33328,318254357,920723,"The Procter & Gamble Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2016",2016-01-26,"Earnings Calls","The Procter & Gamble Company","Executives","Good morning. In the quarter we just completed, we continued to reducing costs and reinvested in growth, reaccelerating our top line and delivering strong earnings and cash flow. Organic sales increased 2%. Core earnings per share increased 9% with consta",4954,"Good morning. In the quarter we just completed, we continued to reducing costs and reinvested in growth, reaccelerating our top line and delivering strong earnings and cash flow. Organic sales increased 2%. Core earnings per share increased 9% with constant-currency core earnings per share up 21%. We delivered meaningful triple-digit basis points improvements in gross and operating margins on both constant-currency and all-in basis. All-in GAAP earnings per share were up 37%, and adjusted free cash flow productivity was 117%. This is a reasonably strong quarter, which reflects our efforts to accelerate organic top line and earnings per share growth fueled by productivity savings. 
We continue to operate, though, in a very challenging and volatile macro environment. Market growth rates in both the volume and value basis have decelerated due mainly to slower growth in developing markets. We entered the year expecting the market to grow close to 3% to 4% globally. We now expect 2% to 3%. 
There are more flashpoints across the globe than in any time in recent memory with significant economic and political instability impacting incomes and consumption in many large and important market. Russia, the Ukraine, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the balance of the Middle East, Turkey, Nigeria, Argentina, Venezuela and Brazil. Currencies are weakening across the board, more than $750 million since the start of the fiscal and over $1 billion after tax versus a year ago. This is on top of a $1.5 billion impact last fiscal year and nearly a $1 billion impact the year before. Across 3 years, FX has been a $3.5 billion impact, over 30% of fiscal year 2013 core net earnings after tax. 
Since the start of December, the current year FX headwinds has increased by $300 million after tax with a 40% devaluation in Argentina and additional 15% devaluation in Russia and nearly 10% devaluation in Mexico. The relative strength of the dollar weighs heavier on us than our euro and yen functional currency competitors. The dollars more than doubled against the ruble over the past 2 years, while our euro functional competitors are facing about 50% to 60% of that impact. We expect these dynamics, slowing market growth, geopolitical hotspots and a stronger dollar will continue to be part of our reality going forward. 
Against this backdrop, we're staying focused on big opportunities in our control, executing what is the largest transformation in our company's history, step change in productivity, transforming our portfolio and strengthening category business models and innovation plan. This transformation strategy, as we'll explain more at CAGNY, is fundamentally growth strategy. 
I'll talk briefly about each of these focus areas, productivity, portfolio and business model and innovation plans, before getting into the details of the quarter. We continue to dramatically improve productivity with significant ahead. Our original 5-year cost of goods savings target was $6 billion. We expect to deliver over $7 billion by the end of this year, 15% above our initial target. We've reduced manufacturing enrollment by 15% over the last 3 years. This includes new staffing necessary to support capacity addition. On a same-site basis, manufacturing enrollment is down nearly 20%. We're targeting 25% to 30% cumulative reduction by the end of fiscal 2017. 
In February 2012, we announced we will reduce nonmanufacturing overhead by 10% over 5 years. As of December 31, we've reduced these roles by 23%, more than double the original target and are well on track to meet our revised target of 25% to 30% by the end of 2017. In fact, we currently expect to reach our 25% to 30% objective this year, one year ahead of schedule. These figures include the divestitures. Including divestitures, we'll reduce manufacturing roles by over 35%. [ph] Continued digitization has been and will be a big enabler of our overhead and manufacturing enrollment efficiencies. We're reducing nonworking and marketing expenditures, cost that do not impact reach, do not impact frequency. Last year, we reduced the number of agencies we work with by nearly 40% and cut agency and production spending by about $370 million. We're aiming for an additional $200 million of agency-related savings this year. These are nonworking savings that enable us to invest in advertising and in trial of consumer-preferred products. We're strengthening our working marketing programs, greater reach, higher frequency, greater effectiveness at less overall marketing costs. 
Last fiscal year in the U.S., we increased total marketing and merchandising support behind Pantene by 440 basis points, increased Tide brand's spending by 220 basis points and invested an additional 150 basis points in Fusion, behind the new FlexBall innovation. This year, we've made similar increases to advertising programs in the U.S. on Shave Care, Fabric Care in Brazil on Baby Care and Fabric Care and China in Fabric Care and Oral Care. In North America alone, we've added nearly 100 basis points to advertising and in-store marketing budgets since we started the fiscal year. 
In addition to cost of goods sold, overhead and nonworking marketing cost reduction, we're driving balance sheet productivity. Inventory days are down. Payable days are up. The moves we made on the balance sheet have enabled us to expand our long track record of very strong adjusted free cash flow productivity, 102% last fiscal year, 101% in Q1, 117% in Q2. We continue to maintain our position as one of the strongest cash generators among competitive peers and comparable megacap companies. We're also among the top companies in returning cash to shareholders. In fiscal 2015, we increased our dividend for the 59th consecutive year and returned $11.9 billion in cash to shareholders, 105% of adjusted net earnings. Over the past 5 years, we've returned $60 billion to shareholders and intend to pay dividends, retire shares and repurchase shares worth up to $70 billion over just the next 4 years. 
In addition to transforming our cost structure, we're transforming our portfolio. As you know, we're centering our portfolio on 10 category base business units where P&G has leading market positions, strong brands and consumer-meaningful product technologies. These 10 categories have historically grown faster with higher margins than the balance of the company. We'll be a company of consumer-preferred brands of products in these 10 product categories. Within these core businesses, we're also focusing our offerings to maximize value creation. We're making smart choices for short-, mid- and long-term value creation, foregoing bad business, even when these choices create short-term top line pressure. 
Our Mexico Family Care business, we made a choice to discontinue low tier and profitable products in favor of very profitable, higher-tier products, albeit with lower sales. The top line drive from this choice will dissipate over the next few quarters, and we'll have a solidly value-accretive business going forward. 
In India, we've made a choice to deprioritize several unprofitable lines of business, which negatively impact short-term top line growth rates but will lead longer-term though much more profitable business that will grow strongly. 
Last fiscal year, organic sales growth slowed by several points, but we made significant progress in improving local profit margin, up 750 basis points. We went from losing money in India to triple digit profits. 
In the quarter we just completed, India organic sales growth was only 2%. The strategic part of the business, the part that we're maintaining, grew a healthy 10%. Sales and the portion of the business we're fixing or exiting, which is about 15% of the portfolio, were down 35%. Profit is running significantly ahead of even last year's improved levels. 
As we come out of this, we'll have strong top line growth that is really worth something. There's really no point to growth if it isn't worth something. 
Places like this impacted our organic top line growth rate by about 1 point in the October-December quarter but will enable us to increase profitability on an ongoing basis. As we've improved productivity and sharpened our portfolio, we've been strengthening business unit strategies, business models and product offerings, but in particular priority against our 4 largest categories, Fabric Care, Baby Care, Grooming and Hair Care and our 2 largest markets, the U.S. and China. We're focusing our laundry business and consumer-preferred brands and product offerings like our premium performance and premium-priced unit-dose detergents and our market-leading and market-expanding scent bead fabric enhancers. We're launching better-performing and more profitable new compact liquid detergents in Russia, Turkey, Mexico, Brazil and China. In Russia and Turkey, where we launched superior compact liquid detergents early last calendar year, P&G's share of liquid detergents is up 7 and 11 points, respectively. 
Fabric Care results in the U.S. demonstrate what is possible when we get the strategy balanced and the innovation program focused on what matters most to consumers, superior value for best-in-class performance at a modest price premium. The U.S. laundry detergent category is continuing to grow, up more than 4 points on a value basis across all outlets over the last 3 and 6-month periods. Within this, our share is growing. P&G's U.S. laundry detergent value share was up 1 point last fiscal year and was up 0.5 point in the December quarter. We will continue to be the innovation leader in Fabric Care. 
In North America, we're introducing a new regiment on Tide and Downy that addresses the odor problems common to athletic wear. 70% of consumers wear athletic gear multiple times each week. The odor defense collection, anchored by innovation on Tide PODS, brings the proprietary formula of enzymes and surfactants that break down and remove stubborn soils and residues for a great clean and fresh scent. Paired with the added cleaning power of Tide odor defense rescue wonder booster and Downy Fresh Protect odor defense beads, this regiment promises to eliminate odors from the fast-growing market of athletes leisure clothes people are wearing far beyond the gym. 
In the U.S. Baby Care, strong innovation, consumer innovation, trial programs and a robust online presence have led to strong growth for Pampers. Pampers value share of U.S. diapers was up more than 1.5 points last fiscal year and was up 1 point in the December quarter. The progress is particularly encouraging considering our latest Pampers innovation with extra absorb channels with on-shipment allocation for much of the quarter as demand succeeded our initial supply. With increased capacity in place and continued strong demand, we expect a good start to the new calendar year. 
We're increasing our investments in Loves diapers in the second half of the fiscal year to address share declines following a significant price reduction taken by our primary competitor. Baby Care results have been softer in other markets. To address this, we've strengthened our value proposition in several markets an accelerated premium innovation on both taped and pull-on diapers to restore our competitiveness on the top end of the market. We're strengthening our selling resources and programs for baby stores, and we're improving our point-of-market entry programs to deliver higher awareness and trial of Pampers among new moms. 
The Gillette FlexBall innovation continues to deliver strong results in Grooming. Globally, an estimated 25 million men have tried FlexBall in 18 months since launch. FlexBall has been an important catalyst of growth on ProGlide cartridges. ProGlide cartridge sales grew 18% last fiscal year compared to 7% decline in the overall male cartridge market. ProGlide cartridge shares is up 2 to 3 points in each of the past 3, 6 and 12-month periods through December. The strong ProGlide results set a very positive stage for our next cartridge innovation, Gillette Fusion ProShield. ProShield with lubrication before and after the blades shields against irritation during every shave. Retailer response to ProShield has been outstanding, delivering large orders and display levels well above target. 
We're supporting a broader range of our product ladder from our best products, Fusion FlexBall, to Mark 3 systems, to premium price and superior performance disposables with strong consumer value communication. We're innovating in-store, helping retailers move out of the lock boxes on shelves and a checkout with the use of hard tags. Hard tags may Gillette much easier to shop. They take up less space on shelves so more product can be on a peg, reducing out of stocks and improving sales closure rates. And they're very effective at reducing shrink. We've already made changes in several hundred stores with excellent results, and we're rolling out hard tags as fast as we're able. 
We're also innovating online with more men purchasing the Blades & Razors through e-commerce, we're establishing Gillette as the online leader. While we're admittedly late to build out our online offering, Gillette Shave Club launched in June and is off to a very good start. We've increased our e-commerce share of Blades & Razors more than 6 points and nearly doubled online consumption since launching Gillette Shave Club. 
We're building partnerships with e-tailers and retailers offering their shopper subscription tie-ins for the Gillette Shave Club, which have enabled Gillette to deliver record online sales in each of the past 3 months. 
In Hair Care, we launched our new conditioner innovation on Pantene in the U.S. earlier this month. Pantene's new breakthrough conditioner technology delivers weightless conditioning, addressing the most significant consumer trial barrier for conditioners. The new conditioner innovation is a consumer blind test winner versus our best competitors in North America, China and Japan. We recently launched 2 new Head & Shoulders variants in the U.S., instant fresh and nourishing care, and upgraded Head & Shoulders consumer message with a new campaign, use daily to say 100% flake-free for life with Head & Shoulders scalp shield technology. 
Driven by these innovations in laundry, Baby Care, Grooming, Hair Care and other categories, and by our investment in category-dedicated sales coverage, we're making sequential progress in our largest and most profitable market, United States. The U.S. business rebounded from a 2-point organic sales decline in Q1 to deliver 3 points of organic growth in Q2. The U.S. improvement was despite product allocation driven by demand in excess of supply in 2 of our largest categories, Baby Care and Feminine Care. And despite a record-like cost cold season impacting the Vick's brand. 
Sales are probably a 1 point or so ahead of consumption for the October-December quarter, but the progress is encouraging nonetheless. 
Our second largest market, both sales and profits, is China. Here, Q2 organic sales were again down high single digits, in line with the Q1 trend. We've gotten behind improving innovation, which has been a contributor to our soft top line trains over the last several quarters. We are aggressively addressing this opportunity. David Taylor, Kathy Fisher, our R&D leader, myself and several other members of the leadership team have spent the last week in China. We're working with the team there and with the global business units to expand their offerings in the premium-priced tiers, which are the fastest-growing, to invest in trial of consumer-preferred products and to transform our go-to-market operations. We've launched premium Baby Care innovations in both the taped and pull-on segments. We're launching compact Ariel liquid detergents that consumers prefer over competitions. And we have new upgrades coming soon on Tide. We've made meaningful product and packaging improvements in Hair Care that launched last quarter on both Head & Shoulders and Pantene. 
In Oral Care, we're launching Oral-B gum care, a new, super premium, repair line of Oral-B toothpastes. The line includes a 2-step paste and other single-step paste variants. Consumer test show the new line winning against top competition in the superpremium tier. We're importing our best Feminine Care products, Infinity, to China with premium power toothbrushes and our best Braun razors. We're increasing our investment in consumer awareness, point-of-market entry sampling and trial across categories. We're strengthening our relationship and presence with key e-commerce and specialty retailers, the fastest-growing channels in the Chinese retail market. We're investing in coverage of these channels and are working to simplify, standardize and strengthen our overall go-to-market approach. 
These moves will take time to fully implement, and the go-to-market changes may actually result in pullback before progress, but we're confident they will result in stronger growth over time. 
Stepping back then and looking at things on a macro level. The environment continues to be very challenging, slower market growth, stiff foreign exchange headwinds and a volatile political and policy environment. Against this backdrop, we continue to improve productivity to focus our portfolio and to invest in superior consumer-preferred brands and products. We're putting particular priority against the 4 largest categories, Baby Care, Fabric Care, Hair Care and Grooming and against our 2 largest markets, the U.S. and China. 
With that context as background, let me get into the details of the quarter we just completed as well as the outlook for the fiscal year. Two housekeeping items before I begin. First, the organic sales and core earnings results we reported today are based on our 10 core product categories. The results of the Beauty and batteries businesses that we're in the process of exiting are reported as discontinued operations. In late October,  we provided a restated 10-K for fiscal 2015 presenting historical results on the same basis. Second, starting last quarter, we're no longer consolidating results of our Venezuelan subsidiaries in our reported numbers. 
Organic sales were up 2% for the quarter versus the prior year, each segment was at or ahead of year ago. As I mentioned previously, sales were slightly ahead of consumption. Organic sales in China and Russia were significantly lower versus last year, negatively impacting total company sales growth by more than 1 point. The category and SKU cleanup efforts drove up to another 1 point of organic sales decline. These impacts are more than offset by progress in the United States and growth in Latin America. All-in sales were down 9%, including 8-point headwind from foreign exchange and 3 points from the Venezuela deconsolidation and minor brand divestitures. Core gross margin and core operating margin each improved on both in all-in and ex currency basis, driven by productivity savings. Core gross margin increased 210 basis points versus the prior year. Excluding foreign exchange, core gross margin was up 290 basis points. 
Our SG&A cost improved 140 basis points, driven primarily by overhead cost reductions. We continue to invest in marketing, reinvesting in nonworking cost savings. Marketing expenditures were, in total, equal to a year ago as a percentage of sales. 
Core operating margin was up 350 basis points versus the prior year, behind 270 basis points of productivity savings. On a constant-currency basis, our core operating margin was up 390 basis points. 
The core effective tax rate was 23.6%, up nearly 1 point versus last year. Core earnings per share were $1.04, up 9% versus the prior year quarter. This includes a 12 percentage point foreign exchange headwind, approximately $300 million after tax. On a constant-currency basis, core earnings per share grew 21%. 
On an all-in GAAP basis, earnings per share were $1.12 for the quarter, up 37% versus the prior year. We generated $3.8 billion in free cash flow, yielding 117% adjusted free cash flow productivity. 
We returned approximately $3.9 billion to shareholders this quarter through a combination of $1.9 billion in dividends and $2 billion in share repurchase. 
Moving to guidance. We're maintaining our outlook for organic sales growth of in line to up low single digits versus fiscal 2015. We've been investing to increase awareness and trial of our brands and products in North America, which is a key catalyst for growth in categories like Fabric Care and Baby Care. We're launching a number of new consumer-preferred premium innovations over the next few months in both developed and developing markets. We're investing in selling capabilities to capitalize on opportunities in the fastest-growing channels and strengthen our presence in our most important markets. We've also invested in targeted price reductions to narrow consumer value gaps in several categories. All of these efforts, along with annualizing some of the most significant impact of last fiscal year, give us confidence we'll continue to grow organic sales in the second half. The level of growth could be impacted by our access to dollars for finished product imported to Venezuela. About 60% of our Venezuelan businesses is imported. The sale of imported products from the importing subsidiary is still reported on our consolidated results. Failure to continue this business would result in up to a 0.5 point impact to top line growth in the fiscal year. 
The headwind from foreign exchange has increased since the start of the year. We now expect FX will have a 7 percentage point impact on all-in sales growth. 
Also, the combined impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation and minor brand divestitures will have a 2 to 3 percentage point drag on all-in sales growth. Taken together, we expect all-in sales to be down high single digits versus restated fiscal 2015 results. 
We're also maintaining constant-currency core earnings per share guidance of mid- to high singles with our internal outlook currently at the low end of this range. 
Given the magnitude of the foreign exchange impact, I thought it might be helpful to again recount how FX impacts our earnings. I'll use the example of the Argentinian peso. We were pleased to see the early decisive approach of Argentina's ants new leadership and believe the actions they are taking will take long-term benefits, in which we are well positioned to participate. But the nearly 30% to 40% devaluation of the peso will significant impact our reported earnings in 3 ways. First, transaction impacts increase the cost of non-peso-denominated inputs. We import, as an example, Gillette Blades & Razors from Mexico into Argentina. Widening of the causeway between the 2 peso currencies increases the Argentina units cost of razors and reduces profit. Similarly, the local cost of plastic bottles, which are denominated in dollars and imported into Argentina for the production of Fabric Care and Hair Care products, have increased significantly. These transaction cost impacts affect all manufacturers, multinational or local, whose materials or finished products are imported from similar sources and are similarly denominated. 
We attempt to recover these cost increases through pricing, when local legal requirements and market realities allow it, though there's a lag between the time when a currency devalues, the costs are incurred and the pricing is taken or executed through our channels of distribution. 
The second impact is balance sheet revaluation. We need to revalue transaction-related payables and receivables balances at the end of each quarter. This includes the revaluation of balances related to transactions between P&G legal entities that operate in different currencies. To continue the prior example, while razors produced in Mexico are being transported and are moving through the customs process into Argentina, our Argentinian business holds a Mexico peso-denominated payable on its books. At the end of every quarter, payables and receivables balances are revalued at current spot rates. Gains or losses from reevaluating transactional balances flow through SG&A and are included in core earnings per share. 
Third, income statements of foreign subsidiaries like Argentina that do not use the U.S. dollars or functional currency are translated back to U.S. dollars at the new exchange rates. Thus, the Argentinian peso transaction, balance sheet revaluation and translation impacts have been and are projected to be significant at about $70 million, $50 million and $20 million after tax, respectively, for a total of $140 million after tax for the year. Across all currencies, foreign exchange hurts total nearly $300 million after tax in the December quarter, $700 million fiscal year-to-date and are forecast to be $1 billion impact after-tax profit hurt over the course of the fiscal year. 
When we talk about foreign exchange impacts, we're sometimes asked why we don't simply hedge these away? A very valid question and something we look at internally and with a different set of outside eyes every year as we compare our financial plan. 
There are 3 reasons we typically don't end up choosing the hedge. Up to 2/3 of our foreign exchange losses and a significant amount of our forward exposure is in currencies that are either non-deliverable or are very difficult edge. The Argentinian peso, the Venezuelan bolivar and the Ukrainian hryvnia are 3 examples. Second, hedging is neither free nor cheap. Currency volatility in itself increases sometimes in significant ways this cost. So when you want it most, it becomes difficult to afford. 
The last shortfall of hedging as the answer is that it solves nothing longer term. It also does nothing to help restore the margin structure of the business. A hedge simply defers volatility. When the instrument expires, you have the same hit with the same margin impact you would've had as you're not hedged. 
While it takes time and there's a lag between the hurt and help, we typically look to pricing, sizing, mix enhancement, sourcing choices and cost reduction to manage FX impacts. We have historically recovered about 2/3 of FX impacts with pricing over time. We think, this time, given differential impacts for euro and yen functional currency competitors, it will be somewhat less than that. 
I've said in our last call that we would invest where it was appropriate to do so. I said we would not cut smart investment to offset foreign exchange impacts, which meant we could very well end up below the earnings per share guidance range. FX is a near-term reality that has gotten significantly worse. We're doing our best to offset FX impacts with productivity savings and pricing while continuing to make investments in brand equities, innovation, trial and value equations. We think we've struck a reasonable balance of investment to improve the long-term health of the business, even though it requires we moderate our short-term earnings outlook, including foreign exchange. We're reducing our core earnings per share guidance to a range of down 3% to 8% versus last year's core earnings per share of $3.76. This earnings per share guidance includes headwinds of 8 to 9 percentage points from the combined impacts of duty, deal and transition expenses. These are for the businesses moving out to merge with Coty, Venezuela deconsolidation, lower operating income and a higher nonoperating income -- excuse me, and higher operating tax rate. Adjusting for these items, our guidance translates to modest core earnings per share growth with meaningful growth excluding foreign exchange. 
Our key assumptions on items below the core operating profit line have not changed. The core effective tax rate should be about 24% for fiscal 2016, about 3 points higher than last year, roughly a 4 percentage point headwind on core earnings per share growth. The core tax rate in the back half of the fiscal year -- last fiscal year was below 19%. We expect the tax rate of closer to 24% in the back half of this fiscal. 
We continue to expect nonoperating income will be a 2 to 3 percentage point drag on core earnings per share growth, mainly impacting the fourth quarter. We had nearly $440 million of nonoperating income gains last year with over $400 million coming in the second half, including $355 million in the fourth quarter. We expect modest nonoperating income gains in the back half of this fiscal. With most of these impacts hitting in the back half, the core earnings per share growth headwind across Q3 and Q4 is roughly 13 percentage points or about $0.24 per share. FX adds another 7% or about $0.12 per share headwind in the back half. So while the midpoint of our new guidance range points to roughly a 15% core earnings per share reduction in the back half versus last year, we're roughly flat, excluding the tax of nonoperating headwinds and up mid singles, if we just for currency. 
Given very strong progress to date, as I've said before, 101% in Q1 and 117% in Q2, we're increasing our free cash flow productivity target from 90% to 100% of earnings. We continue to expect to retire shares at a value of approximately $8 billion to $9 billion through a combination of direct share repurchases and shares that will be exchanged during the third quarter in the Duracell transaction. In addition to these shares we expect to retire, we expect dividend payments of more than $7 billion, in total, $15 billion to $16 billion in dividend payments, share exchange and share repurchase. 
We now expect all-in GAAP earnings per share to be up approximately 42% at the center of our guidance range. Going forward, we are committed to balanced top and bottom line growth and strong free cash flow productivity to drive total shareholder return. 
We will continue to address value gaps if and when they merge. We will defend our positions, and we will invest behind brand trial and awareness programs, and of course, consumer-preferred innovation. We'll do everything we can from a productivity standpoint. We'll smartly invest to accelerate top line growth and will continue to delivering on our commitment of strong cash return to shareholders. 
David and I both look forward to talking with you at CAGNY about the plan and priorities to deliver balanced growth and value creation beyond this fiscal year. 
I'll provide an update on our productivity progress and the significant opportunity that remains in front of us, which can help fuel investment and growth. David will discuss our strategic choices, how we plan to sustainably improve top line growth and the organization and culture changes we'll make to accelerate our progress. 
That concludes our prepared remarks for this morning. As a reminder, business segment information is provided in our press release and will be available through slides that we posted on our website, www.pg.com, following the call. 
With that, I'd be happy to take your questions."

So there's really no change in the overall outlook, which as you rightly say, was for acceleration in Q2 and then further improvement in the back half of the year. As I've mentioned, the extent of that improvement in the back half of the year is going to be potentially impacted by what happens with access to dollars for imports into Venezuela, and it will obviously be impacted by other things as well. But even with that, we remain confident that we can continue to grow in the second half. In terms of the business in the U.S. and the comparison to scanner data, as you know, we pretty dramatically accelerated our growth in the U.S. from minus 2% in the quarter before to plus 3% this quarter. I mentioned that there was about 1 point of sales that's ahead of consumption. That's some things like the ProShield razor that we shipped into the market, but still, even adjusting for that acceleration as we expected. It's getting increasingly difficult to look only at scanner data as a measure of market sales or business itself. That's particularly true in markets like China, where the -- a huge portion of the growth of the market is coming in the e-commerce channel, which doesn't cross scanner. And you have some that same dynamic in the U.S. So for example, the Shave Club sales, depending on how they're executed, may or may not cross scanner. And I think that's part of the dichotomy. But generally, if we look across several quarters to dampen out some of the short-term volatility and the noise, we continue to be pleased and encouraged by increasing strength of the North American business, and we expect it to grow going forward."

Number one, in emerging markets, where we continue to see currencies devalue, like Russia, like Brazil, how far are you into your price increases? Are you going to continue to take price increases to keep in line with inflation? Or sort of what's the outlook there? And then second part of that, with regard to pricing in North America, it's surprising to me that there is still so much positive pricing kind of across of the whole sector in light of the lower commodity prices. And I don't know whether that's a reflection of the stronger U.S. consumer or more innovation. But if you can comment kind of broadly on your outlook about pricing in North America and whether you think the price increases you've taken are sustainable."

It depends on the individual category, but the market growth rates range roughly from, call it, 5% to 8%. So mid to high singles across the categories. And as I've mentioned, we see significant opportunity remaining in China with those very fractured growth rates, albeit somewhat slower than they were 2 and 3 years ago, with the conversion from a manufacturing to a consumption-based economy, with the dramatic potential that exists as a result of larger family sizes, from the possibility of 2 children versus just 1 and with the premiumization of the market, which as I indicated, admittedly we have not been as agile as we need to be in exploiting. But really, as I've mentioned, I was there last week, I was there a week before the Christmas holidays, and I walk away with a tremendous sense of encouragement while acknowledging that we have work to do. In terms of pricing, the pricing dynamic should continue to be a favorable contributor to top line growth as we move forward, even if all we do is take forward the price increases that have already been executed. They're not fully annualized yet. And so that should continue to be a positive on the top line. The pricing calculus or algebra is fairly complicated. You really have to look at the combination of currencies, commodities and competition to determine a course of action going forward in an individual product category or market. And some of those 3 things, it's very different, depending on what markets you're in, as influenced by both currencies and by competition. In general, the companies in our industry continue to price at some level for foreign exchange. I mentioned in our prepared remarks that we expect our ability to price to be somewhat lower than it has been historically, and we'll make up for that over time with productivity and other savings. And in the U.S., first of all, the commodity impacts aren't as significant as you would assume just looking at the headlines on oil prices, for example. If you look at everything from diesel to resin to other imports that are derived from the petrol complex, while pricing benefit or cost reduction has occurred, it is not anywhere near the level yet of the crude price reductions. So I think that's a potential source of disconnect as people think about this. Generally, we're taking pricing behind very strong product innovation. We're looking to improve the strength of our overall value equations, the combination of pricing, product performance, consumer usage experience, aesthetic. And done in that way, I think that continues to be a contributor to growth and value creation."

In terms of currency, there is some letup, but not a lot, in the back half.

For example, if we have employees in our global business service organization that are working to stand up to the new company in terms of building the systems that are acquired, et cetera, those are employees that are going to remain within Procter & Gamble.

But particularly in a time when we need to restore structural economics in response to currency moves, we can get ourselves into big trouble if that becomes the driving metric. So as I've said, we're prepared to lose some share in 2 situations. One, is where we're restoring our structural economic attractiveness. I mean hiving a higher market share with a higher gross margin isn't helpful to anyone. And also where we're doing some of portfolio cleanup that I mentioned, the core categories, where will be in a much better position longer term in both the growth and value creation standpoint, if we can focus on the parts of our portfolio that are really working for us.

And as you rightly indicated, that's had about 1 point worth of impact. And the other is the market reaction from a consumption standpoint, and in some cases, the share price evolution as we take pricing to offset foreign exchange impacts in large devaluation markets. If you take Russia or the Ukraine as an example, where devaluation has been 70%, 80%, 110%, we have negative gross margins. We need to price over time as well as do everything we can from a savings standpoint to restore margins at least a positive level so the growth is meaningful. And during that process, both at a market level, market spend contract and in response to higher price points and sometimes from a share standpoint, and Russia and the Ukraine are good examples, where we're competing against strong European competitors, and in the case of Russia, Japanese competitors as well, and sometimes, there's a modest share impact that comes with the pricing that we deem necessary to take. We are not prepared to lose share indefinitely. Our history in this area is that it takes kind of 6 to 9 months to work your way through this. Some of the pricing that we've taken have been recent because a lot of the devaluation has been recent. So I don't -- I haven't actually looked at it quarter by quarter to see what's the quarter where volume will we inflect positive. We'll have to work our way through this pricing. And I don't believe in this -- go back to the comments on market share, we fully intend to grow at market growth rates or slightly ahead of market growth rates over longer periods of time. That requires volume growth. I mentioned, Mark, it's growing 3%-ish. We're not going to able to take 3% pricing indefinitely nor is that our intent in any way. So we will -- also we're not -- in markets where competitors don't respond from a pricing standpoint, remember, we -- because we're the market leaders, typically have to lead or nothing happen. So we are exposed for that period of time, and competitors can take 6 to 9 months sometimes before they respond, or they cannot respond at all. In the cases where they don't respond to the levels that are necessary to maintain our value-creation comparisons, or when they don't price at all, we will reduce price. We're not going to be uncompetitive. We're not going to lose share on a sustained basis."

We're not moving people as rapidly across categories. The GBUs have all decision rights on the amount of resources that are supporting their businesses from a go-to-market operations standpoint, which has led to some choices, quite frankly, to increase coverage in some channels.

That's in Mexico. Excluding that, Mexico organic sales were up 8% in the quarter, and volume was up as well. So again, there's a bit of noise as we work through the combination of the portfolio and foreign exchange, but we expect volume will grow as we go forward, and share will also be something that becomes increasingly attainable."

So again, Brazil was up 11% in the quarter. In terms of commodities, look at it as a single variant, so just the cost -- the reduction of input cost. That impact is about $500 million on the fiscal year. Some of that, we anticipate going into the year, of course, but that's the amount. I would argue that, in total, in other words, inclusive of consumption impacts and oil-producing countries, where there's been massive disruption and instability, if you think about markets like Saudi Arabia, markets like, certainly, Venezuela, I would say that the net impact in our P&L is likely neutral to negative, but the pure cost impact is $500 million."

You have a nice couple of quarters [indiscernible] really bode well. But can you elaborate a little bit more and perhaps even qualify the inventory management change by retailers and the trade term change that you mentioned in press release, which as mentioned is a negative, particularly the contracts of what you said on your prepared remarks, which is that sales being slightly ahead of consumption. So give us a sense of the ongoing effects of those, if you could, number one. Number two is, on your FX kind of multiplier between the top line and the bottom line impact, why did it change so dramatically versus your '16 [ph] guidance? So what I mean is that in July, your FX impact was going to be negative 4% to 5% top line, negative 3% to 4% bottom line, so kind of less than 1 ratio. And now it's negative 7 top line and negative 10 to bottom line. So very quickly shifting to a greater than 1 ratio, despite your efforts to localize more, et cetera. So it's that all Argentina devaluation is the kind of some forecasting math that I'm not getting? Or can you give us a sense how structured or levered kind of differently than we would expect it because it's a big switch in a short period of time? And then third question, is more in terms of running these conference calls. Should we infer the decision was made -- I know you guys were thinking about this, that you're CEO will not be on these calls and only be at things like CAGNY and the annual calls like Agee was doing, or you still in the deciding mode?"

And top and bottom line relationship between currency movements is very different, depending on the market. It depends on how the market sourced. It depends on the balance sheet of the market. I've mentioned balance sheet revaluation. So for example, in Argentina, we talked about the balance sheet revaluation that occurred there. So it's really a function of what actually is happening in the marketplace, country by country, how we source the markets and what the balance sheet exposures in different markets. So I'd guess I'm saying, we don't really have a good ability to forecast exactly what the currency impacts are going to be on either the top or bottom line. And frankly, we spend very little time thinking about the relationship between the two. In terms of the comments on trade inventory reduction, that is largely a China dynamic. I've mentioned in prior calls that our inventory levels were too high, particularly in the wholesale channel in China. And as a result, our pricing was too low, which was driving a bit of distortion and difficulty for distributors. And so we have made some choices to address that, and that has a short-term volume impact. That's really what that comment was designed to indicate. Relative to senior executive engagement with the investment community, we intend to be fully engaged with investment community through a combination of quarterly conference calls, investment conferences, meetings here in Cincinnati. David will be on the road frequently as well interacting with investment community. And so again, our strategy is one a very high engagement."

In the quarter we just completed, we continued reducing cost and reinvested in growth, reaccelerating our top line and delivering strong earnings and cash flow. Organic sales increased 2%.

In the quarter we just completed, we continued reducing cost and reinvested in growth, reaccelerating our top line and delivering strong earnings and cash flow. Organic sales increased 2%. Core earnings per share increased 9% with constant-currency core earnings per share up 21%. We delivered meaningful triple-digit basis point improvements in gross and operating margins on both a constant-currency and all-in basis. All-in GAAP earnings per share were up 37%, and adjusted free cash flow productivity was 117%. This is a reasonably strong quarter, which reflects our efforts to accelerate organic top line and earnings per share growth fueled by productivity savings. 
We continue to operate, though, in a very challenging and volatile macro environment. Market growth rates in both the volume and value basis have decelerated, due mainly to slower growth in developing markets. We entered the year expecting the market to grow close to 3% to 4% globally. We now expect 2% to 3%. 
There are more flashpoints across the globe than in any time in recent memory with significant economic and political instability impacting incomes and consumption in many large and important markets. Russia, the Ukraine, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the balance of the Middle East, Turkey, Nigeria, Argentina, Venezuela and Brazil. Currencies are weakening across the board, more than $750 million since the start of the fiscal and over $1 billion after-tax versus a year ago. This is on top of a $1.5 billion impact last fiscal year and nearly a $1 billion impact the year before. Across 3 years, FX has been a $3.5 billion impact, over 30% of fiscal year 2013 core net earnings after-tax. 
Since the start of December, the current year FX headwind has increased by $300 million after-tax, with a 40% devaluation in Argentina, an additional 15% devaluation in Russia and nearly a 10% devaluation in Mexico. The relative strength of the dollar weighs heavier on us than our euro and yen functional currency competitors. The dollars has more than doubled against the ruble over the past 2 years, while our euro functional competitors are facing about 50% to 60% of that impact. We expect these dynamics, slowing market growth, geopolitical hotspots and a stronger dollar will continue to be part of our reality going forward. 
Against this backdrop, we're staying focused on big opportunities in our control, executing what is the largest transformation in our company's history. Step change in productivity, transforming our portfolio and strengthening category business models and innovation plans. This transformation strategy, as we'll explain more at CAGNY, is fundamentally a growth strategy. 
I'll talk briefly about each of these focus areas, productivity, portfolio, and business model and innovation plans, before getting into the details of the quarter. We continued to dramatically improve productivity with significant [ph] ahead. Our original 5-year cost of goods savings target was $6 billion. We expect to deliver over $7 billion by the end of this year, 15% above our initial target. We've reduced manufacturing enrollment by 15% over the last 3 years. This includes new staffing necessary to support capacity addition. On a same-site basis, manufacturing enrollment is down nearly 20%. We're targeting 25% to 30% cumulative reduction by the end of fiscal 2017. 
In February 2012, we announced we will reduce nonmanufacturing overhead by 10% over 5 years. As of December 31, we've reduced these roles by 23%, more than double the original target, and are well on track to meet a revised target of 25% to 30% by the end of fiscal 2017. In fact, we currently expect to reach our 25% to 30% objective this year, one year ahead of schedule. These figures exclude divestitures. Including divestitures will reduce nonmanufacturing roles by over 35%. Continued digitization has been, and will be, a big enabler of our overhead and manufacturing enrollment efficiencies. We're reducing nonworking marketing expenditures, cost that do not impact reach, do not impact frequency. Last year, we reduced the number of agencies we work with by nearly 40% and cut agency and production spending by about $370 million. We're aiming for an additional $200 million of agency-related savings this year. These are nonworking savings that enable us to invest in advertising and in trial of consumer-preferred products. We're strengthening our working marketing programs, greater reach, higher frequency, greater effectiveness at less overall marketing cost. 
Last fiscal year in the U.S., we increased total marketing and merchandising support behind Pantene by 440 basis points, increased Tide brand's spending by 220 basis points and invested an additional 150 basis points in Fusion, behind the new FlexBall innovation. This year, we've made similar increases to advertising programs in the U.S. on Shave Care, Fabric Care, in Brazil on Baby Care and Fabric Care, in China in Fabric Care and Oral Care. In North America alone, we've added nearly 100 basis points to advertising and in-store merchanting budgets since we started the fiscal year. 
In addition to cost of goods sold, overhead and nonworking marketing cost reduction, we're driving balance sheet productivity. Inventory days are down. Payable days are up. The moves we made on the balance sheet have enabled us to expand our long track record of very strong adjusted free cash flow productivity, 102% last fiscal year, 101% in Q1, 117% in Q2. We continue to maintain our position as one of the strongest cash generators among competitive peers and comparable mega cap companies. We're also among the top companies in returning cash to shareholders. In fiscal 2015, we increased our dividend for the 59th consecutive year and returned $11.9 billion in cash to shareholders, a 105% of adjusted net earnings. Over the past 5 years, we've returned $60 billion to shareholders and intend to pay dividends, retire shares and repurchase shares worth up to $70 billion over just the next 4 years. 
In addition to transforming our cost structure, we're transforming our portfolio. As you know, we're centering our portfolio on 10 category base business units where P&G has leading market positions, strong brands and consumer-meaningful product technologies. These 10 categories have historically grown faster with higher margins than the balance of the company. We'll be a company of consumer-preferred brands and products in these 10 product categories. Within these core businesses, we're also focusing our offerings to maximize value creation. We're making smart choices for short-, mid- and long-term value creation, foregoing bad business, even when these choices create short-term top line pressure. 
In our Mexico Family Care business, we made a choice to discontinue low tier unprofitable products in favor of very profitable, higher-tier products, albeit with lower sales. The top line drive from this choice will dissipate over the next few quarters, and we'll have a solidly value-accretive business going forward. 
In India, we've made a choice to deprioritize several unprofitable lines of business, which negatively impact short-term top line growth rates but will lead longer-term though much more profitable business that will grow strongly. 
Last fiscal year, organic sales growth slowed by several points, but we made significant progress in improving local profit margin, up 750 basis points. We went from losing money in India to triple digit profits. 
In the quarter we just completed, India organic sales growth was only 2%. The strategic part of the business, the part that we're maintaining, grew a healthy 10%. Sales and the portion of the business we're fixing or exiting, which is about 15% of the portfolio, were down 35%. Profit is running significantly ahead of even last year's improved levels. 
As we come out of this, we'll have strong top line growth that is really worth something. There's really no point to growth if it isn't worth something. 
Places like this impacted our organic top line growth rate by about 1 point in the October-December quarter, but will enable us to increase profitability on an ongoing basis. As we've improved productivity and sharpened our portfolio, we've been strengthening business unit strategies, business models and product offerings, putting particular priority against our 4 largest categories, Fabric Care, Baby Care, Grooming and Hair Care and our 2 largest markets, the U.S. and China. We're focusing our laundry business on consumer-preferred brands and product offerings like our premium performance and premium-priced unit dose detergents, and our market-leading and market-expanding scent bead fabric enhancers. We're launching better-performing and more profitable new compact liquid detergents in Russia, Turkey, Mexico, Brazil and China. In Russia and Turkey, where we launched superior compact liquid detergents early last calendar year, P&G's share of liquid detergents is up 7 and 11 points, respectively. 
Fabric Care results in the U.S. demonstrate what is possible when we get the strategy balanced and the innovation program focused on what matters most to consumers, superior value for best-in-class performance at a modest price premium. The U.S. laundry detergent category is continuing to grow, up more than 4 points on a value basis across all outlets over the last 3 and 6-month periods. Within this, our share is growing. P&G's U.S. laundry detergent value share was up 1 point last fiscal year and was up 0.5 point in the December quarter. We will continue to be the innovation leader in Fabric Care. 
In North America, we're introducing a new regiment on Tide and Downy that addresses the odor problems common to athletic wear. 70% of consumers wear athletic gear multiple times each week. The odor defense collection, anchored by innovation on Tide PODS, brings the proprietary formula of enzymes and surfactants that break down and remove stubborn soils and residues for a great, clean and fresh scent. Paired with the added cleaning power of Tide odor defense rescue wonder [ph] booster and Downy Fresh Protect odor defense beads, this regiment promises to eliminate odors from the fast-growing market of athleisure clothes people are wearing far beyond the gym. 
In the U.S. Baby Care, strong innovation, consumer communication, trial programs and a robust online presence have led to strong growth for Pampers. Pampers value share of U.S. diapers was up more than 1.5 points last fiscal year and was up 1 point in the December quarter. The progress is particularly encouraging considering our latest Pampers innovation with extra absorb channels with on-shipment allocation for much of the quarter as demand succeeded our initial supply. With increased capacity in place and continued strong demand, we expect a good start to the new calendar year. 
We're increasing our investments in Luvs diapers in the second half of the fiscal year to address share declines following a significant price reduction taken by our primary competitor. Baby Care results have been softer in other markets. To address this, first we've strengthened our value proposition in several markets and accelerated premium innovation on both taped and pull-on diapers to restore our competitiveness at the top end of the market. We're strengthening our selling resources and programs for baby stores, and we're improving our point-of-market entry programs to deliver higher awareness and trial of Pampers among new moms. 
The Gillette FlexBall innovation continues to deliver strong results in Grooming. Globally, an estimated 25 million men have tried FlexBall in the 18 months since launch. FlexBall has been an important catalyst of growth on ProGlide cartridges. ProGlide cartridge sales grew 18% last fiscal year compared to a 7% decline in the overall male cartridge market. ProGlide cartridge shares is up 2 to 3 points in each of the past 3-, 6- and 12-month periods through December. The strong ProGlide results set a very positive stage for our next cartridge innovation, Gillette Fusion ProShield. ProShield with lubrication before and after the blades shields against irritation during every shave. Retailer response to ProShield has been outstanding, delivering large orders and display levels well above targets. 
We're supporting a broader range of our product ladder from our best products, Fusion FlexBall, to Mark 3 systems, to premium price and superior performance disposables with strong consumer value communication. We're innovating in-store, helping retailers move out of the lock boxes on shelves and at checkout with the use of hard tags. Hard tags make Gillette much easier to shop, they take up less space on shelves so more product can be on a peg, reducing out-of-stocks and improving sales closure rates. And they're very effective at reducing shrink. We've already made the change in several hundred stores with excellent results, and are rolling out hard tags as fast as we're able. 
We're also innovating online, with more men purchasing their Blades & Razors through e-commerce, we're establishing Gillette as the online leader. While we're admittedly late to build out our online offering, Gillette Shave Club launched in June and is off to a very good start. We've increased our e-commerce share of Blades & Razors more than 6 points and nearly doubled online consumption since launching Gillette Shave Club. 
We're building partnerships with e-tailers and retailers for offering their shopper subscription tie-ins for the Gillette Shave Club, which have enabled Gillette to deliver record online sales in each of the past 3 months. 
In Hair Care, we launched our new conditioner innovation on Pantene in the U.S. earlier this month. Pantene's new breakthrough conditioner technology delivers weightless conditioning, addressing the most significant consumer trial barrier for conditioners. The new conditioner innovation is a consumer blind test winner versus our best competitors in North America, China and Japan. We recently launched 2 new Head & Shoulders variants in the U.S., Instant Fresh and Nourishing Care, and are upgrading Head & Shoulders consumer message with a new campaign, ""Use daily to stay 100% flake-free for life with Head & Shoulders scalp shield technology.""
Driven by these interventions in Laundry, Baby Care, Grooming, Hair Care and other categories, and by our investment in category-dedicated sales coverage, we're making sequential progress in our largest and most profitable market, The United States. The U.S. business rebounded from a 2-point organic sales decline in Q1 to deliver 3 points of organic growth in Q2. The U.S. improvement was despite product allocation driven by demand in excess of supply in 2 of our largest categories, Baby Care and Feminine Care. And despite a record-like cost cold season impacting the Vicks brand. 
Sales are probably a 1 point or so ahead of consumption for the October-December quarter, but the progress is encouraging nonetheless. 
Our second largest market, both sales and profits, is China. Here, Q2 organic sales were again down high single digits, in line with the Q1 trend. We've gotten behind improving innovation, which has been a contributor to our soft top line trends over the last several quarters. We are aggressively addressing this opportunity. David Taylor, Kathy Fisher, our R&D leader, myself and several other members of our leadership team have spent the last week in China. We're working with the team there and with the global business units to expand their offerings in the premium-priced tiers, which are the fastest-growing, to invest in trial of consumer-preferred products and to transform our go-to-market operations. We've launched premium Baby Care innovations in both the taped and pull-on segments. We're launching compact Ariel liquid detergents that consumers prefer over competition. And we have new upgrades coming soon on Tide. We've made meaningful product and packaging improvements in Hair Care that launched last quarter on both Head & Shoulders and Pantene. 
In Oral Care, we're launching Oral-B gum care, a new, super premium, repair line of Oral-B toothpastes. The line includes a 2-step paste and other single-step paste variants. Consumer tests show the new line winning against top competition in the superpremium tier. We're importing our best Feminine Care product, Infinity, to China with premium power toothbrushes and our best Braun razors. We're increasing our investment in consumer awareness, point-of-market entry sampling and trial across categories. We're strengthening our relationship in presence with key e-commerce and specialty retailers, the fastest-growing channels in the Chinese retail market. We're investing in coverage of these channels and are working to simplify, standardize and strengthen our overall go-to-market approach. 
These moves will take time to fully implement, and the go-to-market changes may actually result in pullback before progress, but we're confident they will result in stronger growth over time. 
Stepping back then and looking at things on a macro level, the environment continues to be very challenging. Slower market growth, stiff foreign exchange headwinds and a volatile political and policy environment. Against this backdrop, we continue to improve productivity, to focus our portfolio and to invest in superior consumer-preferred brands and products. We're putting particular priority against the 4 largest categories, Baby Care, Fabric Care, Hair Care and Grooming, and against our 2 largest markets, the U.S. and China. 
With that as -- with that context as background, let me get into the details of the quarter we've just completed, as well as the outlook for the fiscal year. Two housekeeping items before I begin. First, the organic sales and core earnings results we're reporting today are based on our 10 core product categories. The results of the Beauty and batteries businesses that we're in the process of exiting are reported as discontinued operations. In late October,  we provided a restated 10-K for fiscal 2015 presenting historical results on this same basis. Second, starting last quarter, we're no longer consolidating the results of our Venezuelan subsidiaries in our reported numbers. 
Organic sales were up 2% for the quarter versus the prior year, each segment was at or ahead of year ago. As I mentioned previously, sales were slightly ahead of consumption. Organic sales in China and Russia were significantly lower versus last year, negatively impacting total company sales growth by more than 1 point. The category and SKU cleanup efforts drove up to another 1 point of organic sales decline. These impacts were more than offset by progress in the United States and growth in Latin America. All-in sales were down 9%, including 8-point headwind from foreign exchange and 3 points from the Venezuela deconsolidation and minor brand divestitures. Core gross margin and core operating margin each improved on both in all-in and ex-currency basis, driven by productivity savings. Core gross margin increased 210 basis points versus the prior year. Excluding foreign exchange, core gross margin was up 290 basis points. 
Our SG&A cost improved 140 basis points, driven primarily by overhead cost reductions. We continue to invest in marketing, reinvesting in nonworking cost savings. Marketing expenditures were, in total, equal to a year ago as a percentage of sales. 
Core operating margin was up 350 basis points versus the prior year, behind 270 basis points of productivity savings. On a constant-currency basis, our core operating margin was up 390 basis points. 
The core effective tax rate was 23.6%, up nearly 1 point versus last year. Core earnings per share were $1.04, up 9% versus the prior year quarter. This includes a 12 percentage point foreign exchange headwind, approximately $300 million after tax. On a constant-currency basis, core earnings per share grew 21%. 
On an all-in GAAP basis, earnings per share were $1.12 for the quarter, up 37% versus the prior year. We generated $3.8 billion in free cash flow, yielding 117% adjusted free cash flow productivity. 
We returned approximately $3.9 billion to shareholders this quarter through a combination of $1.9 billion in dividends and $2 billion in share repurchase. 
Moving to guidance. We're maintaining our outlook for organic sales growth of in line to up low single digits versus fiscal 2015. We've been investing to increase awareness and trial of our brands and products in North America, which is a key catalyst for growth in categories like Fabric Care and Baby Care. We're launching a number of new consumer-preferred premium innovations over the next few months in both developed and developing markets. We're investing in selling capabilities to capitalize on opportunities in the fastest-growing channels and strengthen our presence in our most important markets. We've also invested in targeted price reductions to narrow consumer value gaps in several categories. All of these efforts, along with annualizing some of the most significant impacts from last fiscal year, give us confidence we'll continue to grow organic sales in the second half. The level of growth could be impacted by our access to dollars for finished product imported into Venezuela. About 60% of our Venezuelan businesses is imported. The sale of imported products from the importing subsidiary is still reported on our consolidated results. Failure to continue this business would result in up to a 0.5 point impact to top line growth in the fiscal year. 
The headwind from foreign exchange has increased since the start of the year. We now expect FX will have a 7 percentage point impact on all-in sales growth. 
Also, the combined impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation and minor brand divestitures will have a 2 to 3 percentage point drag on all-in sales growth. Taken together, we expect all-in sales to be down high single digits versus restated fiscal 2015 results. 
We're also maintaining constant-currency core earnings per share guidance of mid- to high singles, with our internal outlook currently at the low end of this range. 
Given the magnitude of the foreign exchange impact, I thought it might be helpful to again recount how FX impacts our earnings. I'll use the example of the Argentinian peso. We were most pleased to see the early decisive approach of Argentina's new leadership and believe the actions they're taking will take long-term benefits, in which we are well-positioned to participate. But the nearly 30% to 40% devaluation of the peso will significantly impact our reported earnings in 3 ways. First, transaction impacts increase the cost of non-peso-denominated inputs. We import, as an example, Gillette Blades & Razors from Mexico into Argentina. Widening of the cross weight between the 2 peso currencies increases the Argentina unit's cost of razors and reduces profit. Similarly, the local cost of plastic bottles, which are denominated in dollars and imported into Argentina for the production of Fabric Care and Hair Care products, have increased significantly. These transaction cost impacts affect all manufacturers, multinational or local, whose materials or finished products are imported from similar sources and are similarly denominated. 
We attempt to recover these cost increases through pricing, when local legal requirements and market realities allow it, though there's a lag between the time when a currency devalues, the costs are incurred and the pricing is taken andexecuted through our channels of distribution. 
The second impact is balance sheet revaluation. We need to revalue transaction-related payables and receivables balances at the end of each quarter. This includes the revaluation of balances related to transactions between P&G legal entities that operate in different currencies. To continue the prior example, while razors produced in Mexico are being transported and are moving through the customs process into Argentina, our Argentinian business holds a Mexico peso-denominated payable on its books. At the end of every quarter, payables and receivables balances are revalued at current spot rates. Gains or losses from revalue and transactional balances flow through SG&A and are included in core earnings per share. 
Third, income statements of foreign subsidiaries like Argentina that do not use the U.S. dollars or functional currency are translated back to U.S. dollars at the new exchange rates. Thus, the Argentinian peso transaction, balance sheet revaluation and translation impacts have been and are projected to be significant at about $70 million, $50 million and $20 million after tax, respectively, for a total of $140 million after tax for the year. Across all currencies, foreign exchange hurts total nearly $300 million after tax in the December quarter, $700 million fiscal year-to-date and are forecast to be $1 billion impact after-tax profit hurt over the course of the fiscal year. 
When we talk about foreign exchange impacts, we're sometimes asked why we don't simply hedge these away? A very valid question and something we look at internally and with a different set of outside eyes every year as we compare our financial plan. 
There are 3 reasons we typically don't end up choosing the hedge. Up to 2/3 of our foreign exchange losses, and a significant amount of our forward exposure is in currencies that are either non-deliverable or are very difficult to hedge. The Argentinian peso, the Venezuelan bolivar and the Ukrainian hryvnia are 3 examples. Second, hedging is neither free nor cheap. Currency volatility in itself increases sometimes in significant ways this cost. So when you want it most, it becomes difficult to afford. 
The last shortfall of hedging as the answer is that it solves nothing longer term. It also does nothing to help restore the margin structure of the business. A hedge simply defers volatility. When the instrument expires, you have the same hit, with the same margin impact you would've had as you're not hedged. 
While it takes time and there's a lag between the hurt and help, we typically look to pricing, sizing, mix enhancement, sourcing choices and cost reduction to manage FX impacts. We have historically recovered about 2/3 of FX impacts with pricing over time. We think, this time, given differential impacts for euro and yen functional currency competitors, it will be somewhat less than that. 
I've said in our last call that we would invest where it was appropriate to do so. I said we would not cut smart investment to offset foreign exchange impacts, which meant we could very well end up below the earnings per share guidance range. FX is a near-term reality that has gotten significantly worse. We're doing our best to offset FX impacts with productivity savings and pricing while continuing to make investments in brand equities, innovation, trial and value equations. We think we've struck a reasonable balance of investment to improve the long-term health of the business, even though it requires we moderate our short-term earnings outlook, including foreign exchange. We're reducing our core earnings per share guidance to a range of down 3% to 8% versus last year's core earnings per share of $3.76. This earnings per share guidance includes headwinds of 8 to 9 percentage points from the combined impacts of beauty, deal and transition expenses. These are for the businesses moving out to merge with Coty, Venezuela deconsolidation, lower operating income and a higher -- nonoperating income excuse me, and a higher tax rate. Adjusting for these items, our guidance translates to modest core earnings per share growth with meaningful growth excluding foreign exchange. 
Our key assumptions on items below the core operating profit line have not changed. The core effective tax rate should be about 24% for fiscal 2016, about 3 points higher than last year, roughly a 4 percentage point headwind on core earnings per share growth. The core tax rate in the back half of the fiscal year -- of last fiscal year was below 19%. We expect the tax rate of closer to 24% in the back half of this fiscal. 
We continue to expect nonoperating income will be a 2 to 3 percentage point drag on core earnings per share growth, mainly impacting the fourth quarter. We had nearly $440 million of nonoperating income gains last year with over $400 million coming in the second half, including $355 million in the fourth quarter. We expect modest nonoperating income gains in the back half of this fiscal. With most of these impacts hitting in the back half, the core earnings per share growth headwind across Q3 and Q4 is roughly 13 percentage points or about $0.24 per share. FX adds another 7% or about $0.12 per share headwind in the back half. So while the midpoint of our new guidance range points to roughly a 15% core earnings per share reduction in the back half versus last year, we're roughly flat, excluding the tax of nonoperating headwinds and up mid-singles, if we adjust for currency. 
Given very strong progress to date, as I've said before, 101% in Q1 and 117% in Q2, we're increasing our free cash flow productivity target from 90% to 100% of earnings. We continue to expect to retire shares at a value of approximately $8 billion to $9 billion through a combination of direct share repurchases and shares that will be exchanged during the third quarter in the Duracell transaction. In addition to these shares we expect to retire, we expect dividend payments of more than $7 billion, in total, $15 billion to $16 billion in dividend payments, share exchange and share repurchase. 
We now expect all-in GAAP earnings per share to be up approximately 42% at the center of our guidance range. Going forward, we are committed to balanced top and bottom line growth and strong free cash flow productivity to drive total shareholder return. 
We will continue to address value gaps if and when they merge. We will defend our positions, and we will invest behind brand trial and awareness programs, and of course, consumer-preferred innovation. We'll do everything we can from a productivity standpoint. We'll smartly invest to accelerate top line growth and will continue delivering on our commitment of strong cash return to shareholders. 
David and I both look forward to talking with you at CAGNY, about the plan and priorities to deliver balanced growth and value creation beyond this fiscal year. 
I'll provide an update on our productivity progress and the significant opportunity that remains in front of us, which could help fuel investment and growth. David will discuss our strategic choices, how we plan to sustainably improve top line growth, and the organization and culture changes we'll make to accelerate our progress. 
That concludes our prepared remarks for this morning. As a reminder, business segment information is provided in our press release and will be available from slides which we posted on our website, www.pg.com, following the call. 
With that, I'd be happy to take your questions."

Q2 was a solid sequential improvement despite some of the retailing and tour cuts you mentioned in the release, and your full year sales guidance on ordered sales looks like it's moving up given the all-in guidance is unchanged despite the greater FX pressure. So what's driving that more favorable expectation? Are the factors behind it more longer term in nature or temporary to this year? And then also, can you help explain, if we look at Nielsen's scatter data, we haven't seen improvement in the U.S., Europe or emerging markets. So if you could help explain the dichotomy between the improved expectations but the lack of scattered data sales improvement, that would be helpful. And then last, last quarter, you mentioned second half organic sales growth would likely be above Q2. Is that still the case?"

So there's really no change in the overall outlook, which as you rightly say, was for acceleration in Q2 and then further improvement in the back half of the year. As I've mentioned, the extent of that improvement in the back half of the year is going to be potentially impacted by what happens with access to dollars for imports into Venezuela, and it will obviously be impacted by other things as well. But even with that, we remain confident that we can continue to grow in the second half. In terms of the business in the U.S. and the comparison to scanner data, as you know, we pretty dramatically accelerated our growth in the U.S. from minus 2% in the quarter before to plus 3% this quarter. I mentioned that there was about 1 point of sales that's ahead of consumption. That's some things like the ProShield razor that we shipped into the market, but still, even adjusting for that acceleration as we expected. It's getting increasingly difficult to look only at scanner data as a measure of market health or a business's health. That's particularly true in markets like China, where the -- a huge portion of the growth of the market is coming in the e-commerce channel, which doesn't cross scanner. And you have some of that same dynamic in the U.S. So for example, the Shave Club sales, depending on how they're executed, may or may not cross scanner. And I think that's part of the dichotomy. But generally, if we look across several quarters to dampen out some of the short-term volatility and the noise, we continue to be pleased and encouraged by increasing strength of the North American business, and we expect it to grow going forward."

Number one, in emerging markets where we continue to see currencies devalue, like Russia, like Brazil, how far are you into your price increases? Are you going to continue to take price increases to keep in line with inflation? Or sort of what's the outlook there? And then second part of that, with regard to pricing in North America, it's surprising to me that there is still so much positive pricing kind of across of the whole sector in light of the lower commodity prices. And I don't know whether that's just a reflection of the stronger U.S. consumer or more innovation. But if you can comment kind of broadly on your outlook about pricing in North America and whether you think the price increases you've taken are sustainable?"

It depends on the individual category, but the market growth rates range roughly from, call it, 5% to 8%. So mid to high singles across the categories. And as I've mentioned, we see a significant opportunity remaining in China with those very fractured growth rates, albeit somewhat slower than they were 2 and 3 years ago, with the conversion from a manufacturing to a consumption-based economy, with the dramatic potential that exists as a result of larger family sizes, from the possibility of 2 children versus just 1, and with the premiumization of the market, which as I indicated, admittedly we have not been as agile as we need to be in exploiting. But really, as I mentioned, I was there last week, I was there a week before the Christmas holidays, and I walk away with a tremendous sense of encouragement while acknowledging that we have work to do. In terms of pricing, the pricing dynamic should continue to be a favorable contributor to top line growth as we move forward, even if all we do is take forward the price increases that have already been executed. They're not fully annualized yet. And so that should continue to be a positive on the top line. The pricing calculus or algebra is fairly complicated. You really have to look at the combination of currencies, commodities and competition to determine a course of action going forward in any individual product category or market. And the sum of those 3 things, it's very different, depending on what markets you're in, is influenced by both currencies and by competition. In general, the companies in our industry continue to price at some level for foreign exchange. I mentioned in our prepared remarks that we expect our ability to priced to be somewhat lower than it has been historically, and we'll make up for that over time with productivity and other savings. And in the U.S., first of all, the commodity impacts aren't as significant as you would assume just looking at the headlines on oil prices, for example. If you look at everything from diesel to resin to other imports that are derived from the petro-complex, while the pricing benefit or cost reduction has occurred, it is not anywhere near the level yet of the crude price reductions. So I think that's a potential source of disconnect as people think about this. Generally, we're taking pricing behind very strong product innovation. We're looking to improve the strength of our overall value equations, the combination of pricing and product performance, consumer usage experience, aesthetic. And done in that way, I think that continues to be a contributor to growth and value creation."

For example, if we have employees in our global business service organization that are working to stand up to the new company in terms of building the systems that are required et cetera, those are employees that are going to remain with Procter & Gamble, and therefore, their costs are not in discontinued operations, they're in continuing operations.

In terms of market share, our objective is balanced growth and value creation with the growth objectives being over time at or slightly ahead of markets. So market share does matter. But particularly in a time when we need to restore structural economics in response to currency moves, we can get ourselves in big trouble if that becomes the driving metric. And so as we've said, we're prepared to lose some share in 2 situations. One, is where we're restoring our structural economic attractiveness. I mean, hiving a higher market share with a negative gross margin isn't helpful to anyone. And also where we're doing some of portfolio cleanup that I mentioned, on the core categories, where we'll be in a much better position longer term from both the growth and value creation standpoint, if we can focus on the parts of our portfolio that are really working for us.

There's a margin structure that allows for significant investment and growth on each of these businesses. These are higher-margin businesses, and they're businesses that importantly leverage our core capabilities as a company. So they've been deliberately chosen for success."

And then on the other hand, volumes were still down 2%. I guess, 1% if I exclude the businesses you've chosen to exit, but negative, essentially, across the whole business nonetheless. And market share sounds like it was down in aggregate. So I guess, just some further comments there would be helpful in terms of how and when you're likely to come out of this negative volume phase. Because if I go back over the last 15 years or so, we're sort of in this anomalous period where last year and it sounds like this year we're in negative volume territory. The only time that this ever happened was in the financial crisis. So I guess, again, how and when can we sort of inflect positive on that key volume number?"

And as you rightly indicated, that's had about 1 point worth of impact. And the other is the market reaction from a consumption standpoint, and in some cases, the share price evolution as we take pricing to offset foreign exchange impacts in large devaluation markets. So if you take Russia or the Ukraine as an example, where devaluation has been 70%, 80%, 110%, we have negative gross margins. We need to price over time as well as do everything we can from a savings standpoint to restore those margins at least a positive level so the growth is meaningful. And during that process, both at a market level, market spending contracts in response to higher price points and sometimes from a share standpoint, and Russia and the Ukraine are good examples where we're competing against strong European competitors, and in the case of Russia, Japanese competitors as well, and sometimes, there's a modest share impact that comes with the pricing that we deem necessary to take. We are not prepared to lose share indefinitely. Our history in this area is that it takes kind of 6 to 9 months to work your way through this. Some of the pricing that we've taken has been recent because a lot of the devaluation has been recent. So I don't -- I haven't actually looked at it quarter by quarter to see what's the quarter where volume will reinflect positive. We'll have to work our way through this pricing. And I don't believe in this -- go back to the comments on market share, we fully intend to grow at market growth rates or slightly ahead of market growth rates over longer periods of time. That requires volume growth. I mentioned, Mark, it's growing 3%-ish. We're not going to able to take 3% pricing indefinitely nor is that our intent in any way. So we will -- also we're not -- in markets where competitors don't respond from a pricing standpoint, remember, we -- because we're the market leaders, typically have to lead or nothing happens. So we are exposed for that period of time, and competitors can take 6 to 9 months sometimes before they respond, or they cannot respond at all. In the cases where they don't respond to the levels that are necessary to maintain our value-equation comparisons, or where they don't price at all, we will reduce price. We're not going to be uncompetitive. We're not going to lose share on a sustained basis."

We're not moving people as rapidly across categories. The GBUs have full decision rights on the amount of resources that are supporting their businesses from a go-to-market operations standpoint, which has led to some choices, quite frankly, to increase coverage in some channels. It's led to choices to hire mid-career talent that has experience in the category that extends beyond the experience of our current employees. So it's having a dramatic impact. And every change has a slightly different timeline in terms of when it gets reflected on business results, but I think we can -- I think we're making good progress in this area.

The relationship of organic volume to organic sales in the October-December quarter, developed markets organic volume was plus 2. Organic sales were plus 3. If you look at developing, organic volume was minus 6, organic sales were flat versus a year ago. If you look at those comparisons, they are indicative of exactly what I've said a couple of times in this call in terms of what's driving the volume reductions. It's pricing in developing markets to offset FX, where you don't have as much of an FX impact, for instance, in developed markets our volumes grew at 2% on the quarter. In terms of -- you mentioned Mexico as an example. We actually had a very good quarter in Mexico. The changes that we've made there, we're very pleased with. Organic sales were up 4% in Mexico in the quarter. And remember, I talked about the tissue towel impact or the tissue change in the portfolio, which has negatively impacted organic sales. That's in Mexico. Excluding that, Mexico organic sales were up 8% in the quarter, and volume was up as well. So again, there's a bit of noise as we work through the combination of the portfolio and foreign exchange, but we expect volume will grow as we go forward, and share will also be something that becomes increasingly attainable."

I would argue that, in total, in other words, inclusive of consumption impacts and oil-producing countries, where there's been massive disruption and instability, if you think about markets like Saudi Arabia, markets like, certainly Venezuela, I would say that the net impact in our P&L is likely neutral to negative, but the pure cost impact is $500 million."

But can you elaborate a little bit more, and perhaps even quantify the inventory management change by retailers and the trade term change that you mentioned in the press release, which is mentioned as a negative, particularly in the context of what you said on your prepared remarks, which is that sales being slightly ahead of consumption. So give us a sense of the ongoing effects of those, if you could, number one. Number two is, on your FX, kind of multiplier between the top line and the bottom line impact, why did it change so dramatically versus your '16 guidance? So what I mean is that in July, your FX impact was going to be negative 4% or 5% top line, negative 3% to 4% bottom line, so kind of less than 1 ratio. But now it's a negative 7 on top line and negative 10 on the bottom line. So very quickly shifting to a greater than 1 ratio, despite your efforts to localize more, et cetera. So is that all Argentina devaluation or is there kind of some forecasting math that I'm not getting? Or can you give us a sense how your business is structured or levered kind of differently than we would expect it, because it's a big switch in a short period of time? And then third question, is more in terms of running these conference calls. Should we infer that the decision was made -- because I know you guys were thinking about this, that you're CEO will not be on these calls and would only be at things like CAGNY and the annual calls like AG was doing, or you still in the deciding mode?"

And the top and bottom line relationship between currency movements is very different depending on the market. It depends on how the market is sourced. It depends on the balance sheet of the market. I've mentioned balance sheet revaluation. So for example, in Argentina, we talked about the balance sheet revaluation that occurred there. So it's really a function of what actually is happening in the marketplace, country by country, how we source the markets and what the balance sheet exposures is in different markets. So I'd guess I'm saying, we don't really have a good ability to forecast exactly what the currency impacts are going to be on either the top or bottom line. And frankly, we spend very little time thinking about the relationship between the two. In terms of the comments on trade inventory reduction, that is largely a China dynamic. I've mentioned in prior calls that our inventory levels were too high, particularly in the wholesale channel in China. And as a result, our pricing was too low, which was driving a bit of distortion and difficulty for distributors. And so we have made some choices to address that, and that has a short-term volume impact. That's really what that comment was designed to indicate. Relative to senior executive engagement with the investment community, we intend to be fully engaged with the investment community through a combination of quarterly conference calls, investment conferences, meetings here in Cincinnati. David will be on the road frequently as well, interacting with investment community. And so again, our strategy is one a very high engagement."

In the quarter we just completed, we continued reducing cost and reinvested in growth, reaccelerating our top line and delivering strong earnings and cash flow. Organic sales increased 2%. Core earnings per share increased 9% with constant-currency core earnings per share up 21%. We delivered meaningful triple-digit basis point improvements in gross and operating margins on both a constant-currency and all-in basis. All-in GAAP earnings per share were up 37%, and adjusted free cash flow productivity was 117%. This is a reasonably strong quarter, which reflects our efforts to accelerate organic top line and earnings per share growth fueled by productivity savings. 
We continue to operate, though, in a very challenging and volatile macro environment. Market growth rates in both the volume and value basis have decelerated, due mainly to slower growth in developing markets. We entered the year expecting the market to grow close to 3% to 4% globally. We now expect 2% to 3%. 
There are more flashpoints across the globe than in any time in recent memory with significant economic and political instability impacting incomes and consumption in many large and important markets. Russia, the Ukraine, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the balance of the Middle East, Turkey, Nigeria, Argentina, Venezuela and Brazil. Currencies are weakening across the board, more than $750 million since the start of the fiscal and over $1 billion after-tax versus a year ago. This is on top of a $1.5 billion impact last fiscal year and nearly a $1 billion impact the year before. Across 3 years, FX has been a $3.5 billion impact, over 30% of fiscal year 2013 core net earnings after-tax. 
Since the start of December, the current year FX headwind has increased by $300 million after-tax, with a 40% devaluation in Argentina, an additional 15% devaluation in Russia and nearly a 10% devaluation in Mexico. The relative strength of the dollar weighs heavier on us than our euro and yen functional currency competitors. The dollar has more than doubled against the ruble over the past 2 years, while our euro functional competitors are facing about 50% to 60% of that impact. We expect these dynamics, slowing market growth, geopolitical hotspots and a stronger dollar will continue to be part of our reality going forward. 
Against this backdrop, we're staying focused on big opportunities in our control, executing what is the largest transformation in our company's history. Depth change in productivity, transforming our portfolio and strengthening category business models and innovation plans. This transformation strategy, as we'll explain more at CAGNY, is fundamentally a growth strategy. 
I'll talk briefly about each of these focus areas, productivity, portfolio, and business model and innovation plans, before getting into the details of the quarter. We continued to dramatically improve productivity with significant [indiscernible] ahead. Our original 5-year cost of goods savings target was $6 billion. We expect to deliver over $7 billion by the end of this year, 15% above our initial target. We've reduced manufacturing enrollment by 15% over the last 3 years. This includes new staffing necessary to support capacity addition. On a same-site basis, manufacturing enrollment is down nearly 20%. We're targeting 25% to 30% cumulative reduction by the end of fiscal 2017. 
In February 2012, we announced we would reduce nonmanufacturing overhead by 10% over 5 years. As of December 31, we've reduced these roles by 23%, more than double the original target, and are well on track to meet a revised target of 25% to 30% by the end of fiscal 2017. In fact, we currently expect to reach our 25% to 30% objective this year, one year ahead of schedule. These figures exclude divestitures. Including divestitures will reduce nonmanufacturing roles by over 35%. Continued digitization has been, and will be, a big enabler of our overhead and manufacturing enrollment efficiencies. We're reducing nonworking marketing expenditures, costs that do not impact reach, do not impact frequency. Last year, we reduced the number of agencies we work with by nearly 40% and cut agency and production spending by about $370 million. We're aiming for an additional $200 million of agency-related savings this year. These are nonworking savings that enable us to invest in advertising and in trial of consumer-preferred products. We're strengthening our working marketing programs, greater reach, higher frequency, greater effectiveness at less overall marketing cost. 
Last fiscal year in the U.S., we increased total marketing and merchandising support behind Pantene by 440 basis points, increased Tide brand's spending by 220 basis points and invested an additional 150 basis points in Fusion, behind the new FlexBall innovation. This year, we've made similar increases to advertising programs in the U.S. on Shave Care, Fabric Care, in Brazil on Baby Care and Fabric Care, in China in Fabric Care and Oral Care. In North America alone, we've added nearly 100 basis points to advertising and in-store merchanting budgets since we started the fiscal year. 
In addition to cost of goods sold, overhead and nonworking marketing cost reduction, we're driving balance sheet productivity. Inventory days are down. Payable days are up. The moves we've made on the balance sheet have enabled us to extend our long track record of very strong adjusted free cash flow productivity, 102% last fiscal year, 101% in Q1, 117% in Q2. We continue to maintain our position as one of the strongest cash generators among competitive peers and comparable mega cap companies. We're also among the top companies in returning cash to shareholders. In fiscal 2015, we increased our dividend for the 59th consecutive year and returned $11.9 billion in cash to shareholders, 105% of adjusted net earnings. Over the past 5 years, we've returned $60 billion to shareholders and intend to pay dividends, retire shares and repurchase shares worth up to $70 billion over just the next 4 years. 
In addition to transforming our cost structure, we're transforming our portfolio. As you know, we're centering our portfolio on 10 category base business units where P&G has leading market positions, strong brands and consumer-meaningful product technologies. These 10 categories have historically grown faster with higher margins than the balance of the company. We'll be a company of consumer-preferred brands and products in these 10 product categories. Within these core businesses, we're also focusing our offerings to maximize value creation. We're making smart choices for short-, mid- and long-term value creation, foregoing bad business, even when these choices create short-term top line pressure. 
In our Mexico Family Care business, we made a choice to discontinue low tier unprofitable products in favor of very profitable, higher-tier products, albeit with lower sales. The top line drag from this choice will dissipate over the next few quarters, and we'll have a solidly value-accretive business going forward. 
In India, we've made a choice to deprioritize several unprofitable lines of business, which negatively impact short-term top line growth rates but will lead longer-term to a much more profitable business that will grow strongly. 
Last fiscal year, organic sales growth slowed by several points, but we made significant progress in improving local profit margin, up 700 basis points. We went from losing money in India to triple digit profits. 
In the quarter we just completed, India organic sales growth was only 2%. The strategic part of the business, the part that we're maintaining, grew a healthy 10%. Sales and the portion of the business we're fixing or exiting, which is about 15% of the portfolio, were down 35%. Profit is running significantly ahead of even last year's improved levels. 
As we come out of this, we'll have strong top line growth that is really worth something. There's really no point to growth if it isn't worth something. 
Places [ph] like this impacted our organic top line growth rate by about 1 point in the October-December quarter, but will enable us to increase profitability on an ongoing basis. As we've improved productivity and sharpened our portfolio, we've been strengthening business unit strategies, business models and product offerings, putting particular priority against our 4 largest categories, Fabric Care, Baby Care, Grooming and Hair Care and our 2 largest markets, the U.S. and China. We're focusing our laundry business on consumer-preferred brands and product offerings like our premium performance and premium-priced unit dose detergents, and our market-leading and market-expanding scent bead fabric enhancers. We're launching better-performing and more profitable new compact liquid detergents in Russia, Turkey, Mexico, Brazil and China. In Russia and Turkey, where we launched superior compact liquid detergents early last calendar year, P&G's share of liquid detergents is up 7 and 11 points, respectively. 
Fabric Care results in the U.S. demonstrate what is possible when we get the strategy balanced and the innovation program focused on what matters most to consumers, superior value for best-in-class performance at a modest price premium. The U.S. laundry detergent category is continuing to grow, up more than 4 points on a value basis across all outlets over the last 3 and 6-month periods. Within this, our share is growing. P&G's U.S. laundry detergent value share was up 1 point last fiscal year and was up 0.5 point in the December quarter. We will continue to be the innovation leader in Fabric Care. 
In North America, we're introducing a new regiment on Tide and Downy that addresses the odor problems common to athletic wear. 70% of consumers wear athletic gear multiple times each week. The odor defense collection, anchored by innovation on Tide PODS, brings the proprietary formula of enzymes and surfactants that break down and remove stubborn soils and residues for a great, clean and fresh scent. Paired with the added cleaning power of Tide odor defense rescue laundry booster and Downy Fresh Protect odor defense beads, this regiment promises to eliminate odors from the fast-growing market of athleisure clothes people are wearing far beyond the gym. 
In the U.S. Baby Care, strong innovation, consumer communication, trial programs and a robust online presence have led to strong growth for Pampers. Pampers value share of U.S. diapers was up more than 1.5 points last fiscal year and was up 1 point in the December quarter. The progress is particularly encouraging considering our latest Pampers innovation with extra absorb channels was on shipment allocation for much of the quarter as demand succeeded our initial supply. With increased capacity in place and continued strong demand, we expect a good start to the new calendar year. 
We're increasing our investments in Luvs diapers in the second half of the fiscal year to address share declines following a significant price reduction taken by our primary competitor. Baby Care results have been softer in other markets. To address this, first we've strengthened our value proposition in several markets and accelerated premium innovation on both taped and pull-on diapers to restore our competitiveness at the top end of the market. We're strengthening our selling resources and programs for baby stores, and we're improving our point-of-market entry programs to deliver higher awareness and trial of Pampers among new moms. 
The Gillette FlexBall innovation continues to deliver strong results in Grooming. Globally, an estimated 25 million men have tried FlexBall in the 18 months since launch. FlexBall has been an important catalyst of growth on ProGlide cartridges. ProGlide cartridge sales grew 18% last fiscal year compared to a 7% decline in the overall male cartridge market. ProGlide cartridge shares is up 2 to 3 points in each of the past 3-, 6- and 12-month periods through December. The strong ProGlide results set a very positive stage for our next cartridge innovation, Gillette Fusion ProShield. ProShield with lubrication before and after the blades shields against irritation during every shave. Retailer response to ProShield has been outstanding, delivering launch orders and display levels well above targets. 
We're supporting a broader range of our product ladder from our best product, Fusion FlexBall, to Mach 3 systems, to premium price and superior performance disposables with strong consumer value communication. We're innovating in-store, helping retailers move out of the lock boxes on shelves and at checkout with the use of hard tags. Hard tags make Gillette much easier to shop, they take up less space on shelves so more product can be on a peg, reducing out-of-stocks and improving sales closure rates. And they're very effective at reducing shrink. We've already made the change in several hundred stores with excellent results, and are rolling out hard tags as fast as we're able. 
We're also innovating online. With more men purchasing their Blades & Razors through e-commerce, we're establishing Gillette as the online leader. While we're admittedly late to build out our online offering, Gillette Shave Club launched in June and is off to a very good start. We've increased our e-commerce share of Blades & Razors more than 6 points and nearly doubled online consumption since launching Gillette Shave Club. 
We're building partnerships with e-tailers and retailers who are offering their shopper subscription tie-ins for the Gillette Shave Club, which have enabled Gillette to deliver record online sales in each of the past 3 months. 
In Hair Care, we launched our new conditioner innovation on Pantene in the U.S. earlier this month. Pantene's new breakthrough conditioner technology delivers weightless conditioning, addressing the most significant consumer trial barrier for conditioners. The new conditioner innovation is a consumer blind test winner versus our best competitors in North America, China and Japan. We recently launched 2 new Head & Shoulders variants in the U.S., Instant Fresh and Nourishing Care, and are upgrading Head & Shoulders consumer message with a new campaign, ""Use daily to stay 100% flake-free for life with Head & Shoulders scalp shield technology.""
Driven by these interventions in Laundry, Baby Care, Grooming, Hair Care and other categories, and by our investment in category-dedicated sales coverage, we're making sequential progress in our largest and most profitable market, the United States. The U.S. business rebounded from a 2-point organic sales decline in Q1 to deliver 3 points of organic growth in Q2. The U.S. improvement was despite product allocation driven by demand in excess of supply in 2 of our largest categories, Baby Care and Feminine Care and despite a record light cough-cold season impacting the Vicks brand. 
Sales are probably a 1 point or so ahead of consumption for the October-December quarter, but the progress is encouraging nonetheless. 
Our second largest market, both sales and profits, is China. Here, Q2 organic sales were again down high single digits, in line with the Q1 trend. We've gotten behind improving [ph] innovation, which has been a contributor to our soft top line trends over the last several quarters. We are aggressively addressing this opportunity. David Taylor, Kathy Fish, our R&D leader, myself and several other members of our leadership team have spent the last week in China. We're working with the team there and with the global business units to expand their offerings in the premium-priced tiers, which are the fastest-growing, to invest in trial of consumer-preferred products and to transform our go-to-market operations. We've launched premium Baby Care innovations in both the taped and pull-on segments. We're launching compact Ariel liquid detergents that consumers prefer over competition. And we have new upgrades coming soon on Tide. We've made meaningful product and packaging improvements in Hair Care that launched last quarter on both Head & Shoulders and Pantene. 
In Oral Care, we're launching Oral-B gum care, a new, super premium, repair line of Oral-B toothpastes. The line includes a 2-step paste and other single-step paste variants. Consumer tests show the new line winning against top competition in the superpremium tier. We're importing our best Feminine Care product, Infinity, to China with premium power toothbrushes and our best Braun razors. We're increasing our investment in consumer awareness, point-of-market entry sampling and trial across categories. We're strengthening our relationship and presence with key e-commerce and specialty retailers, the fastest-growing channels in the Chinese retail market. We're investing in coverage of these channels and are working to simplify, standardize and strengthen our overall go-to-market approach. 
These moves will take time to fully implement, and the go-to-market changes may actually result in pullbacks before progress, but we're confident they will result in stronger growth over time. 
Stepping back then and looking at things on a macro level, the environment continues to be very challenging. Slower market growth, stiff foreign exchange headwinds and a volatile political and policy environment. Against this backdrop, we continue to improve productivity, to focus our portfolio and to invest in superior consumer-preferred brands and products. We're putting particular priority against the 4 largest categories, Baby Care, Fabric Care, Hair Care and Grooming, and against our 2 largest markets, the U.S. and China. 
With that as -- with that context as background, let me get into the details of the quarter we've just completed, as well as the outlook for the fiscal year. Two housekeeping items before I begin. First, the organic sales and core earnings results we're reporting today are based on our 10 core product categories. The results of the Beauty and batteries businesses that we're in the process of exiting are reported as discontinued operations. In late October, we provided a restated 10-K for fiscal 2015 presenting historical results on this same basis. Second, starting last quarter, we're no longer consolidating the results of our Venezuelan subsidiaries in our reported numbers. 
Organic sales were up 2% for the quarter versus the prior year, each segment was at or ahead of year ago. As I mentioned previously, sales were slightly ahead of consumption. Organic sales in China and Russia were significantly lower versus last year, negatively impacting total company sales growth by more than 1 point. The category and SKU cleanup efforts drove up to another 1 point of organic sales decline. These impacts were more than offset by progress in the United States and growth in Latin America. All-in sales were down 9%, including 8-point headwind from foreign exchange and 3 points from the Venezuela deconsolidation and minor brand divestitures. Core gross margin and core operating margin each improved on both in all-in and ex-currency basis, driven by productivity savings. Core gross margin increased 210 basis points versus the prior year. Excluding foreign exchange, core gross margin was up 290 basis points. 
Core SG&A cost improved 140 basis points, driven primarily by overhead cost reductions. We continue to invest in marketing, reinvesting in nonworking cost savings. Marketing expenditures were, in total, equal to a year ago as a percentage of sales. 
Core operating margin was up 350 basis points versus the prior year, behind 270 basis points of productivity savings. On a constant-currency basis, our core operating margin was up 390 basis points. 
The core effective tax rate was 23.6%, up nearly 1 point versus last year. Core earnings per share were $1.04, up 9% versus the prior year quarter. This includes a 12 percentage point foreign exchange headwind, approximately $300 million after tax. On a constant-currency basis, core earnings per share grew 21%. 
On an all-in GAAP basis, earnings per share were $1.12 for the quarter, up 37% versus the prior year. We generated $3.8 billion in free cash flow, yielding 117% adjusted free cash flow productivity. 
We returned approximately $3.9 billion to shareholders this quarter through a combination of $1.9 billion in dividends and $2 billion in share repurchase. 
Moving to guidance. We're maintaining our outlook for organic sales growth of in line to up low single digits versus fiscal 2015. We've been investing to increase awareness and trial of our brands and products in North America, which is a key catalyst for growth in categories like Fabric Care and Baby Care. We're launching a number of new consumer-preferred premium innovations over the next few months in both developed and developing markets. We're investing in selling capabilities to capitalize on opportunities in the fastest-growing channels and strengthen our presence in our most important markets. We've also invested in targeted price reductions to narrow consumer value gaps in several categories. All of these efforts, along with annualizing some of the most significant impacts from last fiscal year, give us confidence we'll continue to grow organic sales in the second half. The level of growth could be impacted by our access to dollars for finished product imported into Venezuela. About 60% of our Venezuelan businesses is imported. The sale of imported products from the importing subsidiary is still reported on our consolidated results. Failure to continue this business would result in up to a 0.5-point impact to top line growth in the fiscal year. 
The headwind from foreign exchange has increased since the start of the year. We now expect FX will have a 7 percentage point impact on all-in sales growth. 
Also, the combined impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation and minor brand divestitures will have a 2 to 3 percentage point drag on all-in sales growth. Taken together, we expect all-in sales to be down high single digits versus restated fiscal 2015 results. 
We're also maintaining constant-currency core earnings per share guidance of mid- to high singles, with our internal outlook currently at the low end of this range. 
Given the magnitude of the foreign exchange impact, I thought it might be helpful to again recount how FX impacts our earnings. I'll use the example of the Argentinian peso. We were most pleased to see the early decisive approach of Argentina's new leadership and believe the actions they're taking will create long-term benefits, in which we are well-positioned to participate. But the nearly 30% to 40% devaluation of the peso will significantly impact our reported earnings in 3 ways. First, transaction impacts increase the cost of non-peso-denominated inputs. We import, as an example, Gillette Blades & Razors from Mexico into Argentina. Widening of the cross weight between the 2 peso currencies increases the Argentina unit's cost of razors and reduces profit. Similarly, the local cost of plastic bottles, which are denominated in dollars and imported into Argentina for the production of Fabric Care and Hair Care products, have increased significantly. These transaction cost impacts affect all manufacturers, multinational or local, whose materials or finished products are imported from similar sources and are similarly denominated. 
We attempt to recover these cost increases through pricing, when local legal requirements and market realities allow it, though there's a lag between the time when a currency devalues, the costs are incurred and the pricing is taken and executed through our channels of distribution. 
The second impact is balance sheet revaluation. We need to revalue transaction-related payables and receivables balances at the end of each quarter. This includes the revaluation of balances related to transactions between P&G legal entities that operate in different currencies. To continue the prior example, while razors produced in Mexico are being transported and are moving through the customs process into Argentina, our Argentinian business holds a Mexico peso-denominated payable on its books. At the end of every quarter, payables and receivables balances are revalued at current spot rates. Gains or losses from revalue and transactional balances flow through SG&A and are included in core earnings per share. 
Third, income statements of foreign subsidiaries like Argentina that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency are translated back to U.S. dollars at the new exchange rates. Thus, the Argentinian peso transaction, balance sheet revaluation and translation impacts have been and are projected to be significant at about $70 million, $50 million and $20 million after tax, respectively, for a total of $140 million after tax for the year. Across all currencies, foreign exchange hurts total nearly $300 million after tax in the December quarter, $700 million fiscal year-to-date and are forecast to be $1 billion impact after-tax profit hurt over the course of the fiscal year. 
When we talk about foreign exchange impacts, we're sometimes asked why we don't simply hedge these away. It's a very valid question and something we look at internally and with a different set of outside eyes every year as we prepare our financial plan. 
There are 3 reasons we typically don't end up choosing the hedge. Up to 2/3 of our foreign exchange losses, and a significant amount of our forward exposure is in currencies that are either non-deliverable or are very difficult to hedge. The Argentinian peso, the Venezuelan bolivar and the Ukrainian hryvnia are 3 examples. Second, hedging is neither free nor cheap. Currency volatility in itself increases sometimes in significant ways this cost. So when you want it most, it becomes difficult to afford. 
The last shortfall of hedging as the answer is that it solves nothing longer term. It also does nothing to help restore the margin structure of the business. A hedge simply defers volatility. When the instrument expires, you have the same hit, with the same margin impact you would've had, had you not hedged. 
While it takes time and there's a lag between the hurt and help, we typically look to pricing, sizing, mix enhancement, sourcing choices and cost reduction to manage FX impacts. We have historically recovered about 2/3 of FX impacts with pricing over time. We think, this time, given differential impacts for euro and yen functional currency competitors, it will be somewhat less than that. 
I said in our last call that we would invest where it was appropriate to do so. I said we would not cut smart investment to offset foreign exchange impacts, which meant we could very well end up below the earnings per share guidance range. FX is a near-term reality that has gotten significantly worse. We're doing our best to offset FX impacts with productivity savings and pricing while continuing to make investments in brand equities, innovation, trial and value equations. We think we've struck a reasonable balance of investment to improve the long-term health of the business, even though it requires we moderate our short-term earnings outlook, including foreign exchange. We're reducing our core earnings per share guidance to a range of down 3% to 8% versus last year's core earnings per share of $3.76. This earnings per share guidance includes headwinds of 8 to 9 percentage points from the combined impacts of beauty, deal and transition expenses. These are for the businesses moving out to merge with Coty, Venezuela deconsolidation, lower operating income and a higher -- nonoperating income, excuse me, and a higher tax rate. Adjusting for these items, our guidance translates to modest core earnings per share growth with meaningful growth excluding foreign exchange. 
Our key assumptions on items below the core operating profit line have not changed. The core effective tax rate should be about 24% for fiscal 2016, about 3 points higher than last year, roughly a 4 percentage point headwind on core earnings per share growth. The core tax rate in the back half of the fiscal year -- of last fiscal year was below 19%. We expect the tax rate of closer to 24% in the back half of this fiscal. 
We continue to expect nonoperating income will be a 2 to 3 percentage point drag on core earnings per share growth, mainly impacting the fourth quarter. We had nearly $440 million of nonoperating income gains last year with over $400 million coming in the second half, including $355 million in the fourth quarter. We expect modest nonoperating income gains in the back half of this fiscal. With most of these impacts hitting in the back half, the core earnings per share growth headwind across Q3 and Q4 is roughly 13 percentage points or about $0.24 per share. FX adds another 7% or about $0.12 per share headwind in the back half. So while the midpoint of our new guidance range points to roughly a 15% core earnings per share reduction in the back half versus last year, we're roughly flat, excluding the tax of nonoperating headwinds, and up mid-singles if we adjust for currency. 
Given very strong progress to date, as I've said before, 101% in Q1 and 117% in Q2, we're increasing our free cash flow productivity target from 90% to 100% of earnings. We continue to expect to retire shares at a value of approximately $8 billion to $9 billion through a combination of direct share repurchases and shares that will be exchanged during the third quarter in the Duracell transaction. In addition to these shares we expect to retire, we expect dividend payments of more than $7 billion, in total, $15 billion to $16 billion in dividend payments, share exchange and share repurchase. 
We now expect all-in GAAP earnings per share to be up approximately 42% at the center of our guidance range. Going forward, we are committed to balanced top and bottom line growth and strong free cash flow productivity to drive total shareholder return. 
We will continue to address value gaps if and when they emerge. We will defend our positions, and we will invest behind brand trial and awareness programs, and of course, consumer-preferred innovation. We'll do everything we can from a productivity standpoint. We'll smartly invest to accelerate top line growth and will continue delivering on our commitment of strong cash return to shareholders. 
David and I both look forward to talking with you at CAGNY, about the plan and priorities to deliver balanced growth and value creation beyond this fiscal year. 
I'll provide an update on our productivity progress and the significant opportunity that remains in front of us, which could help fuel investment and growth. David will discuss our strategic choices, how we plan to sustainably improve top line growth, and the organization and culture changes we'll make to accelerate our progress. 
That concludes our prepared remarks for this morning. As a reminder, business segment information is provided in our press release and will be available from slides which we posted on our website, www.pg.com, following the call. 
With that, I'd be happy to take your questions."

Q2 was a solid sequential improvement despite some of the retailing and tour cuts you mentioned in the release, and your full year sales guidance on ordered [ph] sales looks like it's moving up given the all-in guidance is unchanged despite the greater FX pressure. So what's driving that more favorable expectation? Are the factors behind it more longer term in nature or temporary to this year? And then also, can you help explain, if we look at Nielsen's scatter data, we haven't seen improvement in the U.S., Europe or emerging markets. So if you could help explain the dichotomy between the improved expectations but a lack of scattered data sales improvement, that would be helpful. And then last, last quarter, you mentioned second half organic sales growth would likely be above Q2. Is that still the case?"

So there's really no change in the overall outlook, which as you rightly say, was for acceleration in Q2 and then further improvement in the back half of the year. As I've mentioned, the extent of that improvement in the back half of the year is going to be potentially impacted by what happens with access to dollars for imports into Venezuela, and it will obviously be impacted by other things as well. But even with that, we remain confident that we can continue to grow in the second half. In terms of the businesses in the U.S. and the comparison to scanner data, as you know, we pretty dramatically accelerated our growth in the U.S. from minus 2% in the quarter before to plus 3% in this quarter. I mentioned that there was about 1 point of sales that's ahead of consumption. That's on things like the ProShield razor that we shipped into the market, but still, even adjusting for that acceleration as we expected. It's getting increasingly difficult to look only at scanner data as a measure of market's health or a business's health. That's particularly true in markets like China, where the -- a huge portion of the growth of the market is coming in the e-commerce channel, which doesn't cross scanner. And you have some of that same dynamic in the U.S. So for example, the Shave Club sales, depending on how they're executed, may or may not cross scanner. And I think that's part of the dichotomy. But generally, if we look across several quarters to dampen out some of the short-term volatility and the noise, we continue to be pleased and encouraged by increasing strength of the North American business, and we expect it to grow going forward."

Do you have a sense for what the category growth was, just so we can compare that? And then second question, kind of more broadly on pricing. I guess, 2 components. Number one, in emerging markets where we continue to see currencies devalue, like Russia, like Brazil, how far are you into your price increases? Are you going to continue to take price increases to keep in line with inflation? Or sort of what's the outlook there? And then second part of that, with regard to pricing in North America, it's surprising to me that there is still so much positive pricing kind of across the whole sector in light of the lower commodity prices. And I don't know whether that's just a reflection of a stronger U.S. consumer or more innovation. But if you can comment kind of broadly on your outlook about pricing in North America and whether you think the price increases you've taken are sustainable?"

It depends on the individual category, but the market growth rates range roughly from, call it, 5% to 8%. So mid to high singles across the categories. And as I've mentioned, we see significant opportunity remaining in China with those very attractive growth rates, albeit somewhat slower than they were 2 and 3 years ago, with the conversion from a manufacturing to a consumption-based economy, with the dramatic potential that exists as a result of larger family sizes, from the possibility of 2 children versus just 1, and with the premiumization of the market, which as I indicated, admittedly we have not been as agile as we need to be in exploiting. But really, as I mentioned, I was there last week, I was there a week before the Christmas holidays, and I walk away with a tremendous sense of encouragement while acknowledging that we have work to do. In terms of pricing, the pricing dynamic should continue to be a favorable contributor to top line growth as we move forward, even if all we do is take forward the price increases that have already been executed. They're not fully annualized yet. And so that should continue to be a positive on the top line. The pricing calculus or algebra is fairly complicated. You really have to look at the combination of currencies, commodities and competition to determine a course of action going forward in any individual product category or market. And the sum of those 3 things, it's very different, depending on what markets you're in, as influenced by both currencies and by competition. In general, the companies in our industry continue to price at some level for foreign exchange. I mentioned in our prepared remarks that we expect our ability to -- price to be somewhat lower than it has been historically, and we'll make up for that over time with productivity and other savings. And in the U.S., first of all, the commodity impacts aren't as significant as you would assume just looking at the headlines on oil prices, for example. If you look at everything from diesel to resin to other imputs that are derived from the petro-complex, while the pricing benefit or cost reduction has occurred, it is not anywhere near the level yet of the crude price reductions. So I think that's a potential source of disconnect as people think about this. Generally, we're taking pricing behind very strong product innovation. We're looking to improve the strength of our overall value equations, the combination of pricing and product performance, consumer usage experience, aesthetic. And done in that way, I think that continues to be a contributor to growth and value creation."

That's driven both by our encouragement from a response standpoint to the spending that we have in the market and the acceleration of growth, particularly in the U.S. And so yes, your interpretation is correct in terms of the various moving pieces. The guidance range is really reflective of what the underlying constant-currency range of outcomes could be. And then we just apply the current FX math on top of that, and there's a lot of -- we're operating in a more volatile environment than we ever have.

So that's a significant driver of lower EBIT comparisons second half versus first half. As I mentioned, most of those -- most of those hit the second half disproportionately. In terms of currency, there is some letup, but not a lot, in the back half. And I expect our margin progress to continue to be reasonably strong, certainly constant-currency on both gross and operating, though it's really -- the comparison is most dramatically driven by FX and by things like the Venezuela deconsolidation, the transition cost associated with the Beauty business that are not in discontinued operations. For example, if we have employees in our global business service organization that are working to stand up to the new company in terms of building the systems that are required et cetera, those are employees that are going to remain with Procter & Gamble, and therefore, their costs are not in discontinued operations, they're in continuing operations.

Do you still think Duracell is going to close roughly any day now? And then is Coty still set to close July, August? And then my real question is, when do you guys -- when does market share really start to matter? Because I know you've sort of downplayed it and said we're about as many categories and protecting the structural integrity of our categories, but it just seems that some of the share declines that some others mentioned, especially from the emerging markets, are pretty significant. So can you just tell me like if you are going to have a point in time where the focus is going to shift and you're going to focusing on market share again?

You know the exact date will depend on work that still needs to occur, but that's on track. Coty is currently scheduled to close as well on the timing that we initially indicated, which would be in the back half of the calendar year. So no changes on either of those, both progressing towards the desired endpoints as we would hope. In terms of market share, our objective is balanced growth and value creation with the growth objectives being over time at to slightly ahead of markets. So market share does matter. But particularly in a time when we need to restore structural economics in response to currency moves, we can get ourselves in big trouble if that becomes the driving metric. And so as we've said, we're prepared to lose some share in 2 situations. One, is where we're restoring our structural economic attractiveness. I mean, having a higher market share with a negative gross margin isn't helpful to anyone. And also where we're doing some of the portfolio cleanup that I mentioned on the core categories, where we'll be in a much better position longer term from both the growth and value creation standpoint, if we can focus on the parts of our portfolio that are really working for us. So -- and if you look at the percentage of business that is holding or growing share, it's about 45% globally. Currently, we would expect that to be higher going forward. In the U.S., where we're further ahead in the strengthening of our portfolio, et cetera, we've got about 60% of business holding in our growing share."

And I think -- we picked the categories that we're going to compete in, in the new portfolio based on our view of our capability to be more than competitive, to win. These are categories that we have won in. We're global leaders in almost every single one, I think 7 out of the 10, and we're among the leaders in the balance. There's a margin structure that allows for significant investment and growth on each of these businesses. These are higher-margin businesses, and they're businesses that importantly leverage our core capabilities as a company. So they've been deliberately chosen for success."

And market share sounds like it was down in aggregate. So I guess, just some further comments there would be helpful in terms of how and when you're likely to come out of this negative volume phase. Because if I go back over the last 15 years or so, we're sort of in this anomalous period where last year and it sounds like this year we're in negative volume territory. The only time that's ever happened was the financial crisis. So I guess, again, how and when can we sort of inflect positive on that key volume number?"

And as you rightly indicated, that's had about 1 point worth of impact. And the other is the market reaction from a consumption standpoint, and in some cases, the share price evolution as we take pricing to offset foreign exchange impacts in large devaluation markets. So if you take Russia or the Ukraine as an example, where devaluation has been 70%, 80%, 110%, we have negative gross margins. We need to price over time as well as do everything we can from a savings standpoint to restore those margins at least to a positive level so that growth is meaningful. And during that process, both at a market level, markets tend to contract in response to higher price points and sometimes from a share standpoint, and Russia and the Ukraine are good examples where we're competing against strong European competitors, and in the case of Russia, Japanese competitors as well, and sometimes, there's a modest share impact that comes with the pricing that we deem necessary to take. We are not prepared to lose share indefinitely. Our history in this area is that it takes kind of 6 to 9 months to work your way through this. Some of the pricing that we've taken has been recent because a lot of the devaluation has been recent. So I don't -- I haven't actually looked at it quarter by quarter to see what's the quarter where volume will reinflect positive. We'll have to work our way through this pricing. I don't believe in this -- go back to the comments on market share, we fully intend to grow at market growth rates or slightly ahead of market growth rates over longer periods of time. That requires volume growth. I mentioned, Mark, it's growing 3%-ish. We're not going to able to take 3% pricing indefinitely nor is that our intent in any way. So we will -- also we're not -- in markets where competitors don't respond from a pricing standpoint, remember, we -- because we're the market leaders, typically have to lead or nothing happens. So we are exposed for that period of time, and competitors can take 6 to 9 months sometimes before they respond, or they cannot respond at all. In the cases where they don't respond to the levels that are necessary to maintain our value-equation comparisons, or where they don't price at all, we will reduce price. We're not going to be uncompetitive. We're not going to lose share on a sustained basis."

We're basically -- in addition to the 10 categories and their ability to operate somewhat independently, we've sectorized our sales force, and so we're going end to end from the GBU all the way through to the customer with dedicated sales support. We're not moving people as rapidly across categories. The GBUs have full decision rights on the amount of resources that are supporting their businesses from a go-to-market operations standpoint, which has led to some choices, quite frankly, to increase coverage in some channels. It's led to choices to hire mid-career talent that has experience in a category that extends beyond the experience of our current employees. So it's having a dramatic impact. And every change has a slightly different timeline in terms of when it gets reflected on business results, but I think we can -- I think we're making good progress in this area.

If you look at developing, organic volume was minus 6, organic sales were flat versus a year ago. If you look at those comparisons, they are indicative of exactly what I've said a couple of times in this call in terms of what's driving the volume reductions. It's pricing in developing markets to offset FX, where you don't have as much of an FX impact. For instance, in the developed markets our volumes grew at 2% on the quarter. In terms of -- you mentioned Mexico as an example. We actually had a very good quarter in Mexico. The changes that we've made there, we're very pleased with. Organic sales were up 4% in Mexico in the quarter. And remember, I talked about the tissue towel impact or the tissue change in the portfolio, which has negatively impacted organic sales. That's in Mexico. Excluding that, Mexico organic sales were up 8% in the quarter, and volume was up as well.

Number two is, on your FX, kind of multiplier between the top line and the bottom line impact, why did it change so dramatically versus your '16 guidance?

And the top and bottom line relationship between currency movements is very different depending on the market. It depends on how the market is sourced. It depends on the balance sheet of the market. I've mentioned balance sheet revaluations. So for example, in Argentina, we talked about the balance sheet revaluation that occurred there. So it's really a function of what actually is happening in the marketplace, country by country, how we source the markets and what the balance sheet exposure is in different markets. So I'd guess I'm saying, we don't really have a good ability to forecast exactly what the currency impacts are going to be on either the top or bottom line. And frankly, we spend very little time thinking about the relationship between the two. In terms of the comments on trade inventory reduction, that is largely a China dynamic. I've mentioned in prior calls that our inventory levels were too high, particularly in the wholesale channel in China. And as a result, our pricing was too low, which was driving a bit of distortion and difficulty for our distributors. And so we have made some choices to address that, and that has a short-term volume impact. That's really what that comment was designed to indicate. Relative to senior executive engagement with the investment community, we intend to be fully engaged with the investment community through a combination of quarterly conference calls, investment conferences, meetings here in Cincinnati. David will be on the road frequently as well, interacting with the investment community. And so again, our strategy is one of very high engagement."

In the quarter we just completed, we continued reducing cost and reinvested in growth, reaccelerating our top line and delivering strong earnings and cash flow. Organic sales increased 2%.

In the quarter we just completed, we continued reducing cost and reinvested in growth, reaccelerating our top line and delivering strong earnings and cash flow. Organic sales increased 2%. Core earnings per share increased 9% with constant-currency core earnings per share up 21%. We delivered meaningful triple-digit basis point improvements in gross and operating margins on both a constant-currency and all-in basis. All-in GAAP earnings per share were up 37%, and adjusted free cash flow productivity was 117%. This is a reasonably strong quarter, which reflects our efforts to accelerate organic top line and earnings per share growth fueled by productivity savings. 
We continue to operate, though, in a very challenging and volatile macro environment. Market growth rates in both the volume and value basis have decelerated, due mainly to slower growth in developing markets. We entered the year expecting the market to grow close to 3% to 4% globally. We now expect 2% to 3%. 
There are more flashpoints across the globe than in any time in recent memory with significant economic and political instability impacting incomes and consumption in many large and important markets. Russia, the Ukraine, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the balance of the Middle East, Turkey, Nigeria, Argentina, Venezuela and Brazil. Currencies are weakening across the board, more than $750 million since the start of the fiscal and over $1 billion after-tax versus a year ago. This is on top of a $1.5 billion impact last fiscal year and nearly a $1 billion impact the year before. Across 3 years, FX has been a $3.5 billion impact, over 30% of fiscal year 2013 core net earnings after-tax. 
Since the start of December, the current year FX headwind has increased by $300 million after-tax, with a 40% devaluation in Argentina, an additional 15% devaluation in Russia and nearly a 10% devaluation in Mexico. The relative strength of the dollar weighs heavier on us than our euro and yen functional currency competitors. The dollar has more than doubled against the ruble over the past 2 years, while our euro functional competitors are facing about 50% to 60% of that impact. We expect these dynamics, slowing market growth, geopolitical hotspots and a stronger dollar will continue to be part of our reality going forward. 
Against this backdrop, we're staying focused on big opportunities in our control, executing what is the largest transformation in our company's history. Step changing productivity, transforming our portfolio and strengthening category business models and innovation plans. This transformation strategy, as we'll explain more at CAGNY, is fundamentally a growth strategy. 
I'll talk briefly about each of these focus areas, productivity, portfolio, and business model and innovation plans, before getting into the details of the quarter. We continued to dramatically improve productivity with significant [indiscernible] ahead. Our original 5-year cost of goods savings target was $6 billion. We expect to deliver over $7 billion by the end of this year, 15% above our initial target. We've reduced manufacturing enrollment by 15% over the last 3 years. This includes new staffing necessary to support capacity addition. On a same-site basis, manufacturing enrollment is down nearly 20%. We're targeting 25% to 30% cumulative reduction by the end of fiscal 2017. 
In February 2012, we announced we would reduce nonmanufacturing overhead by 10% over 5 years. As of December 31, we've reduced these roles by 23%, more than double the original target, and are well on track to meet our revised target of 25% to 30% by the end of fiscal 2017. In fact, we currently expect to reach our 25% to 30% objective this year, one year ahead of schedule. These figures exclude divestitures. Including divestitures will reduce nonmanufacturing roles by over 35%. Continued digitization has been, and will be, a big enabler of our overhead and manufacturing enrollment efficiencies. We're reducing nonworking marketing expenditures, costs that do not impact reach, do not impact frequency. Last year, we reduced the number of agencies we work with by nearly 40% and cut agency and production spending by about $370 million. We're aiming for an additional $200 million of agency-related savings this year. These are nonworking savings that enable us to invest in advertising and in trial of consumer-preferred products. We're strengthening our working marketing programs, greater reach, higher frequency, greater effectiveness at less overall marketing cost. 
Last fiscal year in the U.S., we increased total marketing and merchandising support behind Pantene by 440 basis points, increased Tide brand's spending by 220 basis points and invested an additional 150 basis points in Fusion, behind the new FlexBall innovation. This year, we've made similar increases to advertising programs in the U.S. on Shave Care, Fabric Care, in Brazil on Baby Care and Fabric Care, in China in Fabric Care and Oral Care. In North America alone, we've added nearly 100 basis points to advertising and in-store merchanting budgets since we started the fiscal year. 
In addition to cost of goods sold, overhead and nonworking marketing cost reduction, we're driving balance sheet productivity. Inventory days are down. Payable days are up. The moves we've made on the balance sheet have enabled us to extend our long track record of very strong adjusted free cash flow productivity, 102% last fiscal year, 101% in Q1, 117% in Q2. We continue to maintain our position as one of the strongest cash generators among competitive peers and comparable mega cap companies. We're also among the top companies in returning cash to shareholders. In fiscal 2015, we increased our dividend for the 59th consecutive year and returned $11.9 billion in cash to shareholders, 105% of adjusted net earnings. Over the past 5 years, we've returned $60 billion to shareholders and intend to pay dividends, retire shares and repurchase shares worth up to $70 billion over just the next 4 years. 
In addition to transforming our cost structure, we're transforming our portfolio. As you know, we're centering our portfolio on 10 category base business units where P&G has leading market positions, strong brands and consumer-meaningful product technologies. These 10 categories have historically grown faster with higher margins than the balance of the company. We'll be a company of consumer-preferred brands and products in these 10 product categories. Within these core businesses, we're also focusing our offerings to maximize value creation. We're making smart choices for short-, mid- and long-term value creation, foregoing bad business, even when these choices create short-term top line pressure. 
In our Mexico Family Care business, we made a choice to discontinue low tier unprofitable products in favor of very profitable, higher-tier products, albeit with lower sales. The top line drag from this choice will dissipate over the next few quarters, and we'll have a solidly value-accretive business going forward. 
In India, we've made a choice to deprioritize several unprofitable lines of business, which negatively impact short-term top line growth rates but will lead longer-term to a much more profitable business that will grow strongly. 
Last fiscal year, organic sales growth slowed by several points, but we made significant progress in improving local profit margin, up 700 basis points. We went from losing money in India to triple digit profits. 
In the quarter we just completed, India organic sales growth was only 2%. The strategic part of the business, the part that we're maintaining, grew a healthy 10%. Sales in the portion of the business we're fixing or exiting, which is about 15% of the portfolio, were down 35%. Profit is running significantly ahead of even last year's improved levels. 
As we come out of this, we'll have strong top line growth that is really worth something. There's really no point to growth if it isn't worth something. 
Choices like this impacted our organic top line growth rate by about 1 point in the October-December quarter, but will enable us to increase profitability on an ongoing basis. As we've improved productivity and sharpened our portfolio, we've been strengthening business unit strategies, business models and product offerings, putting particular priority against our 4 largest categories, Fabric Care, Baby Care, Grooming and Hair Care and our 2 largest markets, the U.S. and China. We're focusing our laundry business on consumer-preferred brands and product offerings like our premium performance and premium-priced unit dose detergents, and our market-leading and market-expanding scent bead fabric enhancers. We're launching better-performing and more profitable new compact liquid detergents in Russia, Turkey, Mexico, Brazil and China. In Russia and Turkey, where we launched superior compact liquid detergents early last calendar year, P&G's share of liquid detergents is up 7 and 11 points, respectively. 
Fabric Care results in the U.S. demonstrate what is possible when we get the strategy balanced and the innovation program focused on what matters most to consumers, superior value for best-in-class performance at a modest price premium. The U.S. laundry detergent category is continuing to grow, up more than 4 points on a value basis across all outlets over the last 3 and 6-month periods. Within this, our share is growing. P&G's U.S. laundry detergent value share was up 1 point last fiscal year and was up 0.5 point in the December quarter. We will continue to be the innovation leader in Fabric Care. 
In North America, we're introducing a new regiment on Tide and Downy that addresses the odor problems common to athletic wear. 70% of consumers wear athletic gear multiple times each week. The odor defense collection, anchored by innovation on Tide PODS, brings the proprietary formula of enzymes and surfactants that break down and remove stubborn soils and residues for a great, clean and fresh scent. Paired with the added cleaning power of Tide odor defense rescue laundry booster and Downy Fresh Protect odor defense beads, this regiment promises to eliminate odors from the fast-growing market of athleisure clothes people are wearing far beyond the gym. 
In the U.S. Baby Care, strong innovation, consumer communication, trial programs and a robust online presence have led to strong growth for Pampers. Pampers value share of U.S. diapers was up more than 1.5 points last fiscal year and was up 1 point in the December quarter. The progress is particularly encouraging considering our latest Pampers innovation with extra absorb channels was on shipment allocation for much of the quarter as demand succeeded our initial supply. With increased capacity in place and continued strong demand, we expect a good start to the new calendar year. 
We're increasing our investments in Luvs diapers in the second half of the fiscal year to address share declines following a significant price reduction taken by our primary competitor. Baby Care results have been softer in other markets. To address this, we've strengthened our value proposition in several markets and accelerated premium innovation on both taped and pull-on diapers to restore our competitiveness at the top end of the market. We're strengthening our selling resources and programs for baby stores, and we're improving our point-of-market entry programs to deliver higher awareness and trial of Pampers among new moms. 
The Gillette FlexBall innovation continues to deliver strong results in Grooming. Globally, an estimated 25 million men have tried FlexBall in the 18 months since launch. FlexBall has been an important catalyst of growth on ProGlide cartridges. ProGlide cartridge sales grew 18% last fiscal year compared to a 7% decline in the overall male cartridge market. ProGlide cartridge shares is up 2 to 3 points in each of the past 3-, 6- and 12-month periods through December. The strong ProGlide results set a very positive stage for our next cartridge innovation, Gillette Fusion ProShield. ProShield with lubrication before and after the blades shields against irritation during every shave. Retailer response to ProShield has been outstanding, delivering launch orders and display levels well above targets. 
We're supporting a broader range of our product ladder from our best product, Fusion FlexBall, to Mach 3 systems, to premium price and superior performance disposables with strong consumer value communication. We're innovating in-store, helping retailers move out of the lock boxes on shelves and at checkout with the use of hard tags. Hard tags make Gillette much easier to shop, they take up less space on shelves so more product can be on a peg, reducing out-of-stocks and improving sales closure rates. And they're very effective at reducing shrink. We've already made the change in several hundred stores with excellent results, and are rolling out hard tags as fast as we're able. 
We're also innovating online. With more men purchasing their Blades & Razors through e-commerce, we're establishing Gillette as the online leader. While we're admittedly late to build out our online offering, Gillette Shave Club launched in June and is off to a very good start. We've increased our e-commerce share of Blades & Razors more than 6 points and nearly doubled online consumption since launching Gillette Shave Club. 
We're building partnerships with e-tailers and retailers who are offering their shopper subscription tie-ins for the Gillette Shave Club, which have enabled Gillette to deliver record online sales in each of the past 3 months. 
In Hair Care, we launched our new conditioner innovation on Pantene in the U.S. earlier this month. Pantene's new breakthrough conditioner technology delivers weightless conditioning, addressing the most significant consumer trial barrier for conditioners. The new conditioner innovation is a consumer blind test winner versus our best competitors in North America, China and Japan. We recently launched 2 new Head & Shoulders variants in the U.S., Instant Fresh and Nourishing Care, and are upgrading Head & Shoulders consumer message with a new campaign, ""Use daily to stay 100% flake-free for life with Head & Shoulders scalp shield technology.""
Driven by these interventions in Laundry, Baby Care, Grooming, Hair Care and other categories, and by our investment in category-dedicated sales coverage, we're making sequential progress in our largest and most profitable market, the United States. The U.S. business rebounded from a 2-point organic sales decline in Q1 to deliver 3 points of organic growth in Q2. The U.S. improvement was despite product allocation driven by demand in excess of supply in 2 of our largest categories, Baby Care and Feminine Care and despite a record light cough-cold season impacting the Vicks brand. 
Sales are probably a 1 point or so ahead of consumption for the October-December quarter, but the progress is encouraging nonetheless. 
Our second largest market, both sales and profits, is China. Here, Q2 organic sales were again down high single digits, in line with the Q1 trend. We've gotten behind in premium innovation, which has been a contributor to our soft top line trends over the last several quarters. We are aggressively addressing this opportunity. David Taylor, Kathy Fish, our R&D leader, myself and several other members of our leadership team have spent the last week in China. We're working with the team there and with the global business units to expand their offerings in the premium-priced tiers, which are the fastest-growing, to invest in trial of consumer-preferred products and to transform our go-to-market operations. We've launched premium Baby Care innovations in both the taped and pull-on segments. We're launching compact Ariel liquid detergents that consumers prefer over competition. And we have new upgrades coming soon on Tide. We've made meaningful product and packaging improvements in Hair Care that launched last quarter on both Head & Shoulders and Pantene. 
In Oral Care, we're launching Oral-B gum care, a new, super premium gum repair line of Oral-B toothpastes. The line includes a 2-step paste and other single-step paste variants. Consumer tests show the new line winning against top competition in the superpremium tier. We're importing our best Feminine Care product, Infinity, to China with premium power toothbrushes and our best Braun razors. We're increasing our investment in consumer awareness, point-of-market entry sampling and trial across categories. We're strengthening our relationship and presence with key e-commerce and specialty retailers, the fastest-growing channels in the Chinese retail market. We're investing in coverage of these channels and are working to simplify, standardize and strengthen our overall go-to-market approach. 
These moves will take time to fully implement, and the go-to-market changes may actually result in pullbacks before progress, but we're confident they will result in stronger growth over time. 
Stepping back then and looking at things on a macro level, the environment continues to be very challenging. Slower market growth, stiff foreign exchange headwinds and a volatile political and policy environment. Against this backdrop, we continue to improve productivity, to focus our portfolio and to invest in superior consumer-preferred brands and products. We're putting particular priority against the 4 largest categories, Baby Care, Fabric Care, Hair Care and Grooming, and against our 2 largest markets, the U.S. and China. 
With that as -- with that context as background, let me get into the details of the quarter we've just completed, as well as the outlook for the fiscal year. Two housekeeping items before I begin. First, the organic sales and core earnings results we're reporting today are based on our 10 core product categories. The results of the Beauty and batteries businesses that we're in the process of exiting are reported as discontinued operations. In late October, we provided a restated 10-K for fiscal 2015 presenting historical results on this same basis. Second, starting last quarter, we're no longer consolidating the results of our Venezuelan subsidiaries in our reported numbers. 
Organic sales were up 2% for the quarter versus the prior year, each segment was at or ahead of year ago. As I mentioned previously, sales were slightly ahead of consumption. Organic sales in China and Russia were significantly lower versus last year, negatively impacting total company sales growth by more than 1 point. The category and SKU cleanup efforts drove up to another 1 point of organic sales decline. These impacts were more than offset by progress in the United States and growth in Latin America. All-in sales were down 9%, including 8-point headwind from foreign exchange and 3 points from the Venezuela deconsolidation and minor brand divestitures. Core gross margin and core operating margin each improved on both in all-in and ex-currency basis, driven by productivity savings. Core gross margin increased 210 basis points versus the prior year. Excluding foreign exchange, core gross margin was up 290 basis points. 
Core SG&A cost improved 140 basis points, driven primarily by overhead cost reductions. We continue to invest in marketing, reinvesting in nonworking cost savings. Marketing expenditures were, in total, equal to a year ago as a percentage of sales. 
Core operating margin was up 350 basis points versus the prior year, behind 270 basis points of productivity savings. On a constant-currency basis, our core operating margin was up 390 basis points. 
The core effective tax rate was 23.6%, up nearly 1 point versus last year. Core earnings per share were $1.04, up 9% versus the prior year quarter. This includes a 12 percentage point foreign exchange headwind, approximately $300 million after tax. On a constant-currency basis, core earnings per share grew 21%. 
On an all-in GAAP basis, earnings per share were $1.12 for the quarter, up 37% versus the prior year. We generated $3.8 billion in free cash flow, yielding 117% adjusted free cash flow productivity. 
We returned approximately $3.9 billion to shareholders this quarter through a combination of $1.9 billion in dividends and $2 billion in share repurchase. 
Moving to guidance. We're maintaining our outlook for organic sales growth of in line to up low single digits versus fiscal 2015. We've been investing to increase awareness and trial of our brands and products in North America, which is a key catalyst for growth in categories like Fabric Care and Baby Care. We're launching a number of new consumer-preferred premium innovations over the next few months in both developed and developing markets. We're investing in selling capabilities to capitalize on opportunities in the fastest-growing channels and strengthen our presence in our most important markets. We've also invested in targeted price reductions to narrow consumer value gaps in several categories. All of these efforts, along with annualizing some of the most significant impacts from last fiscal year, give us confidence we'll continue to grow organic sales in the second half. The level of growth could be impacted by our access to dollars for finished product imported into Venezuela. About 60% of our Venezuelan businesses is imported. The sale of imported products from the importing subsidiary is still reported on our consolidated results. Failure to continue this business would result in up to a 0.5-point impact to top line growth in the fiscal year. 
The headwind from foreign exchange has increased since the start of the year. We now expect FX will have a 7 percentage point impact on all-in sales growth. 
Also, the combined impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation and minor brand divestitures will have a 2 to 3 percentage point drag on all-in sales growth. Taken together, we expect all-in sales to be down high single digits versus restated fiscal 2015 results. 
We're also maintaining constant-currency core earnings per share guidance of mid- to high singles, with our internal outlook currently at the low end of this range. 
Given the magnitude of the foreign exchange impact, I thought it might be helpful to again recount how FX impacts our earnings. I'll use the example of the Argentinian peso. We were most pleased to see the early decisive approach of Argentina's new leadership and believe the actions they're taking will create long-term benefits, in which we are well-positioned to participate. But the nearly 30% to 40% devaluation of the peso will significantly impact our reported earnings in 3 ways. First, transaction impacts increase the cost of non-peso-denominated inputs. We import, as an example, Gillette Blades & Razors from Mexico into Argentina. Widening of the cross weight between the 2 peso currencies increases the Argentina unit's cost of razors and reduces profit. Similarly, the local cost of plastic bottles, which are denominated in dollars and imported into Argentina for the production of Fabric Care and Hair Care products, have increased significantly. These transaction cost impacts affect all manufacturers, multinational or local, whose materials or finished products are imported from similar sources and are similarly denominated. 
We attempt to recover these cost increases through pricing, when local legal requirements and market realities allow it, though there's a lag between the time when a currency devalues, the costs are incurred and the pricing is taken and executed through our channels of distribution. 
The second impact is balance sheet revaluation. We need to revalue transaction-related payables and receivables balances at the end of each quarter. This includes the revaluation of balances related to transactions between P&G legal entities that operate in different currencies. To continue the prior example, while razors produced in Mexico are being transported and are moving through the customs process into Argentina, our Argentinian business holds a Mexico peso-denominated payable on its books. At the end of every quarter, payables and receivables balances are revalued at current spot rates. Gains or losses from revaluing transactional balances flow through SG&A and are included in core earnings per share. 
Third, income statements of foreign subsidiaries like Argentina that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency are translated back to U.S. dollars at the new exchange rates. Thus, the Argentinian peso transaction, balance sheet revaluation and translation impacts have been and are projected to be significant at about $70 million, $50 million and $20 million after tax, respectively, for a total of $140 million after tax for the year. Across all currencies, foreign exchange hurts total nearly $300 million after tax in the December quarter, $700 million fiscal year-to-date and are forecast to be $1 billion impact after-tax profit hurt over the course of the fiscal year. 
When we talk about foreign exchange impacts, we're sometimes asked why we don't simply hedge these away. It's a very valid question and something we look at internally and with a different set of outside eyes every year as we prepare our financial plan. 
There are 3 reasons we typically don't end up choosing the hedge. Up to 2/3 of our foreign exchange losses, and a significant amount of our forward exposure is in currencies that are either non-deliverable or are very difficult to hedge. The Argentinian peso, the Venezuelan bolivar and the Ukrainian hryvnia are 3 examples. Second, hedging is neither free nor cheap. Currency volatility in itself increases sometimes in significant ways this cost. So when you want it most, it becomes difficult to afford. 
The last shortfall of hedging as the answer is that it solves nothing longer term. It also does nothing to help restore the margin structure of the business. A hedge simply defers volatility. When the instrument expires, you have the same hit, with the same margin impact you would've had, had you not hedged. 
While it takes time and there's a lag between the hurt and help, we typically look to pricing, sizing, mix enhancement, sourcing choices and cost reduction to manage FX impacts. We have historically recovered about 2/3 of FX impacts with pricing over time. We think, this time, given differential impacts for euro and yen functional currency competitors, it will be somewhat less than that. 
I said in our last call that we would invest where it was appropriate to do so. I said we would not cut smart investment to offset foreign exchange impacts, which meant we could very well end up below the earnings per share guidance range. FX is a near-term reality that has gotten significantly worse. We're doing our best to offset FX impacts with productivity savings and pricing while continuing to make investments in brand equities, innovation, trial and value equations. We think we've struck a reasonable balance of investment to improve the long-term health of the business, even though it requires we moderate our short-term earnings outlook, including foreign exchange. We're reducing our core earnings per share guidance to a range of down 3% to 8% versus last year's core earnings per share of $3.76. This earnings per share guidance includes headwinds of 8 to 9 percentage points from the combined impacts of beauty, deal and transition expenses. These are for the businesses moving out to merge with Coty, Venezuela deconsolidation, lower operating income and a higher -- nonoperating income, excuse me, and a higher tax rate. Adjusting for these items, our guidance translates to modest core earnings per share growth with meaningful growth excluding foreign exchange. 
Our key assumptions on items below the core operating profit line have not changed. The core effective tax rate should be about 24% for fiscal 2016, about 3 points higher than last year, roughly a 4 percentage point headwind on core earnings per share growth. The core tax rate in the back half of the fiscal year -- of last fiscal year was below 19%. We expect the tax rate of closer to 24% in the back half of this fiscal. 
We continue to expect nonoperating income will be a 2 to 3 percentage point drag on core earnings per share growth, mainly impacting the fourth quarter. We had nearly $440 million of nonoperating income gains last year with over $400 million coming in the second half, including $355 million in the fourth quarter. We expect modest nonoperating income gains in the back half of this fiscal. With most of these impacts hitting in the back half, the core earnings per share growth headwind across Q3 and Q4 is roughly 13 percentage points or about $0.24 per share. FX adds another 7% or about $0.12 per share headwind in the back half. So while the midpoint of our new guidance range points to roughly a 15% core earnings per share reduction in the back half versus last year, we're roughly flat, excluding the tax of nonoperating headwinds, and up mid-singles if we adjust for currency. 
Given very strong progress to date, as I've said before, 101% in Q1 and 117% in Q2, we're increasing our free cash flow productivity target from 90% to 100% of earnings. We continue to expect to retire shares at a value of approximately $8 billion to $9 billion through a combination of direct share repurchases and shares that will be exchanged during the third quarter in the Duracell transaction. In addition to these shares we expect to retire, we expect dividend payments of more than $7 billion, in total, $15 billion to $16 billion in dividend payments, share exchange and share repurchase. 
We now expect all-in GAAP earnings per share to be up approximately 42% at the center of our guidance range. Going forward, we are committed to balanced top and bottom line growth and strong free cash flow productivity to drive total shareholder return. 
We will continue to address value gaps if and when they emerge. We will defend our positions, and we will invest behind brand trial and awareness programs, and of course, consumer-preferred innovation. We'll do everything we can from a productivity standpoint. We'll smartly invest to accelerate top line growth and will continue delivering on our commitment of strong cash return to shareholders. 
David and I both look forward to talking with you at CAGNY, about the plan and priorities to deliver balanced growth and value creation beyond this fiscal year. 
I'll provide an update on our productivity progress and the significant opportunity that remains in front of us, which could help fuel investment and growth. David will discuss our strategic choices, how we plan to sustainably improve top line growth, and the organization and culture changes we'll make to accelerate our progress. 
That concludes our prepared remarks for this morning. As a reminder, business segment information is provided in our press release and will be available from slides which we posted on our website, www.pg.com, following the call. 
With that, I'd be happy to take your questions."

Q2 was a solid sequential improvement despite some of the retail inventory cuts you mentioned in the release, and your full year sales guidance on org sales looks like it's moving up given the all-in guidance is unchanged despite the greater FX pressure. So what's driving that more favorable expectation? Are the factors behind it more longer term in nature or temporary to this year? And then also, can you help explain, if we look at Nielsen's scanner data, we haven't seen improvement in the U.S., Europe or emerging markets. So if you could help explain the dichotomy between the improved expectations but a lack of scanner data sales improvement, that would be helpful. And then last, last quarter, you mentioned second half organic sales growth would likely be above Q2. Is that still the case?"

So there's really no change in the overall outlook, which as you rightly say, was for acceleration in Q2 and then further improvement in the back half of the year. As I've mentioned, the extent of that improvement in the back half of the year is going to be potentially impacted by what happens with access to dollars for imports into Venezuela, and it will obviously be impacted by other things as well. But even with that, we remain confident that we can continue to grow in the second half. In terms of the businesses in the U.S. and the comparison to scanner data, as you know, we pretty dramatically accelerated our growth in the U.S. from minus 2% in the quarter before to plus 3% in this quarter. I mentioned that there was about 1 point of sales that's ahead of consumption. That's on things like the ProShield razor that we shipped into the market, but still, even adjusting for that acceleration as we expected. It's getting increasingly difficult to look only at scanner data as a measure of market's health or a business's health. That's particularly true in markets like China, where the -- a huge portion of the growth of the market is coming in the e-commerce channel, which doesn't cross scanner. And you have some of that same dynamic in the U.S. So for example, the Shave Club sales, depending on how they're executed, may or may not cross scanner. And I think that's part of the dichotomy. But generally, if we look across several quarters to dampen out some of the short-term volatility and the noise, we continue to be pleased and encouraged by increasing strength of the North American business, and we expect it to grow going forward."

Do you have a sense for what the category growth was, just so we can compare that? And then second question, kind of more broadly on pricing. I guess, 2 components. Number one, in emerging markets where we continue to see currencies devalue, like Russia, like Brazil, how far are you into your price increases? Are you going to continue to take price increases to keep in line with inflation? Or sort of what's the outlook there? And then second part of that, with regard to pricing in North America, it's surprising to me that there is still so much positive pricing kind of across the whole sector in light of the lower commodity prices. And I don't know whether that's just a reflection of a stronger U.S. consumer or more innovation. But if you can comment kind of broadly on your outlook about pricing in North America and whether you think the price increases you've taken are sustainable?"

It depends on the individual category, but the market growth rates range roughly from, call it, 5% to 8%. So mid to high singles across the categories. And as I've mentioned, we see significant opportunity remaining in China with those very attractive growth rates, albeit somewhat slower than they were 2 and 3 years ago, with the conversion from a manufacturing to a consumption-based economy, with the dramatic potential that exists as a result of larger family sizes, from the possibility of 2 children versus just 1, and with the premiumization of the market, which as I indicated, admittedly we have not been as agile as we need to be in exploiting. But really, as I mentioned, I was there last week, I was there a week before the Christmas holidays, and I walk away with a tremendous sense of encouragement while acknowledging that we have work to do. In terms of pricing, the pricing dynamic should continue to be a favorable contributor to top line growth as we move forward, even if all we do is take forward the price increases that have already been executed. They're not fully annualized yet. And so that should continue to be a positive on the top line. The pricing calculus or algebra is fairly complicated. You really have to look at the combination of currencies, commodities and competition to determine a course of action going forward in any individual product category or market. And the sum of those 3 things, it's very different, depending on what markets you're in, as influenced by both currencies and by competition. In general, the companies in our industry continue to price at some level for foreign exchange. I mentioned in our prepared remarks that we expect our ability to -- price to be somewhat lower than it has been historically, and we'll make up for that over time with productivity and other savings. And in the U.S., first of all, the commodity impacts aren't as significant as you would assume just looking at the headlines on oil prices, for example. If you look at everything from diesel to resin to other inputs that are derived from the petro-complex, while the pricing benefit or cost reduction has occurred, it is not anywhere near the level yet of the crude price reductions. So I think that's a potential source of disconnect as people think about this. Generally, we're taking pricing behind very strong product innovation. We're looking to improve the strength of our overall value equations, the combination of pricing and product performance, consumer usage experience, aesthetic. And done in that way, I think that continues to be a contributor to growth and value creation."

That's driven both by our encouragement from a response standpoint to the spending that we have in the market and the acceleration of growth, particularly in the U.S. And so yes, your interpretation is correct in terms of the various moving pieces. The guidance range is really reflective of what the underlying constant-currency range of outcomes could be.

So I think I understand you, the below-the-line impacts of tax rate and other, but it looks like FX probably gets less bad in the back half of the year. I think you said that, right?

So that's a significant driver of lower EBIT comparisons second half versus first half. As I mentioned, most of those -- most of those hit the second half disproportionately. In terms of currency, there is some letup, but not a lot, in the back half. And I expect our margin progress to continue to be reasonably strong, certainly constant-currency on both gross and operating, though it's really -- the comparison is most dramatically driven by FX and by things like the Venezuela deconsolidation, the transition cost associated with the Beauty business that are not in discontinued operations. For example, if we have employees in our global business service organization that are working to stand up to the new company in terms of building the systems that are required et cetera, those are employees that are going to remain with Procter & Gamble, and therefore, their costs are not in discontinued operations, they're in continuing operations.

Do you still think Duracell is going to close roughly any day now? And then is Coty still set to close July, August?

You know the exact date will depend on work that still needs to occur, but that's on track. Coty is currently scheduled to close as well on the timing that we initially indicated, which would be in the back half of the calendar year. So no changes on either of those, both progressing towards the desired endpoints as we would hope. In terms of market share, our objective is balanced growth and value creation with the growth objectives being over time at to slightly ahead of markets. So market share does matter. But particularly in a time when we need to restore structural economics in response to currency moves, we can get ourselves in big trouble if that becomes the driving metric. And so as we've said, we're prepared to lose some share in 2 situations. One, is where we're restoring our structural economic attractiveness. I mean, having a higher market share with a negative gross margin isn't helpful to anyone. And also where we're doing some of the portfolio cleanup that I mentioned on the core categories, where we'll be in a much better position longer term from both the growth and value creation standpoint, if we can focus on the parts of our portfolio that are really working for us. So -- and if you look at the percentage of business that is holding or growing share, it's about 45% globally. Currently, we would expect that to be higher going forward.

And I think -- we picked the categories that we're going to compete in, in the new portfolio based on our view of our capability to be more than competitive, to win. These are categories that we have won in. We're global leaders in almost every single one, I think 7 out of the 10, and we're among the leaders in the balance. There's a margin structure that allows for significant investment and growth on each of these businesses. These are higher-margin businesses, and they're businesses that importantly leverage our core capabilities as a company. So they've been deliberately chosen for success."

And market share sounds like it was down in aggregate. So I guess, just some further comments there would be helpful in terms of how and when you're likely to come out of this negative volume phase. Because if I go back over the last 15 years or so, we're sort of in this anomalous period where last year, and it sounds like this year, we're in negative volume territory. The only time that's ever happened was the financial crisis. So I guess, again, how and when can we sort of inflect positive on that key volume number?"

And as you rightly indicated, that's had about 1 point worth of impact. And the other is the market reaction from a consumption standpoint, and in some cases, the share price evolution as we take pricing to offset foreign exchange impacts in large devaluation markets. So if you take Russia or the Ukraine as an example, where devaluation has been 70%, 80%, 110%, we have negative gross margins. We need to price over time as well as do everything we can from a savings standpoint to restore those margins at least to a positive level so that growth is meaningful. And during that process, both at a market level, markets tend to contract in response to higher price points and sometimes from a share standpoint, and Russia and the Ukraine are good examples where we're competing against strong European competitors, and in the case of Russia, Japanese competitors as well, and sometimes, there's a modest share impact that comes with the pricing that we deem necessary to take. We are not prepared to lose share indefinitely. Our history in this area is that it takes kind of 6 to 9 months to work your way through this. Some of the pricing that we've taken has been recent because a lot of the devaluation has been recent. So I don't -- I haven't actually looked at it quarter by quarter to see what's the quarter where volume will reinflect positive. We'll have to work our way through this pricing. I don't believe in this -- go back to the comments on market share, we fully intend to grow at market growth rates or slightly ahead of market growth rates over longer periods of time. That requires volume growth. I mentioned market's growing 3%-ish. We're not going to able to take 3% pricing indefinitely nor is that our intent in any way. So we will -- also we're not -- in markets where competitors don't respond from a pricing standpoint, remember, we -- because we're the market leaders, typically have to lead or nothing happens. So we are exposed for that period of time, and competitors can take 6 to 9 months sometimes before they respond, or they cannot respond at all. In the cases where they don't respond to the levels that are necessary to maintain our value-equation comparisons, or where they don't price at all, we will reduce price. We're not going to be uncompetitive. We're not going to lose share on a sustained basis."

We're basically -- in addition to the 10 categories and their ability to operate somewhat independently, we've sectorized our sales force, and so we're going end to end from the GBU all the way through to the customer with dedicated sales support. We're not moving people as rapidly across categories. The GBUs have full decision rights on the amount of resources that are supporting their businesses from a go-to-market operations standpoint, which has led to some choices, quite frankly, to increase coverage in some channels. It's led to choices to hire mid-career talent that has experience in a category that extends beyond the experience of our current employees. So it's having a dramatic impact. And every change has a slightly different timeline in terms of when it gets reflected on business results, but I think we can -- I think we're making good progress in this area.

The relationship of organic volume to organic sales in the October-December quarter, developed markets organic volume was plus 2. Organic sales were plus 3. If you look at developing, organic volume was minus 6, organic sales were flat versus a year ago. If you look at those comparisons, they are indicative of exactly what I've said a couple of times in this call in terms of what's driving the volume reductions. It's pricing in developing markets to offset FX, where you don't have as much of an FX impact. For instance, in the developed markets our volumes grew at 2% on the quarter. In terms of -- you mentioned Mexico as an example. We actually had a very good quarter in Mexico. The changes that we've made there, we're very pleased with. Organic sales were up 4% in Mexico in the quarter. And remember, I talked about the tissue towel impact or the tissue change in the portfolio, which has negatively impacted organic sales. That's in Mexico. Excluding that, Mexico organic sales were up 8% in the quarter, and volume was up as well. So again, there's a bit of noise as we work through the combination of the portfolio and foreign exchange, but we expect volume will grow as we go forward, and share will also be something that becomes increasingly attainable."

So again, Brazil was up 11% on the quarter. In terms of commodities, looked at as a singled area, so just the cost -- the reduction of input cost. That impact is about $500 million on the fiscal year. Some of that we anticipated going into the year, of course, but that's the amount. I would argue that, in total, in other words, inclusive of consumption impacts in oil-producing countries, where there's been massive disruption and instability, if you think about markets like Saudi Arabia, markets like, certainly Venezuela, I would say that the net impact in our P&L is likely neutral to negative, but the pure cost impact is $500 million."

Look, I mean your compares clearly get easier over the next couple of quarters. So that should certainly bode well. But can you elaborate a little bit more, and perhaps even quantify the inventory management change by retailers and the trade term change that you mentioned in the press release, which is mentioned as a negative, particularly in the context of what you said on your prepared remarks, which is that sales being slightly ahead of consumption. So give us a sense of the ongoing effects of those, if you could, number one. Number two is, on your FX, kind of multiplier between the top line and the bottom line impact, why did it change so dramatically versus your '16 guidance? So what I mean is that in July, your FX impact was going to be negative 4% or 5% top line, negative 3% to 4% bottom line, so kind of less than 1 ratio. But now it's a negative 7 on top line and negative 10 on the bottom line. So very quickly shifting to a greater than 1 ratio, despite your efforts to localize more, et cetera. So is that all Argentina devaluation or is there kind of some forecasting math that I'm not getting? Or can you give us a sense how your business is structured or levered kind of differently than we would expect it, because it's a big switch in a short period of time? And then third question, is more in terms of running these conference calls. Should we infer that the decision was made -- because I know you guys were thinking about this, that your CEO will not be on these quarterly calls and will only be at things like CAGNY and the annual calls like AG was doing, or you still in the deciding mode?"

And the top and bottom line relationship between currency movements is very different depending on the market. It depends on how the market is sourced. It depends on the balance sheet of the market. I've mentioned balance sheet revaluations. So for example, in Argentina, we talked about the balance sheet revaluation that occurred there. So it's really a function of what actually is happening in the marketplace, country by country, how we source the markets and what the balance sheet exposure is in different markets. So I'd guess I'm saying, we don't really have a good ability to forecast exactly what the currency impacts are going to be on either the top or bottom line. And frankly, we spend very little time thinking about the relationship between the two. In terms of the comments on trade inventory reduction, that is largely a China dynamic. I've mentioned in prior calls that our inventory levels were too high, particularly in the wholesale channel in China. And as a result, our pricing was too low, which was driving a bit of distortion and difficulty for our distributors. And so we have made some choices to address that, and that has a short-term volume impact. That's really what that comment was designed to indicate. Relative to senior executive engagement with the investment community, we intend to be fully engaged with the investment community through a combination of quarterly conference calls, investment conferences, meetings here in Cincinnati. David will be on the road frequently as well, interacting with the investment community. And so again, our strategy is one of very high engagement."

As David Taylor said on the press release, we should earlier this morning, we continue to make progress on the transformation we are making to return P&G's results to a balance of strong top line growth, bottom line growth and cash generation. We achieve a significant milestone this quarter in the transformation of the product portfolio with the exit of the Batteries business, we delivered another strong quarter of productivity improvement and cost savings and we increased investments and innovation, advertising and selling capacity to enhance our long-term prospects for faster, sustainable top line growth and value creation. 
We do continue to operate in a challenging and volatile macro environment. Market growth rates on both the volume and value basis have decelerated due mainly to slower growth in developing markets. We entered the year expecting the market to grow close to 3% to 4% globally. We now expect 3%. 
There are more flashpoints across the globe than at anytime in recent memory with significant economic and political instability impacting incomes and consumption in many large and important markets, Russia, the Ukraine, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the balance of the Middle East, Turkey, Nigeria, Argentina, Venezuela, Brazil. We generate more than 10% of our annual sales and profit in these markets. Currencies have weakened across the board since the start of our fiscal year. While dollar has softened a bit recently, we still face up to $1 billion after-tax net earnings impact versus year ago, a $200 million increased since just the start of December. Across 4 years, FX has reduced net earnings by about $4 billion after-tax, nearly 40% of fiscal year 2012 net earnings. 
Against this backdrop, we remain focused on large opportunities in our control, executing what is the largest transformation in our company's history, step changing cost and cash productivity, transforming our portfolio, strengthening our organization and culture and reaccelerating top line growth, with strengthened category business models and innovation plans and where appropriate, improved value equations. This transformation is aimed at delivering balanced top and bottom line growth and leadership value creation. 
I'm going to talk briefly about each of this transformation steps, productivity, portfolio, organization and top line acceleration before getting into the details of the quarter. 
We continue to dramatically improve cost and cash productivity with significant upside still ahead. Our original 5-year cost of goods savings target was $6 billion. We expect to deliver over $7 billion by the end of this year, $1 billion or more above our initial target. 
We've reduced manufacturing enrollment by 15% over the last 3 years. This includes new staffing necessary to support capacity additions. On a same-site basis, manufacturing enrollment is down 20%. We're targeting a 25% to 30% cumulative reduction by the end of fiscal 2017. In February 2012, we announced that we would reduce nonmanufacturing overhead by 10% over 5 years. As of March 31, we've reduced these roles by more than 24%, almost 2.5x the original target. We expect to meet our latest target of 25% to 30% by the end of this year, 1 year ahead of schedule. 
Including divestitures, we'll reduce nonmanufacturing roles by about 35% by the end of fiscal 2017. While reducing nonworking marketing expenditures, cost that do not impact reach, frequency or continuity our advertising and trial generation programs. We were spending $2 billion per year on agency fees. Last year, we reduced the roughly 6,000 agencies we work with by nearly 40% and cut agency and production spending by about $370 million. 
We're aiming for an additional $200 million of agency-related savings this year, reinvesting those savings in advertising and sampling of consumer-preferred products. Net of reinvestments and innovation, selling, media and sampling, productivity has enabled us to deliver constant currency growth and operating profit margin improvement in each of the last 3 fiscal years, driving double-digit constant currency core earnings per share growth in each of those years. 
We're on track to improve gross and operating margins by triple-digit indices, both including and excluding currency impacts again this fiscal year. We're driving productivity up and down the income statement and across the balance sheet. Inventory days are down, payable days are up, balance sheet productivity has enabled us to extend our long track record of very strong adjusted free cash flow productivity, 102% last fiscal year, 101% in Q1, 117% in Q2 and 105% in the quarter we just completed, even as we spend capital to transform our supply chain. 
We continue to maintain our position as one of the strongest cash generators among competitive peers and comparable mega cap companies. We're among the top companies in returning cash to shareholders.
[Audio Gap]
Over that past decade, we have returned more than $118 billion in cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. We said 4 years ago that the we needed to make cost and cash productivity part of our culture, as integral to our culture as innovation. We've made significant progress and we have significant opportunity. Our strong track record and our line of sight to additional opportunity both in form or intent to save as much as another $10 billion in cost over the next 5 years. 
Our supply chain transformation is in its early stages, first, in North America and Europe, then in Latin America and in India, Middle East and Africa. We're in an investment mode now, with savings to start in 3 to 4 years. Our new U.S. Mexico centers are up and running, putting roughly 80% of volume within 24 hours of store shelves. 
We're constructing multi-category manufacturing sites in geographically strategic locations to replace smaller single category sites in less cost-effective locations. We're upgrading and standardized manufacturing platforms to lower costs and facilitate faster innovation. We're employing smart automation and digitization to improve manufacturing productivity, raw material and finished product logistics and demand planning. We have additional opportunity to optimize working capital and further increase the efficiency of our capital spend. After 2 strong years of savings, we'll enter next year still spending $1.5 billion in agency-related marketing costs, still more room to improve. We'll continue to look for efficiencies in working media with better advertising target and earn media campaigns with engaging content. 
As we fully operationalize the new focus 10 [ph] category company, there will undoubtedly be additional opportunities to increase organization efficiency, agility and speed up decision-making. Digitization will continue to enable smart productivity choices. Finally, we'll be working to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our promotion spending. We currently spend about $18 billion in deductions between gross and net sales. We see clear opportunities to improve the effectiveness of the spend for both us and our retail partners and to improve its efficiency. 
So we're targeting up to $10 billion of additional savings over the next 5 years. We expect to reinvest a significant amount of the savings in R&D and product and packaging improvements, sales capacity and in brand awareness and trial building programs to deliver balanced top and bottom line growth and to create value for share owners. 
In addition to transforming our cost structure, we're transforming our portfolio. Over the past 18 months, we have divested, discontinued or consolidated 55 brands, including the completion of the Duracell transaction at the end of February. 
We have 50 more brands in the exit process, including the 41 Beauty brands in the transaction from Cody ph]. The S-4 registration statement for the Beauty transaction was filed last week. We're on track to close the deal in the second half of the calendar year. In total, we'll exit 105 brands and all the content complexity they great. These brands will represent only about 6% of fiscal 2013 profit. Going forward, we're anchoring our portfolio on 10 category-based business units and about 65 brands. These are category where P&G has a leading market positions and where product technologies has deliver performance differences that matter to consumers. These 10 businesses have historically grown faster with higher margins in the balance of the company. 
Within these core businesses, we're focusing our offerings, making smart choices for short, mid- and long-term value creation for going bad businesses, even when these choices create near-term top line pressure. In Mexico, for example, we made a choice to discontinue low-tier, unprofitable and commoditizing toilet paper products in favor of very profitable high-tier, differentiated products. Sales are down 75% but before tax margins have improved by more than 50 basis points from very negative to nicely positive. It will take a few more quarters for the top line drag dissipate and we'll have a solidly value-accretive business going forward. 
In India, we've made a choice to deprioritize several unprofitable lines of business, which negatively impact short-term top line growth rates but will lead longer term to a much more profitable business that will grow strongly. 
The strategic portion of our India business is growing at a high single-digit face. Sales in the portion we're fixing or exiting have been down more than 30%. This top line pain is worth it. We're making significant progress in improving local profit margins, up about 700 basis points. We've gone from losing significant money in India to triple-digit profits in just 2 years. 
We're taking a similar opposing in our Fabric Care product portfolio. Discontinuing product forms, additives, bars, bleaches and tablets and value to detergents have been a drag on profitability and value creation. These choices are causing a top line drag of nearly a 1 point on the global Fabric Care business, but profitability and the long-term attractiveness of the business improves. Combined, these choices are causing about 1 point drag on organic sales growth. We expect this headwind to continue for the balance of the calendar year and then dissipate we annualize more of the impacts. As we come out of this, we'll have stronger top line growth that is worth something on the bottom line. 
We're transforming our organization and culture. We're making many changes that by themselves may seem small and obvious but together, are significant and important. As an example, we made several important changes in how we go-to-market. We eliminated overlapping resources and structures and responsibilities of marketing and sales professionals in the global business units and market development organizations, clarify responsibilities and strengthening accountability. Reflecting this, we change the name of the market development organizations to selling and market operations, small but very important. 
We're increasing staff -- we're increasingly staffing leadership roles in the selling and marketing operations with leaders, who have significant telling experience. We are changing our talent development and assignment planning to drive more mastery and depth. The objective is simple, improve business results by getting and keeping the right people in the right places to develop and apply deep category mastery to winning. 
Consistent with this, we're dedicating sales resources to categories or sectors. In our larger markets, sales resources have greater accountability back to the categories they serve, which is a change. We're aligning incentives at a lower and more specific level of granularity to better match these responsibilities and to increase accountability. 
Another example of the evolution of our thinking under organization is what David talked about at CAGNY. He said, the P&G is fortunate to consistently source and develop strong talent and that we intend to maintain our develop from within approach. But there are times when the best talent may not be inside our organization. Going forward, we're going to look at outside hiring more often than when we needed to fill the best team possible. The bottom line is that we are committed to getting, keeping and growing the right talent in the right place to better drive business results. 
Again, each of these changes may seem small and rather obvious but collectively, they are big and important changes for our organization and culture. A very important area of transformation is reacceleration of top line growth. We expect to make progress in all 10 product categories but we're putting specific emphasis against the 4 largest categories, Baby Care, Fabric Care, Hair Care and Grooming and the 2 largest markets; the U.S. and China. These 4 categories represent over 60% of sales and profit. These 2 countries represent nearly 50% of sales and more than 50% of profit. We're growing our Fabric Care business with consumer-preferred brands and product offerings like our premium performance and premium-priced unit dose detergents and our market-leading and market-expanding scent bead fabric enhancers. We're exiting slower growing, lower-priced, more commoditized product forms which are more difficult to distinguish our products and create value. 
Fabric Care results in the U.S. demonstrates what's possible when we deliver superior value with best-in-class performance at a modest price premium. The U.S. laundry detergent market is continuing to grow behind these efforts, with the category up more than 4 points on a value basis over the last 3-, 6- and 9-month periods. The same is true for fabric enhancers, by the rapid growth of scent beads, the U.S. fabric enhancers category is growing, up more than 6 points on a value basis over the last -- 3, 6- and 9-month periods. Our share is growing, P&G's U.S. laundry detergent and fabric enhancer value share were each up nearly a point in the March quarter. 
We will continue to be the innovation leader in Fabric Care. In North America, we're introducing a new Regiment on Tide and Downy that addresses the odor problems common to athletic wear. 70% of consumers wear athletic gear multiple times each week. The odor defense collection, anchored by innovation on Tide PODS brings a proprietary formula of enzymes and surfactants that break down and remove stubborn soils and residues for a great clean and fresh scent. Paired with the added cleaning power of Tide odor defense rescue longer booster and Downy Fresh Protect odor defense beads, this regiment promises to eliminate odors from the fast-growing market of athleisure clothes people are far beyond the gym. 
Next month, we start our learning market on Tide pure clean liquid detergent in the U.S. Naturals is a large and growing segment in several categories, but Naturals are only about 3% of the laundry category. Unlocking growth in Naturals is about solving the tension between green and clean. People want performance and sustainability. Pure clean provides a cleaning power of Tide, with 65% bio-based ingredients and is produced with 100% renewable wind power electricity in a facility operating with 0 manufacturing waste to landfill. 
We're launching better performing and more profitable new compact liquid detergents in Russia, Turkey, Mexico, Brazil and China. In Russia and Turkey, where we launched superior compact liquid detergents early last calendar year, P&G share of liquid detergents are up 7 points and 14 points, respectively. 
We've increased sampling in new washing machines, a key point category entry and change for consumers. Last fiscal year, we distributed 5 million samples in washing machines globally. This fiscal year, we'll distribute about 17 million. In calendar year 2016, we'll distribute 30 million samples of our best-performing products. 
In U.S. Baby Care, strong innovation, consumer communication, trial programs and robust online presence have led to strong growth for Pampers. Pampers value share of U.S. diapers was up more than 1.5 points last fiscal year and was up 1 point in the March quarter. Pampers latest sweaters and innovation extra absorb channels is off to a good start in the new calendar year with cruiser share up more than point in the last quarter. 
We strengthened investments in brand awareness and trial at the point-of-market entry. 70% of new moms in the U.S. will receive samples of best products through our prenatal baby shower and hospital programs. 
Last fiscal year marked the seventh consecutive year of sales and value share growth for the Luvs brand in the U.S. results have been down so far this year following a significant price reduction taken by our primary competitor. We're taking steps to improve the awareness, trial and consumer value of Luvs. We're increasing equity building advertising, strengthening in-store programs that have product and packaging improvements slated for launch next quarter. 
Baby Care results have been softer in other markets. To address this, we've strengthened our value proposition in several markets and accelerated premium innovation on both taped and pull-on diapers to restore our competitiveness at the top end of the market. We're strengthening our selling resources and programs for baby stores and we're improving point-of-market entry programs to deliver higher awareness and trial of Pampers among new moms. 
In Hair Care, we launched our new conditioner innovation on Pantene in the U.S. last quarter. Pantene's new breakthrough conditioner technology delivers weightless conditioning, addressing the most significant consumer trial barrier in the category. The new conditioner innovation is a consumer blind test winner versus our best competition in North America, China and Japan. 
We continue to strongly support Head & Shoulders, one of our steadiest of and strongest growing brands, delivering over 8% compound average shares -- sales growth over the past 10 years, even with significant currency impacts. Organic sales for Pantene and Head & Shoulders were each up high single digits in the U.S. in the March quarter. 
Gillette has delivered steady growth in international markets so for this fiscal year behind strong innovation, advertising and sampling programs. Gillette is holding our growing value share in each region outside the U.S. The growth in international markets has been offset by soft results in the U.S. To improve our growth and the growth of the market, we're investing in innovation, new user trial and improve consumer value. 
We're expanding our performance advantage at the top end of the market, our most recent cartridge innovation, Gillette Fusion ProShield, launched last quarter. ProShield with lubrication before and the blades, shields against irritation after every shape. Early consumption results in the U.S. have been tracking ahead of plan. We're supporting a broader range of our product ladder from best products, Fusion FlexBall ProShield to Mach 3 to premium price and superior performances disposables, with stronger consumer value communication. We're facing more aggressive competition at lower price points, and we will respond to ensure of our brands remain a superior consumer value. 
We stepped up new trial activities in the U.S. with our 18th birthday sampling program. We've put Fusion ProGlide FlexBall razors in the hands of nearly 80% of young men, over 2 million samples last year, a 33% increase over the prior year level. We've now began sampling the FlexBall razor handle and the ProShield cartridge, our very best combination of shaving technologies. 
We are not standing still in the other categories. We delivered solid organic sales growth in the U.S. this quarter in the Feminine Care, Family Care and Home Care categories. All big and profitable businesses for us. 
P&G continues to be the innovation leader in our U.S. categories. In the IRI innovation pacesetters report just published, P&G had 4 of the top 10 innovations and 6 of the top 13. Product innovations recognized for 2015 sales were Tide simply clean and fresh, Always Discreet, Fusion FlexBall, Venus Swirl, recent stoppable and Tide Plus Alston release. Overall, the U.S., organic sales were up 2%, in line with underlying market growth of our categories. Organic volume was up 3% for the quarter. 
We're making progress in China but there's still more work to do. We narrowed sales declines by half this quarter and expect to improve again next quarter. We recently upgraded our Pampers premium diaper pants to improve fit and softness, and we have new innovations coming soon on midtier pants and premium taped diapers. 
Oral B super-premium toothpaste launched in over 700 stores last quarter reaching roughly a 5% share in those outlets. We'll triple distribution on this item this quarter. Ariel was growing in China following the concentrated liquid detergent launch in January. Gillette Fusion FlexBall has driven male razor system share growth over the past 3-, 6- and 12-month periods. And SK-II continues to deliver very strong growth with sales for the quarter up nearly 20%. 
So some bright spots are emerging but it will take time to get fully back to target growth rates. We're realistic that improvements in top line growth won't happen overnight and they won't happen in a straight line, but they will continue to improve over time. 
Let me move now to the quarter we just completed and to the outlook for the fiscal year.
Organic sales were up 1% for the quarter versus the prior year. The impact from the portfolio of cleanup efforts, I discussed earlier, was about 1 point drag on organic sales growth. All-in sales were down 7%, including a 5 point headwind from foreign exchange, 3 points on the combination of Venezuela deconsolidation and minor brand divestitures. 
Core earnings per share were $0.86, down 3% versus the prior year. Core gross margin increased 270 basis points. Core operating margin increased 300 basis points. This quarter's core earnings per share results included a next FX headwind of approximately $90 million after-tax or $0.03 per share. Comprised of a negative spot rate impact of about $230 million, which was partially offset by $140 million balance sheet revaluation impact in the base period that did not recur this year. 
Venezuela continues to be a difficult market and was also a drag on March quarter results. At the beginning of the fiscal year, we announced our decision to deconsolidate our Venezuelan operations, no longer reporting sales or profits from products locally manufactured and sold in Venezuela. 
We continue to recognize health and profit and product sold to our Venezuelan subsidiaries from non-Venezuelan P&G entities. We highlighted at CAGNY that a disruption in our Venezuelan subsidiaries ability to access dollars to pay for this imports finished products could have a negative impact on our top and bottom line results. 
We've been unable to access U.S. dollars at any size since November. And as a result, reported no sales or profit for Venezuela in the March quarter. This caused a 20 basis points organic sales growth reduction in the quarter. On the bottom line, the total impact Venezuela was $0.05 per share or 6% in terms of core EPS. Assuming this financing constraints continue, the bottom line impact on the year will be up to $0.10 per share or minus 3%. The core effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.2%, up 800 basis points versus last year, a $0.10 per share impact on core earnings per share and 11 percentage point impact on core earnings per share growth. The base period tax rate was unusually low due to geographic mix of earnings and due to audit settlements. And the current period rate was inflated by a valuation allowance against net operating loss carryforwards. 
These 2 items account for about 6 points of the 8-point change in the tax rate. These 3 impacts, FX, Venezuela and tax were a combined core earnings per share growth headwind of 20% this quarter. 
On an all-in GAAP basis, earnings per share were $0.97 for the quarter, up 29% versus the prior year. We generated $2.5 billion in free cash flow, yielding 105% adjusted free cash flow productivity. We returned approximately $2.9 billion to shareholders this quarter through a combination of $1.9 billion in dividends and $1 billion of share repurchase. 
In addition, we received approximately $4.2 billion of stock through the Duracell transaction. Earlier this month, we increased the dividend 1%, making this the 60th consecutive year the company has increase the dividend. That side of the dividend increase reflects FX headwinds, the cash impacts from streamlining the strengthening the business unit portfolio and our plans to increase investments in the business to accelerate top line growth. 
Moving to guidance, our outlook for the fiscal year reflects 4 large factors driving lower earnings in the fourth quarter. First, lower nonoperating income. We expect about $100 million less in the fourth quarter this year versus last year. Second, tax, the Q4 tax rate will likely be, again, about 800 basis points higher than last year due top the geographic earnings mix and audit settlement benefit in the base period. Third, investment levels. We'll have a significant increase in advertising expense couple with continued reinvestment in R&D and selling capabilities. 
Fourth, FX, we'll continue to see significant spot rate impacts on both the top and bottom line in Q4 and unlike the last 2 quarters, we'll not have offsets from base period balance sheet revaluation changes. 
Combined, we expect these 4 factors to lower Q4 net earnings by more than $800 million and reduce core earnings per share by more than 32% versus the prior year. 
For the fiscal year, we're maintaining our outlook for organic sales growth of in-line to up low single digits versus fiscal 2015. As I mentioned, our outlook assumes we'll no longer benefit from sales of finished product to our deconsolidated subsidiaries in Venezuela. This will be roughly 30 basis points drag on Q4 organic sales growth. 
In addition, the roughly 1 point drag from the core portfolio cleanup will continue into Q4. We expect FX will have a 6 to 7 percentage point impact on all-in sales growth for the fiscal year. Also, the combined impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation and minor brand divestiture will have a 2 to 3 percentage point drag on all-in sales growth. Taken together, we expect all-in sales to be down high single digits versus fiscal 2015. 
We contineu to expect constant currency core earnings per share growth in the mid-single-digits for the year. Foreign exchange will reduce net earnings been approximately $1 billion versus the prior year, resulting in 9 percentage points or $0.35 per share impact on core earnings per share growth for the year. With 1 quarter left in the year, we're tightening and improving our core earnings per share guidance range from down 3 to 8 to down 3 to 6, which puts the midpoint of the range at $3.59 per share was last year core earnings per share of $3.76. Fiscal year earnings per share guidance includes headwinds of 10 percentage points from the combined impacts of Beauty deal expenses, Venezuela deconsolidation, lower nonoperating income and a higher tax rate. 
Adjusting for these items, our guidance translates to modest core earnings per share growth with meaningful growth, excluding foreign exchange. We expect the core effective tax rate to be 25% or higher for fiscal 2016, more than 4 points higher than last year, roughly a 6-point headwind from core earnings per share growth. We're raising our fiscal year outlook for free cash flow to 100% or more of adjusted net earnings. We expect to reduce outstanding shares at a value of over $8 billion through a combination of direct share repurchases and the shares that were exchanged in the Duracell transaction. In addition, we expect dividend payments of more than $7 billion. In total, $15 billion to $16 billion in dividend payments, share exchanges and share repurchases. 
We expect all-in GAAP earnings per share to be up in the range of 46% to 51%. 
Moving briefly to 2017. David is going to join me on our next call scheduled for Tuesday, August 2, to discuss our plans and outlook for fiscal 2017. We're currently in the early planning stages for next year and we'll give guidance on the next call, but there are a few things to keep in mind as you review your SMS between now and then. We expect improvements in organic sales growth, though core portfolio cleanup will still be a headwind. Venezuela will be a drag in the first 2 quarters of the year. If currency exchange rates hold steady through next fiscal year, FX should be much more manageable than it's been for the past few years but we'll still have a headwind of both the top and bottom line particularly in the first 2 quarters. Likewise, if commodity costs hold every single levels, we'll continue to see a modest tailwind in the first half or so next fiscal year. 
We'll be increasing investment in R&D, in product and packaging programs and sales capacity and brand awareness and trial building programs to accelerate top line growth in a responsible and sustainable way. We'll defend the relevant consumer value of our brands and invest to address value gaps if and when they emerge. We'll do everything we can from a productivity standpoint and we'll continue delivering on our commitment of cash return to shareholders. 
There'll be an EPS benefit from shares eliminated via with our category exits, though the exact amount of which will depend on when we close -- when we actually close the Coty transaction. We'll obviously give more specifics on all of this in our next call but we thought it might be helpful to offer you this early thoughts. 
To sum up, we continue to make progress on returning P&G to balance top and bottom line growth. We're nearing the completion of the portfolio transformation. We upgraded and are sustaining strong cost savings and cash productivity momentum. We're strengthening the organization and culture and we're investing to accelerate top line growth. 
That concludes our prepared remarks for this morning. As a reminder, business segment information is provided in our press release and will be available on slides, which we posted on our website, www.pg.com, following the call. 
Now I'll be happy to take your questions."

You're coming back strong with 4 questions and 1. But it's great to have you back. In terms of the advertising rates, we were up about, I think, 130 basis points in the quarter. We expect to be up about 140 basis points on the second half. So there'll be some sequential strength in that comparison as we move forward. I tried to say 8 or 9x in our prepared remarks that we will be investing to grow our top line. We'll be funding that with productivity and bringing the bottom line with it. There has not been a significant increase in the percentage of our business being sold on promotions nor has there been a significant increasing the depth of those promotions. We have in several markets used to [indiscernible] as a way adjust pricing back to competitive levels where we got to more of a price increase than our competitors ultimately did. So you see that impact and I would just think about price adjustment and value gap closer to that as being the explanation for the change in the price component of the top line. And as for fourth quarter guidance, we just provided it. It is what it is. And I think that the range -- you rightly point out is a wide one. That's the reality of the world that we're operating in, with very significant volatility, whether it's input cost, FX, geopolitical and geoeconomic dynamics and the consumer impacts of things like oil prices. And we're going to be living with that volatility for the foreseeable future."

Yes, it has increased over time, driven in part by expansion of modern retailers on a global basis brought that business model with them to other parts of the world that previously were, for example, largely distributor and wholesaler markets. There is significant opportunity within that bucket to expand. The first and foremost increased its effectiveness, ensuring that we were spending it in ways that drive category growth on a sustainable basis as opposed to short-term loading, for example. Shifting, spending to our best product offerings to increase the trial and repurchase rate of those items with consumers. Again, not driving so much the -- in some cases, the lower end of the portfolio. The vehicles that we used to communicate in-store and how those are constructed and utilized in conjunction with our retail partners. So there are just massive opportunities to improve the effectiveness of that spend as we work to reaccelerate our top line growth. There are also efficiency opportunities and this is one of those unique and wonderful costs if there is such a thing, where if you're able to reduce it, benefits both the top line and the bottom line. But we'll be very judicious as we do that. Again, really you want it where we have opportunities to shift that from ineffective spend to effective spend is the primary activity in this space.

Frankly, I think the scoreboard you have is organic growth, right? And so I think that's obviously really important. And then really quickly just a housekeeping item, I know you're not -- you don't have the exact numbers but can you give us like a rough cut at what you think the earnings upside is from both of the Duracell and the Coty divestitures?"

First and foremost, we need to accelerate our top line growth rate, and there's no debate about that. The reason that we've talked a little bit about not following share out the window, we can be gaining shares and categories that are declining and that's not going to grow our top line. What we need to be doing as innovation leaders in our categories is getting the market growing through that innovation and gaining the share of that growth. That's exactly what we're doing in Fabric Care on the U.S. for example, and has taken awhile but it's worked extremely well. And the category is growing 4%, we're getting a disproportionate part of that growth and that's what we are looking to do across our product categories. So it's bringing innovation to the market which grows categories for the industry, for our retail partners and allows us to gain a little bit of share in the process. And look, we need to be growing at the rate of the market or better. But market growth is an important element of that in terms of how attractive that growth ultimately ends up being. So it's kind of -- it's all of the above. In terms of earnings per share upside from Duracell and Coty, I think we've talked to before that we plan to be nondilutive from day 1. We've been working for 2 years in the stranded overheads that are going to be created as a result of this and we also expect the portfolio that we're going to be left with is a healthier, stronger portfolio that the will grow and will grow more profitably."

For perspective, we've been growing constant currency earnings in developing markets well ahead of constant currency sales. Going back 3 years ago, 2x; the year after that, 4x; last year, 8x; this year, 8x. And that reflects the things that you're describing in terms of the supply chain. It also reflects the overall productivity program and its benefits in the developing market. And it reflects a lot of work that we've been doing on our portfolio, as I described in our earlier commentary. The biggest driver of the 3 really nice mark or profit improvement in India has been that portfolio work. So it's all of that. In terms of volume and the impact that it's had on our fixed cost rates, if you will, in the supply chain, it's definitely had an impact. The good news is that we're right in the middle of the supply transformation and that's going to be a multi geography in nature. So that gives us an opportunity where we need to, to rationalize that fixed cost infrastructure. At the same time, hopefully, the main benefit going forward in terms of that is reacceleration of volume and sales."

I know you said your business is showing some signs of improvement down not as much given some of the premium-priced innovations you're doing. But how confident are you in the strategy of pursuing what sounds like almost exclusively premium-priced innovation because it does sound like some of the other competitors out there that there's also pricing competition going on in some of your big markets. If you can talk about China more broadly and the strategy there, that would be great. And then my second question has to do with your comment that, I think, we've heard. I mean I think we heard it from Bob or Donald a few years ago, the P&G was increasingly open to hiring from the outside and I know we've had certain partnerships in R&D stuff but in terms of actual physical new hires outside of kind of legal and tax and HR, I can't think of anybody on the business side who you actually have from outside. So given that you've been saying that for so long, are there any particular areas where you think that, that is a priority? Is it marketing? Is it something in specific businesses? And why say it for so many years and then not have it actually happen?"

That big middle of the portfolio is very important, and we are not losing site of that. We have fantastic positions in that portion of the market, which we intend to maintain to build. But we also want to take advantage of the higher growth portion of the market, which is currently the premium tiers, 50% of consumption is currently in those tiers across our categories. They're growing at high single to double-digit rates, and we obviously want to participate in that, not only for the sales and volume benefit but also for the equity halo that it provides to our brands. So it is clearly an end strategy, not an overall strategy. Your question on our approach to bringing in talent from outside the organization. I think David was very clear about that at CAGNY that we are going to maintain broadly or promote from within and develop from within our support program. But we are going to put the right people, the best people in jobs across the organization. And when that requires that we go outside we'll do that. We have, for example, hired a number of experienced salespeople. I mentioned building our sales capacity as we're dedicating selling organizations to categories and sectors, there are cases where we can find more experience outside the company, people who had 10 years experience in a category where we may be underrepresented. And that we're bringing those people in. The whole area of digital marketing and media, where we need resources either partnering with agencies will have that capability in some cases, we're bringing that in. I don't think that's limited to any portion of the organization. That includes line management and -- but we're going to approach these deliberately, having someone come in just for the sake of having them come in and being able to say that we are making progress there is obviously not something that interests us very much. But having the right people in the right jobs, bringing mastery to help us win across the board, we're definitely committed to."

There's still situations where we're going to be taking additional pricing, where we feel that, that will be matched. So it will continue to be dynamic but a little bit less going forward. On the volume piece, I certainly don't have a crystal ball but if I look at what happened historically, that volume has come back over time. And sometimes it depends on the market. Volume reacceleration in markets like in Latin America has been fairly quick. In other markets, for example, Russia, the last crisis, it took us 3 years to get back from a volume standpoint.

So from a -- if I just look at the difference between value growth and volume growth in the markets to get at your question of how much of it is pricing. In developed markets, if I just look over the past year, basically, volume growth has actually accelerated a little bit going from 0 to 1. Value growth is unchanged at about 1. In developing markets, value growth has gone from 9 to 6, volume growth has gone from 2 to 1. So I think with those, that set of numbers you can put the picture together that you are looking to put together. In terms of these savings target and the semantics around up 2, that's -- those are the words we've used since we first start talking about this back at CAGNY. And that doesn't imply a cap. There's no reason to cap but it does imply of range of outcomes. And last time we said $10 billion, we overdeliver that. So again, there was no cap. I think $10 billion is a good number to shoot for, and I'm sure we'll get some somewhere close to that, if not there. But you may recall conversations that some of us we're having 4 years ago on this topic and there was a lot of concern about whether we would actually get to $10 billion and I say again, that's the right number to shoot for. And if we only get to $9 billion, I'm going to be pretty happy and I look at it the same way this time around. So really no change there. On the supply chain transformation, that particular portion of the savings will be -- will come later as we've indicated since we started talking about supply chain transformation. I wouldn't take that as indicative of the entire program. Last time around, it was pretty evenly paced across the fiscal year is, that's not the decided of God that's just the without her guidance see a reason for it to fall significantly different than that this time. Remember though and I know that you notice, we're going to be reinvesting a lot of these savings NRO the basis, more of that investment acceleration, if you will, we'll look her in the early years and then as that -- it gets fully in place, it will have a less year-over-year impact."

The second question, is Jon, you jumped a few years ago that you wouldn't want to be CFO of P&G at a time when the dividend didn't grow. And, I think, we are all collectively glad that it did grow. But can you give us some more color on the 1% dividend increase? I mean, shareholders have been waiting around for you guys for quite some time. You've had some very challenging times. The macros have been very challenging other than your peer group suggest that they increase their dividend a little bit more aggressively than yours. And I get your dividend yield and I get your payout ratio but what would in the end be the true cost of a slight ratings downgrade here to reward  shareholders a little bit more aggressively?"

So I'm not sure what message has been received. In terms of the message we're providing, it's very much the one you described to David just a minute ago, which is continued progress in both of the top and bottom line as well as our cash flow. And obviously, we want to accelerate all of that as quickly as we're able but do it in a sustainable responsible way. And as I indicated, we're just putting our plans together for next year and we'll see what the month of progress we make. Our competitors don't sit still. Markets are volatile. And so that's where the not straight line comment comes in. I think that's a reflection of reality. The Coty benefit in terms of the share retirement will depend on exactly when those shares get retired, but there should definitely be a benefit associated with. And we view that as part of the overall equation. In terms of the dividend increase, as you know, we're very committed to the principle of cash return to shareholders. Over the last 10 years, as I mentioned earlier, we've returned $118 billion. This year between dividends and share repurchases, share exchange we effectively returned $15 billion to $16 billion. There's not a lot of juice, if you will, to the amount of cash available from a borrowing standpoint between our current credit rating and 1 or 2 notches down. So to do that, to the credit rating for a small amount of additional dividend increases is not something that made a lot of sense to us. We were very happy to increase the dividend. We remain committed to cash return to shareholders. But we also need to reflect reality in our dividend planning, significant FX headwinds, we are creating a smaller company and our earnings per share are below a year ago, and we have a responsibility there as you will appreciate as well. So it's a balancing of those 2 things. I completely get and understand the question. It's a very fair one. But that's where we met it out. I leave it there. Thank you, everybody for your questions this morning. We'll be available for the balance of the week to talk to any of these with you.

We delivered another strong quarter of productivity improvement and cost savings and we increased investments in innovation, advertising and selling capacity to enhance our long-term prospects for faster, sustainable top line growth and value creation. 
We do continue to operate in a challenging and volatile macro environment. Market growth rates on both the volume and value basis have decelerated due mainly to slower growth in developing markets. We entered the year expecting the market to grow close to 3% to 4% globally. We now expect 3%. 
There are more flashpoints across the globe than at any time in recent memory with significant economic and political instability impacting incomes and consumption in many large and important markets, Russia, the Ukraine, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the balance of the Middle East, Turkey, Nigeria, Argentina, Venezuela, Brazil. We generate more than 10% of our annual sales and profit in these markets. Currencies have weakened across the board since the start of our fiscal year. While the dollar has softened a bit recently, we still face up to $1 billion after tax net earnings impact versus year ago, a $200 million increase since just the start of December. Across 4 years, FX has reduced net earnings by about $4 billion after tax, nearly 40% of fiscal year 2012 net earnings. 
Against this backdrop, we remain focused on large opportunities in our control, executing what is the largest transformation in our company's history, step changing cost and cash productivity, transforming our portfolio, strengthening our organization and culture and reaccelerating top line growth with strengthened category business models and innovation plans and, where appropriate, improved value equations. This transformation is aimed at delivering balanced top and bottom line growth and leadership value creation. 
I'm going to talk briefly about each of these transformation steps, productivity, portfolio, organization and top line reacceleration before getting into the details of the quarter. 
We continued to dramatically improve cost and cash productivity with significant upside still ahead. Our original 5-year cost of goods savings target was $6 billion. We expect to deliver over $7 billion by the end of this year, $1 billion or more above our initial target. 
We've reduced manufacturing enrollment by 15% over the last 3 years. This includes new staffing necessary to support capacity additions. On a same-site basis, manufacturing enrollment is down 20%. We're targeting a 25% to 30% cumulative reduction by the end of fiscal 2017. In February 2012, we announced that we would reduce nonmanufacturing overhead by 10% over 5 years. As of March 31, we've reduced these roles by more than 24%, almost 2.5x the original target. We expect to meet our latest target of 25% to 30% by the end of this year, 1 year ahead of schedule. 
Including divestitures, we'll reduce nonmanufacturing roles by about 35% by the end of fiscal 2017. We're reducing nonworking marketing expenditures, costs that do not impact reach, frequency or continuity of our advertising and trial generation programs. We were spending $2 billion per year on agency fees. Last year, we reduced the roughly 6,000 agencies we work with by nearly 40% and cut agency and production spending by about $370 million. 
We're aiming for an additional $200 million of agency-related savings this year, reinvesting those savings in advertising and sampling of consumer-preferred products. Net of reinvestments and innovation, selling, media and sampling, productivity has enabled us to deliver constant-currency growth and operating profit margin improvement in each of the last 3 fiscal years, driving double-digit constant-currency core earnings per share growth in each of those years. 
We're on track to improve gross and operating margins by triple-digit indices, both including and excluding currency impacts again this fiscal year. We're driving productivity up and down the income statement and across the balance sheet. Inventory days are down, payable days are up, balance sheet productivity has enabled us to extend our long track record of very strong adjusted free cash flow productivity, 102% last fiscal year, 101% in Q1, 117% in Q2 and 105% in the quarter we just completed, even as we spend capital to transform our supply chain. 
We continued to maintain our position as one of the strongest cash generators among competitive peers and comparable mega-cap companies. We're among the top companies in returning cash to shareholders.    Over the past decade, we have returned more than $118 billion in cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchase. We said 4 years ago that we needed to make cost and cash productivity part of our culture, as integral to our culture as innovation. We've made significant progress and we have significant opportunity. Our strong track record and our line of sight to additional opportunity both in form or intent to save as much as another $10 billion in cost over the next 5 years. 
Our supply chain transformation is in its early stages, first, in North America and Europe, then in Latin America and in India, Middle East and Africa. We're in an investment mode now, with savings to start in 3 to 4 years. Our new U.S. mixing centers are up and running, putting roughly 80% of volume within 24 hours of store shelves. 
We're constructing multi-category manufacturing sites in geographically strategic locations to replace smaller single category sites in less cost-effective locations. We're upgrading and standardized manufacturing platforms to lower costs and facilitate faster innovation. We're employing smart automation and digitization to improve manufacturing productivity, raw material and finished product logistics and demand planning. We have additional opportunity to optimize working capital and further increase the efficiency of our capital spend. After 2 strong years of savings, we'll enter next year still spending $1.5 billion in agency-related marketing costs, still more room to improve. We'll continue to look for efficiencies in working media with better advertising targeting and earned media campaigns with engaging content. 
As we fully operationalize the new focused 10-category [ph] company, there will undoubtedly be additional opportunities to increase organization efficiency, agility and speed of decision-making. Digitization will continue to enable smart productivity choices. Finally, we'll be working to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our promotion spending. We currently spend about $18 billion in deductions between gross and net sales. We see clear opportunities to improve the effectiveness of the spend for both us and our retail partners and to improve its efficiency. 
So we're targeting up to $10 billion of additional savings over the next 5 years. We expect to reinvest a significant amount of the savings in R&D and product and packaging improvements, sales capacity and in brand awareness and trial building programs to deliver balanced top and bottom line growth and to create value for share owners. 
In addition to transforming our cost structure, we're transforming our portfolio. Over the past 18 months, we have divested, discontinued or consolidated 55 brands, including the completion of the Duracell transaction at the end of February. 
We have 50 more brands in the exit process, including the 41 Beauty brands in the transaction with Coty. The S-4 registration statement for the Beauty transaction was filed last week. We're on track to close the deal in the second half of the calendar year. In total, we'll exit 105 brands and all the complexity they create. These brands represent only about 6% of fiscal 2013 profit. Going forward, we're anchoring our portfolio on 10 category-based business units and about 65 brands. These are categories where P&G has leading market positions and where product technologies deliver performance differences that matter to consumers. These 10 businesses have historically grown faster with higher margins in the balance of the company. 
Within these core businesses, we're focusing our offerings, making smart choices for short, mid- and long-term value creation, foregoing bad businesses, even when these choices create near-term top line pressure. In Mexico, for example, we made a choice to discontinue low-tier unprofitable and commoditizing toilet paper products in favor of very profitable high-tier differentiated products. Sales are down 75% but before tax margins have improved by more than 50 basis points from very negative to nicely positive. It will take a few more quarters for the top line drag to dissipate and we'll have a solidly value-accretive business going forward. 
In India, we've made a choice to deprioritize several unprofitable lines of business, which negatively impact short-term top line growth rates but will lead longer term to a much more profitable business that will grow strongly. 
The strategic portion of our India business is growing at a high single-digit pace. Sales in the portion we're fixing or exiting have been down more than 30%. This top line pain is worth it. We're making significant progress in improving local profit margins, up about 700 basis points. We've gone from losing significant money in India to triple-digit profits in just 2 years. 
We're taking a similar approach in our Fabric Care product portfolio. Discontinuing product forms, additives, bars, bleaches and tablets and value-tier detergents that have been a drag on profitability and value creation. These choices are causing a top line drag of nearly a 1 point on the global Fabric Care business, but profitability and the long-term attractiveness of the business improves. Combined, these choices are causing about a 1 point drag on organic sales growth. We expect this headwind to continue for the balance of the calendar year and then dissipate as annualize more of the impacts. As we come out of this, we'll have stronger top line growth that is worth something on the bottom line. 
We're transforming our organization and culture. We're making many changes that by themselves may seem small and obvious but together are significant and important. As an example, we've made several important changes in how we go to market. We eliminated overlapping resources and duplicative structures and responsibilities of marketing and sales professionals in the global business units and market development organizations, clarifying responsibilities and strengthening accountability. Reflecting this, we changed the name of the market development organizations to selling and market operations, small but very important. 
We're increasing staff -- we're increasingly staffing leadership roles in the selling and marketing operations with leaders who have significant telling experience. We're changing our talent development and assignment planning to drive more mastery and depth. The objective is simple: improve business results by getting and keeping the right people in the right places to develop and apply deep category mastery to winning. 
Consistent with this, we're dedicating sales resources to categories or sectors. In our larger markets, sales resources have greater accountability back to the categories they serve, which is a change. We're aligning incentives at a lower and more specific level of granularity to better match these responsibilities and to increase accountability. 
Another example of the evolution of our thinking on the organization is what David talked about at CAGNY. He said that P&G is fortunate to consistently source and develop strong talent and that we intend to maintain our develop-from-within approach. But there are times when the best talent for a role may not be inside our organization. Going forward, we're going to look at outside hiring more often than -- often when we need it to field the best team possible. The bottom line is that we're committed to getting, keeping and growing the right talent in the right place to better drive business results. 
Again, each of these changes may seem small and rather obvious but collectively they are big and important changes for our organization and culture. A very important area of transformation is reacceleration of top line growth. We expect to make progress in all 10 product categories, but we're putting specific emphasis against the 4 largest categories: Baby Care, Fabric Care, Hair Care and Grooming; and the 2 largest markets: the U.S. and China. These 4 categories represent over 60% of sales and profit. These 2 countries represent nearly 50% of sales and more than 50% of profit. We're growing our Fabric Care business with consumer-preferred brands and product offerings like our premium performance and premium-priced unit dose detergents and our market-leading and market-expanding scent bead fabric enhancers. We're exiting slower-growing, lower-priced, more commoditized product forms where it's more difficult to distinguish our products and create value. 
Fabric Care results in the U.S. demonstrates what's possible when we deliver superior value with best-in-class performance at a modest price premium. The U.S. laundry detergent market is continuing to grow behind these efforts, with the category up more than 4 points on a value basis over the last 3-, 6- and 9-month periods. The same is true for fabric enhancers. Spurred by the rapid growth of scent beads, the U.S. fabric enhancers category is growing, up more than 6 points on a value basis over the last 3-, 6- and 9-month periods. Our share is growing. P&G's U.S. laundry detergent and fabric enhancer value shares were each up nearly 1 point in the March quarter. 
We will continue to be the innovation leader in Fabric Care. In North America, we're introducing a new regimen on Tide and Downy that addresses the odor problems common to athletic wear. 70% of consumers wear athletic gear multiple times each week. The odor defense collection, anchored by innovation on Tide PODS brings a proprietary formula of enzymes and surfactants that break down and remove stubborn soils and residues for a great clean and fresh scent. Paired with the added cleaning power of Tide Odor Defense Rescue laundry booster and Downy Fresh Protect odor defense beads, this regimen promises to eliminate odors from the fast-growing market of athleisure clothes people are wearing far beyond the gym. 
Next month, we start our learning market on Tide Pure Clean liquid detergent in the U.S. Naturals is a large and growing segment in several categories, but Naturals are only about 3% of the laundry category. Unlocking growth in Naturals is about solving the tension between green and clean. People want performance and sustainability. Pure Clean provides a cleaning power of Tide with 65% bio-based ingredients and is produced with 100% renewable wind power electricity in a facility operating with 0 manufacturing waste to landfill. 
We're launching better performing and more profitable new compact liquid detergents in Russia, Turkey, Mexico, Brazil and China. In Russia and Turkey, where we launched superior compact liquid detergents early last calendar year, P&G share of liquid detergents are up 7 points and 14 points, respectively. 
We've increased sampling in new washing machines, a key point of category entry and change for consumers. Last fiscal year, we distributed 5 million samples in washing machines globally. This fiscal year, we'll distribute about 17 million. In calendar year 2016, we'll distribute 30 million samples of our best-performing products. 
In U.S. Baby Care, strong innovation, consumer communication, trial programs and a robust online presence have led to strong growth for Pampers. Pampers value share of U.S. diapers was up more than 1.5 points last fiscal year and was up 1 point in the March quarter. Pampers latest Swaddlers and Cruisers innovation Extra Absorb Channels is off to a good start in the new calendar year with Swaddlers and Cruisers share up more than 1 point in the last quarter. 
We strengthened investments in brand awareness and trial at the point-of-market entry. 70% of new moms in the U.S. will receive samples of our best products through our prenatal baby shower and hospital programs. 
Last fiscal year marked the seventh consecutive year of sales and value share growth for the Luvs brand in the U.S.; however, results have been down so far this year following a significant price reduction taken by our primary competitor. We're taking steps to improve the awareness, trial and consumer value of Luvs. We're increasing equity-building advertising, strengthening in-store programs that have product and packaging improvements slated for launch next quarter. 
Baby Care results have been softer in other markets. To address this, we've strengthened our value proposition in several markets and accelerated premium innovation on both taped and pull-on diapers to restore our competitiveness at the top end of the market. We're strengthening our selling resources and programs for baby stores and we're improving our point-of-market entry programs to deliver higher awareness and trial of Pampers among new moms. 
In Hair Care, we launched our new conditioner innovation on Pantene in the U.S. last quarter. Pantene's new breakthrough conditioner technology delivers weightless conditioning, addressing the most significant consumer trial barrier in the category. The new conditioner innovation is a consumer blind test winner versus our best competition in North America, China and Japan. 
We continue to strongly support Head & Shoulders, one of our steadiest and strongest growing brands, delivering over 8% compound average shares -- excuse me, sales growth over the past 10 years, even with significant currency impacts. Organic sales for Pantene and Head & Shoulders were each up high single digits in the U.S. in the March quarter. 
Gillette has delivered steady growth in international markets so far this fiscal year behind strong innovation, advertising and sampling programs. Gillette is holding our growing value share in each region outside the U.S. The growth in international markets has been offset by soft results in the U.S. To improve our growth and the growth of the market, we're investing in innovation, new user trial and improved consumer value. 
We're expanding our performance advantage at the top end of the market. Our most recent cartridge innovation, Gillette Fusion ProShield, launched last quarter, ProShield with lubrication before and after the blades, shields against irritation during every shave. Early consumption results in the U.S. have been tracking ahead of plan. We're supporting a broader range of our product ladder from our best product, Fusion FlexBall ProShield, to MACH3 to premium price and superior performance disposables, with stronger consumer value communication. We're facing more aggressive competition at lower price points, and we will respond to ensure our brands remain a superior consumer value. 
We've stepped up new trial activities in the U.S. with our 18th birthday sampling program. We've put Fusion ProGlide FlexBall razors in the hands of nearly 80% of young men, over 2 million samples last year, a 33% increase over the prior year level. We've now began sampling the FlexBall razor handle and the ProShield cartridge, our very best combination of shaving technologies. 
We're not standing still in the other categories. We delivered solid organic sales growth in the U.S. this quarter in the Feminine Care, Family Care and Home Care categories, all big and profitable businesses for us. 
P&G continues to be the innovation leader in our U.S. categories. In the IRI Innovation Pacesetters Report just published, P&G had 4 of the top 10 innovations and 6 of the top 13. Top innovations recognized for 2015 sales were Tide Simply Clean & Fresh, Always Discreet, Fusion ProGlide FlexBall, Venus Swirl, Febreze Unstopables and Tide Plus Ultra Stain Release. Overall, in the U.S., organic sales were up 2%, in line with underlying market growth of our categories. Organic volume was up 3% for the quarter. 
We're making progress in China, but there's still more work to do. We narrowed sales declines by half this quarter and expect to improve again next quarter. We recently upgraded our Pampers Premium diaper pants to improve fit and softness, and we have new innovations coming soon on mid-tier pants and premium taped diapers. 
Oral-B super-premium toothpaste, launched in over 700 stores last quarter, reaching roughly a 5% share in those outlets. We'll triple distribution on this item this quarter. Ariel was growing in China following the concentrated liquid detergent launch in January. Gillette Fusion FlexBall has driven male razor system share growth over the past 3-, 6- and 12-month periods. And SK-II continues to deliver very strong growth, with sales for the quarter up nearly 20%. 
So some bright spots are emerging, but it will take time to get fully back to target growth rates. We're realistic that improvements in top line growth won't happen overnight and they won't happen in a straight line, but they will continue to improve over time. 
Let me move now to the quarter we've just completed and to the outlook for the fiscal year.
Organic sales were up 1% for the quarter versus the prior year. The impact from the portfolio cleanup efforts I discussed earlier was about a 1 point drag on organic sales growth. All-in sales were down 7%, including a 5 point headwind from foreign exchange, 3 points from the combination of Venezuela deconsolidation and minor brand divestitures. 
Core earnings per share were $0.86, down 3% versus the prior year. Core gross margin increased 270 basis points. Core operating margin increased 300 basis points. This quarter's core earnings per share results included a next FX headwind of approximately $90 million after tax or $0.03 per share. Comprised of a negative spot rate impact of about $230 million, which was partially offset by $140 million balance sheet revaluation impact in the base period that did not recur this year. 
Venezuela continues to be a difficult market and was also a drag on March quarter results. At the beginning of the fiscal year, we announced our decision to deconsolidate our Venezuelan operations, no longer reporting sales or profits from products locally manufactured and sold in Venezuela. 
We continue to recognize health and profit and product sold to our Venezuelan subsidiaries from non-Venezuelan P&G entities. We've highlighted at CAGNY that a disruption in our Venezuelan subsidiaries ability to access dollars to pay for these imports of finished products could have a negative impact on our top and bottom line results. 
We've been unable to access U.S. dollars at any size since November. And as a result, reported no sales or profit for Venezuela in the March quarter. This caused a 20 basis point organic sales growth reduction in the quarter. On the bottom line, the total impact of Venezuela was $0.05 per share or 6% in terms of core EPS. Assuming this financing constraints continue, the bottom line impact on the year will be up to $0.10 per share or minus 3%. The core effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.2%, up 800 basis points versus last year, a $0.10 per share impact on core earnings per share and 11 percentage point impact on core earnings per share growth. The base period tax rate was unusually low due to the geographic mix of earnings and due to audit settlements. And the current period rate was inflated by a valuation allowance against net operating loss carryforwards. 
These 2 items account for about 6 points of the 8-point change in the tax rate. These 3 impacts, FX, Venezuela and tax were a combined core earnings per share growth headwind of 20% this quarter. 
On an all-in GAAP basis, earnings per share were $0.97 for the quarter, up 29% versus the prior year. We generated $2.5 billion in free cash flow, yielding 105% adjusted free cash flow productivity. We returned approximately $2.9 billion to shareholders this quarter through a combination of $1.9 billion in dividends and $1 billion of share repurchase. 
In addition, we received approximately $4.2 billion of stock through the Duracell transaction. Earlier this month, we increased the dividend 1%, making this the 60th consecutive year the company has increased the dividend. The size of the dividend increase reflects FX headwinds, the cash impacts from streamlining the strengthening of the business unit portfolio and our plans to increase investments in the business to accelerate top line growth. 
Moving to guidance, our outlook for the fiscal year reflects 4 large factors driving lower earnings in the fourth quarter. First, lower nonoperating income. We expect about $100 million less in the fourth quarter this year versus last year. Second, tax. The Q4 tax rate will likely be, again, about 800 basis points higher than last year due to the geographic earnings mix and audit settlement benefits in the base period. Third, investment levels. We'll have a significant increase in advertising expense, coupled with continued reinvestment in R&D and selling capabilities. 
Fourth, FX. We'll continue to see significant spot rate impacts on both the top and bottom line in Q4, and unlike the last 2 quarters, will not have offsets from base period balance sheet revaluation changes. Combined, we expect these 4 factors to lower Q4 net earnings by more than $800 million and reduce core earnings per share by more than 32% versus the prior year. 
For the fiscal year, we're maintaining our outlook for organic sales growth of in line to up low single digits versus fiscal 2015. As I mentioned, our outlook assumes we'll no longer benefit from sales of finished product to our deconsolidated subsidiaries in Venezuela. This would be roughly a 30 basis point drag on Q4 organic sales growth. 
In addition, the roughly 1 point drag from the core portfolio cleanup will continue into Q4. We expect FX will have a 6 to 7 percentage point impact on all-in sales growth for the fiscal year. Also, the combined impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation and minor brand divestitures will have a 2 to 3 percentage point drag on all-in sales growth. Taken together, we expect all-in sales would be down high single digits versus fiscal 2015. 
We continue to expect constant-currency core earnings per share growth in the mid-single-digits for the year. Foreign exchange will reduce net earnings by approximately $1 billion versus the prior year, resulting in a 9 percentage point or $0.35 per share impact on core earnings per share growth for the year. With 1 quarter left in the year, we're tightening and improving our core earnings per share guidance range from down 3% to 8% to down 3% to 6%, which puts the midpoint of the range at $3.59 per share versus last year's core earnings per share of $3.76. Fiscal year earnings per share guidance includes headwinds of 10 percentage points from the combined impacts of Beauty deal expenses, Venezuela deconsolidation, lower nonoperating income and a higher tax rate. 
Adjusting for these items, our guidance translates to modest core earnings per share growth with meaningful growth, excluding foreign exchange. We expect the core effective tax rate to be 25% or higher for fiscal 2016, more than 4 points higher than last year, roughly a 6-point headwind from core earnings per share growth. We're raising our fiscal year outlook for free cash flow to 100% or more of adjusted net earnings. We expect to reduce outstanding shares at a value of over $8 billion through a combination of direct share repurchases and the shares that were exchanged in the Duracell transaction. In addition, we expect dividend payments of more than $7 billion. In total, $15 billion to $16 billion in dividend payments, share exchanges and share repurchases. We expect all-in GAAP earnings per share to be up in the range of 46% to 51%. 
Moving briefly to 2017. David is going to join me on our next call scheduled for Tuesday, August 2, to discuss our plans and outlook for fiscal 2017. We're currently in the early planning stages for next year and we'll give guidance on the next call, but there are a few things to keep in mind as you review your estimates between now and then. We expect improvements in organic sales growth, though core portfolio cleanup will still be a headwind. Venezuela will be a drag in the first 2 quarters of the year. If currency exchange rates hold steady through next fiscal year, FX should be much more manageable than it's been for the past few years, but we'll still have a headwind on both the top and bottom line, particularly in the first 2 quarters. Likewise, if commodity costs hold at recent levels, we'll continue to see a modest tailwind in the first half or so of next fiscal year. 
We'll be increasing investment in R&D, in product and packaging programs and sales capacity and in brand awareness and trial-building programs to accelerate top line growth in a responsible and sustainable way. We'll defend the relevant consumer value of our brands and invest to address value gaps if and when they emerge. We'll do everything we can from a productivity standpoint and we'll continue delivering on our commitment of cash return to shareholders. 
There'll be an EPS benefit from shares eliminated via -- with our category exits, though the exact amount of which will depend on when we close -- when we actually close the Coty transaction. We'll obviously give more specifics on all of this in our next call, but we thought it might be helpful to offer you this early thoughts. 
To sum up, we continue to make progress on returning P&G to balanced top and bottom line growth. We're nearing the completion of the portfolio transformation. We upgraded and are sustaining strong cost savings and cash productivity momentum. We're strengthening the organization and culture and we're investing to accelerate top line growth. 
That concludes our prepared remarks for this morning. As a reminder, business segment information is provided in our press release and will be available on slides which we posted on our website, www.pg.com, following the call. 
Now I'll be happy to take your questions."

Perhaps, you can break out what the impact of price was between developed and developing markets to help us out there. And then just lastly, you tightened the core EPS range, as you mentioned, but given that there's just 1 quarter left in the year but you left the full year organic sales target unchanged, which obviously implies an incredibly wide range for Q4. So maybe can you refine your expectations a bit there and the main factors that impact where you fall within that range."

You're coming back strong with 4 questions in 1. But it's great to have you back. In terms of the advertising rates, we were up about, I think, 130 basis points in the quarter. We expect to be up about 140 basis points on the second half. So there'll be some sequential strength in that comparison as we move forward. I tried to say 8x or 9x in our prepared remarks that we will be investing to grow our top line. We'll be funding that with productivity and bringing the bottom line with it. There has not been a significant increase in the percentage of our business being sold on promotion nor has there been a significant increase in the depth of those promotions. We have in several markets used sales deducts as a way to adjust pricing back to competitive levels where we got -- where we took more of a price increase than our competitors ultimately did. So you see that impact, and I would just think about price adjustment and value gap closures as being the explanation for the change in the price component of the top line. And as for fourth quarter guidance, we just provided it. It is what it is. And I think that the range, you rightly pointed out, is a wide one. That's the reality of the world that we're operating in, with very significant volatility, whether it's input costs, FX, geopolitical and geo-economic dynamics and the consumer impacts of things like oil prices. And we're going to be living with that volatility for the foreseeable future."

And then of the reduction, how much is likely to get reinvested elsewhere in the P&L as we think about the next several years?"

Yes, it has increased over time, driven in part by expansion of modern retailers on a global basis. We brought that business model with them to other parts of the world that previously were, for example, largely distributor and wholesaler markets. There is significant opportunity within that bucket of spend. The first and foremost, increased its effectiveness, ensuring that we're spending it in ways that drive category growth on a sustainable basis as opposed to short-term pantry loading, for example. Shifting spending to our best product offerings to increase the trial and repurchase rates of those items with consumers. Again, not driving so much the, in some cases, the lower end of the portfolio. The vehicles that we used to communicate in-store and how those are constructed and utilized in conjunction with our retail partners. So there are just massive opportunities to improve the effectiveness of that spend as we work to reaccelerate the top line growth. There are also efficiency opportunities, and this is one of those unique and wonderful costs, if there is such a thing, where if you're able to reduce it, benefits both the top line and the bottom line. But we'll be very judicious as we do that. Again, really, wanting where we have opportunities to shift that from ineffective spend to effective spend is the primary activity in this space. But I'm convinced that with an $18 billion spend, we'll -- we have efficiency opportunities."

First and foremost, we need to accelerate our top line growth rate, and there's no debate about that. The reason that we've talked a little bit about not following share out the window, we can be gaining shares in categories that are declining, and that's not going to grow our top line. What we need to be doing as innovation leaders in our categories is getting the market growing through that innovation and gaining the share of that growth. That's exactly what we're doing in Fabric Care in the U.S. for example, and it's taken awhile, but it's worked extremely well. And the category is growing 4%. We're getting a disproportionate part of that growth. And that's what we are looking to do across our product categories. So it's bringing innovation to the market, which grows categories for the industry, for our retail partners, and allows us to gain a little bit of share in the process. And look, we need to be growing at the rate of the market or better. But market growth is an important element of that in terms of how attractive that growth ultimately ends up being. So it's kind of it's all of the above. In terms of earnings per share upside from Duracell and Coty, I think we've talked before that we plan to be nondilutive from day 1. We've been working for 2 years on the stranded overheads that were -- that are going to be created as a result of this, and we also expect that the portfolio that we're going to be left with is a healthier, stronger portfolio that will grow and will grow more profitably."

As I said in the -- in our early remarks, we're investing in not just advertising. I went through 3 examples of sampling to generate trial, getting our best products in the hands of consumer. That's a significant portion of investment. I mentioned as well expanding our sales capacity, that's happening across some of the newer channels, but also in our existing channels. Dedicating sales coverage to individual categories and sectors, which has required and will require some investment. So it's broad-based. You mentioned the package. There are clear opportunities to continue to improve our first moment of truth, which is a lot about the package, and we'll continue to do that as well. In terms of specific numbers for next year across those buckets, we're in the early stages of putting our plan together for next year, but our intent is clear, I think. And as I said, we'll continue to work to fund those investments through continued productivity savings as well. On value equation, there's really no change here in terms of our intent to be competitive. Our cross price tiers on big businesses that matter and big markets that matter.

The good news is that we're right in the middle of a supply transformation, and that's going to be a multi-geography in nature.

I know you said that your business is showing some signs of improvement down not as much given some of the premium-priced innovation you're doing. But how confident are you in the strategy of pursuing what sounds like almost exclusively premium-priced innovation? Because it does sound like some of the other competitors out there that there's also pricing competition going on in some of your big markets. So if you can talk about China more broadly and the strategy there, that would be great. And then my second question has to do with your comment that, I think, we've heard. I mean, I think we heard it from Bob McDonald a few years ago, the P&G was increasingly open to hiring from the outside, and I know we've had certain partnerships in R&D stuff. But in terms of actual physical new hires outside of kind of legal and tax and HR, I can't think of anybody on the business side who you actually have let in from outside. So given that you've been saying that for so long, are there particular areas where you think that, that is a priority? Is it marketing? Is it something in specific businesses?

That big middle of the portfolio is very important, and we're not losing sight of that. We have fantastic positions in that portion of the market, which we intend to maintain and build. But we also want to take advantage of the higher growth portion of the market, which is currently the premium tiers. 50% of consumption is currently in those tiers across our categories. They're growing at high-single to double-digit rates. And we obviously want to participate in that, not only for the sales and volume benefit, but also for the equity halo that it provides to our brands. So it is clearly an end strategy, not an overall strategy. Your question on our approach to bringing in talent from outside the organization, I think David was very clear about that at CAGNY, that we are going to maintain broadly or promote from within and develop from within, most importantly, our program. But we are going to put the right people, the best people in jobs across the organization. And when that requires that we go outside, we'll do that. We have, for example, hired a number of experienced salespeople. I mentioned building our sales capacity. As we're dedicating selling organizations to categories and sectors, there are cases where we can find more experience outside the company, people who had 10 years experience in a category where we may be underrepresented. And that we're bringing those people in. The whole area of digital marketing and media, where we need resources, we're either partnering with agencies who have that capability in some cases, we're bringing it in. I don't think that's limited to any portion of the organization. That includes line management and -- but we're going to approach this deliberately. Having someone come in just for the sake of having them come in and being able to say that we're making progress there is obviously not something that interests us very much. But having the right people in the right jobs, bringing mastery to help us win across the board, we're definitely committed to."

There's still situations where we're going to be taking additional pricing, where we feel that, that will be matched. So it'll continue to be dynamic, but a little bit less going forward. On the volume piece, I certainly don't have a crystal ball, but if I look at what happened historically, that volume has come back over time. And sometimes it depends on the market. Volume reacceleration in markets like Latin America has been fairly quick. In other markets, for example, Russia, the last crisis, it took us 3 years to get back from a volume standpoint.

It's not going to be a straight line, but I think we'll see improvement over time. And there is no bogey in terms of that number related to investment. This is a strategic planning at the category country brand level that we're just beginning to do. You've seen the increased investment profile in the back half of this fiscal year, that's the only 1 I really have real insight into at this point. And I certainly wouldn't expect the investment levels to be lower as we go forward into next year."

I think that's also an important point in understanding the difference between the 2% last quarter and the 1% this quarter in terms of organic sales growth. That and Venezuela really explained all of that change. So thanks for asking that question. I think it would be -- in terms of the long-term algorithm, that has not changed. We want to be growing with the market, just slightly ahead of the market. And we believe that with the continued productivity progress, that should translate into mid- to high single-digit earnings per share growth. I do think that getting back fully to that algorithm next year would be difficult. But again, we're just beginning to put our plans together."

And then the second question was on the savings target, this could just be a matter of semantics, but I heard you say up to $10 billion. So should we consider $10 billion as the cap and a bit of stretch goal that may not be achieved? And also on the supply chain side, you mentioned sort of upfront investment, savings will build in 3 to 4 years. Should we be thinking about the delivery against those savings as be a further out, so a bit more protracted than what we've seen over the last $10 billion?"

So from a -- if I just look at the difference between value growth and volume growth in the markets to get at your question of how much of it is pricing.

So from a -- if I just look at the difference between value growth and volume growth in the markets to get at your question of how much of it is pricing. In developed markets, if I just look over the past year, basically, volume growth has actually accelerated a little bit, gone from 0 to 1. Value growth is unchanged at about 1. And in developing markets, value growth has gone from 9 to 6, volume growth has gone from 2 to 1. So I think with those -- that set of numbers, you can put the picture together that you're looking to put together. In terms of the savings target and the semantics around up 2, that's -- those are the words we've used since we first start talking about this back at CAGNY. And that doesn't imply a cap. There's no reason to cap, but it does imply a range of outcomes. And last time we said $10 billion, we overdelivered that. So again, there was no cap. I think $10 billion is a good number to shoot for, and I'm sure we'll get somewhere close to that, if not there. You may recall a conversation that some of us we're having 4 years ago on this topic, and there was a lot of concern about whether we would actually get to $10 billion. And I said again, that's the right number to shoot for, and if we only get to $9 billion, I'm going to be pretty happy. And I look at it the same way this time around. So really no change there. On the supply chain transformation, that particular portion of the savings will be -- will come later, as we've indicated since we started talking about supply chain transformation. I wouldn't take that as indicative of the entire program. Last time around, it was pretty evenly paced across the fiscal year. That's not the design attempt, that's just how it felt. And I don't see a reason for it to fall significantly different than that this time. Remember though, and I know you know this, we are going to be reinvesting a lot of these savings. And on relative basis, more of that investment acceleration, if you will, we'll occur in the early years. And then as that -- it gets fully in place, it will allow us to get less of the year-to-year impact."

One is, I know you're pretty reluctant to talk about 2017 guidance on this call. But it would seem that analysts and investors have at least been interpreting some sort of message from you guys, given many EPS numbers have come down over the past month or so and significantly, more negatively it would seem, then, Jon, some of the messaging you've talked about at least on this call. So I'm trying to get a sense, especially with the Coty benefit or the kind of share retirement benefit, so I'm trying to get a sense of recap of your thinking on 2017 in terms of reinvestments and returns, because clearly, that some math are just being interpreted out there. And if you can balance kind of the ""continued progress"" that you're CEO says versus the not straight line that you mentioned and give us a little more color, I think, would be appreciated, because there's some message getting out clearly. The second question is, Jon, you joked a few years ago that you wouldn't want to be CFO of P&G at a time when the dividend didn't grow. And I think, we're all collectively glad that it did grow. But can you give us some more color on the 1% dividend increase? I mean, shareholders have been waiting around for you guys for quite some time. You've had some very challenging times. The macros have been very challenging other than your peer group suggests that they increased their dividend a little bit more aggressively than yours. And I get your dividend yield, and I get your payout ratio. But what would, in the end, be the true cost of a slight ratings downgrade here to reward  shareholders a little bit more aggressively?"

So I'm not sure what message has been received. In terms of the message we're providing, it's very much the one you described to David just a minute ago, which is continued progress on both of the top and bottom line as well as our cash flow. And obviously, we want to accelerate all of that as quickly as we're able, but do it in a sustainable, responsible way. And as I indicated, we're just putting our plans together for next year, and we'll see what amount of progress we make. Our competitors don't sit still. Markets are volatile. And so that's where the not straight line comment comes in. I just think that's a reflection of reality. The Coty benefit in terms of the share retirement will depend on exactly when those shares get retired, but there should definitely be a benefit associated with that. And we view that as part of the overall equation. In terms of the dividend increase, as you know, we're very committed to the principle of cash return to shareholders. Over the last 10 years, as I mentioned earlier, we've returned $118 billion. This year, between dividends and share repurchases and share exchange, we'll effectively return $15 billion to $16 billion. There is not a lot of juice, if you will, to the amount of cash available from a borrowing standpoint between our current credit rating and 1 or 2 notches down. So to do that to the credit rating for a small amount of additional dividend increases is not something that made a lot of sense to us. We were very happy to increase the dividend. We remain committed to cash return to shareholders. But we also need to reflect reality in our dividend planning, significant FX headwinds, we are creating a smaller company, and our earnings per share are below a year ago. And we have a responsibility there as you will appreciate as well. So it's a balancing of those 2 things. I completely get and understand the question. It's a very fair one. But that's where we net it out. I'll leave it there. Thank you, everybody, for your questions this morning. We'll be available for the balance of the week to talk to any of us with you. We're very happy about the progress that we're making, but we clearly understand we have more to do. Thanks a lot."

As David Taylor said on the press release we should earlier this morning, we continue to make progress on the transformation we are making to return P&G's results to a balance of strong top line growth, bottom line growth and cas",4934,"Thanks, and good morning. As David Taylor said on the press release we should earlier this morning, we continue to make progress on the transformation we are making to return P&G's results to a balance of strong top line growth, bottom line growth and cash generation. We achieved a significant milestone this quarter in the transformation of the product portfolio with the exit of the Batteries business. We delivered another strong quarter of productivity improvement and cost savings and we increased investments in innovation, advertising and selling capacity to enhance our long-term prospects for faster, sustainable top line growth and value creation. 
We do continue to operate in a challenging and volatile macro environment. Market growth rates on both the volume and value basis have decelerated due mainly to slower growth in developing markets. We entered the year expecting the market to grow close to 3% to 4% globally. We now expect 3%.  There are more flashpoints across the globe than at any time in recent memory with significant economic and political instability impacting incomes and consumption in many large and important markets, Russia, the Ukraine, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the balance of the Middle East, Turkey, Nigeria, Argentina, Venezuela, Brazil. We generate more than 10% of our annual sales and profit in these markets. Currencies have weakened across the board since the start of our fiscal year. While the dollar has softened a bit recently, we still face up to $1 billion after tax net earnings impact versus year ago, a $200 million increase since just the start of December. Across 4 years, FX has reduced net earnings by about $4 billion after tax, nearly 40% of fiscal year 2012 net earnings. 
Against this backdrop, we remain focused on large opportunities in our control, executing what is the largest transformation in our company's history, step changing cost and cash productivity, transforming our portfolio, strengthening our organization and culture and reaccelerating top line growth with strengthened category business models and innovation plans and, where appropriate, improved value equations. This transformation is aimed at delivering balanced top and bottom line growth and leadership value creation. I'm going to talk briefly about each of the transformation steps, productivity, portfolio, organization and top line reacceleration before getting into the details of the quarter. 
We continued to dramatically improve cost and cash productivity with significant upside still ahead. Our original 5-year cost of goods savings target was $6 billion. We expect to deliver over $7 billion by the end of this year, $1 billion or more above our initial target.  We've reduced manufacturing enrollment by 15% over the last 3 years. This includes new staffing necessary to support capacity additions. On a same-site basis, manufacturing enrollment is down 20%. We're targeting a 25% to 30% cumulative reduction by the end of fiscal 2017. In February 2012, we announced that we would reduce nonmanufacturing overhead by 10% over 5 years. As of March 31, we've reduced these roles by more than 24%, almost 2.5x the original target. We expect to meet our latest target of 25% to 30% by the end of this year, 1 year ahead of schedule. 
Including divestitures, we'll reduce nonmanufacturing roles by about 35% by the end of fiscal 2017. We're reducing nonworking marketing expenditures, costs that do not impact reach, frequency or continuity of our advertising and trial generation programs. We were spending $2 billion per year on agency fees. Last year, we reduced the roughly 6,000 agencies we work with by nearly 40% and cut agency and production spending by about $370 million. We're aiming for an additional $200 million of agency-related savings this year, reinvesting those savings in advertising and sampling of consumer-preferred products. 
Net of reinvestments and innovation, selling, media and sampling, productivity has enabled us to deliver constant-currency growth and operating profit margin improvement in each of the last 3 fiscal years, driving double-digit constant-currency core earnings per share growth in each of those years. We're on track to improve gross and operating margins by triple-digit indices, both including and excluding currency impacts again this fiscal year. We're driving productivity up and down the income statement and across the balance sheet. Inventory days are down, payable days are up, balance sheet productivity has enabled us to extend our long track record of very strong adjusted free cash flow productivity, 102% last fiscal year, 101% in Q1, 117% in Q2 and 105% in the quarter we just completed, even as we spend capital to transform our supply chain. 
We continued to maintain our position as one of the strongest cash generators among competitive peers and comparable mega-cap companies. We're among the top companies in returning cash to shareholders. Over the past decade, we have returned more than $118 billion in cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchase. We said 4 years ago that we needed to make cost and cash productivity part of our culture, as integral to our culture as innovation. We've made significant progress and we have significant opportunity. Our strong track record and our line of sight to additional opportunity both inform our intent to save as much as another $10 billion in cost over the next 5 years. Our supply chain transformation is in its early stages, first, in North America and Europe, then in Latin America and in India, Middle East and Africa. We're in an investment mode now, with savings to start in 3 to 4 years. Our new U.S. mixing centers are up and running, putting roughly 80% of volume within 24 hours of store shelves. 
We're constructing multi-category manufacturing sites in geographically strategic locations to replace smaller single category sites in less cost-effective locations. We're upgrading and standardized manufacturing platforms to lower costs and facilitate faster innovation. We're employing smart automation and digitization to improve manufacturing productivity, raw material and finished product logistics and demand planning. We have additional opportunity to optimize working capital and further increase the efficiency of our capital spend. After 2 strong years of savings, we'll enter next year still spending $1.5 billion in agency-related marketing costs, still more room to improve. We'll continue to look for efficiencies in working media with better advertising targeting and earned media campaigns with engaging content. 
As we fully operationalize the new focused 10-category [ph] company, there will undoubtedly be additional opportunities to increase organization efficiency, agility and speed of decision-making. Digitization will continue to enable smart productivity choices. Finally, we'll be working to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our promotion spending. We currently spend about $18 billion in deductions between gross and net sales. We see clear opportunities to improve the effectiveness of the spend for both us and our retail partners and to improve its efficiency.  So we're targeting up to $10 billion of additional savings over the next 5 years. We expect to reinvest a significant amount of the savings in R&D and product and packaging improvements, sales capacity and in brand awareness and trial building programs to deliver balanced top and bottom line growth and to create value for share owners.  
In addition to transforming our cost structure, we're transforming our portfolio. Over the past 18 months, we have divested, discontinued or consolidated 55 brands, including the completion of the Duracell transaction at the end of February.  We have 50 more brands in the exit process, including the 41 Beauty brands in the transaction with Coty. The S-4 registration statement for the Beauty transaction was filed last week. We're on track to close the deal in the second half of the calendar year. In total, we'll exit 105 brands and all the complexity they create. These brands represent only about 6% of fiscal 2013 profit. Going forward, we're anchoring our portfolio on 10 category-based business units and about 65 brands. These are categories where P&G has leading market positions and where product technologies deliver performance differences that matter to consumers. These 10 businesses have historically grown faster with higher margins in the balance of the company. 
Within these core businesses, we're focusing our offerings, making smart choices for short, mid- and long-term value creation, foregoing bad businesses, even when these choices create near-term top line pressure. In Mexico, for example, we made a choice to discontinue low-tier unprofitable and commoditizing toilet paper products in favor of very profitable high-tier differentiated products. Sales are down 75% but before tax margins have improved by more than 50 basis points from very negative to nicely positive. It will take a few more quarters for the top line drag to dissipate and we'll have a solidly value-accretive business going forward. 
In India, we've made a choice to deprioritize several unprofitable lines of business, which negatively impact short-term top line growth rates but will lead longer term to a much more profitable business that will grow strongly.  The strategic portion of our India business is growing at a high single-digit pace. Sales in the portion we're fixing or exiting have been down more than 30%. This top line pain is worth it. We're making significant progress in improving local profit margins, up about 700 basis points. We've gone from losing significant money in India to triple-digit profits in just 2 years. 
We're taking a similar approach in our Fabric Care product portfolio, discontinuing product forms, additives, bars, bleaches and tablets and value-tier detergents that have been a drag on profitability and value creation. These choices are causing a top line drag of nearly 1 point on the global Fabric Care business, but profitability and the long-term attractiveness of the business improves. Combined, these choices are causing about a 1 point drag on organic sales growth. We expect this headwind to continue for the balance of the calendar year and then dissipate as annualize more of the impacts. As we come out of this, we'll have stronger top line growth that is worth something on the bottom line. 
We're transforming our organization and culture. We're making many changes that by themselves may seem small and obvious but together are significant and important. As an example, we've made several important changes in how we go to market. We eliminated overlapping resources and duplicative structures and responsibilities of marketing and sales professionals in the global business units and market development organizations, clarifying responsibilities and strengthening accountability. Reflecting this, we changed the name of the market development organizations to selling and market operations, small but very important. 
We're increasing staff -- we're increasingly staffing leadership roles in the selling and marketing operations with leaders who have significant telling experience. We're changing our talent development and assignment planning to drive more mastery and depth. The objective is simple: improve business results by getting and keeping the right people in the right places to develop and apply deep category mastery to winning. Consistent with this, we're dedicating sales resources to categories or sectors. In our larger markets, sales resources have greater accountability back to the categories they serve, which is a change. We're aligning incentives at a lower and more specific level of granularity to better match these responsibilities and to increase accountability. 
Another example of the evolution of our thinking on the organization is what David talked about at CAGNY. He said that P&G is fortunate to consistently source and develop strong talent and that we intend to maintain our develop-from-within approach. But there are times when the best talent for a role may not be inside our organization. Going forward, we're going to look at outside hiring more often than -- often when we need it to field the best team possible. The bottom line is that we're committed to getting, keeping and growing the right talent in the right place to better drive business results. 
Again, each of these changes may seem small and rather obvious but collectively they are big and important changes for our organization and culture. A very important area of transformation is reacceleration of top line growth. We expect to make progress in all 10 product categories, but we're putting specific emphasis against the 4 largest categories: Baby Care, Fabric Care, Hair Care and Grooming; and the 2 largest markets: the U.S. and China. These 4 categories represent over 60% of sales and profit. These 2 countries represent nearly 50% of sales and more than 50% of profit. We're growing our Fabric Care business with consumer-preferred brands and product offerings like our premium performance and premium-priced unit dose detergents and our market-leading and market-expanding scent bead fabric enhancers. We're exiting slower-growing, lower-priced, more commoditized product forms where it's more difficult to distinguish our products and create value. 
Fabric Care results in the U.S. demonstrates what's possible when we deliver superior value with best-in-class performance at a modest price premium. The U.S. laundry detergent market is continuing to grow behind these efforts, with the category up more than 4 points on a value basis over the last 3-, 6- and 9-month periods. The same is true for fabric enhancers. Spurred by the rapid growth of scent beads, the U.S. fabric enhancers category is growing, up more than 6 points on a value basis over the last 3-, 6- and 9-month periods. Our share is growing. P&G's U.S. laundry detergent and fabric enhancer value shares were each up nearly 1 point in the March quarter. 
We will continue to be the innovation leader in Fabric Care. In North America, we're introducing a new regimen on Tide and Downy that addresses the odor problems common to athletic wear. 70% of consumers wear athletic gear multiple times each week. The odor defense collection, anchored by innovation on Tide PODS brings a proprietary formula of enzymes and surfactants that break down and remove stubborn soils and residues for a great clean and fresh scent. Paired with the added cleaning power of Tide Odor Defense Rescue laundry booster and Downy Fresh Protect odor defense beads, this regimen promises to eliminate odors from the fast-growing market of athleisure clothes people are wearing far beyond the gym. 
Next month, we start our learning market on Tide Pure Clean liquid detergent in the U.S. Naturals is a large and growing segment in several categories, but Naturals are only about 3% of the laundry category. Unlocking growth in Naturals is about solving the tension between green and clean. People want performance and sustainability. Pure Clean provides a cleaning power of Tide with 65% bio-based ingredients and is produced with 100% renewable wind power electricity in a facility operating with 0 manufacturing waste to landfill. We're launching better performing and more profitable new compact liquid detergents in Russia, Turkey, Mexico, Brazil and China. In Russia and Turkey, where we launched superior compact liquid detergents early last calendar year, P&G share of liquid detergents are up 7 points and 14 points, respectively. We've increased sampling in new washing machines, a key point of category entry and change for consumers. Last fiscal year, we distributed 5 million samples in washing machines globally. This fiscal year, we'll distribute about 17 million. In calendar year 2016, we'll distribute 30 million samples of our best-performing products. 
In U.S. Baby Care, strong innovation, consumer communication, trial programs and a robust online presence have led to strong growth for Pampers. Pampers value share of U.S. diapers was up more than 1.5 points last fiscal year and was up 1 point in the March quarter. Pampers latest Swaddlers and Cruisers innovation Extra Absorb Channels is off to a good start in the new calendar year with Swaddlers and Cruisers share up more than 1 point in the last quarter.  We strengthened investments in brand awareness and trial at the point-of-market entry. 70% of new moms in the U.S. will receive samples of our best products through our prenatal baby shower and hospital programs. 
Last fiscal year marked the seventh consecutive year of sales and value share growth for the Luvs brand in the U.S. However, results have been down so far this year following a significant price reduction taken by our primary competitor. We're taking steps to improve the awareness, trial and consumer value of Luvs. We're increasing equity-building advertising, strengthening in-store programs that have product and packaging improvements slated for launch next quarter.  Baby Care results have been softer in other markets. To address this, we've strengthened our value proposition in several markets and accelerated premium innovation on both taped and pull-on diapers to restore our competitiveness at the top end of the market. We're strengthening our selling resources and programs for baby stores and we're improving our point-of-market entry programs to deliver higher awareness and trial of Pampers among new moms. 
In Hair Care, we launched our new conditioner innovation on Pantene in the U.S. last quarter. Pantene's new breakthrough conditioner technology delivers weightless conditioning, addressing the most significant consumer trial barrier in the category. The new conditioner innovation is a consumer blind test winner versus our best competition in North America, China and Japan.  We continue to strongly support Head & Shoulders, one of our steadiest and strongest growing brands, delivering over 8% compound average shares -- excuse me, sales growth over the past 10 years, even with significant currency impacts. Organic sales for Pantene and Head & Shoulders were each up high single digits in the U.S. in the March quarter. 
Gillette has delivered steady growth in international markets so far this fiscal year behind strong innovation, advertising and sampling programs. Gillette is holding or growing value share in each region outside the U.S. The growth in international markets has been offset by soft results in the U.S. To improve our growth and the growth of the market, we're investing in innovation, new user trial and improved consumer value.  We're expanding our performance advantage at the top end of the market. Our most recent cartridge innovation, Gillette Fusion ProShield, launched last quarter, ProShield with lubrication before and after the blades, shields against irritation during every shave. Early consumption results in the U.S. have been tracking ahead of plan. We're supporting a broader range of our product ladder from our best product, Fusion FlexBall ProShield, to MACH3 to premium price and superior performance disposables, with stronger consumer value communication. We're facing more aggressive competition at lower price points, and we will respond to ensure our brands remain a superior consumer value. 
We've stepped up new trial activities in the U.S. with our 18th birthday sampling program. We've put Fusion ProGlide FlexBall razors in the hands of nearly 80% of young men, over 2 million samples last year, a 33% increase over the prior year level. We've now began sampling the FlexBall razor handle and the ProShield cartridge, our very best combination of shaving technologies.  
We're not standing still in the other categories. We delivered solid organic sales growth in the U.S. this quarter in the Feminine Care, Family Care and Home Care categories, all big and profitable businesses for us. P&G continues to be the innovation leader in our U.S. categories. In the IRI Innovation Pacesetters Report just published, P&G had 4 of the top 10 innovations and 6 of the top 13. Top innovations recognized for 2015 sales were Tide Simply Clean & Fresh, Always Discreet, Fusion ProGlide FlexBall, Venus Swirl, Febreze Unstopables and Tide Plus Ultra Stain Release. Overall, in the U.S., organic sales were up 2%, in line with underlying market growth of our categories. Organic volume was up 3% for the quarter. 
We're making progress in China, but there's still more work to do. We narrowed sales declines by half this quarter and expect to improve again next quarter. We recently upgraded our Pampers Premium diaper pants to improve fit and softness, and we have new innovations coming soon on mid-tier pants and premium taped diapers. Oral-B super-premium toothpaste, launched in over 700 stores last quarter, reaching roughly a 5% share in those outlets. We'll triple distribution on this item this quarter. Ariel is growing in China following the concentrated liquid detergent launch in January. Gillette Fusion FlexBall has driven male razor system share growth over the past 3-, 6- and 12-month periods. And SK-II continues to deliver very strong growth, with sales for the quarter up nearly 20%. So some bright spots are emerging, but it will take time to get fully back to target growth rates. We're realistic that improvements in top line growth won't happen overnight and they won't happen in a straight line, but they will continue to improve over time. 
Let me move now to the quarter we've just completed and to the outlook for the fiscal year. Organic sales were up 1% for the quarter versus the prior year. The impact from the portfolio cleanup efforts I discussed earlier was about a 1 point drag on organic sales growth. All-in sales were down 7%, including a 5 point headwind from foreign exchange, 3 points from the combination of Venezuela deconsolidation and minor brand divestitures. Core earnings per share were $0.86, down 3% versus the prior year. Core gross margin increased 270 basis points. Core operating margin increased 300 basis points. This quarter's core earnings per share results included a next FX headwind of approximately $90 million after tax or $0.03 per share. Comprised of a negative spot rate impact of about $230 million, which was partially offset by $140 million balance sheet revaluation impact in the base period that did not recur this year. 
Venezuela continues to be a difficult market and was also a drag on March quarter results. At the beginning of the fiscal year, we announced our decision to deconsolidate our Venezuelan operations, no longer reporting sales or profits from products locally manufactured and sold in Venezuela.  We continue to recognize sales and profit on products sold to our Venezuelan subsidiaries from non-Venezuelan P&G entities. We've highlighted at CAGNY that a disruption in our Venezuelan subsidiaries ability to access dollars to pay for these imports of finished products could have a negative impact on our top and bottom line results. 
We've been unable to access U.S. dollars at any size since November. And as a result, reported no sales or profit for Venezuela in the March quarter. This caused a 20 basis point organic sales growth reduction on the quarter. On the bottom line, the total impact of Venezuela was $0.05 per share or 6% in terms of core EPS. Assuming these financing constraints continue, the bottom line impact on the year will be up to $0.10 per share or minus 3%. The core effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.2%, up 800 basis points versus last year, a $0.10 per share impact on core earnings per share and 11 percentage point impact on core earnings per share growth. The base period tax rate was unusually low due to the geographic mix of earnings and due to audit settlements. And the current period rate was inflated by a valuation allowance against net operating loss carryforwards. These 2 items account for about 6 points of the 8-point change in the tax rate. These 3 impacts, FX, Venezuela and tax were a combined core earnings per share growth headwind of 20% this quarter. 
On an all-in GAAP basis, earnings per share were $0.97 for the quarter, up 29% versus the prior year. We generated $2.5 billion in free cash flow, yielding 105% adjusted free cash flow productivity. We returned approximately $2.9 billion to shareholders this quarter through a combination of $1.9 billion in dividends and $1 billion of share repurchase.  In addition, we received approximately $4.2 billion of stock through the Duracell transaction. Earlier this month, we increased the dividend 1%, making this the 60th consecutive year the company has increased the dividend. The size of the dividend increase reflects FX headwinds, the cash impacts from streamlining the strengthening of the business unit portfolio and our plans to increase investments in the business to accelerate top line growth. 
Moving to guidance, our outlook for the fiscal year reflects 4 large factors driving lower earnings in the fourth quarter. First, lower nonoperating income. We expect about $100 million less in the fourth quarter this year versus last year. Second, tax. The Q4 tax rate will likely be, again, about 800 basis points higher than last year due to the geographic earnings mix and audit settlement benefits in the base period. Third, investment levels. We'll have a significant increase in advertising expense, coupled with continued reinvestment in R&D and selling capabilities. Fourth, FX. We'll continue to see significant spot rate impacts on both the top and bottom line in Q4, and unlike the last 2 quarters, will not have offsets from base period balance sheet revaluation changes. Combined, we expect these 4 factors to lower Q4 net earnings by more than $800 million and reduce core earnings per share by more than 32% versus the prior year. 
For the fiscal year, we're maintaining our outlook for organic sales growth of in line to up low single digits versus fiscal 2015. As I mentioned, our outlook assumes we'll no longer benefit from sales of finished product to our deconsolidated subsidiaries in Venezuela. This would be roughly a 30 basis point drag on Q4 organic sales growth. In addition, the roughly 1 point drag from the core portfolio cleanup will continue into Q4. We expect FX will have a 6 to 7 percentage point impact on all-in sales growth for the fiscal year. Also, the combined impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation and minor brand divestitures will have a 2 to 3 percentage point drag on all-in sales growth. Taken together, we expect all-in sales will be down high single digits versus fiscal 2015. 
We continue to expect constant-currency core earnings per share growth in the mid-single-digits for the year. Foreign exchange will reduce net earnings by approximately $1 billion versus the prior year, resulting in a 9 percentage point or $0.35 per share impact on core earnings per share growth for the year. With 1 quarter left in the year, we're tightening and improving our core earnings per share guidance range from down 3% to 8% to down 3% to 6%, which puts the midpoint of the range at $3.59 per share versus last year's core earnings per share of $3.76. Fiscal year earnings per share guidance includes headwinds of 10 percentage points from the combined impacts of Beauty deal expenses, Venezuela deconsolidation, lower nonoperating income and a higher tax rate. 
Adjusting for these items, our guidance translates to modest core earnings per share growth with meaningful growth, excluding foreign exchange. We expect the core effective tax rate to be 25% or higher for fiscal 2016, more than 4 points higher than last year, roughly a 6-point headwind on core earnings per share growth. We're raising our fiscal year outlook for free cash flow to 100% or more of adjusted net earnings. We expect to reduce outstanding shares at a value of over $8 billion through a combination of direct share repurchases and the shares that were exchanged in the Duracell transaction. In addition, we expect dividend payments of more than $7 billion. In total, $15 billion to $16 billion in dividend payments, share exchanges and share repurchases. We expect all-in GAAP earnings per share to be up in the range of 46% to 51%. 
Moving briefly to 2017. David is going to join me on our next call scheduled for Tuesday, August 2, to discuss our plans and outlook for fiscal 2017. We're currently in the early planning stages for next year and we'll give guidance on the next call, but there are a few things to keep in mind as you review your estimates between now and then. We expect improvements in organic sales growth, though core portfolio cleanup will still be a headwind. Venezuela will be a drag in the first 2 quarters of the year. If currency exchange rates hold steady through next fiscal year, FX should be much more manageable than it's been for the past few years, but we'll still have a headwind on both the top and bottom line, particularly in the first 2 quarters. Likewise, if commodity costs hold at recent levels, we'll continue to see a modest tailwind in the first half or so of next fiscal year. 
We'll be increasing investment in R&D, in product and packaging programs and sales capacity and in brand awareness and trial-building programs to accelerate top line growth in a responsible and sustainable way. We'll defend the relevant consumer value of our brands and invest to address value gaps if and when they emerge. We'll do everything we can from a productivity standpoint and we'll continue delivering on our commitment of cash return to shareholders.  There'll be an EPS benefit from shares eliminated via -- with our category exits, though the exact amount of which will depend on when we close -- when we actually close the Coty transaction. We'll obviously give more specifics on all of this in our next call, but we thought it might be helpful to offer you these early thoughts. 
To sum up, we continue to make progress on returning P&G to balanced top and bottom line growth. We're nearing the completion of the portfolio transformation. We upgraded and are sustaining strong cost savings and cash productivity momentum. We're strengthening the organization and culture and we're investing to accelerate top line growth. That concludes our prepared remarks for this morning. As a reminder, business segment information is provided in our press release and will be available on slides which we posted on our website, www.pg.com, following the call. 
Now I'll be happy to take your questions."

And then price overall came in, so how much of that was incremental promotion, step-up in sampling that you're doing, things like that? Perhaps you can break out what the impact of price was between developed and developing markets to help us out there. And then just lastly, you tightened the core EPS range, as you mentioned, but given that there's just 1 quarter left in the year but you left the full year organic sales target unchanged, which obviously implies an incredibly wide range for Q4. So maybe can you refine your expectations a bit there and the main factors that impact where you fall within that range."

You're coming back strong with 4 questions in 1. But it's great to have you back. In terms of the advertising rates, we were up about, I think, 130 basis points in the quarter. We expect to be up about 140 basis points on the second half. So there'll be some sequential strengthening of that comparison as we move forward. I tried to say 8 or 9 times in our prepared remarks that we will be investing to grow our top line. We'll be funding that with productivity and bringing the bottom line with it. There has not been a significant increase in the percentage of our business being sold on promotion nor has there been a significant increase in the depth of those promotions. We have in several markets used sales deducts as a way to adjust pricing back to competitive levels where we got -- where we took more of a price increase than our competitors ultimately did. So you see that impact, and I would just think about price adjustment and value gap closures as being the explanation for the change in the price component of the top line. And as for fourth quarter guidance, we just provided it. It is what it is. And I think that the range, you rightly pointed out, is a wide one. That's the reality of the world that we're operating in, with very significant volatility, whether it's input costs, FX, geopolitical and geo-economic dynamics and the consumer impacts of things like oil prices. And we're going to be living with that volatility for the foreseeable future."

Yes, it has increased over time, driven in part by expansion of modern retailers on a global basis. We brought that business model with them to other parts of the world that previously were, for example, largely distributor and wholesaler markets. There is significant opportunity within that bucket of spend. The first and foremost, increase its effectiveness, ensuring that we're spending it in ways that drive category growth on a sustainable basis as opposed to short-term pantry loading, for example. Shifting spending to our best product offerings to increase the trial and repurchase rates of those items with consumers. Again, not driving so much the, in some cases, the lower end of the portfolio. The vehicles that we use to communicate in-store and how those are constructed and utilized in conjunction with our retail partners. So there are just massive opportunities to improve the effectiveness of that spend as we work to reaccelerate the top line growth. There are also efficiency opportunities, and this is one of those unique and wonderful costs, if there is such a thing, where if you're able to reduce it, benefits both the top line and the bottom line. But we'll be very judicious as we do that. Again, really, wanting where we have opportunities to shift that from ineffective spend to effective spend is the primary activity in the space. But I'm convinced that with an $18 billion spend, we'll -- we have efficiency opportunities."

Because I think, maybe the last 2 or 3 years, you kind of said market share is not a primary driver of the business, it's really about growing the categories profitably. But does that change as you kind of feel more pressure to close the gap in organic growth versus your peers? Frankly, I think the scoreboard you have is organic growth, right? And so I think that's obviously really important. And then really quickly, just a housekeeping item, I know you're not -- you don't have the exact numbers, but can you just give us like a rough cut at what you think the earnings upside is from both of the Duracell and the Coty divestitures?"

First and",322,"You ask a very important question, Bill, how do we think about top line growth, and what are we trying to achieve there and what's the -- how do you think about the different metrics, whether it's category growth, organic sales or market share. First and foremost, we need to accelerate our top line growth rate, and there's no debate about that. The reason that we've talked a little bit about not following share out the window, we can be gaining shares in categories that are declining, and that's not going to grow our top line. What we need to be doing as innovation leaders in our categories is getting the market growing through that innovation and gaining the share of that growth. That's exactly what we're doing in Fabric Care in the U.S. for example, and it's taken awhile, but it's worked extremely well. And the category is growing 4%. We're getting a disproportionate part of that growth. And that's what we are looking to do across our product categories. So it's bringing innovation to the market, which grows categories for the industry, for our retail partners, and allows us to gain a little bit of share in the process. And look, we need to be growing at the rate of the market or better. But market growth is an important element of that in terms of how attractive that growth ultimately ends up being. So it's kind of -- it's all of the above. In terms of earnings per share upside from Duracell and Coty, I think we've talked before that we plan to be non-dilutive from day 1. We've been working for 2 years on the stranded overheads that were -- that are going to be created as a result of this, and we also expect that the portfolio that we're going to be left with is a healthier, stronger portfolio that will grow and will grow more profitably."

I also want to see color on your comments on consumer value investments, particularly in Gillette in the U.S. and Baby in the U.S. And just in Luvs, I wonder about how you think about Luvs' pricing versus private label and positioning.

That's a significant portion of investment. I mentioned as well expanding our sales capacity, that's happening across some of the newer channels, but also in our existing channels. Dedicating sales coverage to individual categories and sectors, which has required and will require some investment. So it's broad-based. You mentioned package.

In terms of volume and the impact that it's had on our fixed-cost rates, if you will, in the supply chain, it's definitely had an impact. The good news is that we're right in the middle of a supply transformation, and that's going to be multi-geography in nature.

So we're going to, hopefully, achieve the best of both, and we'll see how that works going forward."

I know you said that your business is showing some signs of improvement down not as much given some of the premium-priced innovation you're doing. But how confident are you in the strategy of pursuing what sounds like almost exclusively premium-priced innovation? Because it does sound like some of the other competitors out there that there's also pricing competition going on in some of your big markets. So if you can talk about China more broadly and the strategy there, that would be great. And then my second question has to do with your comment that, I think, we've heard. I mean, I think we heard it from Bob McDonald a few years ago, the P&G was increasingly open to hiring from the outside, and I know we've had certain partnerships in R&D stuff. But in terms of actual physical new hires outside of kind of legal and tax and HR, I can't think of anybody on the business side who you actually have brought in from outside. So given that you've been saying that for so long, are there particular areas where you think that, that is a priority? Is it marketing? Is it something in specific businesses? And why say it for so many years and then not have it actually happen?"

That big middle of the portfolio is very important, and we're not losing sight of that. We have fantastic positions in that portion of the market, which we intend to maintain and build. But we also want to take advantage of the higher growth portion of the market, which is currently the premium tiers. 50% of consumption is currently in those tiers across our categories. They're growing at high-single to double-digit rates. And we obviously want to participate in that, not only for the sales and volume benefit, but also for the equity halo that it provides to our brands. So it is clearly an ""and"" strategy, not an ""or"" strategy. Your question on our approach to bringing in talent from outside the organization, I think David was very clear about that at CAGNY, that we are going to maintain broadly or promote from within and develop from within, most importantly, our program. But we are going to put the right people, the best people in jobs across the organization. And when that requires that we go outside, we'll do that. We have, for example, hired a number of experienced salespeople. I mentioned building our sales capacity. As we're dedicating selling organizations to categories and sectors, there are cases where we can find more experience outside the company, people who had 10 years' experience in a category where we may be underrepresented. And that we're bringing those people in. The whole area of digital marketing and media, where we need resources, we're either partnering with agencies who have that capability; in some cases, we're bringing it in. I don't think that's limited to any portion of the organization. That includes line management and -- but we're going to approach this deliberately. Having someone come in just for the sake of having them come in and being able to say that we're making progress there is obviously not something that interests us very much. But having the right people in the right jobs, bringing mastery to help us win across the board, we're definitely committed to."

There's still situations where we're going to be taking additional pricing, where we feel that, that will be matched. So it'll continue to be dynamic, but a little bit less going forward. On the volume piece, I certainly don't have a crystal ball, but if I look at what happened historically, that volume has come back over time. And sometimes it depends on the market. Volume reacceleration in markets like Latin America has been fairly quick. In other markets, for example, Russia, the last crisis, it took us 3 years to get back from a volume standpoint.

So from a -- if I just look at the difference between value growth and volume growth in the markets to get at your question of how much of it is pricing. In developed markets, if I just look over the past year, basically, volume growth has actually accelerated a little bit, gone from 0 to 1. Value growth is unchanged at about 1. And in developing markets, value growth has gone from 9 to 6, volume growth has gone from 2 to 1. So I think with those -- that set of numbers, you can put the picture together that you're looking to put together. In terms of the savings target and the semantics around up 2, that's -- those are the words we've used since we first start talking about this back at CAGNY. And that doesn't imply a cap. There's no reason to cap, but it does imply a range of outcomes. And last time we said $10 billion, we over delivered that. So again, there was no cap. I think $10 billion is a good number to shoot for, and I'm sure we'll get somewhere close to that, if not there. You may recall a conversation that some of us we're having 4 years ago on this topic, and there was a lot of concern about whether we would actually get to $10 billion. And I said again, that's the right number to shoot for, and if we only get to $9 billion, I'm going to be pretty happy. And I look at it the same way this time around. So really no change there. On the supply chain transformation, that particular portion of the savings will be -- will come later, as we've indicated since we started talking about supply chain transformation. I wouldn't take that as indicative of the entire program. Last time around, it was pretty evenly paced across the fiscal years. That's not the design intent, that's just how it felt. And I don't see a reason for it to fall significantly different than that this time. Remember though, and I know you know this, we are going to be reinvesting a lot of these savings. And on relative basis, more of that investment acceleration, if you will, we'll occur in the early years. And then as that -- it gets fully in place, it will allow us to get less of the year-to-year impact."

One is, I know you're pretty reluctant to talk about 2017 guidance on this call. But it would seem that analysts and investors have at least been interpreting some sort of message from you guys, given many EPS numbers have come down over the past month or so. And significantly, more negatively it would seem, then, Jon, some of the messaging you've talked about at least on this call. So I'm trying to get a sense -- especially with the Coty benefit or the kind of share retirement benefit. So I'm trying to get a sense of recap of your thinking on 2017 in terms of reinvestments and returns, because clearly, that some math are just being interpreted out there. And if you can balance kind of the ""continued progress"" that you're CEO says versus the not straight line that you mentioned and give us a little more color, I think, would be appreciated, because there's some message getting out clearly. The second question is, Jon, you joked a few years ago that you wouldn't want to be CFO of P&G at a time when the dividend didn't grow. And I think, we're all collectively glad that it did grow. But can you give us some more color on the 1% dividend increase? I mean, shareholders have been waiting around for you guys for quite some time. You've had some very challenging times. The macros have been very challenging other than your peer group suggest that they increased their dividend a little bit more aggressively than yours. And I get your dividend yield, and I get your payout ratio. But what would, in the end, be the true cost of a slight ratings downgrade here to reward  shareholders a little bit more aggressively?"

So I'm not sure what message is being received. In terms of the message we're providing, it's very much the one you described to David just a minute ago, which is continued progress on both of the top and bottom line as well as our cash flow. And obviously, we want to accelerate all of that as quickly as we're able, but do it in a sustainable, responsible way. And as I indicated, we're just putting our plans together for next year, and we'll see what amount of progress we make. Our competitors don't sit still. Markets are volatile. And so that's where the not straight line comment comes in. I just think that's a reflection of reality. The Coty benefit in terms of the share retirement will depend on exactly when those shares get retired, but there should definitely be a benefit associated with that. And we view that as part of the overall equation. In terms of the dividend increase, as you know, we're very committed to the principle of cash return to shareholders. Over the last 10 years, as I mentioned earlier, we've returned $118 billion. This year, between dividends and share repurchases and share exchange, we'll effectively return $15 billion to $16 billion. There is not a lot of juice, if you will, to the amount of cash available from a borrowing standpoint between our current credit rating and 1 or 2 notches down. So to do that to the credit rating for a small amount of additional dividend increases is not something that made a lot of sense to us. We were very happy to increase the dividend. We remain committed to cash return to shareholders. But we also need to reflect reality in our dividend planning, significant FX headwinds, we are creating a smaller company, and our earnings per share are below year ago. And we have a responsibility there as you'll appreciate as well. So it's a balancing of those 2 things. I completely get and understand the question. It's a very fair one. But that's where we net it out. I'll leave it there. 
Thank you, everybody, for your questions this morning. We'll be available for the balance of the week to talk to any of us with you. We're very happy about the progress that we're making, but we clearly understand we have more to do. Thanks a lot."

As David Taylor said on the press release we should earlier this morning, we continue to make progress on the transformation we are making to return P&G's results to a balance of strong top line growth, bottom line growth and cas",4934,"Thanks, and good morning. As David Taylor said on the press release we should earlier this morning, we continue to make progress on the transformation we are making to return P&G's results to a balance of strong top line growth, bottom line growth and cash generation. We achieved a significant milestone this quarter in the transformation of the product portfolio with the exit of the Batteries business. We delivered another strong quarter of productivity improvement and cost savings and we increased investments in innovation, advertising and selling capacity to enhance our long-term prospects for faster, sustainable top line growth and value creation. 
We do continue to operate in a challenging and volatile macro environment. Market growth rates on both the volume and value basis have decelerated due mainly to slower growth in developing markets. We entered the year expecting the market to grow close to 3% to 4% globally. We now expect 3%. There are more flashpoints across the globe than at any time in recent memory with significant economic and political instability impacting incomes and consumption in many large and important markets, Russia, the Ukraine, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the balance of the Middle East, Turkey, Nigeria, Argentina, Venezuela, Brazil. We generate more than 10% of our annual sales and profit in these markets. Currencies have weakened across the board since the start of our fiscal year. While the dollar has softened a bit recently, we still face up to $1 billion after tax net earnings impact versus year ago, a $200 million increase since just the start of December. Across 4 years, FX has reduced net earnings by about $4 billion after tax, nearly 40% of fiscal year 2012 net earnings. 
Against this backdrop, we remain focused on large opportunities in our control, executing what is the largest transformation in our company's history, step changing cost and cash productivity, transforming our portfolio, strengthening our organization and culture and reaccelerating top line growth with strengthened category business models and innovation plans and, where appropriate, improved value equations. This transformation is aimed at delivering balanced top and bottom line growth and leadership value creation. I'm going to talk briefly about each of the transformation steps, productivity, portfolio, organization and top line reacceleration before getting into the details of the quarter. 
We continued to dramatically improve cost and cash productivity with significant upside still ahead. Our original 5-year cost of goods savings target was $6 billion. We expect to deliver over $7 billion by the end of this year, $1 billion or more above our initial target. We've reduced manufacturing enrollment by 15% over the last 3 years. This includes new staffing necessary to support capacity additions. On a same-site basis, manufacturing enrollment is down 20%. We're targeting a 25% to 30% cumulative reduction by the end of fiscal 2017. In February 2012, we announced that we would reduce nonmanufacturing overhead by 10% over 5 years. As of March 31, we've reduced these roles by more than 24%, almost 2.5x the original target. We expect to meet our latest target of 25% to 30% by the end of this year, 1 year ahead of schedule. 
Including divestitures, we'll reduce nonmanufacturing roles by about 35% by the end of fiscal 2017. We're reducing nonworking marketing expenditures, costs that do not impact reach, frequency or continuity of our advertising and trial generation programs. We were spending $2 billion per year on agency fees. Last year, we reduced the roughly 6,000 agencies we work with by nearly 40% and cut agency and production spending by about $370 million. We're aiming for an additional $200 million of agency-related savings this year, reinvesting those savings in advertising and sampling of consumer-preferred products. 
Net of reinvestments and innovation, selling, media and sampling, productivity has enabled us to deliver constant-currency growth and operating profit margin improvement in each of the last 3 fiscal years, driving double-digit constant-currency core earnings per share growth in each of those years. We're on track to improve gross and operating margins by triple-digit indices, both including and excluding currency impacts again this fiscal year. We're driving productivity up and down the income statement and across the balance sheet. Inventory days are down, payable days are up, balance sheet productivity has enabled us to extend our long track record of very strong adjusted free cash flow productivity, 102% last fiscal year, 101% in Q1, 117% in Q2 and 105% in the quarter we just completed, even as we spend capital to transform our supply chain. 
We continued to maintain our position as one of the strongest cash generators among competitive peers and comparable mega-cap companies. We're among the top companies in returning cash to shareholders. Over the past decade, we have returned more than $118 billion in cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchase. We said 4 years ago that we needed to make cost and cash productivity part of our culture, as integral to our culture as innovation. We've made significant progress and we have significant opportunity. Our strong track record and our line of sight to additional opportunity both inform our intent to save as much as another $10 billion in cost over the next 5 years. Our supply chain transformation is in its early stages, first, in North America and Europe, then in Latin America and in India, Middle East and Africa. We're in an investment mode now, with savings to start in 3 to 4 years. Our new U.S. mixing centers are up and running, putting roughly 80% of volume within 24 hours of store shelves. 
We're constructing multi-category manufacturing sites in geographically strategic locations to replace smaller single category sites in less cost-effective locations. We're upgrading and standardized manufacturing platforms to lower costs and facilitate faster innovation. We're employing smart automation and digitization to improve manufacturing productivity, raw material and finished product logistics and demand planning. We have additional opportunity to optimize working capital and further increase the efficiency of our capital spend. After 2 strong years of savings, we'll enter next year still spending $1.5 billion in agency-related marketing costs, still more room to improve. We'll continue to look for efficiencies in working media with better advertising targeting and earned media campaigns with engaging content. 
As we fully operationalize the new focused 10-category [ph] company, there will undoubtedly be additional opportunities to increase organization efficiency, agility and speed of decision-making. Digitization will continue to enable smart productivity choices. Finally, we'll be working to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our promotion spending. We currently spend about $18 billion in deductions between gross and net sales. We see clear opportunities to improve the effectiveness of the spend for both us and our retail partners and to improve its efficiency. So we're targeting up to $10 billion of additional savings over the next 5 years. We expect to reinvest a significant amount of the savings in R&D and product and packaging improvements, sales capacity and in brand awareness and trial building programs to deliver balanced top and bottom line growth and to create value for share owners. 
In addition to transforming our cost structure, we're transforming our portfolio. Over the past 18 months, we have divested, discontinued or consolidated 55 brands, including the completion of the Duracell transaction at the end of February. We have 50 more brands in the exit process, including the 41 Beauty brands in the transaction with Coty. The S-4 registration statement for the Beauty transaction was filed last week. We're on track to close the deal in the second half of the calendar year. In total, we'll exit 105 brands and all the complexity they create. These brands represent only about 6% of fiscal 2013 profit. Going forward, we're anchoring our portfolio on 10 category-based business units and about 65 brands. These are categories where P&G has leading market positions and where product technologies deliver performance differences that matter to consumers. These 10 businesses have historically grown faster with higher margins in the balance of the company. 
Within these core businesses, we're focusing our offerings, making smart choices for short, mid- and long-term value creation, foregoing bad businesses, even when these choices create near-term top line pressure. In Mexico, for example, we made a choice to discontinue low-tier unprofitable and commoditizing toilet paper products in favor of very profitable high-tier differentiated products. Sales are down 75% but before tax margins have improved by more than 50 basis points from very negative to nicely positive. It will take a few more quarters for the top line drag to dissipate and we'll have a solidly value-accretive business going forward. 
In India, we've made a choice to deprioritize several unprofitable lines of business, which negatively impact short-term top line growth rates but will lead longer term to a much more profitable business that will grow strongly. The strategic portion of our India business is growing at a high single-digit pace. Sales in the portion we're fixing or exiting have been down more than 30%. This top line pain is worth it. We're making significant progress in improving local profit margins, up about 700 basis points. We've gone from losing significant money in India to triple-digit profits in just 2 years. 
We're taking a similar approach in our Fabric Care product portfolio, discontinuing product forms, additives, bars, bleaches and tablets and value-tier detergents that have been a drag on profitability and value creation. These choices are causing a top line drag of nearly 1 point on the global Fabric Care business, but profitability and the long-term attractiveness of the business improves. Combined, these choices are causing about a 1 point drag on organic sales growth. We expect this headwind to continue for the balance of the calendar year and then dissipate as annualize more of the impacts. As we come out of this, we'll have stronger top line growth that is worth something on the bottom line. 
We're transforming our organization and culture. We're making many changes that by themselves may seem small and obvious but together are significant and important. As an example, we've made several important changes in how we go to market. We eliminated overlapping resources and duplicative structures and responsibilities of marketing and sales professionals in the global business units and market development organizations, clarifying responsibilities and strengthening accountability. Reflecting this, we changed the name of the market development organizations to selling and market operations, small but very important. 
We're increasing staff -- we're increasingly staffing leadership roles in the selling and marketing operations with leaders who have significant telling experience. We're changing our talent development and assignment planning to drive more mastery and depth. The objective is simple: improve business results by getting and keeping the right people in the right places to develop and apply deep category mastery to winning. Consistent with this, we're dedicating sales resources to categories or sectors. In our larger markets, sales resources have greater accountability back to the categories they serve, which is a change. We're aligning incentives at a lower and more specific level of granularity to better match these responsibilities and to increase accountability. 
Another example of the evolution of our thinking on the organization is what David talked about at CAGNY. He said that P&G is fortunate to consistently source and develop strong talent and that we intend to maintain our develop-from-within approach. But there are times when the best talent for a role may not be inside our organization. Going forward, we're going to look at outside hiring more often than -- often when we need it to field the best team possible. The bottom line is that we're committed to getting, keeping and growing the right talent in the right place to better drive business results. 
Again, each of these changes may seem small and rather obvious but collectively they are big and important changes for our organization and culture. A very important area of transformation is reacceleration of top line growth. We expect to make progress in all 10 product categories, but we're putting specific emphasis against the 4 largest categories: Baby Care, Fabric Care, Hair Care and Grooming; and the 2 largest markets: the U.S. and China. These 4 categories represent over 60% of sales and profit. These 2 countries represent nearly 50% of sales and more than 50% of profit. We're growing our Fabric Care business with consumer-preferred brands and product offerings like our premium performance and premium-priced unit dose detergents and our market-leading and market-expanding scent bead fabric enhancers. We're exiting slower-growing, lower-priced, more commoditized product forms where it's more difficult to distinguish our products and create value. 
Fabric Care results in the U.S. demonstrates what's possible when we deliver superior value with best-in-class performance at a modest price premium. The U.S. laundry detergent market is continuing to grow behind these efforts, with the category up more than 4 points on a value basis over the last 3-, 6- and 9-month periods. The same is true for fabric enhancers. Spurred by the rapid growth of scent beads, the U.S. fabric enhancers category is growing, up more than 6 points on a value basis over the last 3-, 6- and 9-month periods. Our share is growing. P&G's U.S. laundry detergent and fabric enhancer value shares were each up nearly 1 point in the March quarter. 
We will continue to be the innovation leader in Fabric Care. In North America, we're introducing a new regimen on Tide and Downy that addresses the odor problems common to athletic wear. 70% of consumers wear athletic gear multiple times each week. The odor defense collection, anchored by innovation on Tide PODS brings a proprietary formula of enzymes and surfactants that break down and remove stubborn soils and residues for a great clean and fresh scent. Paired with the added cleaning power of Tide Odor Defense Rescue laundry booster and Downy Fresh Protect odor defense beads, this regimen promises to eliminate odors from the fast-growing market of athleisure clothes people are wearing far beyond the gym. 
Next month, we start our learning market on Tide Pure Clean liquid detergent in the U.S. Naturals is a large and growing segment in several categories, but Naturals are only about 3% of the laundry category. Unlocking growth in Naturals is about solving the tension between green and clean. People want performance and sustainability. Pure Clean provides a cleaning power of Tide with 65% bio-based ingredients and is produced with 100% renewable wind power electricity in a facility operating with 0 manufacturing waste to landfill. We're launching better performing and more profitable new compact liquid detergents in Russia, Turkey, Mexico, Brazil and China. In Russia and Turkey, where we launched superior compact liquid detergents early last calendar year, P&G share of liquid detergents are up 7 points and 14 points, respectively. We've increased sampling in new washing machines, a key point of category entry and change for consumers. Last fiscal year, we distributed 5 million samples in washing machines globally. This fiscal year, we'll distribute about 17 million. In calendar year 2016, we'll distribute 30 million samples of our best-performing products. 
In U.S. Baby Care, strong innovation, consumer communication, trial programs and a robust online presence have led to strong growth for Pampers. Pampers value share of U.S. diapers was up more than 1.5 points last fiscal year and was up 1 point in the March quarter. Pampers latest Swaddlers and Cruisers innovation Extra Absorb Channels is off to a good start in the new calendar year with Swaddlers and Cruisers share up more than 1 point in the last quarter. We strengthened investments in brand awareness and trial at the point-of-market entry. 70% of new moms in the U.S. will receive samples of our best products through our prenatal baby shower and hospital programs. 
Last fiscal year marked the seventh consecutive year of sales and value share growth for the Luvs brand in the U.S. However, results have been down so far this year following a significant price reduction taken by our primary competitor. We're taking steps to improve the awareness, trial and consumer value of Luvs. We're increasing equity-building advertising, strengthening in-store programs that have product and packaging improvements slated for launch next quarter. Baby Care results have been softer in other markets. To address this, we've strengthened our value proposition in several markets and accelerated premium innovation on both taped and pull-on diapers to restore our competitiveness at the top end of the market. We're strengthening our selling resources and programs for baby stores and we're improving our point-of-market entry programs to deliver higher awareness and trial of Pampers among new moms. 
In Hair Care, we launched our new conditioner innovation on Pantene in the U.S. last quarter. Pantene's new breakthrough conditioner technology delivers weightless conditioning, addressing the most significant consumer trial barrier in the category. The new conditioner innovation is a consumer blind test winner versus our best competition in North America, China and Japan. We continue to strongly support Head & Shoulders, one of our steadiest and strongest growing brands, delivering over 8% compound average shares -- excuse me, sales growth over the past 10 years, even with significant currency impacts. Organic sales for Pantene and Head & Shoulders were each up high single digits in the U.S. in the March quarter. 
Gillette has delivered steady growth in international markets so far this fiscal year behind strong innovation, advertising and sampling programs. Gillette is holding or growing value share in each region outside the U.S. The growth in international markets has been offset by soft results in the U.S. To improve our growth and the growth of the market, we're investing in innovation, new user trial and improved consumer value. We're expanding our performance advantage at the top end of the market. Our most recent cartridge innovation, Gillette Fusion ProShield, launched last quarter, ProShield with lubrication before and after the blades, shields against irritation during every shave. Early consumption results in the U.S. have been tracking ahead of plan. We're supporting a broader range of our product ladder from our best product, Fusion FlexBall ProShield, to MACH3 to premium price and superior performance disposables, with stronger consumer value communication. We're facing more aggressive competition at lower price points, and we will respond to ensure our brands remain a superior consumer value. 
We've stepped up new trial activities in the U.S. with our 18th birthday sampling program. We've put Fusion ProGlide FlexBall razors in the hands of nearly 80% of young men, over 2 million samples last year, a 33% increase over the prior year level. We've now began sampling the FlexBall razor handle and the ProShield cartridge, our very best combination of shaving technologies. 
We're not standing still in the other categories. We delivered solid organic sales growth in the U.S. this quarter in the Feminine Care, Family Care and Home Care categories, all big and profitable businesses for us. P&G continues to be the innovation leader in our U.S. categories. In the IRI Innovation Pacesetters Report just published, P&G had 4 of the top 10 innovations and 6 of the top 13. Top innovations recognized for 2015 sales were Tide Simply Clean & Fresh, Always Discreet, Fusion ProGlide FlexBall, Venus Swirl, Febreze Unstopables and Tide Plus Ultra Stain Release. Overall, in the U.S., organic sales were up 2%, in line with underlying market growth of our categories. Organic volume was up 3% for the quarter. 
We're making progress in China, but there's still more work to do. We narrowed sales declines by half this quarter and expect to improve again next quarter. We recently upgraded our Pampers Premium diaper pants to improve fit and softness, and we have new innovations coming soon on mid-tier pants and premium taped diapers. Oral-B super-premium toothpaste, launched in over 700 stores last quarter, reaching roughly a 5% share in those outlets. We'll triple distribution on this item this quarter. Ariel is growing in China following the concentrated liquid detergent launch in January. Gillette Fusion FlexBall has driven male razor system share growth over the past 3-, 6- and 12-month periods. And SK-II continues to deliver very strong growth, with sales for the quarter up nearly 20%. So some bright spots are emerging, but it will take time to get fully back to target growth rates. We're realistic that improvements in top line growth won't happen overnight and they won't happen in a straight line, but they will continue to improve over time. 
Let me move now to the quarter we've just completed and to the outlook for the fiscal year. Organic sales were up 1% for the quarter versus the prior year. The impact from the portfolio cleanup efforts I discussed earlier was about a 1 point drag on organic sales growth. All-in sales were down 7%, including a 5 point headwind from foreign exchange, 3 points from the combination of Venezuela deconsolidation and minor brand divestitures. Core earnings per share were $0.86, down 3% versus the prior year. Core gross margin increased 270 basis points. Core operating margin increased 300 basis points. This quarter's core earnings per share results included a next FX headwind of approximately $90 million after tax or $0.03 per share. Comprised of a negative spot rate impact of about $230 million, which was partially offset by $140 million balance sheet revaluation impact in the base period that did not recur this year. 
Venezuela continues to be a difficult market and was also a drag on March quarter results. At the beginning of the fiscal year, we announced our decision to deconsolidate our Venezuelan operations, no longer reporting sales or profits from products locally manufactured and sold in Venezuela. We continue to recognize sales and profit on products sold to our Venezuelan subsidiaries from non-Venezuelan P&G entities. We've highlighted at CAGNY that a disruption in our Venezuelan subsidiaries ability to access dollars to pay for these imports of finished products could have a negative impact on our top and bottom line results. 
We've been unable to access U.S. dollars at any size since November. And as a result, reported no sales or profit for Venezuela in the March quarter. This caused a 20 basis point organic sales growth reduction on the quarter. On the bottom line, the total impact of Venezuela was $0.05 per share or 6% in terms of core EPS. Assuming these financing constraints continue, the bottom line impact on the year will be up to $0.10 per share or minus 3%. The core effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.2%, up 800 basis points versus last year, a $0.10 per share impact on core earnings per share and 11 percentage point impact on core earnings per share growth. The base period tax rate was unusually low due to the geographic mix of earnings and due to audit settlements. And the current period rate was inflated by a valuation allowance against net operating loss carryforwards. These 2 items account for about 6 points of the 8-point change in the tax rate. These 3 impacts, FX, Venezuela and tax were a combined core earnings per share growth headwind of 20% this quarter. 
On an all-in GAAP basis, earnings per share were $0.97 for the quarter, up 29% versus the prior year. We generated $2.5 billion in free cash flow, yielding 105% adjusted free cash flow productivity. We returned approximately $2.9 billion to shareholders this quarter through a combination of $1.9 billion in dividends and $1 billion of share repurchase. In addition, we received approximately $4.2 billion of stock through the Duracell transaction. Earlier this month, we increased the dividend 1%, making this the 60th consecutive year the company has increased the dividend. The size of the dividend increase reflects FX headwinds, the cash impacts from streamlining the strengthening of the business unit portfolio and our plans to increase investments in the business to accelerate top line growth. 
Moving to guidance, our outlook for the fiscal year reflects 4 large factors driving lower earnings in the fourth quarter. First, lower nonoperating income. We expect about $100 million less in the fourth quarter this year versus last year. Second, tax. The Q4 tax rate will likely be, again, about 800 basis points higher than last year due to the geographic earnings mix and audit settlement benefits in the base period. Third, investment levels. We'll have a significant increase in advertising expense, coupled with continued reinvestment in R&D and selling capabilities. Fourth, FX. We'll continue to see significant spot rate impacts on both the top and bottom line in Q4, and unlike the last 2 quarters, will not have offsets from base period balance sheet revaluation changes. Combined, we expect these 4 factors to lower Q4 net earnings by more than $800 million and reduce core earnings per share by more than 32% versus the prior year. 
For the fiscal year, we're maintaining our outlook for organic sales growth of in line to up low single digits versus fiscal 2015. As I mentioned, our outlook assumes we'll no longer benefit from sales of finished product to our deconsolidated subsidiaries in Venezuela. This would be roughly a 30 basis point drag on Q4 organic sales growth. In addition, the roughly 1 point drag from the core portfolio cleanup will continue into Q4. We expect FX will have a 6 to 7 percentage point impact on all-in sales growth for the fiscal year. Also, the combined impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation and minor brand divestitures will have a 2 to 3 percentage point drag on all-in sales growth. Taken together, we expect all-in sales will be down high single digits versus fiscal 2015. 
We continue to expect constant-currency core earnings per share growth in the mid-single-digits for the year. Foreign exchange will reduce net earnings by approximately $1 billion versus the prior year, resulting in a 9 percentage point or $0.35 per share impact on core earnings per share growth for the year. With 1 quarter left in the year, we're tightening and improving our core earnings per share guidance range from down 3% to 8% to down 3% to 6%, which puts the midpoint of the range at $3.59 per share versus last year's core earnings per share of $3.76. Fiscal year earnings per share guidance includes headwinds of 10 percentage points from the combined impacts of Beauty deal expenses, Venezuela deconsolidation, lower nonoperating income and a higher tax rate. 
Adjusting for these items, our guidance translates to modest core earnings per share growth with meaningful growth, excluding foreign exchange. We expect the core effective tax rate to be 25% or higher for fiscal 2016, more than 4 points higher than last year, roughly a 6-point headwind on core earnings per share growth. We're raising our fiscal year outlook for free cash flow to 100% or more of adjusted net earnings. We expect to reduce outstanding shares at a value of over $8 billion through a combination of direct share repurchases and the shares that were exchanged in the Duracell transaction. In addition, we expect dividend payments of more than $7 billion. In total, $15 billion to $16 billion in dividend payments, share exchanges and share repurchases. We expect all-in GAAP earnings per share to be up in the range of 46% to 51%. 
Moving briefly to 2017. David is going to join me on our next call scheduled for Tuesday, August 2, to discuss our plans and outlook for fiscal 2017. We're currently in the early planning stages for next year and we'll give guidance on the next call, but there are a few things to keep in mind as you review your estimates between now and then. We expect improvements in organic sales growth, though core portfolio cleanup will still be a headwind. Venezuela will be a drag in the first 2 quarters of the year. If currency exchange rates hold steady through next fiscal year, FX should be much more manageable than it's been for the past few years, but we'll still have a headwind on both the top and bottom line, particularly in the first 2 quarters. Likewise, if commodity costs hold at recent levels, we'll continue to see a modest tailwind in the first half or so of next fiscal year. 
We'll be increasing investment in R&D, in product and packaging programs and sales capacity and in brand awareness and trial-building programs to accelerate top line growth in a responsible and sustainable way. We'll defend the relevant consumer value of our brands and invest to address value gaps if and when they emerge. We'll do everything we can from a productivity standpoint and we'll continue delivering on our commitment of cash return to shareholders. There'll be an EPS benefit from shares eliminated via -- with our category exits, though the exact amount of which will depend on when we close -- when we actually close the Coty transaction. We'll obviously give more specifics on all of this in our next call, but we thought it might be helpful to offer you these early thoughts. 
To sum up, we continue to make progress on returning P&G to balanced top and bottom line growth. We're nearing the completion of the portfolio transformation. We upgraded and are sustaining strong cost savings and cash productivity momentum. We're strengthening the organization and culture and we're investing to accelerate top line growth. That concludes our prepared remarks for this morning. As a reminder, business segment information is provided in our press release and will be available on slides which we posted on our website, www.pg.com, following the call. 
Now I'll be happy to take your questions."

So is this a level we should expect going forward? Or does it still move materially from here?

Perhaps you can break out what the impact of price was between developed and developing markets to help us out there. And then just lastly, you tightened the core EPS range, as you mentioned, but given that there's just 1 quarter left in the year but you left the full year organic sales target unchanged, which obviously implies an incredibly wide range for Q4. So maybe can you refine your expectations a bit there and the main factors that impact where you fall within that range."

You're coming back strong with 4 questions in 1. But it's great to have you back. In terms of the advertising rates, we were up about, I think, 130 basis points in the quarter. We expect to be up about 140 basis points on the second half. So there'll be some sequential strengthening of that comparison as we move forward. I tried to say 8 or 9 times in our prepared remarks that we will be investing to grow our top line. We'll be funding that with productivity and bringing the bottom line with it. There has not been a significant increase in the percentage of our business being sold on promotion nor has there been a significant increase in the depth of those promotions. We have in several markets used sales deducts as a way to adjust pricing back to competitive levels where we got -- where we took more of a price increase than our competitors ultimately did. So you see that impact, and I would just think about price adjustment and value gap closures as being the explanation for the change in the price component of the top line. And as for fourth quarter guidance, we just provided it. It is what it is. And I think that the range, you rightly pointed out, is a wide one. That's the reality of the world that we're operating in, with very significant volatility, whether it's input costs, FX, geopolitical and geo-economic dynamics and the consumer impacts of things like oil prices.

Yes, it has increased over time, driven in part by expansion of modern retailers on a global basis. We brought that business model with them to other parts of the world that previously were, for example, largely distributor and wholesaler markets. There is significant opportunity within that bucket of spend. The first and foremost, increase its effectiveness, ensuring that we're spending it in ways that drive category growth on a sustainable basis as opposed to short-term pantry loading, for example. Shifting spending to our best product offerings to increase the trial and repurchase rates of those items with consumers. Again, not driving so much the, in some cases, the lower end of the portfolio. The vehicles that we use to communicate in-store and how those are constructed and utilized in conjunction with our retail partners. So there are just massive opportunities to improve the effectiveness of that spend as we work to reaccelerate the top line growth. There are also efficiency opportunities, and this is one of those unique and wonderful costs, if there is such a thing, where if you're able to reduce it, benefits both the top line and the bottom line. But we'll be very judicious as we do that. Again, really, wanting where we have opportunities to shift that from ineffective spend to effective spend is the primary activity in the space. But I'm convinced that with an $18 billion spend, we'll -- we have efficiency opportunities."

First and foremost, we need to accelerate our top line growth rate, and there's no debate about that. The reason that we've talked a little bit about not following share out the window, we can be gaining shares in categories that are declining, and that's not going to grow our top line. What we need to be doing as innovation leaders in our categories is getting the market growing through that innovation and gaining the share of that growth. That's exactly what we're doing in Fabric Care in the U.S. for example, and it's taken awhile, but it's worked extremely well. And the category is growing 4%. We're getting a disproportionate part of that growth. And that's what we are looking to do across our product categories. So it's bringing innovation to the market, which grows categories for the industry, for our retail partners, and allows us to gain a little bit of share in the process. And look, we need to be growing at the rate of the market or better. But market growth is an important element of that in terms of how attractive that growth ultimately ends up being. So it's kind of -- it's all of the above. In terms of earnings per share upside from Duracell and Coty, I think we've talked before that we plan to be non-dilutive from day 1. We've been working for 2 years on the stranded overheads that were -- that are going to be created as a result of this, and we also expect that the portfolio that we're going to be left with is a healthier, stronger portfolio that will grow and will grow more profitably."

As I said in the -- in our early remarks, we're reinvesting in not just advertising. I went through 3 examples of sampling to generate trial, getting our best products in the hands of consumer. That's a significant portion of investment. I mentioned as well expanding our sales capacity, that's happening across some of the newer channels, but also in our existing channels.

There are clear opportunities to continue to improve our first moment of truth, which is a lot about the package, and we'll continue to do that as well. In terms of specific numbers for next year across those buckets, we're in the early stages of putting our plan together for next year, but our intent is clear, I think. And as I said, we'll continue to work to fund those investments through continued productivity savings as well.

In terms of volume and the impact that it's had on our fixed-cost rates, if you will, in the supply chain, it's definitely had an impact. The good news is that we're right in the middle of a supply transformation, and that's going to be multi-geography in nature.

I know you said that your business is showing some signs of improvement down not as much given some of the premium-priced innovation you're doing. But how confident are you in the strategy of pursuing what sounds like almost exclusively premium-priced innovation? Because it does sound like some of the other competitors out there that there's also pricing competition going on in some of your big markets. So if you can talk about China more broadly and the strategy there, that would be great. And then my second question has to do with your comment that, I think, we've heard. I mean, I think we heard it from Bob McDonald a few years ago, the P&G was increasingly open to hiring from the outside, and I know we've had certain partnerships in R&D stuff. But in terms of actual physical new hires outside of kind of legal and tax and HR, I can't think of anybody on the business side who you actually have brought in from outside. So given that you've been saying that for so long, are there particular areas where you think that, that is a priority? Is it marketing? Is it something in specific businesses?

That big middle of the portfolio is very important, and we're not losing sight of that. We have fantastic positions in that portion of the market, which we intend to maintain and build. But we also want to take advantage of the higher growth portion of the market, which is currently the premium tiers. 50% of consumption is currently in those tiers across our categories. They're growing at high-single to double-digit rates. And we obviously want to participate in that, not only for the sales and volume benefit, but also for the equity halo that it provides to our brands. So it is clearly an ""and"" strategy, not an ""or"" strategy. Your question on our approach to bringing in talent from outside the organization, I think David was very clear about that at CAGNY, that we are going to maintain broadly or promote from within and develop from within, most importantly, our program. But we are going to put the right people, the best people in jobs across the organization. And when that requires that we go outside, we'll do that. We have, for example, hired a number of experienced salespeople. I mentioned building our sales capacity. As we're dedicating selling organizations to categories and sectors, there are cases where we can find more experience outside the company, people who had 10 years' experience in a category where we may be underrepresented. And that we're bringing those people in. The whole area of digital marketing and media, where we need resources, we're either partnering with agencies who have that capability; in some cases, we're bringing it in. I don't think that's limited to any portion of the organization. That includes line management and -- but we're going to approach this deliberately. Having someone come in just for the sake of having them come in and being able to say that we're making progress there is obviously not something that interests us very much.

There's still situations where we're going to be taking additional pricing, where we feel that, that will be matched. So it'll continue to be dynamic, but a little bit less going forward. On the volume piece, I certainly don't have a crystal ball, but if I look at what happened historically, that volume has come back over time. And sometimes it depends on the market. Volume reacceleration in markets like Latin America has been fairly quick. In other markets, for example, Russia, the last crisis, it took us 3 years to get back from a volume standpoint.

You talk about all this reinvestment on a go-forward basis, but is there some way that we can quantify it or measure it, not just in terms of what the advertising spend is on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but is there some sort of a bogey out there or benchmark that sort of helps us figure out, basically, where you're headed?"

We're literally just beginning the process of putting our plans together for next year. To give you some insight into that process though, we're going to go through each of the large category country combinations and assure you that we're efficient in terms of our investment to change the growth profile, and ideally, to grow at the market, and then as we go through the year, try to improve that. I'm not going to call a quarter in which that's going to happen. It's going to take time, as I said in the prepared remarks. It's not going to be a straight line, but I think we'll see improvement over time. And there's no bogey in terms of that number related to investment. This is a strategic planning at the category country brand level that we're just beginning to do. You've seen the increased investment profile in the back half of this fiscal year, that's the only one I really have real insight into at this point. And I certainly wouldn't expect the investment levels to be lower as we go forward into next year."

I think that's also an important point in understanding the difference between the 2% last quarter and the 1% this quarter in terms of organic sales growth. That and Venezuela really explained all of that change. So thanks for asking that question. I think it would be -- in terms of the long-term algorithm, that has not changed. We want to be growing with the market to slightly ahead of the market. And we believe that with the continued productivity progress, that should translate into mid- to high single-digit earnings per share growth. I do think that getting back fully to that algorithm next year would be difficult. But again, we're just beginning to put our plans together."

So should we consider $10 billion as the cap and a bit of stretch goal that may not be achieved? And also on the supply chain side, you mentioned sort of upfront investment, savings will build in 3 to 4 years. Should we be thinking about the delivery against those savings as be a further out, so a bit more protracted than what we've seen over the last $10 billion?"

So from a -- if I just look at the difference between value growth and volume growth in the markets to get at your question of how much of it is pricing. In developed markets, if I just look over the past year, basically, volume growth has actually accelerated a little bit, gone from 0 to 1. Value growth is unchanged at about 1. And in developing markets, value growth has gone from 9 to 6, volume growth has gone from 2 to 1. So I think with those -- that set of numbers, you can put the picture together that you're looking to put together. In terms of the savings target and the semantics around up 2, that's -- those are the words we've used since we first start talking about this back at CAGNY. And that doesn't imply a cap. There's no reason to cap, but it does imply a range of outcomes. And last time we said $10 billion, we over delivered that. So again, there was no cap. I think $10 billion is a good number to shoot for, and I'm sure we'll get somewhere close to that, if not there. You may recall a conversation that some of us we're having 4 years ago on this topic, and there was a lot of concern about whether we would actually get to $10 billion. And I said again, that's the right number to shoot for, and if we only get to $9 billion, I'm going to be pretty happy. And I look at it the same way this time around. So really no change there. On the supply chain transformation, that particular portion of the savings will be -- will come later, as we've indicated since we started talking about supply chain transformation. I wouldn't take that as indicative of the entire program. Last time around, it was pretty evenly paced across the fiscal years. That's not the design intent, that's just how it felt. And I don't see a reason for it to fall significantly different than that this time. Remember though, and I know you know this, we are going to be reinvesting a lot of these savings. And on relative basis, more of that investment acceleration, if you will, we'll occur in the early years. And then as that -- it gets fully in place, it will allow us to get less of the year-to-year impact."

One is, I know you're pretty reluctant to talk about 2017 guidance on this call. But it would seem that analysts and investors have at least been interpreting some sort of message from you guys, given many EPS numbers have come down over the past month or so. And significantly, more negatively it would seem, then, Jon, some of the messaging you've talked about at least on this call. So I'm trying to get a sense -- especially with the Coty benefit or the kind of share retirement benefit. So I'm trying to get a sense of recap of your thinking on 2017 in terms of reinvestments and returns, because clearly, that some math are just being interpreted out there. And if you can balance kind of the ""continued progress"" that you're CEO says versus the not straight line that you mentioned and give us a little more color, I think, would be appreciated, because there's some message getting out clearly. The second question is, Jon, you joked a few years ago that you wouldn't want to be CFO of P&G at a time when the dividend didn't grow. And I think, we're all collectively glad that it did grow. But can you give us some more color on the 1% dividend increase? I mean, shareholders have been waiting around for you guys for quite some time. You've had some very challenging times. The macros have been very challenging other than your peer group suggest that they increased their dividend a little bit more aggressively than yours. And I get your dividend yield, and I get your payout ratio. But what would, in the end, be the true cost of a slight ratings downgrade here to reward shareholders a little bit more aggressively?"

So I'm not sure what message is being received. In terms of the message we're providing, it's very much the one you described to David just a minute ago, which is continued progress on both of the top and bottom line as well as our cash flow. And obviously, we want to accelerate all of that as quickly as we're able, but do it in a sustainable, responsible way. And as I indicated, we're just putting our plans together for next year, and we'll see what amount of progress we make. Our competitors don't sit still. Markets are volatile. And so that's where the not straight line comment comes in. I just think that's a reflection of reality. The Coty benefit in terms of the share retirement will depend on exactly when those shares get retired, but there should definitely be a benefit associated with that. And we view that as part of the overall equation. In terms of the dividend increase, as you know, we're very committed to the principle of cash return to shareholders. Over the last 10 years, as I mentioned earlier, we've returned $118 billion. This year, between dividends and share repurchases and share exchange, we'll effectively return $15 billion to $16 billion. There is not a lot of juice, if you will, to the amount of cash available from a borrowing standpoint between our current credit rating and 1 or 2 notches down. So to do that to the credit rating for a small amount of additional dividend increases is not something that made a lot of sense to us. We were very happy to increase the dividend. We remain committed to cash return to shareholders. But we also need to reflect reality in our dividend planning, significant FX headwinds, we are creating a smaller company, and our earnings per share are below year ago. And we have a responsibility there as you'll appreciate as well. So it's a balancing of those 2 things. I completely get and understand the question. It's a very fair one. But that's where we net it out. I'll leave it there. 
Thank you, everybody, for your questions this morning. We'll be available for the balance of the week to talk to any of us with you. We're very happy about the progress that we're making, but we clearly understand we have more to do. Thanks a lot."

I am joined this morning by our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, David Taylor; and by our Vice President of Investor Relations, John Chevalier. 
I plan to take you through the quarter and provide an update on productivity and our portfolio project. David will discuss our efforts to accelerate top line growth. We'll briefly review progress in each of our 10 business categories and will discuss our plans to further strengthen our organization and culture, all to reliably drive balanced top and bottom line growth. 
We're making progress in moving P&G's results to a balanced top line, bottom line and cash flow growth. The increased investments in innovation, advertising and sales coverage to enhance our long-term prospects for faster, sustainable top line growth and stabilize top line growth rates in several key markets. We've delivered another strong year of productivity improvement and cost savings to help fund this. Cash flow continues to be strong with fiscal year adjusted free cash flow productivity of 115%. 
Organic sales for the quarter were up 2%. This includes about a 1 point drag from the combination of the cleanup work we're doing within the ongoing portfolio and the impact of reduced finished product sales to our Venezuelan subsidiaries. As we get through the cleanup work and annualize the Venezuela headwinds, we'll be closer to 3% growth. 
Importantly, the sales growth was volume-driven, with organic volume growing 2%. Organic volume was ahead of year-ago in every segments ranging from plus 1% to plus 5%. Organic sales grew in every segment ranging from plus 1% to plus 8%. Organic sales were up 1.5 in developed markets and 3.5 points in developing markets. 
In North America, organic sales grew 2%, roughly in line with underlying market growth, our second consecutive quarter at this level. Organic volume in North America grew 3% for the second consecutive quarter, slightly ahead of underlying market growth. In China, organic sales were in line versus the prior year, an improvement over last quarter and another step toward returning to market level growth or better. All-in sales for the company were down 3%, including the 3 points headwind from foreign exchange and a 2-point drag from the combination of Venezuelan consolidation and minor brand divestitures. 
Core gross margin increased 160 basis points versus the prior year. On a constant-currency basis, core gross margin was up 240 basis points, including 280 basis points of productivity improvements. Core operating margin was down 150 basis points for the quarter due to foreign exchange headwinds and a significant increase in advertising support versus the prior year. On a constant-currency basis, core operating margin was down 30 basis points. Productivity improvements contributed 360 basis points of operating margin benefit in the fourth quarter. 
Core earnings per share were $0.79, slightly above the high end of our implied guidance range. This is a reduction of 15% versus the prior year, due mainly to foreign exchange, lower nonoperating income and a higher tax rate. 
Foreign exchange was a $0.07 per share or $200 million after-tax headwind on fourth quarter earnings. Nonoperating income was $0.02 per share headwind as the base period quarter included higher gains from minor brand divestitures. The core effective tax rate was a $0.06 per share impact in the core earnings per share for the quarter at 23.8%, up 540 basis points versus last year. This is a little better than we initially projected, but still a substantial increase compared to last year. 
These 3 impacts: foreign exchange, nonoperating income and tax, were a combined core earnings per share growth headwind of $0.15 per share this quarter. Adjusting for these impacts, fourth quarter core EPS was up modestly versus the prior year. 
On an all-in GAAP basis, earnings per share were $0.69 for the quarter, up 283% versus the prior year quarter that included a significant onetime impact from the deconsolidation of Venezuelan results. We generated $2.8 billion of free cash flow with 145% of adjusted free cash flow productivity. Over the course of the fiscal year, we generated $12.1 billion in free cash flow, yielding adjusted free cash flow productivity of 115%. 
We were able to reduce outstanding shares at a value of over $8 billion through a combination of share repurchase and shares that were exchanged in the Duracell transaction. We paid dividends of more than $7.4 billion. In total, nearly $16 billion in dividend payments, share exchanges and share repurchase. 
Now looking forward, we continue to focus on large opportunities that should be within our control, executing what is the largest transformation in our company's history, reaccelerating top line growth with strengthened category business models, innovation plans, and where appropriate, improved value equations. Step change in cost and cash productivity, simplifying and strengthening our product portfolio and strengthening our organization and culture, all to win more consistently. This transformation is aimed at delivering balanced top and bottom line growth and leadership value creation. 
Top line growth was our biggest improvement during the year and is enabled by both our productivity efforts and the portfolio strengthening that are underway. I'll talk briefly about these enabling efforts and then turn it over to David for discussion on top line acceleration itself. 
We continue to dramatically improve cost and cash productivity, with significant upside still ahead. We have accelerated and exceeded each of our productivity objectives and have now raised them. Our original 5-year cost of goods savings target was $6 billion. We delivered $7.2 billion, more than $1 billion over our initial target. We delivered cost of goods savings, which were at or above target each over the last 5 fiscal years. We've reduced manufacturing enrollment by 22% over the last 4 years. This includes new staffing necessary to support capacity additions. On a same-site basis, manufacturing enrollment was down about 27% through June 2016 with additional progress planned in fiscal 2017. These figures exclude divestiture impacts. 
In February 2012, we announced that we would reduce nonmanufacturing or overhead enrollment by 10% over 5 years. As of July 1, we reduced roles by nearly 25%, 2.5x the original target. Including divestitures, we will reduce nonmanufacturing or overhead roles by about 35% by the end of fiscal '17. 
While reducing nonworking marketing expenditures, cost that don't impact reach, frequency or continuity of our advertising and trial generation programs. We were spending $2 billion per year on agency fees. 2 years ago, we reduced the roughly 6,000 agencies we work with by nearly 40% and cut agency and production spending by about $370 million. 
In fiscal 2016, we delivered an additional $250 million of agency-related savings, reinvesting these savings in advertising and sampling of consumer-preferred products, over $600 million of savings in 2 years. 
We're driving productivity improvement up and down the income statement and across the balance sheet. Inventory days are down. Payable days are up. Net of reinvestments, innovation, sales coverage, medium sampling, productivity has enabled us to deliver constant-currency gross and operating profit margin improvement and high single to double-digit constant-currency core earnings per share growth in each of the last 4 fiscal years. We improved gross and operating margins by triple-digit indices, both including and excluding currency in fiscal 2016. 
We said over 4 years ago that we needed to make cost and cash productivity as part of our culture as integral to our culture as innovation. We've made significant progress, and we have significant opportunity. Our strong track record and our line of sight to additional opportunity inform our intent to save as much as another $10 billion in cost over the next 5 years. The majority of these savings will again come from cost of goods sold, an area we have consistently met or exceeded our targets. 
Supply chain transformation is in its early stages. First in North America, next in Europe, then in Latin America and India, the Middle East and Africa. We're in investment mode now with savings to ramp up in 2, 3 and 4 years. 
Our new U.S. Mexican centers are up and running, putting roughly 80% of volume within 24 hours of store shelves. On-time deliveries and frequency of deliveries have increased. We've already seen an improvement in customer service levels resulting in improved on shelf ability -- excuse me, availability in the U.S. by more than 1 point to roughly 96%. 
We're constructing multi-category manufacturing sites in geographically strategic locations to replace smaller, single-category sites in less cost-effective locations. We are well underway with the construction of a new site in West Virginia that's scheduled to start production in calendar 2017. We've announced moves of production for some laundry detergent, fabric enhancer, perfume, body wash and haircare products. And we've announced our complete shutdown of the 3 sites. In Europe, we've announced plans to consolidate production of laundry powders, deodorants and hard surface cleaners to fewer plants across our European manufacturing network. We're now beginning the consolidation work in Latin America. 
As we make these moves, we're upgrading and standardizing manufacturing platforms to lower cost and to facilitate faster innovation. We're employing smart automation and digitization to improve manufacturing productivity, monitor finished product logistics and demand planning. We have additional opportunities to optimize working capital and further increase the efficiency of our capital spend. 
After 2 strong years of savings, we'll enter next year still spending about $1.4 billion on agency-related costs, still more room to improve. And as we fully operationalize the new focused 10-category company, there will be additional opportunities to increase organizational efficiency, agility and speed of decision-making, enabled in many cases by digitization and automation. 
Finally, we're working to improve the effectiveness of our promotional spending. We currently spend about $18 billion in production between gross and net sales. We see clear opportunities to improve the effectiveness of the spend for us and our retail partners to build the value of our categories and the share of P&G brands. So again, we're targeting up to $10 billion of additional savings over the next 5 years. We expect to reinvest a significant amount of the savings in R&D and product and packaging improvements, sales coverage and brand awareness and trial-building programs that deliver balanced top and bottom line growth. 
Moving to portfolio. Over the last 18 months, we've divested, discontinued or consolidated 61 brands, including the completion of the Duracell transaction at the end of February. We have 44 more brands in the exit process, including 41 brands in the deal with Coty. We're currently winding down transition support for Duracell. We completed the systems work in standing up the Beauty business for the translation with Coty. We've received antitrust clearance in all markets. We currently remain on track to close a deal with Coty in October 2016. By the end of the fiscal year, we will have exited 105 brands and all the complexity they create. These brands represent only about 6% of base period profit. 
Going forward, our portfolio will be anchored on 10-category-based business units and 65 brands. These are categories where P&G has leading market positions and where product technologies deliver performance differences that matter to consumers. These 10 businesses have historically grown faster with higher margins than the balance of the company. We're moving away from businesses that are more trend-driven, where fashion, fragrance and flavor derive consumer purchase decisions. We're focusing our businesses where product and performance drive purchase decisions. With our clear consumer drops to be done and clear objective measures of performance. These are products that consumers purchase and use on a daily basis, and they're structurally [indiscernible] categories. 
Within these core businesses, we're focusing our offerings, making smart choices for short, mid and long-term value creation. We're growing those business even when these choices create near-term top line pressure. In our Mexico Family Care business, we discontinued low-tier unprofitable and commoditizing products and are focusing instead on very profitable, high-tier differentiated products, moving from double-digit negative margins to double-digit positive margins. 
While we first talked about this a year ago, it took several quarters to sell out remaining inventories of the discontinued products. As a result, the top line dragged fully annualized until the end of this calendar year. 
In India, we've made a similar choice to de-prioritize several unprofitable lines of business, which negatively impacted short-term top line growth rates, but will lead longer term to a much more profitable business that will grow strongly. The strategic part of our India business is growing at a high single-digit pace. Sales in the portion of the business we're fixing or exiting about 15% of the portfolio have been down more than 35%. The top line pain is worth it. We're making significant progress in improving local profit margins, up 750 basis points over the last 2 years. We've gone from losing significant money in India to triple-digit profits in just 2 years. 
We're taking a similar approach in our Fabric Care product portfolio, discontinuing product forms, additives, bars, bleaches and tablets and value-tier detergents that have been a drag on profitability and value creation. These choices are causing a top line drag on the Global Fabric Care business, but improve the profitability and the long-term attractiveness of the business. 
[indiscernible] eliminated simplify our Olay lineup causing incremental drag on sales growth. As we annualize this segment next year and as we focus our innovation and marketing support on the core boutiques and SKUs in the portfolio, we have set the stage for faster, more profitable growth. Combined, these choices are causing about a 1 point drag on organic sales growth. We expect this headwind to continue for the balance of calendar year and then dissipate in the second half of next year as we begin annualizing these effects. 
So that's productivity and portfolio, both on or ahead of track, with -- and this is important, significant amount of benefits still ahead of us. 
I'll now hand over to David to update you on the top line, provide a brief status review across the 10-product categories and talk about important steps we've undertaken to strengthen our organization and culture to more consistently create value."

Our objective is very clear: balanced top and bottom line growth that delivers total shareholder returns that place P&G consistently in the top third of our peer group. A critically important element of our transformation is reacceleration of our top line growth to reach and sustain organic sales growth at or slightly ahead of underlying growth that the markets where we compete. Productivity improvement and cost savings are a necessity in this effort, providing fuel for innovation, advertising, sales coverage and trial and sampling to grow users and usage. 
Top and bottom line growth are not separate endeavors. They reinforce and fuel each other. Now everything in this model starts with delighting consumers and shoppers. Winning at the zero, first and second moments of truth, when consumers research our categories and brands, purchase them in the store or online and use them in homes, winning these critical moments requires consumer and shopper insights that lead to improved product innovations, consumer communication and retail programs that lead to competitive advantages for P&G brands and products. 
Now we're making in accelerating organic sales growth, but we're not yet where we need to be. There's more work to be done. As Jon just shared, organic sales grew in all 5 reporting segments and were in line or higher in 9 of 10 product categories in that April-June quarter. But most of these businesses, the back half of the year was stronger than the first half. Organic sales for the company is essentially flat in the first half of the year and were up 1.5% in the second half. Obvious acceleration, but not where we want to be. 
Let me spend a minute on each of the 10 categories. We're growing our Fabric Care business with consumer-preferred brands and product offerings like our premium performance and premium-priced unit-dosed detergents and are market-leading and importantly expanding [indiscernible] fabric enhancers. We're exiting slow-growing, lower-priced, more commoditized product forms where it's more difficult to distinguish our products and create value. Fabric Care results in the U.S. demonstrate that it's possible when we deliver superior value from best-in-class performance at a modest price premium. The U.S. laundry detergent market is continuing to grow behind our efforts with the category up 4 points last year. 
The same is true for fabric enhancers. Spurred by the rapid growth of scent beads, the U.S. fabric enhancer category is growing, up 7 points on a value basis last year, where scent beads form growing in the mid-20s. Our share is growing. P&G's laundry detergent fabric enhancer value shares were up in fiscal 2016. And we will continue to beat innovation leader in Fabric Care. In North America, we're introducing a new regimen on Tide and Downy that addresses the odor problems common to the growing athletic wear segment. 70% of consumers wear athletic gear multiple times each week. The odor defense collection, anchored by innovation on Tide PODS, brings a proprietary formula of enzymes and surfactants that break down and remove stubborn soils and residues -- residue for a great clean a fresh scent. Now paired with the added cleaning power of Tide odor defense rescue laundry booster and Downy Fresh Protect odor defense beads, this regimen promises to eliminate odors from the fast-growing market of athleisure clothes people wear far beyond the gym. 
We opened [indiscernible] market of Tide Clean liquid detergent in the U.S. Naturals is a large and growing segment in several categories, but naturals are only about 3% of the laundry category currently. Unlocking growth in naturals is about solving the tension between green and clean. People want performance and sustainability. Pure Clean provides the cleaning power of Tide with 65% bio-based ingredients and is produced with 100% renewable wind power electricity in a facility operated with 0 manufacturing waste to landfill. Now it's very early to read results. But after just 5 weeks on shelf, with no TV advertising, Pure Clean is approaching a 1 share of detergents within the market stores. Increasing sampling in the washing machines to [indiscernible] entry point of category and change for consumers. In fiscal 2015, we distributed 5 million examples in washing machines globally. Last fiscal year, we increased that to 17 million. In fiscal 2017, we'll distribute 30 million examples of our best-performing products. 
Turning to Home Care. Our performance in this category has been very strong. Cascade grew sales high single digits last year behind the continued success of Cascade Platinum, our best-performing and most premium-priced detergent. In North America, we increased sampling on Cascade Premium by 20% last year. The Dawn brand delivered its ninth consecutive year of organic sales growth in the U.S. This results has also been strong in Japan and Europe on hand washing liquids and other detergent products. Fabricius had a challenging year, down low singles, but we have innovations coming next fiscal. 
In Hair Care, we launched our new conditioner innovation on Pantene in the U.S. early this calendar year. The new conditioner technology is a consumer-blind test winner versus our best competition in North America, China and Japan. Pantene and Head & Shoulders each delivered solid organic sales growth in the U.S. for the second consecutive year. Herbal Essences was the main drag on the Hair Care growth, down mid-teens last fiscal year. Now we have plans in the works for product, package and consumer communication improvements in fiscal 2017. 
In the Skin and Personal Care category, SK-II had another very strong year with organic sales up mid -- low teens. As Jon mentioned, Olay completed a significant streamlining of SKUs in North America last year. In China, Olay's second biggest market, we're executing a similar streamlining of sales counters, retaining the top-selling and most profitable counters to focus resources where it matters most, on the doors that create the most value. 
On Old Spice, sales were up versus the prior year and accelerated in the second half behind the hardest working collection bundle, that included performance and scent upgrades to Old Spice detergents and body wash than all other deodorants and body washes in the U.S. 
In Grooming, Gillette delivered steady growth in international markets last fiscal, holding or growing value share in each region outside the U.S. behind strong innovation, advertising and sampling programs. The growth in international markets was offset by softer sales in the U.S. To improve our growth and the growth of the market, we are reinvesting in innovation, new user trial and improved consumer value. We completed the global expansion of our very successful Gillette Fusion FlexBall innovation into Asia in 2016. We explained in our performance advantage of the top end of the market. Our most recent cartridge innovation, Gillette Fusion ProShield, launched in January. We're supporting a broader range of our product ladder from our best product, Fusion FlexBall ProShield, to Mach3 systems, to premium-priced and superior performance disposables with stronger consumer value communication. 
We're facing more aggressive competition at lower price points, and we will respond to ensure our brands remain as superior consumer value. We're driving trial at point of market entry. We put Fusion, FlexBall razors in the hands of nearly 80% of young men, over 2 million samples last year in U.S. with our 18th birthday sampling program. We're now sampling the FlexBall razor handle and cartridge, our very best combination of shaving technologies. 
Fiscal 2016 was a difficult year in Personal Health Care due to very weak cough/cold season in the U.S. The category was also compared a base period that contained the launch of many new items in the Metamucil and Vicks brands. Even with these headwinds, the category delivered positive organic sales growth for the year. Organic sales in Oral Care were up low single digits through fiscal 2016 with high single-digit after-tax profit growth behind strong productivity improvements. Sales of our top-performing items growth fastest last fiscal with premium Oral-B power toothbrushes and premium HD toothpaste, each up mid-teens. Organic sales in the 42 Oral-B toothpaste expansion markets were up double digits last fiscal year. 
The solid growth in developed markets was partially offset by lower sales in several developing markets, where we took pricing to offset foreign exchange impacts. In U.S. Baby Care, strong innovation, consumer communication, trial programs and a robust online presence have led to strong growth for Pampers. Pampers value share of U.S. diapers was up 1 point last fiscal. 
Pampers [indiscernible] innovation, extra absorb channels, is driving share growth in the premium-tier diaper category with [indiscernible] increase our share of more than 1 point last fiscal year. We strengthened investments in brand awareness and trial at point of category entry. Now 70% of new moms in the U.S. will see samples of our best products through our prenatal and hospital program. Fiscal 2015 marked the seventh consecutive year of sales and value share growth of the brand in the U.S. However, results were down in fiscal 2016, following a significant price reduction taken by our primary competitor. Now we've taken steps to improve the awareness, trial and consumer value of Luxe. We're increasing equity-building advertising, strengthening in-store programs, and we're currently launching product and improvements. 
In Japan, Pampers value share grew more than 2 points last year. Pampers is now the value share leader in Japan diapers and also the share leader in the pants segment. 
Baby Care results have been softer in other markets. To address this, we strengthened our value proposition in several markets and accelerated premium innovation on both taped and pull-on diapers to restore our competitiveness at the top and of the market. 
We're strengthening our selling resources and programs for baby center stores and e-commerce, and we're increasing investments in point of market entry programs to drive higher awareness and trial of Pampers among new moms. 
[indiscernible] organic sales were up low single-digits for the fiscal year with improvement in them in the second of half, including a strong fourth quarter with mid-single digit organic volume and sales growth. Expansion and innovation such as Always Infinity and Always Discreet have been key drivers of improved top line growth. We've always made consumer value innovations in markets like Russia to restore pricing to competitive levels, which helped in the second half. And Family Care, the top tier segments of the Bounty brands delivered solid organic sales growth last fiscal. Now as Jon discussed, we made the choice to discontinue low-tier products in Mexico, which drove overall category sales down versus the prior year. Global bottom line results were strong with after-tax profits up high single digits in fiscal 2016. We have product and packaging innovations coming this year on the Bounty Basic and Basic brand to improve their positioning with consumers in the U.S. 
Now look briefly at our top 2 markets. First, the U.S. Organic sales and shipment volume was up about 0.5 point in the first half of fiscal year. We accelerated this growth in the back half of the year to plus 2% and 2.5% organic sales and shipments, respectively. The second half growth rates are roughly in line with underlying growth of our categories. We plan to build on this momentum. 
China organic sales were down 5 points last fiscal, but improved sequentially in the third and fourth quarters. The fourth quarter was in line with prior year. Progress, but nothing worth celebrating yet. In fiscal 2017, we'll relaunch product lines in several categories and will implement a new go-to-market program across retailers and distributors in China. These improvements will take some time to fully take hold. Recovery will not be a straight line, but aggregate fiscal year results should improve. 
As we work to accelerate top line growth, enabled by productivity and portfolio choices, we're transforming our organization and culture. We're making many changes that by themselves may seem small and obvious, but together, they are significant and important. 
As an example, we've made several important changes in how we go to market. We've talked previously about eliminating overlapping resources and duplicative structures and responsibilities of marketing sales professionals in the global business units in the market development organizations, clarifying responsibilities and strengthening accountability, reflecting this, awhile back, we changed the name of our market development organizations to selling and market operations, a small but very important change. We're changing our talent development and assignment planning to drive more mastery and depth. The objective is simple. Improve business results by getting and keeping the right people in the right places to develop and apply deep category mastery to win. 
Consistent with this, we've dedicated sales resources to categories or sectors. In our larger markets, sales resources have brought accountability back to the categories they serve, which is also a change. We're running incentives at a lower and more specific level of granularity to better match these responsibilities and increase accountability. P&G is fortunate to consistently source and develop strong talent. And we intend to maintain our develop from within approach. But there are times when the best talent for a role may not be inside our organization. We're now implementing and supplementing key businesses with outside hiring, more often when we need to feel the best team possible. As an example, we've dedicated ample resources to improved category mastery in our North American Personal Health Care sales force. 2 years ago, the average tenure of salespeople within the category was less than 12 months. About half of the salespeople were dedicated only to Personal Health Care and 100% of the people were even new hires coming to P&G with no work experience were transferred to other P&G businesses. Over the last year or so, we've added resources to the consumer Health Care sales force. Almost half of those people had prior Health Care sales experience. Today, 100% of people selling the business are dedicated to Personal Health Care and the average experience level is now more than 5 years of Health Care sales experience inside or outside of P&G. Over the last 2 years, we've added 115 people to the U.S. retail sales force through external hiring, and more than half of them had prior sales experience. Over the last 2 years, we've increased category dedication of the U.S. sales force by 20%, with more than 90% of salespeople now focused on one category. We've doubled the number of experienced external hires last fiscal versus the prior year, bringing an experienced talent at 5 different levels of management, including Vice President level. Experienced hires comprise about 5% of all management hiring in fiscal 2016. 
Bottom line, we've been -- we're committed to getting, keeping and growing the right people in the right place to drive better business results. Again, each of these changes may seem small and rather obvious, but collectively, they're big and important changes for an organization and culture. Each area of transformation, top line acceleration, productivity, portfolio and strengthening our organizational culture requires change. Let me say again what I've said at the CAGNY Conference in February. P&G is ready to adapt, evolve and change whatever is needed to win. We're making good progress in each of these areas, but we know our success will ultimately be graded on the sales, profit, cash and value-creation results we deliver, not on the activities that get us there. We are committed to do everything we can and to change what must be changed to deliver these results. 
Now let me hand it back to Jon to discuss fiscal 2017 guidance, and then I'll be happy to take your questions."

To frame that, I think it's helpful to look briefly at the macro environment that confronts us as we start fiscal 2017. Category growth rate slowed throughout last fiscal year and are currently growing at about a 3% pace for our global foot",847,"Thanks, David. To frame that, I think it's helpful to look briefly at the macro environment that confronts us as we start fiscal 2017. Category growth rate slowed throughout last fiscal year and are currently growing at about a 3% pace for our global footprint. As you know, GDP growth rates have slowed to the point that at least 10 countries have moved to negative interest rates, including Germany, Japan, Denmark, France, Italy, Spain and Switzerland. Political, economic and foreign exchange volatility each continue to have a large impact on the markets and the currencies in which we operate. The recent Brexit decision is but one example of a political disruption impact that has effects on consumer confidence and resulting market growth. The recent coup attempt in Turkey is another example. We continue to face significant FX volatility such as the recent 40% devaluation of the Nigerian currency and 25% devaluation for open market transactions in Egypt. Our ability to ensure supply and stay on shelf in many markets is dependent our ability to source U.S. dollars. Currency exchange constraints in markets such as Egypt, Nigeria, Venezuela, and historically, Argentina, make operations in those countries very difficult to manage and sometimes result in production shutdowns. Net, we continue to face a relatively slow growth volatile world, which is reflected in our fiscal 2017 guidance. We're currently expecting organic sales growth of around 2%. This includes between 0.5 point and 1 point of headwind and the cleanup work within the ongoing 10-product categories. It also includes the remaining 2 quarters of headwind from loss sales from our Venezuelan subsidiary. As we annualize more of the cleanup work and as we made progress in markets like China, we should be getting back towards market level growth rates by fiscal year's end. We expect fiscal 2017 all-in sales growth of about 1%, including a 1 point drag on growth from the net impact of foreign exchange and divestitures. Our bottom line guidance for core earnings per share growth of mid-single digits. This range reflect the volatility of the markets in which we compete and reflects the investments we intend to make in the business to accelerate organic sales growth and sustainable long-term market-constructive and value-accretive way. We'll work with our retail partners to build the value of our categories behind strong product innovation and more effective in-store and online merchandising of our leading brands. We'll reinvest savings to improve product formulations and packaging. Sales [indiscernible] media programs, product sampling and in-store demand creation. We'll also invest in d consumer value equations, correcting value gaps and quickly responding to competitive challenges as they emerge throughout the year. 
This guidance includes the fiscal average share count reduction of approximately 4%, the net outstanding share reductions for the full year impact of the Duracell deal, the Beauty transaction with Coty, discretionary share repurchase and stock option exercises. The actual impact on outstanding shares from the Beauty transaction won't be known until the deal is completed in October and will of course be dependent on stock prices of both companies and the transaction discount. 
We're forecasting reduction in nonoperating income in fiscal 2017 due to lower gains from minor brand divestitures. The core effective tax rates should be roughly in line with the fiscal 2016 level. All-in GAAP earnings per share should increase 45% to 55%, due primarily to the significant onetime gain from the Beauty transaction with Coty. 
Also included in the GAAP earnings per share range are $0.10 per share of noncore restructuring charges. We expect adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% or better, CapEx to be in the range of 5% to 5.5% of sales. Fiscal 2017 will be a year of significant value of return to shareholders. We expect to pay dividends of over $7 billion. In addition, we expect to reduce outstanding shares at a value of approximately of $15 billion through a combination of the direct share repurchase and shares that will be exchanged in the Beauty transaction. In total, over $22 billion in dividend payments, share exchanges and share repurchase. 
To summarize fiscal 2017 guidance, our current forecast calls for around 2% organic sales growth, all-in sales growth will be about around 1%, and we should have a small improvement in profit margins. Nonoperating income will be a headwind, and share count will contribute about 4% of earnings per share benefit. All current rates -- at current rates and prices, FX and commodities are modest headwind to fiscal 2017 earnings. Significant currency weaknesses, commodity increases and additional disruptions are not anticipated within this guidance. While we currently expect FX to only be a small headwind for the year, it will still be a notable headwind in Q1. We'll still be impacted by significant devaluations in the U.K., Argentina, Egypt, Nigeria, among others. We'll also still be annualizing the loss of finished product sales to our Venezuelan subsidiary. 
Please take these factors into account as you consider the quarterly profile of sales and earnings estimate. 
With that, I'll hand it back to David for his closing comments."

The first is, how do you balance market share versus profitability? Because I know the organization has changed. And I looked at some of the Nielsen data, it still looks like the vast majority of the business is losing market share. And then just in terms of the fiscal '17 guidance, can you just give us some color on how much of the incremental $10 billion of savings you think are going to come through for the year? And then just sort of rough cut on what advertising levels are going to be and kind of where you intend to spend the money?"

So in terms of the relative priority market share versus profitability, the demand, in our view, we need to be growing at or slightly ahead of markets in which we're operating. And we fully intend to do that. And as we said, we're going to reinvest a significant portion of the savings that we're generating behind that effort to get back to market share growth. And that will -- that started -- you see it in the numbers in the fourth quarter and will continue as we go forward. Just one thing on share trends. I mean, you're absolutely right in your overall observation. But if you look at across the 5 reporting segments, market share trends past 6 months, past 12 months, were better past 6 months in 5 out of 5 segments. The same holds for the past 3 months versus the past 6 months. So again, 5 out of 5 segments improving. And the same for the past 1 month versus past 3-month comparison. Again, as David very clearly said, we're not where we want to be, but we're starting to see that progress and we invest behind the opportunities that are in front of us. In terms of the savings proration across the 5 years, this program will be a little bit more backloaded than our prior program, in part because of the natures of the projects that are contained in it. Specifically, the supply chain transformation, where as I said, we're in investment mode now and the savings will come 2, 3, 4 years from now. Having said that, there will be significant contributions from productivity again next year, which will give us the ability to increase investment in the business. We're expecting increases in advertising spend this year versus last. Think about it in probably mid-single-digit range. We want to increase, as David said in his remarks, sampling of consumer-preferred products and trial duration. We want to be more relevant in-store and online, and all of that is part of an activity system that we believe will help us restore the market share growth that you would rightly cite as necessary going forward."

So I guess, why aren't you expecting more of the sales recovery and market share payback? And then separately, are you comfortable that the level of spending as we leave fiscal 2017 is the right level of spending behind the business longer term? Should we assume we get back to more of that normal EPS growth algorithm post 2017?"

We made the choice, and I think it's very evident in that we're going to get back to investing at the business of the level we need to. We also demonstrated to be in the second half of the year that we're committed to 4 quarters of brand support. The fourth quarter, we increased meaningfully our media investment versus previous share. And we're going to continue that in fiscal '17. Having said that, we will not stop making key choices where we have businesses that are structurally not profitable. But we think, on balance, the majority of that choices have been made and we'll annualize it through this year. So we actually feel very good. The businesses that we have, especially post the close of Coty, that were very well positioned to grow sequentially. So expect the first half to continue to make progress. Second half will be better. And much like we said at CAGNY, we're going to see just continued building of our business strength behind a very clear choice in investing in brand building and that bias towards point of market entry, bringing new consumers on and investing in innovation both in current brands, but also in our P&G ventures to ensure planning the mid and long term future.

So as you step back and think of what you've observed over the last 3 quarters or is so as CEO, what's your confidence at this point that the people of P&G -- the culture, the organization, because can truly take on both challenges at once? In other words, David, is to productivity culture truly great enough that you can layer on or reemphasize top line focus without risk that you end up kind of breaking the back of the organization, so to speak? And then if I could, just related both on question or 2, for Jon. First is, you may have said this, reaccelerate and reinvest, can you maintain that 100% or so of free cash flow productivity? And second, should we expect a volume-centric organic growth algorithm for '17 similar to what we saw in Q4? Or is there a reason for that to reverse as you move through the year?"

All the transformation variables, the one I'm most confident in is that P&G people are up for the challenge. I think we demonstrated this year, which is clearly the peak in terms of the Duracell transaction, the enormous complexity of the Coty transaction, folks have risen to the occasion, stand those companies, sequentially improving the operating committees and while doing some of the heavy-lifting in both the North America and European supply chain work. So it's a very good point. And I think it sounds you underestimate the amount of additional work beyond operating the businesses, but I think the heaviest load is -- it was this last fiscal year and for the next quarter. So the organization has demonstrated the resiliency. And our P&G survey, the confidence that people have that the choices are right and the confidence they have and pride they have in P&G is at an all-time high. So we're going to build off that and have a lot of confidence in P&G people. The second one on is productivity ingrained? My hope now is that after 5 years of making the kind of improvement we have that we've demonstrated externally, and I believe internally, built the confidence that this is critical and a key enabler for getting back to kind of balanced top and bottom line results we need.

My one worry, though, is that more recently, I feel like some of innovation news is getting a little bit heavy on the strive for volume. Example would be on the odor release product line. Why isn't driving incremental wash loads enough versus it needing to be 3 products to do the job of remove the odors? Same thing on the Tide PODS, right? The advertising with 2 PODS being chopped in the wash, which [indiscernible] the dosing recommendation when the product launched.

And you've seen both the category growth and the share growth associated with it. In the specific comments, we go where the consumer goes and expresses interest and/or frustration. In the athleisure areas an area, they expressed frustration. And so we're trying to address a very specific need some consumers have. And to date, that's tested very, very well. And we're actually quite excited about it bringing some additional users. And it may lead to increased consumption for existing users. Both will be important. And I think it will grow the category a little bit as well. The idea is very much to understand the needs consumers have and ensure that we've got a product offering that meets them. To the extent there's an unmet need, we will continue to innovate. The -- each of the add-on products that we've had the last year, whether it's the fabric enhancer or the base Fabric Care business, I think demonstrated the ability to grow to category and grow their share. And to date, I have not seen an indication that it is causing unneeded proliferation. In fact, as I sit back and look across the company, we have meaningfully less SKUs today than we had a year ago. Many categories are down 10% to 20%, and the number of SKUs they've offered. But what we are doing is tried to bring more meaningful consumer benefits to areas that are underserved or needs are unmet. And the last comment I'd make on the 2 PODS instruction, if you look at consumer habits today, they have higher capacity washing machines. And some consumers are putting meaningfully more into each load and what you're trying to do is provide consumers with the understanding of what is the best amount of detergent or a number of pods to use to get ideal performance. And in the U.S. at least, many consumers are underdosing. And this will allow consumers to get a much better outcome and give them at least the guidance that they do get the best outcome. And we have certainly to choose what's right for them."

I'll give a couple of comments overall, but then it's very category-specific. On restarting top line growth, I will first emphasize we're getting back to making consumers aware of the product and communicating the benefits. So making sure we were consistently having to reach and frequency needed with the right message is key. And we've also, I think, adjusted our communication, both to TV, digital in any way that's appropriate to reach target consumers. And I believe that's going to make a big difference. A second area that is helping, and you're going to see it continue probably increase next year, is part of market entry and part of market change-focused spending. We understand and we look back over several years, that had gone down on many categories. And it was showing up in lower shares with entry point consumers. And that doesn't bode well for the future. And that's played out with some of the share losses that you and others have highlighted. The right way to build it back is to bring consumers in to the best and most effective ways to bring consumers into your category when they first have need for the category. So we have prioritized point of market entry and part of market change. And that will continue to increase. We gave example on laundry. It's also happening in many other categories. The second, which I think is critically important, that will play out consistently over time and more in the mid to long term, is the increased investment in innovation and showing that we have products that have meaningful consumer, we call it consumer wow. We have adjusted our valuation of innovation to not just have technically superior products but to have products and brands that have a meaningful difference that consumer see and appreciate. This higher bar is pushing us to go back on some of the innovations in the sheer amount of the product, but also the packets and experience is at a higher level so that consumer can play back, it's meaningfully different. An example of it is that we're using frequently is deprivation. Gives the consumer product and then taken away and get the reaction. If we get a really significant reaction, you probably have a product that really means something to the consumer. So I would say the areas that I would we did focus, and I believe would be very meaningful next year would be point of market entry, continued consistent building of the appropriate reach and frequency and then consumer meaningful and appreciated innovation that has the impact on market growth, which is the last point I want to make, is our innovation, at times, it has been very focused at trying to be a little bit better than our best competition. We've added the expectation for each of our categories that their role is to grow the category size as that has meaningful impact both on the support we get from customers but also the financial attractiveness of each of the innovations and therefore categories."

Stepping back, kind of on a macro level, kind of 4 pillars of transformation, productivity, portfolio, top line acceleration, organization, culture, I think the benefit from those efforts is primarily ahead of us. So the portfolio, we don't complete until the October, and we still have a bunch of transition work to do to execute that big transaction. We have not yet been able to operate as a company in a 10-category-focused fashion. So all of that benefit think is ahead. Productivity, we have benefited from a will continue to benefit from. The acceleration, the investments really have to start all over the last 6 months. And things like part of market entry, market change, investments will increase as we go through next year. And frankly, they take some time to pay out themselves. But the payout is a significant. And I think that the other changes sometimes underestimated in terms of its importance as part of the organizational and cultural changes that David talked about. I think those will be significant. And frankly, we're just putting them in place. The incentive system goes into place in July. We moved, as David says -- said the dedicated sales resources in North America. Starting that move in some of the other big markets. So I think there's a lot of benefit ahead. Last comment as it relates to priority, these are all part of an ecosystem that's designed to work together to produce balanced top line, bottom line and cash flow growth. And I'd really like them because I think they're mutually reinforcing, as David said in his remarks. We get this top line growing. That will generate cost savings and top line leverage which will then use the ability to invest to grow have the motivated organization that's properly and strongly incented to deliver both. I think without getting ahead of ourselves here, again a lot of the benefit still comes in the future."

And happy to comment conditions have in most of the leading customers. First, on China, we see it sequentially improving. We are not done yet with getting our portfolio right in China. That will take time. There are several categories that we are still losing share and we're not positioned with the appropriate portfolio in the premium/super premium segments. We started with the Oral-B effort last year. We've got some -- and we have innovation also in Fabric Care. But each of the categories has stepped up both their innovation pace and also making sure that we have on the ground resources in China to ensure the product and the package and the proposition have been fine-tuned to really win the Chinese consumers. And that will take time. So to that point, it will build over time. The other comment I'd make on China and based on a lot of our that I heard there's been a lot said about the attractiveness of China. Through our lens, it continues to be extremely attractive. Jon mentioned some of the reasons why, but I also say that the published data often shows a very rapid slowdown. And that is true in the off-line portion of the business. We've seen it going with a very low single digits [indiscernible] and some categories are now flat in China. Having said that, the online portion is accelerated and certainly the double-digit [indiscernible] categories 1 30, 1 40, 1 50. And what is encouraging to me is our on online business is starting to accelerate. We're growing share in the past 6 months. And we've at least now got a couple of our categories where our online share is higher than our off-line share, which bodes well for the future given the choice Chinese consumers are making. So it will continue to get better over time. Over the next 12 to 18 months, we'll see more and more innovation hitting. It is been specifically designed for China versus adapted to be used in China. I think that will increase our hit rate and our growth rate."

The digital and social space, to me, is a powerful opportunity for any consumer marketing company, and it's left all of us to figure out how to best leverage the capability that has been developed, and frankly, for consumers to emerge rapidly. P&G has shifted significantly its resources and our investments to ensure that we are showing up with communication that wins mobile back. And that's a big shift for us. And that's critically important because whether it's e-commerce or whether it's consumption of media, in many markets, it's now primarily through the mobile phone. And more and more, you're seeing P&G winning with the marketing programs that are adapted for digital and social. And a good example of one of a social program that has done extraordinarily well is the Always Like A Girl where we leverage that communication in that very strong social platform, but used and leverage the social media capability to drive the brand. I do understand, and certainly there's very real cost to enter a category has changed dramatically today versus 5 and 10 years ago. And part of what we are doing, by category [indiscernible] is looking to see how we leverage liquidity that exist. Expect will continue to see competitors that can up.

We just have a substantive product that meets the consumers need, communication programs that meet consumers, receptive to the message and understand they want less to be solved and more to be part of their life. And we're adjusting our marketing communication programs to do just that. I think that's the right way by category to win."

And I don't think that relative preference in the drivers for business growth changes going forward. But we've had 2 dynamics that we've been dealing within the last year that kind of inform next year's view. One is we've been pricing significantly to recover foreign exchange impacts, which has resulted in volume being less of a component of the top line. In fact, in many cases, a negative component. We are hopeful that we're going to be operating in more stable currency environment. So that volume negative goes away. Also, as you have and others have rightly pointed out on several occasions, we've had category-country combinations where our pricing got too high. In many cases, that's what we were trying to recover from devaluation and competitors didn't follow. In other cases, David talked about [indiscernible] in his prepared a major competitor pricing down in that segment and will be adjusting prices to deal with those realities, which makes price less of the top line component and volume more of it.

They brought aggressive innovation to make sure that their meeting the shoppers' needs better than anybody else, premium performing products. And they did a great job communicating in sampling their products. This fiscal year built into our guidance is increased level sampling and with a broader sampling program as well as the marketing program that is in place, and I've just mentioned some additional innovation coming on the product front, I think we're actually well positioned, and the objective going in independent of what happens in terms of industry consolidation is that we will win with consumers and shoppers.

I am joined this morning by our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, David Taylor; and by our Vice President of Investor Relations, John Chevalier. 
I plan to take you through the quarter and provide an update on productivity and our portfolio projects. David will discuss our efforts to accelerate top line growth, we'll briefly review progress in each of our 10 business categories and we'll discuss our plans to further strengthen our organization and culture, all to reliably drive balanced top and bottom line growth. 
We're making progress in moving P&G's results to a balanced top line, bottom line and cash flow growth. We increased investments in innovation, advertising and sales coverage to enhance our long-term prospects for faster, sustainable top line growth, and stabilized top line growth rates in several key markets. We have delivered another strong year of productivity improvement and cost savings to help fund this. 
Cash flow continues to be strong with fiscal year adjusted free cash flow productivity of 115%. Organic sales for the quarter were up 2%. This includes about a 1 point drag from the combination of the cleanup work we're doing within the ongoing portfolio and the impact of reduced finished product sales to our Venezuelan subsidiaries. As we get through the cleanup work and annualize the Venezuelan headwinds, we'll be closer to 3% growth. 
Importantly, the sales growth was volume driven, with organic volume growing 2%. Organic volume was ahead of year-ago in every segment, ranging from plus 1% to plus 5%. Organic sales grew in every segment, ranging from plus 1% to plus 8%. Organic sales were up 1.5 points in developed markets and 3.5 points in developing markets. In North America, organic sales grew 2%, roughly in line with underlying market growth, our second consecutive quarter at this level. Organic volume in North America grew 3% for the second consecutive quarter, slightly ahead of underlying market growth. In China, organic sales were in line versus the prior year, an improvement over last quarter and another step toward returning to market-level growth or better. All-in sales for the company were down 3%, including the 3 point headwind from foreign exchange and a 2 point drag from the combination of Venezuela deconsolidation and minor brand divestitures. 
Core gross margin increased 160 basis points versus the prior year. On a constant-currency basis, core gross margin was up 240 basis points, including 280 basis points of productivity improvements. Core operating margin was down 150 basis points for the quarter due to foreign exchange headwinds and a significant increase in advertising support versus the prior year. On a constant-currency basis, core operating margin was down 30 basis points. Productivity improvements contributed 360 basis points of operating margin benefit in the fourth quarter. 
Core earnings per share were $0.79, slightly above the high end of our implied guidance range. This is a reduction of 15% versus the prior year, due mainly to foreign exchange, lower nonoperating income and a higher tax rate. Foreign exchange was a $0.07 per share or $200 million after-tax headwind on fourth quarter earnings. Nonoperating income was $0.02 per share headwind, as the base period quarter included higher gains from minor brand divestitures. The core effective tax rate was a $0.06 per share impact on core earnings per share for the quarter at 23.8%, up 540 basis points versus last year. This is a little better than we initially projected, but still a substantial increase compared to last year. These 3 impacts, foreign exchange, nonoperating income and tax, were a combined core earnings per share growth headwind of $0.15 per share this quarter. Adjusting for these impacts, fourth quarter core EPS was up modestly versus the prior year. On an all-in GAAP basis, earnings per share were $0.69 for the quarter, up 283% versus the prior year quarter that included a significant onetime impact from the deconsolidation of Venezuelan results. 
We generated $2.8 billion of free cash flow with 145% adjusted free cash flow productivity. Over the course of the fiscal year, we generated $12.1 billion in free cash flow, yielding adjusted free cash flow productivity of 115%. 
We were able to reduce outstanding shares at a value of over $8 billion through a combination of share repurchase and shares that were exchanged in the Duracell transaction. We paid dividends of more than $7.4 billion. In total, nearly $16 billion in dividend payments, share exchanges and share repurchase. 
Now looking forward, we continue to focus on large opportunities that should be within our control: executing what is the largest transformation in our company's history; reaccelerating top line growth with strengthened category business models, innovation plans, and where appropriate, improved value equations; step change in cost and cash productivity; simplifying and strengthening our product portfolio; and strengthening our organization and culture, all to win more consistently. This transformation is aimed at delivering balanced top and bottom line growth and leadership value creation. 
Top line growth is our biggest improvement need and is enabled by both our productivity efforts and the portfolio strengthening that are underway. I'll talk briefly about these enabling efforts and then turn it over to David for a discussion on top line acceleration itself. 
We continue to dramatically improve cost and cash productivity, with significant upside still ahead. We have accelerated and exceeded each of our productivity objectives and have now raised them. Our original 5-year cost-of-goods savings target was $6 billion. We delivered $7.2 billion, more than $1 billion over our initial target. We delivered cost-of-goods savings which were at or above target each of the last 5 fiscal years. We've reduced manufacturing enrollment by 22% over the last 4 years. This includes new staffing necessary to support capacity additions. On a same-site basis, manufacturing enrollment was down about 27% through June 2016 with additional progress planned in fiscal 2017. These figures exclude divestiture impacts. 
In February of 2012, we announced that we would reduce nonmanufacturing or overhead enrollment by 10% over 5 years. As of July 1, we've reduced roles by nearly 25%, 2.5x the original target. Including divestitures, we'll reduce nonmanufacturing or overhead roles by about 35% by the end of fiscal '17.  
We're reducing nonworking marketing expenditures, costs that don't impact reach, frequency or continuity of our advertising and trial-generation programs. We were spending $2 billion per year on agency fees. 2 years ago, we reduced the roughly 6,000 agencies we work with by nearly 40% and cut agency and production spending by about $370 million. In fiscal 2016, we delivered an additional $250 million of agency-related savings, reinvesting these savings in advertising and sampling of consumer-preferred products, over $600 million of savings in 2 years. 
We're driving productivity improvement up and down the income statement and across the balance sheet. Inventory days are down. Payables days are up. Net of reinvestments in innovation, sales coverage, media and sampling, productivity has enabled us to deliver constant-currency gross and operating profit margin improvement and high single to double-digit constant-currency core earnings per share growth in each of the last 4 fiscal years. We improved gross and operating margins by triple-digit indices, both including and excluding currency, in fiscal 2016. 
We said over 4 years ago that we needed to make cost and cash productivity part of our culture, as integral to our culture as innovation. We've made significant progress, and we have significant opportunity. Our strong track record and our line of sight to additional opportunity inform our intent to save as much as another $10 billion in cost over the next 5 years. The majority of these savings will again come from cost of goods sold, an area where we have consistently met or exceeded our targets. 
Supply chain transformation is in its early stages. First in North America, next in Europe, then in Latin America and India, the Middle East and Africa. We're in investment mode now with savings to ramp up in 2, 3 and 4 years. 
Our new U.S. mixing centers are up and running, putting roughly 80% of volume within 24 hours of store shelves. On-time deliveries and frequency of deliveries have increased. We've already seen an improvement in customer service levels, resulting in improved on-shelf ability -- excuse me, availability in the U.S. by more than 1 point to roughly 96%. 
We're constructing multi-category manufacturing sites in geographically strategic locations to replace smaller, single-category sites in less cost-effective locations. We're well underway with the construction of a new site in West Virginia, that's scheduled to start production in calendar 2017. We've announced moves of production for some laundry detergent, fabric enhancer, perfume, body wash and haircare products, and we've announced our complete shutdown of 3 sites. In Europe, we've announced plans to consolidate production of laundry powders, deodorants and hard surface cleaners to fewer plants across our European manufacturing network. We're now beginning the consolidation work in Latin America. 
As we make these moves, we're upgrading and standardizing manufacturing platforms to lower cost and to facilitate faster innovation. We're employing smart automation and digitization to improve manufacturing productivity, raw material and finished product logistics and demand planning. We have additional opportunity to optimize working capital and further increase the efficiency of our capital spend. 
After 2 strong years of savings, we'll enter next year still spending about $1.4 billion on agency-related costs, still more room to improve. And as we fully operationalize the new focused 10-category company, there will be additional opportunities to increase organization efficiency, agility and speed of decision-making, enabled in many cases by digitization and automation. 
Finally, we're working to improve the effectiveness of our promotional spending. We currently spend about $18 billion in deductions between gross and net sales. We see clear opportunities to improve the effectiveness of the spend for us and our retail partners to build the value of our categories and the share of P&G brands. So again, we're targeting up to $10 billion of additional savings over the next 5 years. We expect to reinvest a significant amount of the savings in R&D and product and packaging improvements, sales coverage and in brand awareness and trial-building programs to deliver balanced top and bottom line growth. 
Moving to portfolio. Over the last 18 months, we've divested, discontinued or consolidated 61 brands, including the completion of the Duracell transaction at the end of February. We have 44 more brands in the exit process, including 41 brands in the deal with Coty. We're currently winding down transition support for Duracell. We have completed the systems work in standing up the Beauty business for the transaction with Coty. We've received antitrust clearance in all markets. We currently remain on track to close the deal with Coty in October 2016. By the end of the fiscal year, we will have exited 105 brands and all of the complexity they create. These brands represent only about 6% of base period profit. 
Going forward, our portfolio will be anchored on 10 category-based business units and 65 brands. These are categories where P&G has leading market positions and where product technologies deliver performance differences that matter to consumers. These 10 businesses have historically grown faster with higher margins than the balance of the company. We're moving away from businesses that are more trend driven, where fashion, fragrance and flavor drive consumer purchase decisions. We're focusing our businesses where products and performance drive purchase decisions, where there are clear consumer jobs to be done and clear objective measures of performance. These are products that consumers purchase and use on a daily basis, and they're in structurally attractive categories. 
Within these core businesses, we're focusing our offerings, making smart choices for short-, mid- and long-term value creation, foregoing bad businesses even when these choices create near-term top line pressure. In our Mexico Family Care business, we discontinued low-tier, unprofitable and commoditizing products and are focusing instead on very profitable, high-tier differentiated products, moving from double-digit negative margins to double-digit positive margins. While we first talked about this a year ago, it took several quarters to sell out remaining inventories of the discontinued products. As a result, the top line drag doesn't fully annualize until the end of this calendar year. 
In India, we've made a similar choice to de-prioritize several unprofitable lines of business, which negatively impact short-term top line growth rates, but will lead longer term to a much more profitable business that will grow strongly. The strategic part of our India business is growing at a high single-digit pace. Sales in the portion of the business we're fixing or exiting, about 15% of the portfolio, have been down more than 35%. The top line pain is worth it. We're making significant progress in improving local profit margins, up 750 basis points over the last 2 years. We've gone from losing significant money in India to triple-digit profits in just 2 years. 
We're taking a similar approach in our Fabric Care product portfolio, discontinuing product forms, additives, bars, bleaches and tablets and value-tier and powder detergents that have been a drag on profitability and value creation. These choices are causing a top line drag in the global fabric care business, but improve the profitability and the long-term attractiveness of the business. 
The SKUs we've eliminated to simplify our Olay lineup cause an incremental drag on sales growth. As we annualize this headwind next year and as we focus our innovation and marketing support on the core boutiques and SKUs in the portfolio, we'll have set the stage for faster, more profitable growth. Combined, these choices have been causing about 1 point drag on organic sales growth. We expect this headwind to continue for the balance of the calendar year and then dissipate in the second half of next year as we begin annualizing these effects. 
So that's productivity and portfolio, both on or ahead of track, with, and this is important, a significant amount of benefits still ahead of us. 
I'll now hand over it over to David to update you on the top line, provide a brief status review across the 10 product categories and talk about important steps we've undertaken to strengthen our organization and culture to more consistently create value."
33328,327687250,1021949,"The Procter & Gamble Company, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","The Procter & Gamble Company","Executives","Good morning. Our objective is very clear: balanced top and bottom line growth that delivers total shareholder returns that place P&G consistently in the top third of our peer group.

Our objective is very clear: balanced top and bottom line growth that delivers total shareholder returns that place P&G consistently in the top third of our peer group. A critically important element of our transformation is reacceleration of our top line growth to reach and sustain organic sales growth at or slightly ahead of underlying growth of the markets where we compete. Productivity improvement and cost savings are a necessity in this effort, providing fuel for innovation, advertising, sales coverage and trial and sampling to grow users and usage. 
Top and bottom line growth are not separate endeavors. They reinforce and fuel each other. Now everything in this model starts with delighting consumers and shoppers. Winning at the zero, first and second moments of truth, when consumers research our categories and brands, purchase them in the store or online and use them in homes. Winning these critical moments requires consumer and shopper insights that lead to improved product innovations, consumer communication and retail programs that lead to competitive advantages for P&G brands and products. 
Now we're making progress in accelerating organic sales growth, but we're not yet where we need to be. There's more work to be done. As Jon just shared, organic sales grew in all 5 reporting segments and were in line or higher in 9 of 10 product categories in that April-June quarter. In most of these businesses, the back half of the year was stronger than the first half. Organic sales for the company was essentially flat in the first half of the year and were up 1.5% in the second half. Obvious acceleration, but not where we want to be. 
Let me spend a minute on each of the 10 categories. We're growing our Fabric Care business with consumer-preferred brands and product offerings like our premium performance and premium-priced unit-dose detergents and our market-leading and importantly expanding scent bead fabric enhancers. We're exiting slower-growing, lower-priced, more commoditized product forms where it's more difficult to distinguish our products and create value. 
Fabric Care results in the U.S. demonstrate what is possible when we deliver superior value from best-in-class performance at a modest price premium. The U.S. laundry detergent market is continuing to grow behind our efforts, with the category up 4 points last year. The same is true for fabric enhancers. Spurred by the rapid growth of scent beads, the U.S. fabric enhancers category is growing, up 7 points on a value basis last year, with scent beads form growing in the mid-20s. Our share is growing. P&G's laundry detergent and fabric enhancer value shares were up in fiscal 2016. 
And we will continue to be the innovation leader in Fabric Care. In North America, we're introducing a new regimen on Tide and Downy that addresses the odor problems common to the growing athletic wear segment. 70% of consumers wear athletic gear multiple times each week. The Odor Defense Collection, anchored by innovation on Tide PODS, brings a proprietary formula of enzymes and surfactants that break down and remove stubborn soils and residues -- residue for a great clean and fresh scent. Now paired with the added cleaning power of Tide Odor Defense Rescue laundry booster and Downy Fresh Protect Odor Defense beads, this regimen promises to eliminate odors from the fast-growing market of athleisure clothes people are wearing far beyond the gym. 
We opened a learning market of Tide Pure Clean liquid detergent in the U.S. Naturals is a large and growing segment in several categories, but Naturals are only about 3% of the laundry category currently. Unlocking growth in Naturals is about solving the tension between green and clean. People want performance and sustainability. Pure Clean provides the cleaning power of Tide with 65% bio-based ingredients and is produced with 100% renewable wind power electricity in a facility operating with 0 manufacturing waste to landfill. Now it's very early to read results, but after just 5 weeks on shelf, with no TV advertising, Pure Clean is approaching a 1 share of detergents within the learning market stores. We're increasing sampling in new washing machines, a key point of category entry and change for consumers. In fiscal 2015, we distributed 5 million samples in washing machines globally. Last fiscal year, we increased that to 17 million. In fiscal 2017, we'll distribute 30 million samples of our best-performing products. 
Turning to Home Care. Our performance in this category has been very strong. Cascade grew sales high single digits last year behind the continued success of Cascade Platinum, our best-performing and most premium-priced auto dish detergent. In North America, we increased sampling on Cascade Premium by 20% last year. The Dawn brand delivered its ninth consecutive year of organic sales growth in the U.S. Dish results have also been strong in Japan and Europe on hand washing liquids and auto detergent products. Febreze had a challenging year, down low singles, but we have innovations coming next fiscal. 
In Hair Care, we launched our new conditioner innovation on Pantene in the U.S. early this calendar year. The new conditioner technology is a consumer blind-test winner versus our best competition in North America, China and Japan. Pantene and Head & Shoulders each delivered solid organic sales growth in the U.S. for the second consecutive year. Herbal Essences was the main drag on the Hair Care growth, down mid-teens last fiscal year. Now we have plans in the works for product, package and consumer communication improvements in fiscal 2017. 
In the Skin and Personal Care category, SK-II had another very strong year with organic sales up mid -- low teens. As Jon mentioned, Olay completed a significant streamlining of SKUs in North America last year. In China, Olay's second-biggest market, we're executing a similar streamlining of sales counters, retaining the top-selling and most profitable counters to focus resources where it matters most, on the doors that create the most value. On Old Spice, sales were up versus the prior year and accelerated in the second half behind the Hardest Working Collection innovation bundle that included performance and scent upgrades to Old Spice detergents and body wash -- or rather deodorants and body washes in the U.S. 
In Grooming, Gillette delivered steady growth in international markets last fiscal, holding or growing value share in each region outside the U.S. behind strong innovation, advertising and sampling programs. The growth in international markets was offset by soft results in the U.S. To improve our growth and the growth of the market, we are reinvesting in innovation, new user trial and improved consumer value. We completed the global expansion of our very successful Gillette Fusion FlexBall innovation into Asia in 2016. We expanded our performance advantage at the top end of the market. Our most recent cartridge innovation, Gillette Fusion ProShield, launched in January. We're supporting a broader range of our product ladder from our best product, Fusion FlexBall ProShield, to MACH3 systems, to premium-priced and superior performance disposables with stronger consumer value communication. We're facing more aggressive competition at lower price points, and we will respond to ensure our brands remain a superior consumer value. We're driving trial at point of market entry. We put Fusion ProGlide FlexBall razors in the hands of nearly 80% of young men, over 2 million samples last year in the U.S. with our 18th birthday sampling program. We're now sampling the FlexBall razor handle and ProShield cartridge, our very best combination of shaving technologies. 
Fiscal 2016 was a difficult year in Personal Health Care due to the very weak cough/cold season in the U.S. The category was also compared against a base period that contained the launch of many new items in the Metamucil and Vicks brands. Even with these headwinds, the category delivered positive organic sales growth for the year. Organic sales in Oral Care were up low single digits in fiscal 2016 with high single-digit after-tax profit growth behind strong productivity improvements. Sales of our top-performing items grew fast this last fiscal with premium Oral-B power toothbrushes and premium HD toothpaste, each up mid-teens. Organic sales in the 42 Oral-B toothpaste expansion markets were up double digits last fiscal year. The solid growth in developed markets was partially offset by lower sales in several developing markets, where we took pricing to offset foreign exchange impacts. 
In U.S. Baby Care, strong innovation, consumer communication, trial programs and a robust online presence have led to strong growth for Pampers. Pampers value share of U.S. diapers was up 1 point last fiscal. Pampers latest Swaddlers and Cruisers innovation, Extra Absorb Channels, is driving share growth in the premium-tier diaper category with Swaddlers and Cruisers share up more than 1 point last fiscal year. 
We strengthened investments in brand awareness and trial at the point of category entry. Now 70% of new moms in the U.S. will receive samples of our best products through our prenatal and hospital programs. 
Fiscal 2015 marked the seventh consecutive year of sales and value share growth of the Luvs brand in the U.S., however, results were down in fiscal 2016 following a significant price reduction taken by our primary competitor. Now we've taken steps to improve the awareness, trial and consumer value of Luvs. We're increasing equity-building advertising, strengthening in-store programs, and we're currently launching product and packaging improvements. In Japan, Pampers value share grew more than 2 points last year. Pampers is now the value share leader in Japan diapers and also the share leader in the pants segment. Baby Care results have been softer in other markets. To address this, we strengthened our value proposition in several markets and accelerated premium innovation on both taped and pull-on diapers to restore our competitiveness at the top end of the market. We're strengthening our selling resources and programs for baby center stores and e-commerce, and we're increasing investments in point-of-market-entry programs to drive higher awareness and trial of Pampers among new moms. 
Fem care organic sales were up low single digits for the fiscal year with improved momentum in the second of half, including a strong fourth quarter with mid-single digit organic volume and sales growth. Expansion and leverage of innovations such as Always Infinity and Always Discreet have been the key drivers of improved top line growth. We've also made consumer value interventions in markets like Russia to restore pricing to competitive levels, which helped in the second half. 
In Family Care, the top-tier segments of the Bounty and Charmin brands delivered solid organic sales growth last fiscal. Now as Jon discussed, we made the choice to discontinue low-tier products in Mexico, which drove overall category sales down versus the prior year. Global bottom line results were strong with after-tax profits up high single digits in fiscal 2016. We have product and packaging innovations coming this year on the Bounty Basic and Charmin Basic brands to improve their positioning with consumers in the U.S. 
Now look briefly at our top 2 markets. First, the U.S. Organic sales and shipment volume was up about 0.5 point in the first half of the fiscal year. We accelerated this growth in the back half of the year to plus 2% and 2.5% organic sales and shipments, respectively. The second half growth rates are roughly in line with underlying growth of our categories. We plan to build on this momentum. 
China organic sales were down 5 points last fiscal, but improved sequentially in the third and fourth quarters. The fourth quarter was in line with prior year. Progress, but nothing worth celebrating yet. In fiscal 2017, we'll relaunch product lines in several categories and will implement a new go-to-market program across retailers and distributors in China. These improvements will take some time to fully take hold. Recovery will not be a straight line, but in aggregate, fiscal year results should improve. 
As we work to accelerate top line growth, enabled by productivity and portfolio choices, we are transforming our organization and culture. We're making many changes that by themselves may seem small and obvious, but together, they are significant and important. 
As an example, we've made several important changes in how we go to market. We've talked previously about eliminating overlapping resources and duplicative structures and responsibilities of marketing and sales professionals in the global business units and the market development organizations, clarifying responsibilities and strengthening accountability. Reflecting this, a while back, we changed the name of our market development organizations to selling and market operations, a small but very important change. We're changing our talent development and assignment planning to drive more mastery and depth. The objective is simple: Improve business results by getting and keeping the right people in the right places to develop and apply deep category mastery to win. 
Consistent with this, we've dedicated sales resources to categories or sectors. In our larger markets, sales resources have greater accountability back to the categories they serve, which is also a change. We're running incentives at a lower and more specific level of granularity to better match these responsibilities and to increase accountability. Now P&G is fortunate to consistently source and develop strong talent, and we intend to maintain our develop-from-within approach. But there are times when the best talent for a role may not be inside our organization. We are now implementing and supplementing key businesses with outside hiring more often, when we need to field the best team possible. As an example, we've dedicated and added resources to improve category mastery in our North American Personal Health Care sales force. 2 years ago, the average tenure of salespeople within the category was less than 12 months. About half of the salespeople were dedicated only to Personal Health Care and 100% of the people were either new hires coming to P&G with no work experience or transfers from other P&G businesses. Over the last year or so, we've added resources to the consumer Health Care sales force. Almost half of those people had prior Health Care sales experience. Today, 100% of people selling the business are dedicated to Personal Health Care and the average experience level is now more than 5 years of Health Care sales experience inside or outside of P&G. Over the last 2 years, we've added 115 people to the U.S. retail sales force through external hiring, and more than half of them had prior sales experience. Over the last 2 years, we've increased category dedication of the U.S. sales force by 20%, with more than 90% of salespeople now focused on one category. We've doubled the number of experienced external hires last fiscal versus the prior year, bringing in experienced talent at 5 different levels of management, including the vice president level. Experienced hires comprised about 5% of all management hiring in fiscal 2016. 
Bottom line, we -- we're committed to getting, keeping and growing the right people in the right place to drive better business results. Again, each of these changes may seem small and rather obvious, but collectively, they're big and important changes for our organization and culture. Each area of transformation, top line acceleration, productivity, portfolio and strengthening our organizational culture, requires change. Let me say again what I've said at the CAGNY Conference in February. ""P&G is ready to adapt, evolve and change whatever is needed to win."" We're making good progress in each of these areas, but we know our success will ultimately be graded on the sales, profit, cash and value-creation results we deliver, not on the activities that get us there. We are committed to do everything we can and to change what must be changed to deliver these results. 
Now let me hand it back to Jon to discuss fiscal 2017 guidance, and then I'll be happy to take your questions."
33328,327687250,1021949,"The Procter & Gamble Company, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","The Procter & Gamble Company","Executives","Thanks, David.

To frame guidance, I think it's helpful to look briefly at the macro environment that confronts us as we start fiscal 2017. Category growth rates slowed throughout last fiscal year and are currently growing at about a 3% pace for our global footprint. As you know, GDP growth rate had slowed to the point that at least 10 countries have moved to negative interest rates, including Germany, Japan, Denmark, France, Italy, Spain and Switzerland. Political, economic and foreign exchange volatility each continue to have a large impact on the markets and on the currencies in which we operate. The recent Brexit decision is but one example of a political disruption impact that has knock-on effects on consumer confidence and resulting market growth. The recent coup attempt in Turkey is another example. We continue to face significant FX volatility such as the recent 40% devaluation of the Nigerian currency and 25% devaluation for open-market transactions in Egypt. Our ability to ensure supply and stay on shelf in many markets is dependent upon our ability to source in U.S. dollars. Currency exchange constraints in markets such as Egypt, Nigeria, Venezuela, and historically, Argentina, make operations in those countries very difficult to manage and sometimes result in production shutdowns. Net, we continue to face a relatively slow-growth volatile world, which is reflected in our fiscal 2017 guidance. We're currently expecting organic sales growth of around 2%. This includes between 0.5 point and 1 point of headwind from the cleanup work within the ongoing 10 product categories. It also includes the remaining 2 quarters of headwind from lost sales for our Venezuelan subsidiaries. As we annualize more of the cleanup work and as we make progress in markets like China, we should be getting back towards market-level growth rates by fiscal year's end. We expect fiscal 2017 all-in sales growth of about 1%, including a 1 point drag on growth from the net impact of foreign exchange and divestitures. 
Our bottom line guidance is core earnings-per-share growth of mid-single digits. This range reflects the volatility of the markets in which we compete and it reflects the investments we intend to make in the business to accelerate organic sales growth in a sustainable long-term market-constructive and value-accretive way. We'll work with our retail partners to build the value of our categories behind strong product innovation and more effective in-store and online merchandising of our leading brands. We'll reinvest savings to improve product formulations and packaging, sales coverage and media programs, product sampling and in-store demand creation. We'll also invest in consumer value equations, correcting value gaps and quickly responding to competitive challenges as they emerge throughout the year. 
This guidance includes the fiscal year average share count reduction of approximately 4%, the net outstanding share reductions from the full year impact of the Duracell deal, the Beauty transaction with Coty, discretionary share repurchase and stock option exercises. The actual impact on outstanding shares from the Beauty transaction won't be known until the deal is completed in October and will, of course, be dependent on the stock prices of both companies and the transaction discount. 
We're forecasting a reduction in nonoperating income in fiscal 2017 due to lower gains from minor brand divestitures. The core effective tax rate should be roughly in line with the fiscal 2016 level. All-in GAAP earnings per share should increase 45% to 55%, due primarily to the significant onetime gain from the Beauty transaction with Coty. Also included in the GAAP earnings-per-share range are $0.10 per share of noncore restructuring charges. 
We expect adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% or better, CapEx should be in the range of 5% to 5.5% of sales. Fiscal 2017 will be a year of significant value return to share owners. We expect to pay dividends of over $7 billion. In addition, we expect to reduce outstanding shares at a value of approximately of $15 billion through a combination of direct share repurchase and shares that will be exchanged in the Beauty transaction. In total, over $22 billion in dividend payments, share exchanges and share repurchase. 
To summarize fiscal 2017 guidance. Our current forecast calls for around 2% organic sales growth, all-in sales growth will be about -- around 1%, and we should have a small improvement in profit margins. Nonoperating income will be a headwind, and share count will contribute about 4% of earnings-per-share benefit. All current rates -- at current rates and prices, FX and commodities are a modest headwind to fiscal 2017 earnings. Significant currency weaknesses, commodity increases or additional geopolitical disruptions are not anticipated within this guidance. While we currently expect FX to only be a small headwind for the year, it will still be a notable headwind in Q1. We'll still be impacted by significant devaluations in the U.K., Argentina, Egypt, Nigeria, among others. We'll also still be annualizing the loss of finished product sales to our Venezuelan subsidiaries. 
Please take these factors into account as you consider the quarterly profile of your sales and earnings estimate. 
With that, I'll hand it back to David for his closing comments."

So in terms of the relative priority of market share versus profitability, it's an and. In our view, we need to be growing at or slightly ahead of the markets in which we're operating, and we fully intend to do that. We're -- as we have said, we're going to reinvest a significant portion of the savings that we're generating behind that effort to get back to market share growth. And that will -- that started. You see it in the numbers in the fourth quarter and will continue as we go forward. Just one thing on share trends. I mean, you're absolutely right in your overall observation. But if you look at across the 5 reporting segments, market share trends, past 6 months, past 12 months, were better past 6 months in 5 out of 5 segments. The same holds for the past 3 months versus the past 6 months. So again, 5 out of 5 segments improving. And the same for the past 1 month versus past 3-month comparison. Again, as David very clearly said, we're not where we want to be, but we're starting to see that progress as we reinvest behind the opportunities that are in front of us. In terms of the savings proration across the 5 years, this program will be a little bit more backloaded than our prior program, in part because of the nature of some of the projects that are contained in it, specifically the supply chain transformation, where as I said, we're in investment mode now and the savings will come 2, 3, 4 years from now. Having said that, there will be significant contributions from productivity again next year, which will give us the ability to increase investment in the business. We're expecting increases in advertising spend this year versus last, think about it in the probably mid-single-digit range. We want to increase, as David said in his remarks, sampling of consumer-preferred products and trial generation.

So I guess, why aren't you expecting more of a sales recovery and market share payback?

First, we are very committed to get back to a little above the market growth, and we recognize 2% is not market growth. Having said that, and Jon highlighted in the formal remarks, we've still got quite a few choices to annualize. We made the choice, and I think it's very evident in AMJ, that we're going to get back to investing at the business at the level we need to. We also demonstrated to be in the second half of the year that we're committed to 4 quarters of brand support. The fourth quarter, we increased meaningfully our media investment versus previous year, and we're going to continue that in fiscal '17. Having said that, we will not stop making key choices where we have businesses that are structurally not profitable. But we think, on balance, the majority of that, choices have been made and we'll annualize it through this year. So we actually feel very good that the businesses that we have, especially post the close of Coty, we're very well positioned to grow sequentially. So I expect the first half to continue to make progress. Second half will be better. And much like we said at CAGNY, you're going to see just continued building of our business strength behind a very clear choice in investing in brand-building, and that biased toward point of market entry and bringing new consumers on and investing in innovation, both in current brands but also in our P&G ventures, to ensure we're planting the seeds for the mid- and long-term future. And we're going to continue to make the investments in go-to-market capability, including sales coverage, to make sure that we can reach and win in fast-moving channels, be that e-commerce, baby stores, cosmetic stores, or wherever the consumer and shopper want to shop."

But as Jon laid out, even after Duracell transaction and with Coty coming to a close here in a couple of months, there's still a lot of change afoot, still a lot of cost-cutting underway. So as you step back and think of what you've observed over the last 3 quarters or so as CEO, what's your confidence at this point that the people of P&G, the culture of the organization, they can truly take on both challenges at once? In other words, is the productivity culture truly ingrained enough that you can layer on or reemphasize top line focus without risk that you end up kind of breaking the back of the organization, so to speak? And then if I could, just a related bolt-on question or 2 for Jon. First is, you may have said this, but as you reaccelerate and reinvest, can you maintain that 100% or so free cash flow productivity? And second, should we expect a volume-centric organic growth algorithm for '17 similar to what we saw in Q4? Or is there a reason for that to reverse as you move through the year?"

Of all the transformation variables, the one I'm most confident in is the P&G people are up for the challenge. I think we demonstrated this year, which is clearly the peak in terms of the Duracell transaction, the enormous complexity of the Coty transaction, folks have risen to the occasion to be able to stand up those companies, still sequentially improving the operating companies, and while doing some of the heavy lifting in both the North American and European supply chain work. So it's a very good point. And I think at times we underestimate the amount of additional work beyond operating the businesses, but I think the heaviest load is -- was this last fiscal year and for the next quarter. So the organization's demonstrated the resiliency. In our P&G survey, the confidence that people have that the choices are right and the confidence they have and pride they have in P&G is at an all-time high. So we're going to build off that, and I have a lot of confidence in P&G people. The second one on is productivity ingrained? My hope now is, after 5 years of making the kind of improvement we have, that we've demonstrated externally, and I believe internally built the confidence that this is critical and a key enabler for getting back to the kind of balanced top and bottom line results we need. We've certainly emphasized that. But as we've added some additional focus on bringing more users on board, I think it's been very empowering to our people. They see then the outcome of all the productivity work, leading into investments in brand-building innovation, and that gives them confidence that the future of the company is going to be strong."

My one worry, though, is that more recently, I feel like some of innovation news is getting a little bit heavy on this drive for volume. So example would be on the odor release product line. Why isn't driving incremental wash loads enough versus it needing to be 3 products to do the job of remove the odors? Same thing on the Tide PODS, right? The advertising with 2 pods being chucked in the wash, which categorically wasn't the dosing recommendation when the product launched. So if you could just talk a little bit, I apologize for micro, but I think it's important on innovation driving category growth and then when you need -- your sort of flip the switch to push for volume in a way that doesn't feel quite as innovation-driven."

One, Fabric Care is a good example of what happens when we get all the elements working together, and you've seen both the category growth and the share growth associated with it. On the specific comments, we go where the consumer goes and expresses interest and/or frustration. And the athleisure area is an area she has expressed frustration, and so we're trying to address a very specific need some consumers have. And to-date, that's tested very, very well. And we're actually quite excited about it, bringing some additional users in, and it may lead to increased consumption for existing users. But both will be important. And I think it will grow the category a little bit as well. The idea is very much to understand the needs consumers have and ensure we've got a product offering that meets them. And to the extent there's an unmet need, we will continue to innovate. The -- each of the add-on products that we've had the last year, whether it's in the fabric enhancer or the base Fabric Care business, I think has demonstrated the ability to grow the category and grow the share. So to-date, at least, I have not seen an indication that it is causing unneeded proliferation. In fact, if I step back and look across the company, we have meaningfully less SKUs today than we had a year ago. Many categories are down 10% to 20% in the number of SKUs they've offered, but what they are doing is trying to bring more meaningful consumer benefits to areas that are underserved or needs are unmet. And then the last comment I'd make on the 2-pods instruction, if you look at consumer habits today, they have higher-capacity washing machines. And some consumers are putting meaningfully more into each load. And what we're trying to do is provide consumers the understanding of what is the best amount of detergent or number of pods to use to get ideal performance. And in the U.S. at least, many consumers were underdosing, and this will allow consumers to get a much better outcome. And we've given them at least the guidance so that they do get the best outcome, and then it would be up to them certainly to choose what's right for them."

I'll give a couple of comments overall, but then it's very category-specific. On restarting top line growth, I will first emphasize we're getting back to making consumers aware of the product and communicating the benefit. So making sure we were consistently having the reach and frequency needed with the right message was key. And we've also, I think, adjusted our communication, both to TV, digital, in any way that's appropriate to reach target consumers, and I believe that's going to make a big difference. A second area that is helping, and you're going to see it continue and probably increase next year, is point-of-market entry and point-of-market change-focused spending. We understand, and we look back over several years, that had gone down on many categories, and it was showing up in lower shares with entry-point consumers. And that doesn't bode well for the future, and that's played out with some of the share losses that you and others have highlighted. The right way to build it back is to bring consumers in, and the best most effective way is to bring consumers into your category when they first have the need for the category. So we have prioritized point of market entry and point of market change, and that will continue to increase. We gave the example on laundry. It's also happening in many other categories. The second, which I think is critically important, and that will play out consistently over time, more even in the mid to long term, is the increased investment in innovation and showing that we have products that have meaningful consumer -- we call it consumer wow. We have adjusted our evaluation of innovation to not just have technically superior products but to have products and brands that have a meaningful difference that consumers see and appreciate. This higher bar is pushing us to go back on some of the innovations coming in the sheer amount of the product but also the package, and the experience is at a higher level so the consumer can play back it's meaningfully different. An example of a test that we're using frequently is deprivation: give the consumer product, and then take it away, and get their reaction. And if you get a really significant reaction, you probably have a product that really means something to the consumer. So I would say the areas that I would -- what we did focus on, and I believe to be very meaningful next year, would be point of market entry, continued consistent building of appropriate reach and frequency, and then consumer meaningful and appreciated innovation that has an impact on market growth, which is the last point I want to make, is our innovation at times has been very focused at trying to be a little bit better than our best competition. We've added the expectation for each of our categories that their role is to grow the category size because that has meaningful impact both on the support we get from customers but also the financial attractiveness of each of the innovations and, therefore, categories."

Stepping back kind of at a macro level on the kind of 4 pillars of transformation, productivity, portfolio, top line acceleration, organization and culture, I think the benefit from those efforts is primarily ahead of us. So the portfolio, we don't complete until October, and we still have a bunch of transition work to do to execute that big transaction. We have not yet been able to operate as a company in a 10-category-focused fashion. So all of that benefit, I think, is ahead. Our productivity, we have benefited from, and we will continue to benefit from. The acceleration, the investments really have just started in the last 6 months. And things like point of market entry, point of market change investments will increase as we go through next year. And frankly, they take some time to pay out themselves, but the payout is significant. And I think the other change that is sometimes underestimated in terms of its importance are the organization and cultural changes that David talked about. I think those will be significant, and frankly, we're just putting them in place. So the new incentive system goes into place in July. We moved, as David said, to dedicated sales resources in North America. We're just starting that move in some of the other big markets. So I think there's a lot of benefit ahead. Last comment as it relates to priority. These are all part of an ecosystem that's designed to work together to produce balanced top line, bottom line and cash flow growth. And I really like them because I think they're mutually reinforcing, as David said in his remarks. We get this top line growing, that will generate cost savings in itself through top line leverage, which will then give us the ability to invest. We'll have a motivated organization that's properly and strongly incented to deliver both. I think, without getting ahead of ourselves here, again, a lot of the benefit still comes in the future."

First, let me just take the cut at the China and then Jon can comment a little bit on the $18 billion from gross to net, and I'm happy to comment on conversations I've had with most of the leading customers. First on China. We see it sequentially improving. We are not done yet with getting our portfolio right in China. That will take time. There are several categories that we are still losing share, and we're not positioned with the appropriate portfolio in the premium, super premium segments. We started with the Oral-B effort last year. We've got some -- and we have innovation also in Fabric Care. But each of the categories has stepped up both the innovation pace but also making sure they have on-the-ground resources in China to ensure the product and the package and the proposition have been fine-tuned to really win the Chinese consumers. And that will take time. So I see that one building over time. The other comment I'd make on China based on a lot that I've heard and read is there's been a lot said about the attractiveness of China. Through our lens, it continues to be extremely attractive. Jon mentioned some of the reasons why, but I'd also say the published data often shows a very rapid slowdown. And that is true in the off-line portion of the business. We see it going to very low single digits, and some categories are now flat in China. Having said that, the online portion is accelerated and is certainly in the double digit, but you see many categories 1 30, 1 40, 1 50, and what is encouraging to me is our on online business is starting to accelerate. We're growing share in the past 6 months. And we've at least now got a couple of our categories where our online share is higher than our off-line share, which bodes well for the future, given the choice Chinese consumers are making. So it will continue to get better over time. Over the next 12 to 18 months, we'll see more and more innovation hitting that has been specifically designed for China versus adapted to be used in China, and I think that will increase our hit rate and our growth rate."

That's not the design intent here. But what we do want to do is ensure that [indiscernible] dollars, both in the form of trade spending but also in the form of marketing, in ways that maximize category growth, which benefits both ourselves and our retail partners. Now there are kind of 3 opportunities within that. One is, just like with our advertising budgets, including the agency and production cost, there are sources of inefficiency that we can access without impacting the market in any way or our retail partners in a significant way, and we ought to go after those. Two, ensuring that we're spending the money in a way that's most productive in terms of driving market basket both, again, for ourselves and our retail customers. And we have big opportunities there to sharpen the focus of where the money gets spent and, again, to the benefit of both our retail partners and ourselves. And the third one is a little bit trickier, but we have some good examples of this already, and we'll be testing others, is looking across the buckets of spend beyond trade spending, there are cases where if we would reduce trade spending, shift that money to advertising or sampling, we may be able to increase the rate of growth in a category, again, in a way that's beneficial to both our retail partners and ourselves. We did some of that, for example, on Olay in North America this year and got fairly broad support for that. So you're absolutely right. We're not looking at -- I wouldn't use the word cut in the space, but there are opportunities to shape the spend in a way that both increases efficiency and increases effectiveness for both us and our retail partners."

The digital and social space, to me, is a powerful opportunity for any consumer marketing company, and it's left to all of us to figure out how to best leverage the capability that has been developed, and frankly, continues to emerge rapidly. P&G has shifted significantly its resources and our investments to ensure that we are showing up with communication that wins mobile back. And that's a big shift for us, and that's critically important because whether it's e-commerce or whether it's consumption of media, in many markets, it's now primarily through the mobile phone. And more and more you're seeing P&G winning with the marketing programs that are adapted for digital and social. And a good example of one -- of a social program that has done extraordinarily well is the Always Like A Girl, where we've leveraged that communication and that very strong social platform, but used and leveraged the social media capability to drive the brand. I do understand, and certainly there's very real -- the cost to enter a category has changed dramatically today versus 5 and 10 years ago. And part of what we are doing, by category, then is looking to see how do we leverage the capability that exists. I expect we'll continue to see competitors that can pop up. But generally, to sustain and grow a business, you have to have a product and a product experience that meets the consumers' need. There are many, many examples of Internet-based competitors that have been popping up both here and China. Tremendous number of those. They get trial, repurchase those is another story, and repurchase in a profitable business model is the highest bar, and that's the one that we're working against. It's just have a substantive product that meets the consumers' need, to have communication programs that meet consumers when and where they're receptive to the message and understand they want less to be sold and more to be part of their life, and we're adjusting our marketing and communication programs to do just that. And I think that's the right way by category to win."

And it's because we have adjusted significantly to not see it as a separate activity but an integrated part of how we go and meet consumers when and where they're receptive to shop. Our growth rate is -- it varies between kind of 1 10 up to the highest market we currently have is 1 85. And the size of our business, you mentioned China, some of our competitors have quoted more than 10%. We're well above 10% of our business is on e-commerce and growing fast. In past 6 months, we're up 0.7 share in e-commerce in Greater China, or in China specifically. So yes, it is growing. We have established efforts in each of the major markets where it's a meaningful part of our business. We now have 5, almost 6 categories where it's over a $100 million business and growing fast. And again, in general, we're at market growth or a little bit higher on majority of our markets, the top 8 markets. And then if I look even through the lens of customers, we're working very closely with any of the customers, whether it be bricks and mortars, omnichannel players or the pure plays, to make sure that we have the portfolio and the communication that wins with them. And whether it is the big retailers in the U.S. or around the world, or whether it's the pure plays on Amazon, Jingdong, or Alibaba, both we're trying to ensure that we show up having consumer and shopper data that helps develop the category and that we have the product offerings to win. And again, our results, the last 6 months, to me, speak to the pivot we've made to make sure we show up in that segment very, very well. And the last comment I'd make is we are also ensuring that we adjust our packaging and our sizing to ensure we have the right offerings for what consumers and shoppers want that shop in that channel, again looking through each category lens."

I guess I'm trying to figure out what that suggests about the competitive environment we should expect in HPC [ph] as you execute your turnaround plans. I mean, if you think about 2017, obviously mid-single-digit EPS growth, so just not a lot of EPS growth beyond Coty and Duracell. Every -- all of the cost savings you're talking about, all that top line growth can be reinvested in the bottom line. And it's going to be reinvested into the market.

If you look at price inclusive of promotion as a component of top line, we've been neutral to positive for 23 straight quarters and 12 consecutive years. And I don't think that relative preference in the drivers for business growth changes going forward. But we've had 2 dynamics that we've been dealing with in the last year that kind of inform next year's view. One is we've been pricing significantly to recover foreign exchange impacts, which has resulted in volume being less of a component of the top line, in fact, in many cases, a negative component. We're hopeful that we're going to be operating in a more stable currency environment. So that volume negative goes away. Also, as you have and others have rightly pointed out on several occasions, we've had category-country combinations where our pricing got too high. In many cases, that's where we were trying to recover from devaluation and competitors didn't follow. In other cases, Dave talked about Luvs in his prepared remarks, a major competitor took pricing down in that segment, and we'll be adjusting prices to deal with those realities, which makes price, in those instances, less of the top line component and volume more of it. We have no interest in spending unproductively. Our intent is to drive, as David said, category growth. And we do not see the business in most parts of the world through a zero-sum lens in any way."

And it's been most acute in places like Russia, where the differential impact we had was very severe for a U.S.-domiciled company. And you're seeing even Russia volume share has recovered. And until we annualize that, it will show up with the dynamic that you highlighted. But there, our front half was below 100 and our back half is double digit, and especially the fourth quarter. That will annualize, and we get back to exactly what Jon said, which is our business model is very, very clear, which is we want to invest in innovation and brand-building, especially focus the brand-building and bringing consumers in, and then we want to delight them so they stay with our brand.

We have, already this year, increased our support for our U.S. Shave Care business, and we'll continue to make sure we support it at the level required to get back to growing. The strategic choice we made that I highlighted earlier, which is very important and should play out positively, in spite of Unilever's acquisition of Dollar Shave Club, is activating more than just the high end of the portfolio. Where we've been most vulnerable is at the mid- and lower tier. And if you look at our share losses, that's where we've been most acute. And Dollar Shave Club has come in with, in some cases, a lower absolute cash outlay. Not a better-performing product, and actually not a better-value product, when you look over time. And for that reason, we have -- and we had other challenges which I think are well known in private label and disposables. So we've gone back and innovated on all 3 tiers and also addressed and now funded marketing programs aimed at all 3: disposables; the MACH3 segment, both in innovation and brand support; and in the premium tier. To me, that will continue to be funded. That is anticipated in our guidance. That's part of the base plan for fiscal '17 for Shave Care. Moving to the second one on Fabric Care, Henkel's acquisition of Sun. Certainly, we're very aware. There was a lot of concern, if you go back a year ago, for sale, when it came in, that, that would have a real detrimental impact on our business. And the view we took then is the same view we take now, is that there will be dynamics in the marketplace that could change, and we'll see how the category sorts itself out. But the way we were able to win is the same strategy going into fiscal '17. Fabric Care focused on consumers and shoppers. They brought aggressive innovation to make sure that they're meeting the shoppers' needs better than anybody else, premium performing products. And they did a great job communicating and sampling their products. And you see, this fiscal year built into our guidance is increased level sampling. And with a broader sampling program as well as the marketing program that is in place, and I just mentioned some additional innovation coming on the product front, I think we are actually well positioned. And the objective going in, independent of what happens in terms of industry consolidation, is that we win with consumers and shoppers. And we'll see how it plays out on the other point."

We -- 6, 9 months ago, made a choice that we're going to win in China and then allocated the resources and the capital to ensure that we had the appropriate product innovation coming. It's not yet publicly announced when some of these major innovations are coming. But on both diapers and pants, we're very committed to win. An encouraging sign to me about the future in China is to look at what we've been able to do recently in Japan, where in Japan, you've seen us now take share leadership. And frankly, we're losing to primarily -- Japanese competitors have done extremely well in China, as well as KC [ph]. And innovation that we have coming over the next fiscal year and beyond, we think will position us well. On Olay, our first step was to get our portfolio cleaned up. That's been done. If you step back and look at the 4 core collections on Olay, we're starting to see a meaningful difference, which is to me a very positive sign, and that's Total Effects, Regenerist, our whitening segment and ProX. On those, we see back half doing better than second half. We still have to anniversary some of the discontinued SKUs. And the second key innovation on Olay will be getting our counters right. Our counters, and having been to China many times and previously lived in Greater China, our counters have gotten quite tired and have not been upgraded recently. So we've shut down the counters that are in stores that aren't productive. And we've made meaningful investments in upgrading the counters in the stores that we think have a basis -- places where we have a basis to compete. So counter innovation is coming. It's already happening. It is funded, and showing up now. And the innovations will be coming on, primarily, the 4 core collections and then some new innovations that we'll be doing. And then the last category is -- hair is our largest category in China. We have meaningful innovations coming on both the conditioner that are superior. And I mentioned earlier, it's already been launched in the U.S. and launched in China. It is superior performing. We have hair innovation coming on many of our brands. Pantene and Head & Shoulders, historically, have been stronger. VS is actually growing share, and we've got innovation coming on in Rejoice, which has been the weakest of our brands in China. So on each one of the brands there's focus. We've also made the choice, funded and staffed on-the-ground resources to ensure we keep up with the pace of innovation required in the Beauty segment, which to me is an important choice about winning in the future in China.

I am joined this morning by our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, David Taylor; and by our Vice President of Investor Relations, John Chevalier. 
I plan to take you through the quarter and provide an update on productivity and our portfolio project. David will discuss our efforts to accelerate top line growth, will briefly review progress in each of our 10 business categories and will discuss our plans to further strengthen our organization and culture, all to reliably drive balanced top and bottom line growth. 
We're making progress in moving P&G's results to a balanced top line, bottom line and cash flow growth. The increased investments in innovation, advertising and sales coverage to enhance our long-term prospects for faster, sustainable top line growth and stabilize top line growth rates in several key markets. We have delivered another strong year of productivity improvement and cost savings to help fund this. 
Cash flow continues to be strong with fiscal year adjusted free cash flow productivity of 115%. Organic sales for the quarter were up 2%. This includes about a 1 point drag from the combination of the cleanup work we're doing within the ongoing portfolio and the impact of reduced finished product sales to our Venezuelan subsidiaries. As we get through the cleanup work and annualize the Venezuela headwinds, we'll be closer to 3% growth. 
Importantly, the sales growth was volume-driven, with organic volume growing 2%. Organic volume was ahead of year-ago in every segment ranging from plus 1% to plus 5%. Organic sales grew in every segment ranging from plus 1% to plus 8%. Organic sales were up 1.5 point in developed markets and 3.5 points in developing markets. In North America, organic sales grew 2%, roughly in line with underlying market growth, our second consecutive quarter at this level. Organic volume in North America grew 3% for the second consecutive quarter, slightly ahead of underlying market growth. In China, organic sales were in line versus the prior year, an improvement over last quarter and another step toward returning to market level growth or better. All-in sales for the company were down 3%, including the 3 point headwind from foreign exchange and a 2 point drag from the combination of Venezuela deconsolidation and minor brand divestitures. 
Core gross margin increased 160 basis points versus the prior year. On a constant-currency basis, core gross margin was up 240 basis points, including 280 basis points of productivity improvements. Core operating margin was down 150 basis points for the quarter due to foreign exchange headwinds and a significant increase in advertising support versus the prior year. On a constant-currency basis, core operating margin was down 30 basis points. Productivity improvements contributed 360 basis points of operating margin benefit in the fourth quarter. 
Core earnings per share were $0.79, slightly above the high end of our implied guidance range. This is a reduction of 15% versus the prior year, due mainly to foreign exchange, lower nonoperating income and a higher tax rate. Foreign exchange was a $0.07 per share or $200 million after-tax headwind on fourth quarter earnings. Nonoperating income was $0.02 per share headwind, as the base period quarter included higher gains from minor brand divestitures. The core effective tax rate was a $0.06 per share impact on core earnings per share for the quarter at 23.8%, up 540 basis points versus last year. This is a little better than we initially projected, but still a substantial increase compared to last year. These 3 impacts, foreign exchange, nonoperating income and tax, were a combined core earnings per share growth headwind of $0.15 per share this quarter. Adjusting for these impacts, fourth quarter core EPS was up modestly versus the prior year. On an all-in GAAP basis, earnings per share were $0.69 for the quarter, up 283% versus the prior year quarter that included a significant onetime impact from the deconsolidation of Venezuelan results. 
We generated $2.8 billion on free cash flow with a 145% adjusted free cash flow productivity. Over the course of the fiscal year, we generated $12.1 billion in free cash flow, yielding adjusted free cash flow productivity of 115%. 
We were able to reduce outstanding shares at a value of over $8 billion through a combination of share repurchase and shares that were exchanged in the Duracell transaction. We paid dividends of more than $7.4 billion. In total, nearly $16 billion in dividend payments, share exchanges and share repurchase. 
Now looking forward. We continue to focus on large opportunities that should be within our control, executing what is the largest transformation in our company's history, reaccelerating top line growth with strengthened category business models, innovation plans, and where appropriate, improve value equations. Step change in cost and cash productivity, simplifying and strengthening our product portfolio and strengthening our organization and culture, all to win more consistently. This transformation is aimed at delivering balanced top and bottom line growth and leadership value creation. 
Top line growth was our biggest improvement in the year and has enabled by both our productivity efforts and the portfolio strengthening that are underway. I'll talk briefly about these enabling efforts and then turn it over to David for discussion on top line acceleration itself. 
We continue to dramatically improve cost and cash productivity, with significant upside still ahead. We have accelerated and exceeded each of our productivity objectives and have now raised them. Our original 5-year cost of goods savings target was $6 billion. We delivered $7.2 billion, more than $1 billion over our initial target. We delivered cost of goods savings, which were at or above target each over the last 5 fiscal years. We've reduced manufacturing enrollment by 22% over the last 4 years. This includes new staffing necessary to support capacity additions. On a same-site basis, manufacturing enrollment was down about 27% through June 2016 with additional progress planned in fiscal 2017. These figures exclude divestiture impacts. 
In February of 2012, we announced that we would reduce nonmanufacturing or overhead enrollment by 10% over 5 years. As of July 1, we've reduced roles by nearly 25%, 2.5x the original target. Including divestitures, we'll reduce nonmanufacturing or overhead roles by about 35% by the end of fiscal '17.  
We're reducing nonworking marketing expenditures, costs that don't impact reach, frequency or continuity of our advertising and trial generation programs. We were spending $2 billion per year on agency fees. 2 years ago, we reduced the roughly 6,000 agencies we work with by nearly 40% and cut agency and production spending by about $370 million. In fiscal 2016, we delivered an additional $250 million of agency-related savings, reinvesting these savings in advertising and sampling of consumer-preferred products, over $600 million of savings in 2 years. 
We're driving productivity improvement up and down the income statement and across the balance sheet. Inventory days are down. Payables days are up. Net of reinvestments in innovation, sales coverage, media and sampling, productivity has enabled us to deliver constant-currency gross and operating profit margin improvement and high single to double-digit constant-currency core earnings per share growth in each of the last 4 fiscal years. We improved gross and operating margins by triple-digit indices, both including and excluding currency in fiscal 2016. 
We said over 4 years ago that, we needed to make cost and cash productivity part of our culture. It's integral to our culture as innovation. We've made significant progress, and we have significant opportunity. Our strong track record and our line of sight to additional opportunity inform our intent to save as much as another $10 billion in cost over the next 5 years. The majority of these savings will again come from cost of goods sold, an area where we have consistently met or exceeded our targets. 
Supply chain transformation is in its early stages. First in North America, next in Europe, then in Latin America and India, the Middle East and Africa. We're in investment mode now with savings to ramp up in 2, 3 and 4 years. 
Our new U.S. Mexican centers are up and running, putting roughly 80% of volume within 24 hours of store shelves. On-time deliveries and frequency of deliveries have increased. We've already seen an improvement in customer service levels resulting in improved on shelf ability -- excuse me, availability in the U.S. by more than 1 point to roughly 96%. 
We're constructing multi-category manufacturing sites in geographically strategic locations to replace smaller, single-category sites in less cost-effective locations. We're well underway with the construction of a new site in West Virginia, that's scheduled to start production in calendar 2017. We've announced moves of production for some laundry detergent, fabric enhancer, perfume, body wash and haircare products, and we've announced our complete shutdown of 3 sites. In Europe, we've announced plans to consolidate production of laundry powders, deodorants and hard surface cleaners to fewer plants across our European manufacturing network. We're now beginning the consolidation work in Latin America. 
As we make these moves, we're upgrading and standardizing manufacturing platforms to lower cost and to facilitate faster innovation. We're employing smart automation and digitization to improve manufacturing productivity, monitor unfinished product logistics and demand planning. We have additional opportunity to optimize working capital and further increase the efficiency of our capital spend. 
After 2 strong years of savings, we'll enter next year still spending about $1.4 billion on agency-related costs, still more room to improve. And as we fully operationalize the new focused 10-category company, there will be additional opportunities to increase organization efficiency, agility and speed of decision-making, enabled in many cases by digitization and automation. 
Finally, we're working to improve the effectiveness of our promotional spending. We currently spend about $18 billion in productions between gross and net sales. We see clear opportunities to improve the effectiveness of the spend for us and our retail partners to build the value of our categories and the share of P&G brands. So again, we're targeting up to $10 billion of additional savings over the next 5 years. We expect to reinvest a significant amount of the savings in R&D and product and packaging improvements, sales coverage and in brand awareness and trial building programs to deliver balanced top and bottom line growth. 
Moving to portfolio. Over the last 18 months, we've divested, discontinued or consolidated 61 brands, including the completion of the Duracell transaction at the end of February. We have 44 more brands in the exit process, including 41 brands in the deal with Coty. We're currently winding down transition support for Duracell. We have completed the systems work in standing up the Beauty business for the transaction with Coty. We've received antitrust clearance in all markets. We currently remain on track to close the deal with Coty in October 2016. By the end of the fiscal year, we will have exited 105 brands and all of the complexity they create. These brands represent only about 6% of base period profit. 
Going forward, our portfolio will be anchored on 10-category-based business units and 65 brands. These are categories where P&G has leading market positions and where product technologies deliver performance differences that matter to consumers. These 10 businesses have historically grown faster with higher margins than the balance of the company. We're moving away from businesses that are more trend driven, where fashion, fragrance and flavor drive consumer purchase decisions. We're focusing our businesses where products and performance drive purchase decisions, where there are clear consumer drops to be done and clear objective measures of performance. These are products that consumers purchase and use on a daily basis, and they're in structurally part of categories. 
Within these core businesses, we're focusing our offerings, making smart choices for short, mid and long-term value creation. For growing that businesses even when these choices create near-term top line pressure. In our Mexico Family Care business, we discontinued low-tier unprofitable and commoditizing products and are focusing instead on very profitable high-tier differentiated products, moving from double-digit negative margins to double-digit positive margins. While we first talked about this a year ago, it took several quarters to sell out remaining inventories of the discontinued products. As a result, the top line drag doesn't fully annualize until the end of this calendar year. 
In India, we've made a similar choice to de-prioritize several unprofitable lines of business, which negatively impact short-term top line growth rates, but will lead longer term to a much more profitable business that will grow strongly. The strategic part of our India business is growing at a high single-digit pace. Sales in the portion of the business we're fixing or exiting about 15% of the portfolio, have been down more than 35%. The top line pain is worth it. We're making significant progress in improving local profit margins, up 750 basis points over the last 2 years. We've gone from losing significant money in India to triple-digit profits in just 2 years. 
We're taking a similar approach in our Fabric Care product portfolio. Discontinuing product forms, additives, bars, bleaches and tablets and value-tier and powder detergents that have been a drag on profitability and value creation. These choices are causing a top line drag in the global fabric care business, but improve the profitability and the long-term attractiveness of the business. 
In SKUs we've eliminated to simplify our Olay lineup causing incremental drag on sales growth. As we annualize this headwind next year and as we focus our innovation and marketing support on the core boutiques and SKUs in the portfolio, we'll have set the stage for faster, more profitable growth. Combined, these choices have been causing about 1 point drag on organic sales growth. We expect this headwind to continue for the balance of calendar year and then dissipate in the second half of next year as we begin annualizing these effects. 
So that's productivity and portfolio, both on or ahead of track, with -- and this is important, a significant amount of benefits still ahead of us. 
I'll now hand over it over to David to update you on the top line, provide a brief status review across the 10-product categories and talk about important steps we've undertaken to strengthen our organization and culture to more consistently create value."
33328,327687250,1022025,"The Procter & Gamble Company, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","The Procter & Gamble Company","Executives","Good morning.

Our objective is very clear: balanced top and bottom line growth that delivers total shareholder returns that place P&G consistently in the top third of our peer group. A critically important element of our transformation is reacceleration of our top line growth to reach and sustain organic sales growth at or slightly ahead of underlying growth at the markets where we compete. Productivity improvement and cost savings are necessity in this effort, providing fuel for innovation, advertising, sales coverage and trial and sampling to grow users and usage. 
Top and bottom line growth are not separate endeavors. They reinforce and fuel each other. Now everything in this model starts with delighting consumers and shoppers. Winning at the zero, first and second moments of truth, when consumers research our categories and brands, purchase them in the store or online and use them in homes. Winning these critical moments requires consumer and shopper insights that leads to improved product innovations, consumer communication and retail programs that lead to competitive advantages for P&G brands and products. 
Now we're making progress in accelerating organic sales growth, but we're not yet where we need to be. There's more work to be done. As Jon just shared, organic sales grew in all 5 reporting segments and were in line or higher in 9 of 10 product categories in that April-June quarter. In most of these businesses, the back half of the year was stronger than the first half. Organic sales for the company was essentially flat in the first half of the year and were up 1.5% in the second half. Obvious acceleration, but not where we want to be. 
Let me spend a minute on each of the 10 categories. We're growing our Fabric Care business with consumer-preferred brands and product offerings like our premium performance and premium-priced unit dose detergents and our market-leading and importantly expanding scent bead fabric enhancers. We're exiting slower-growing, lower-priced, more commoditized product forms where it's more difficult to distinguish our products and create value. 
Fabric Care results in the U.S. demonstrate what is possible when we deliver superior value from best-in-class performance at a modest price premium. The U.S. laundry detergent market is continuing to grow behind our efforts, with the category up 4 points last year. The same is true for fabric enhancers. Spurred by the rapid growth of scent beads, the U.S. fabric enhancers category is growing, up 7 points on a value basis last year, with scent beads form growing in the mid-20s. Our share is growing. P&G's laundry detergent and fabric enhancer value shares were up in fiscal 2016. 
And we will continue to be the innovation leader in Fabric Care. In North America, we're introducing a new regimen on Tide and Downy that addresses the odor problems common to the growing athletic wear segment. 70% of consumers wear athletic gear multiple times each week. The odor defense collection, anchored by innovation on Tide PODS brings a proprietary formula of enzymes and surfactants that break down and remove stubborn soils and residues -- residue for a great clean and fresh scent. Now paired with the added cleaning power of Tide Odor Defense Rescue laundry booster and Downy Fresh Protect odor defense beads, this regimen promises to eliminate odors from the fast-growing market of athleisure clothes people are wearing far beyond the gym. 
We opened a leaning market of Tide Pure Clean liquid detergent in the U.S. Naturals is a large and growing segment in several categories, but Naturals are only about 3% of the laundry category currently. Unlocking growth in Naturals is about solving the tension between green and clean. People want performance and sustainability. Pure Clean provides the cleaning power of Tide with 65% bio-based ingredients and is produced with 100% renewable wind power electricity in a facility operating with 0 manufacturing waste to landfill. Now it's very early to read results, but after just 5 weeks on shelf, with no TV advertising, Pure Clean is approaching a 1 share of detergents within the learning market stores. We're increasing sampling in new washing machines, a key point of category entry and change for consumers. In fiscal 2015, we distributed 5 million samples in washing machines globally. Last fiscal years, we increased that to 17 million. In fiscal 2017, we'll distribute 30 million examples of our best-performing products. 
Turning to Home Care. Our performance in this category has been very strong. Cascade grew sales high single digits last year behind the continued success of Cascade Platinum, our best-performing and most premium-priced odorless detergent. In North America, we increased sampling on Cascade Premium by 20% last year. The Dawn brand delivered its ninth consecutive year of organic sales growth in U.S. This result has also been strong in Japan and Europe on hand washing liquids and other detergent products. Febreze had a challenging year, down low singles, but we have innovations coming next fiscal. 
In Hair Care, we launched our new conditioner innovation on Pantene in the U.S. early this calendar year. The new conditioner technology is a consumer blind test winner versus our best competition in North America, China and Japan. Pantene and Head & Shoulders each delivered solid organic sales growth in the U.S. for the second consecutive year. Herbal Essences was the main drag on the Hair Care growth, down mid-teens last fiscal year. Now we have plans in the works for product, package and consumer communication improvements in fiscal 2017. 
In the Skin and Personal Care category, SK-II had another very strong year with organic sales up mid -- low teens. As Jon mentioned, Olay completed a significant streamlining of SKUs in North America last year. In China, Olay's second biggest market, we're executing a similar streamlining of sales counters, retaining the top-selling and most profitable counters to focus resources where it matters most, on the doors that create the most value. On Old Spice, sales were up versus the prior year and accelerated in the second half behind the hardest working collection innovation bundle, that included performance and scent upgrades to Old Spice detergents and body wash over other deodorants and body washes in the U.S. 
In Grooming, Gillette delivered steady growth in international markets last fiscal, holding or growing value share in each region outside the U.S. behind strong innovation, advertising and sampling programs. The growth in international markets was offset by soft results in the U.S. To improve our growth and the growth of the market, we are reinvesting in innovation, new user trial and improved consumer value. We completed the global expansion of our very successful Gillette Fusion FlexBall innovation into Asia in 2016. We expanded our performance advantage at the top end of the market. Our most recent cartridge innovation, Gillette Fusion ProShield, launched in January. We're supporting a broader range of our product ladder from our best product, Fusion FlexBall ProShield, to MACH3 systems to premium-priced and superior performance disposables with stronger consumer value communication. We're facing more aggressive competition at lower price points, and we will respond to ensure our brands remain a superior consumer value. We're driving trial at point of market entry. We put Fusion ProGlide FlexBall razors in the hands of nearly 80% of young men, over 2 million samples last year in U.S. with our 18th birthday sampling program. We're now sampling the FlexBall razor handle and ProShield cartridge, our very best combination of shaving technologies. 
Fiscal 2016 was a difficult year in Personal Health Care due to the very weak cough/cold season in the U.S. The category was also compared against a base period that contained the launch of many new items in the Metamucil and Vicks brands. Even with these headwinds, the category delivered positive organic sales growth for the year. Organic sales in Oral Care were up low single digits in fiscal 2016 with high single-digit after-tax profit growth behind strong productivity improvements. Sales of our top-performing items grew fast as last fiscal with premium Oral-B power toothbrushes and premium HD toothpaste, each up mid-teens. Organic sales in the 42 Oral-B toothpaste expansion markets were up double digits last fiscal year. The solid growth in developed markets was partially offset by lower sales in several developing markets, where we took pricing to offset foreign exchange impacts. 
In U.S. Baby Care, strong innovation, consumer communication, trial programs and a robust online presence have led to strong growth for Pampers. Pampers value share of U.S. diapers was up 1 point last fiscal. Pampers latest Swaddlers and Cruisers innovation Extra Absorb Channels, is driving share growth in the premium-tier diaper category with Swaddlers and Cruisers share up more than 1 point last fiscal year. 
We strengthened investments in brand awareness and trial at point-of-category entry. Now 70% of new moms in the U.S. will see samples of our best products through our prenatal and hospital program. 
Fiscal 2015 marked the seventh consecutive year of sales and value share growth of the Luvs brand in the U.S.; however, results were down in fiscal 2016, following a significant price reduction taken by our primary competitor. Now we've taken steps to improve the awareness, trial and consumer value of Luvs. We're increasing equity-building advertising, strengthening in-store programs, and we're currently launching product and improvements. In Japan, Pampers value share grew more than 2 points last year. Pampers is now the value share leader in Japan diapers and also the share leader in the pants segment. Baby Care results have been softer in other markets. To address this, we strengthened our value proposition in several markets and accelerated premium innovation on both taped and pull-on diapers to restore our competitiveness at the top and of the market. We're strengthening our selling resources and programs for baby center stores and e-commerce, and we're increasing investments in point of market entry programs to drive higher awareness and trial of Pampers among new moms. 
Fem care organic sales were up low single digits for the fiscal year with improvement [indiscernible] in the second of half, including a strong fourth quarter with mid-single digit organic volume and sales growth. Expansion and leverage of innovation such as Always Infinity and Always Discreet have been the key drivers of improved top line growth. We've always made consumer value interventions in markets like Russia to restore pricing to competitive levels, which helped in the second half. 
In Family Care, the top tier segments of the Bounty and Charmin brands delivered solid organic sales growth last fiscal. Now as Jon discussed, we made the choice to discontinue low-tier products in Mexico, which drove overall category sales down versus the prior year. Global bottom line results were strong with after-tax profits up high single digits in fiscal 2016. We have product and packaging innovations coming this year on the Bounty Basic and Charmin Basic brands to improve their positioning with consumers in the U.S. 
Now look briefly at our top 2 markets. First, the U.S. Organic sales and shipment volume was up about 0.5 point in the first half of fiscal year. We accelerated this growth in the back half of the year to plus 2% and 2.5% organic sales and shipments, respectively. The second half growth rates are roughly in line with underlying growth of our categories. We plan to build on this momentum. 
China organic sales were down 5 points last fiscal, but improved sequentially in the third and fourth quarters. The fourth quarter was in line with prior year. Progress, but nothing worth celebrating yet. In fiscal 2017, we'll relaunch product lines in several categories and will implement a new go-to-market program across retailers and distributors in China. These improvements will take some time to fully take hold. Recovery will not be a straight line, but in aggregate, fiscal year results should improve. 
As we work to accelerate top line growth, enabled by productivity and portfolio choices, we are transforming our organization and culture. We're making many changes that by themselves may seem small and obvious, but together, they are significant and important. 
As an example, we've made several important changes in how we go to market. We've talked previously about eliminating overlapping resources and duplicative structures and responsibilities of marketing sales professionals in the global business units, in the market development organizations, clarifying responsibilities and strengthening accountability. Reflecting this, awhile back, we changed the name of our market development organizations to selling and market operations, a small but very important change. We're changing our talent development and assignment planning to drive more mastery and depth. The objective is simple. Improve business results by getting and keeping the right people in the right places to develop and apply deep category mastery to win. 
Consistent with this, we've dedicated sales resources to categories or sectors. In our larger markets, sales resources have greater accountability back to the categories they serve, which is also a change. We're running incentives at a lower and more specific level of granularity to better match these responsibilities and to increase accountability. Now P&G is fortunate to consistently source and develop strong talent, and we intend to maintain our develop-from-within approach. But there are times when the best talent for a role may not be inside our organization. We are now implementing and supplementing key businesses with outside hiring, more often when we need to field the best team possible. As an example, we've dedicated ample resources to improve category mastery in our North American Personal Health Care sales force. 2 years ago, the average tenure of salespeople within the category was less than 12 months. About half of the salespeople were dedicated only to Personal Health Care and 100% of the people were even new hires coming to P&G with no work experience or transfers from other P&G businesses. Over the last year or so, we've added resources to the consumer Health Care sales force. Almost half of those people had prior Health Care sales experience. Today, 100% of people selling the business are dedicated to Personal Health Care and the average experience level is now more than 5 years of Health Care sales experience inside or outside of P&G. Over the last 2 years, we've added 115 people to the U.S. retail sales force through external hiring, and more than half of them had prior sales experience. Over the last 2 years, we've increased category dedication of the U.S. sales force by 20%, with more than 90% of salespeople now focused on one category. We've doubled the number of experienced external hires last fiscal versus the prior year, bringing in experienced talent at 5 different levels of management, including the vice president level. Experienced hires comprised about 5% of all management hiring in fiscal 2016. 
Bottom line, we -- we're committed to getting, keeping and growing the right people in the right place to drive better business results. Again, each of these changes may seem small and rather obvious, but collectively, they're big and important changes for our organization and culture. Each area of transformation, top line acceleration, productivity, portfolio and strengthening our organizational culture requires change. Let me say again what I've said at the CAGNY Conference in February. ""P&G is ready to adapt, evolve and change whatever is needed to win."" We're making good progress in each of these areas, but we know our success will ultimately be graded on the sales, profit, cash and value-creation results we deliver, not on the activities that get us there. We are committed to do everything we can and to change what must be changed to deliver these results. 
Now let me hand it back to Jon to discuss fiscal 2017 guidance, and then I'll be happy to take your questions."
33328,327687250,1022025,"The Procter & Gamble Company, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","The Procter & Gamble Company","Executives","Thanks, David.

To frame guidance, I think it's helpful to look briefly at the macro environment that confronts us as we start fiscal 2017. Category growth rate slowed throughout last fiscal year and are currently growing at about a 3% pace for our global footprint. As you know, GDP growth rate had slowed to the point that at least 10 countries have moved to negative interest rates, including Germany, Japan, Denmark, France, Italy, Spain and Switzerland. Political, economic and foreign exchange volatility each continue to have a large impact on the markets and on the currencies in which we operate. The recent Brexit decision is but -- one example of a political disruption impact that has knock-on effects on consumer confidence and resulting market growth. The recent coup attempt in Turkey is another example. We continue to face significant FX volatility such as the recent 40% devaluation of the Nigerian currency and 25% devaluation for open market transactions in Egypt. Our ability to ensure supply and stay on shelf at many markets is dependent our ability to source U.S. dollars. Currency exchange constraints in markets such as Egypt, Nigeria, Venezuela, and historically, Argentina, make operations in those countries very difficult to manage and sometimes result in production shutdowns. Net, we continue to face a relatively slow growth volatile world, which is reflected in our fiscal 2017 guidance. We're currently expecting organic sales growth of around 2%. This includes between 0.5 point and 1 point of headwind and the cleanup work within the ongoing 10-product categories. It also includes the remaining 2 quarters of headwind from loss sales for our Venezuelan subsidiaries. As we annualize more of the cleanup work and as we make progress in markets like China, we should be getting back towards market level growth rates by fiscal year's end. We expect fiscal 2017 all-in sales growth of about 1%, including 1 point drag on growth from the net impact of foreign exchange and divestitures. 
Our bottom line guidance is core earnings per share growth of mid-single digits. This range reflects the volatility of the markets in which we compete and it reflects the investments we intend to make in the business to accelerate organic sales growth in a sustainable long-term market-constructive and value-accretive way. We'll work with our retail partners to build the value of our categories behind strong product innovation and more effective in-store and online merchandising of our leading brands. We'll reinvest savings to improve product formulations and packaging, sales coverage and media programs, product sampling and in-store demand creation. We'll also invest in consumer value equations, correcting value gaps and quickly responding to competitive challenges as they emerge throughout the year. 
This guidance includes the fiscal average share count reduction of approximately 4%, the net outstanding share reductions from the full year impact of the Duracell deal, the Beauty transaction with Coty, discretionary share repurchase and stock option exercises. The actual impact on outstanding shares from the Beauty transaction won't be known until the deal is completed in October and will of course be dependent on the stock prices of both companies and the transaction discount. 
We're forecasting a reduction in nonoperating income in fiscal 2017 due to lower gains from minor brand divestitures. The core effective tax rate should be roughly in line with the fiscal 2016 level. All-in GAAP earnings per share should increase 45% to 55%, due primarily to the significant onetime gain from the Beauty transaction with Coty. Also included in the GAAP earnings per share range are $0.10 per share of noncore restructuring charges. 
We expect adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% or better, CapEx should be in the range of 5% to 5.5% of sales. Fiscal 2017 will be a year of significant value return to share owners. We expect to pay dividends of over $7 billion. In addition, we expect to reduce outstanding shares at a value of approximately of $15 billion through a combination of the direct share repurchase and shares that will be exchanged in the Beauty transaction. In total, over $22 billion in dividend payments, share exchanges and share repurchase. 
To summarize fiscal 2017 guidance. Our current forecast calls for around 2% organic sales growth, all-in sales growth will be about -- around 1%, and we should have a small improvement in profit margins. Nonoperating income will be a headwind, and share count will contribute about 4% of earnings per share benefit. All current rates -- at current rates and prices, FX and commodities are modest headwind to fiscal 2017 earnings. Significant currency weaknesses, commodity increases or additional geopolitical disruptions are not anticipated within this guidance. While we currently expect FX to only be a small headwind for the year, it'll still be a notable headwind in Q1. We'll still be impacted by significant devaluations in the U.K., Argentina, Egypt, Nigeria, among others. We'll also still be annualizing the loss of finished product sales through our Venezuelan subsidiaries. 
Please take these factors into account as you consider the quarterly profile of your sales and earnings estimate. 
With that, I'll hand it back to David for his closing comments."

We expect this year to represent another significant step toward our goal of balanced growth and value creation. We're committed to continued productivity improvement and cost savings that provide the fuel for innovation and investments needed to accelerate and sustain faster top line growth. We have created and are sustaining strong cash productivity momentum. We're nearing the completion of the major portfolio moves to simplify and strengthen the category portfolio, and we're making similar moves at the brand and product form level to improve the profitability and value-creation capability of the categories we retain. We're strengthening the organization and culture by improving our approaches to our talent acquisition, career management, decision-making, accountability and incentives. Our standards are high. We're not satisfied with just being a little better. We want to be the best. We're making progress, and we're determined to win, but also realistic about the time it will take for the improvements and investments we're making to fully play out in our results.

In our view, we need to be growing at or slightly ahead of the markets in which we're operating, and we fully intend to do that. We're -- as we have said, we're going to reinvest a significant portion of the savings that we're generating behind that effort to get back to market share growth. And that will -- that started -- you see it in the numbers in the fourth quarter and will continue as we go forward. Just one thing on share trends. I mean, you're absolutely right in your overall observation. But if you look at across the 5 reporting segments, market share trends past 6 months, past 12 months, were better past 6 months in 5 out of 5 segments. The same holds for the past 3 months versus the past 6 months. So again, 5 out of 5 segments improving. And the same for the past 1 month versus past 3-month comparison. Again, as David very clearly said, we're not where we want to be, but we're starting to see that progress and we reinvest behind the opportunities that are in front of us. In terms of the savings proration across the 5 years, this program will be a little bit more backloaded than our prior program, in part, because of the nature of some of the projects that are contained in it specifically, the supply chain transformation, where as I said, we're in investment mode now and the savings will come 2, 3, 4 years from now. Having said that, there will be a significant contributions from productivity again next year, which will give us the ability to increase investment in the business. We're expecting increases in advertising spend this year versus last, think about it in probably mid-single-digit range. We want to increase, as David said in his remarks, sampling of consumer-preferred products and trial generation. We want to be more relevant in-store and online, and all of that is part of an activity system that we believe will help us restore the market share growth that you rightly cite as necessary going forward."

So I guess, why aren't you expecting more of a sales recovery and market share payback? And then separately, are you comfortable that the level of spending as we leave fiscal 2017 is the right level of spending behind the business longer term? Should we assume we get back to more of that normal EPS growth algorithm post 2017?"

First, we are very committed to get back to a little above the market growth, and we recognized 2% is not market growth. Having said that, and Jon highlighted them in the formal remarks, we still got quite a few choices to annualize. We made the choice, and I think it's very evident in AMJ that we're going to get back to investing at the business at the level we need to, we also demonstrated to be in the second half of the year that we're committed to 4 quarters of brand support. The fourth quarter, we increased meaningfully our media investment versus previous share, and we're going to continue that in fiscal '17. Having said that, we will not stop making key choices where we have businesses that are structurally not profitable. But we think, on balance, the majority of that choices have been made and we'll annualize it through this year. So we actually feel very good that the businesses that we have. Especially post the close of Coty, we're very well positioned to grow sequentially. So I expect the first half to continue to make progress. Second half will be better. And much like we said at CAGNY, we're going to see just continued building of our business strength behind a very clear choice in investing in brand-building, and that biased toward Point of Market Entry [ph] and bringing new consumers on and investing in innovation, both in current brands but also in our P&G ventures, to ensure we're planting the seeds for the mid- and long-term future.

But as Jon laid out, even after Duracell transaction with Coty coming to a close here in a couple of months, there's still a lot of change afoot, still a lot of cost-cutting underway. So as you step back and think of what you've observed over the last 3 quarters or so as CEO, what's your confidence at this point that the people of P&G, the culture or the organization, they can truly take on both challenges at once? In other words, is the productivity culture truly ingrained enough that you can layer on or reemphasize top line focus without risk that you end up kind of breaking the back of the organization, so to speak? And then if I could, just related bolt-on question or 2 for Jon. First is, you may have said this, [indiscernible] reaccelerate and reinvest, can you maintain that 100% or so free cash flow productivity? And second, should we expect a volume-centric organic growth algorithm for '17 similar to what we saw in Q4? Or is there a reason for that to reverse as you move through the year?"

All the transformation variables, the one I'm most confident in is the P&G people are up for the challenge. I think we demonstrated this year which is clearly the peak in terms of the Duracell transaction, the enormous complexity of the Coty transaction, folks have risen to the occasion to be able to stand up those companies, still sequentially improving the operating companies, and while doing some of the heavy-lifting in both the North America and European supply chain work. So it's a very good point. And I think it sounds you underestimate the amount of additional work beyond operating the businesses, but I think the heaviest load is -- was this last fiscal year and for the next quarter. So the organization's demonstrated the resiliency. In our P&G survey, the confidence that people have that the choices are right and the confidence they have and pride they have in P&G is at an all-time high. So we're going to build off that, and I have a lot of confidence in P&G people. The second one on is productivity ingrained? My hope now is, after 5 years of making the kind of improvement we have that we've demonstrated externally, and I believe internally, built the confidence that this is critical and a key enabler for getting back to kind of balanced top and bottom line results we need. We've certainly emphasized that. But as we've added some additional focus on bringing more users on board, I think it's been very empowering to our people. They see then the outcome of all the productivity work, leading into investments in brand-building innovation, and that gives them confidence that the future of the company is going to be strong."

My one worry, though, is that more recently, I feel like some of innovation news is getting a little bit heavy on the strive for volume. So example would be on the odor release product line. Why isn't driving incremental wash loads enough versus it needing to be 3 products to do the job of remove the odors? Same thing on the Tide PODS, right? The advertising with 2 pods being chopped in the wash, which category wasn't the dosing recommendation when the product launched. So if you didn't talk a little bit, I apologize for micro, but I think it's important on innovation-driving category growth and then when you need -- your sort of flip the switch to push for volume in a way that doesn't feel quite as innovation-driven."

One, fabric care is a good example of what happens when we get all the elements working together, and you've seen both the category growth and the share growth associated with it. On the specific comments, ow we go where the consumer goes and expresses interest and/or frustration. In the athleisure area in an area [indiscernible] expressed frustration, and so we're trying to address a very specific need some consumers have. And to-date, that's tested very, very well. And we're actually quite excited about it, bringing some additional users in, and it may lead to increased consumption for existing users. But both will be important. And I think it will grow the category a little bit as well. The idea is very much to understand the needs consumers have and ensure we've got a product offering that meets them. And to the extent there's an unmet need, we will continue to innovate. The -- each of the add-on products that we've had the last year, whether it's in the fabric enhancer or the base Fabric Care business, I think has demonstrated the ability to grow the category and grow the share. So to-date, at least I have not seen an indication that it is causing unneeded proliferation. In fact, if I step back and look across the company, we have meaningfully less SKUs today than we had a year ago. Many categories are down 10% to 20% in the number of SKUs they've offered, but what are doing is trying to bring more meaningful consumer benefits to areas that are underserved or needs are unmet. And then the last comment I make on the 2 pods instruction, if you look at consumer habits today, they have higher-capacity washing machines. And some consumers are putting meaningfully more into each load. And what we're trying to do is provide consumers the understanding of what is the best amount of detergent or a number of pods to use to get ideal performance. And in the U.S. at least, many consumers were underdosing, and this will allow consumers to get a much better outcome. And we've give them at least the guidance so that they do get the best outcome, and then we asked them certainly to choose what's right for them."

I'll give a couple of comments overall, but then it's very category-specific. On restarting top line growth, I will first emphasize we're getting back to making consumers aware of the product and communicating the benefit. So making sure we were consistently having the reach and frequency needed with the right message was key. And we've also, I think, adjusted our communication, both to TV, digital, in any way that's appropriate to reach target consumers, and I believe that's going to make a big difference. A second area that is helping, and you're going to see it continue and probably increase next year, is Point of Market Entry- and Point of Market Change-focused spending. We understand, and we look back over several years, that have gone down on many categories, and it was showing up in lower shares with entry point consumers. And that doesn't bode well for the future, and that's played out with some of the share losses that you and others have highlighted. The right way to build it back is to bring consumers into [ph] the best most effective way is to bring consumers into your category when they first have need for the category. So we have prioritized Point of Market Entry and Point of Market Change [ph] , and that will continue to increase. We gave example on laundry. It's also happening in many other categories. The second, which I think is critically important that will play out consistently over time, more even in the mid to long term, is the increased investment in innovation and showing that we have products that have meaningful consumer, we call it consumer wow. We have adjusted our evaluation of innovation to not just have technically superior products but to have products and brands that have a meaningful difference that consumers see and appreciate. This higher bar is pushing us to go back on some of the innovations coming in the sheer amount of the product but also the packets, and the experience is at a higher level so the consumer can play back it's meaningfully different. An example of a test that we're using frequently is deprivation: gives the consumer product, and then take it away, and get their reaction. And if you get a really significant reaction, you probably have a product that really means something to consumer. So I would say the areas that I would -- what we did focus on, and I believe to be very meaningful next year, would be Point of Market Entry, continued consistent building of appropriate reach and frequency, and then consumer meaningful and appreciated innovation that has an impact on market growth, which is the last point I want to make, is our innovation at times has been very focused at trying to be a little bit better than our best competition. We've added the expectation for each of our categories that their role is to grow the category size that has meaningful impact both on the support we get from customers but also the financial attractiveness of each of the innovations and, therefore, categories."

Stepping back kind of at a macro level on the kind of 4 pillars of transformation, productivity, portfolio, top line acceleration, organization and culture, I think the benefit from those efforts is primarily ahead of us. So the portfolio, we don't complete until October, and we still have a bunch of transition work to do to execute that big transaction, we have not yet been able to operate as a company in a 10-category-focused fashion. So all of that benefit, I think, is ahead. Our productivity, we have benefited from, and we will continue to benefit from. The acceleration, the investments really have just started in the last 6 months. And things like Point of Market Entry, Point of Market Change, investments will increase as they go through next year. And frankly, they take some time to pay out themselves, but the payout is significant. And I think the other change that is sometimes underestimated in terms of its importance are the organization and cultural changes that David talked about. I think those will be significant, and frankly, we're just putting them in place. So the new incentive system goes into place in July. We moved, as David said, the dedicated sales resources in North America. We're just starting that move in some of the other big markets. So I think there's a lot of benefit ahead. Last comment as it relates to priority. These are all part of an ecosystem that's designed to work together to produce balanced top line, bottom line and cash flow growth. And I'd really like them because I think they're mutually reinforcing, as David said in his remarks. We get this top line growing. That will generate cost savings and itself [ph] through top line leverage, which will then give us the ability to invest. We'll have motivated organization that's properly and strongly incented to deliver both. I think, without getting ahead of ourselves here, again a lot of the benefit still comes in the future."

First, let me just take the cut at the China and then Jon can comment a little bit on the $18 billion from gross to net, and I'm happy to comment on conversations of that with most of the leading customers. First on China. We see it sequentially improving. We are not done yet with getting our portfolio right in China. That will take time. There are several categories that we are still losing share, and we're not positioned with the appropriate portfolio in the premium, super premium segments. We started with the Oral-B effort last year. We've got some -- and we have innovation also in Fabric Care. But each of the categories has stepped up both the innovation pace but also making sure they have on-the-ground resources in China to ensure the product and the package and the proposition have been fine-tuned to really win the Chinese consumers. And that will take time. So I see that one building over time. The other comment I make on China based on a lot that I've heard [indiscernible] is this been a lot said about the attractiveness of China. Through our lens, it continues to be extremely attractive. Jon mentioned some of the reasons why, but it also say the published data often shows a very rapid slowdown. And that is true in the off-line portion of the business. We see it going very low single digits, and some categories are now flat in China. Having said that, the online portion is accelerated and is certainly the double digit, but you many categories 1.30, 1.40, 1.50, and what is encouraging to me is our on online business is starting to accelerate. We're growing share in the past 6 months. And we've at least now got a couple of our categories where our online share is higher than our off-line share, which bodes well for the future, given the choice Chinese consumers are making. So it will continue to get better over time. Over the next 12 to 18 months, we'll see more and more innovation hitting that has been specifically designed for China versus adapted to be used in China, and I think that will increase our hit rate and our growth rate."

That's not the design intent here. But what we do want to do is ensure that dollars, both in the form of trade spending but also in the form of marketing, in ways that maximize category growth, which benefits both ourselves and our retail partners. Now there are kind of 3 opportunities within that. One is, just like with our advertising budgets, including the agency and production cost, there are sources of inefficiency that we can access without impacting the market in any way or our retail partners in a significant way, and we ought to go after those. Two, ensuring that we're spending the money in a way that's most productive in terms of driving market basket both, again, for ourselves and our retail customers. And we have big opportunities there to sharpen the focus of where the money gets spent and, again, to the benefit of both our retail partners and ourselves. And the third one is a little bit trickier, but we have some good examples of this already, and what we'll be testing others, is looking across the buckets of spend beyond trade spending, there are cases where if we would reduce trade spending, shift that money to advertising or sampling, we may be able to increase the rate of growth in a category, again, in a way that's beneficial to both our retail partners and ourselves. We did some of that, for example, on Olay in North America this year and got fairly broad support for that. So you're absolutely right. We're not looking at, I wouldn't use the word cut in the space, but there are opportunities to shape the spend in a way that both increases efficiency and increases effectiveness for both us and our retail partners."

The digital and social space, to me, is a powerful opportunity for any consumer marketing company, and it's left all of us to figure out how to best leverage the capability that has been developed, and frankly, continues to emerge rapidly. P&G has shifted significantly its resources and our investments to ensure that we are showing up with communication that wins mobile back. And that's a big shift for us, and that's critically important because whether it's e-commerce or whether it's consumption of media, in many markets, it's now primarily through the mobile phone. And more and more you're seeing P&G winning with the marketing programs that are adaptive for digital and social. And a good example of one -- of a social program that has done extraordinarily well is the Always Like A Girl where we've leveraged that communication in that very strong social platform but used and leveraged the social media capability to drive the brand. I do understand and certainly there's very real cost to enter a category has changed dramatically today versus 5 and 10 years ago. And part of what we are doing, by category, then is looking to see how do we leverage the capability that exist. I expect we'll continue to see competitors that can pop up. But generally, to sustain and grow a business, you have to have a product and a product experience that meets the consumers' need. There are many, many examples of Internet-based competitors that have been popping up both here and China. Tremendous number of those, they get trial. We purchase those another story, and we purchase in a profitable business model is the highest bar, and that's the one that we're working against. It just have a substantive product that meets the consumers' need. They have communication programs that meet consumers when and where they're receptive to the message and understand they want less to be sold and more to be part of their life, and we're adjusting our marketing and communication programs to do just that. And I think that's the right way by category to win."

And I don't think that relative preference in the drivers for business growth changes going forward. But we've had 2 dynamics that we've been dealing within the last year that kind of inform next year's view. One is we've been pricing significantly to recover foreign exchange impacts, which has resulted in volume being less of a component of the top line, in fact, in many cases, a negative component. We're hopeful that we're going to be operating in a more stable currency environment. So that volume negative goes away. Also, as you have and others have rightly pointed out on several occasions, we've had category-country combinations where our pricing got too high. In many cases, that's what we were trying to recover from devaluation and competitors didn't follow. In other cases, Dave talked about [indiscernible] in his prepared, a major competitor took pricing down in that segment, and we'll be adjusting prices to deal with those realities, which makes price, in those instances, less of the top line component and volume more of it.

If you go back a year ago, [indiscernible] when it came in that would have a real detrimental impact on our business. And the view we took then is the same we take now, is that there will be dynamics in the marketplace that could change, and we'll see how the category sorts itself out. But the way we were able to win is the same strategy going into fiscal '17. Fabric Care focused on consumers and shoppers. They brought aggressive innovation to make sure that their meeting the shoppers' needs better than anybody else, premium performing products. And they did a great job communicating in sampling their products. And you see, this fiscal year built into our guidance is increased level sampling and with a broader sampling program as well as the marketing program that is in place. And I just mentioned some additional innovation coming on the product front, I think we are actually well positioned, and the objective going in independent of what happens in terms of industry consolidation is that we win with consumers and shoppers. And we'll see how it plays out on the other point."

Because it seems in diapers, the Japanese are discounting their products and there's a big shift in where things are bought. In Olay, we just haven't heard a lot recently. And in Hair, I think you still got issues with your biggest brand there. So that would be helpful."

Some of them have not been announced, so I won't get into any specifics. Diapers, we know we got behind on diapers. It shows up and it's one of the most acute categories in terms of share loss. The category is very -- understand -- the category is we focus on winning in China. We -- 6, 9 months ago, made a choice that we're going to win in China and then allocated the resources and the capital to ensure that we had the appropriate product innovation coming. It's not yet publicly announced when. Some of these major innovations are coming. But on both diapers and pants, we're very committed to it. An encouraging sign to me about the future in China is to look at what we've been able to do recently in Japan, where in Japan, you've seen has now take share leadership. And frankly, we're losing to primarily Japanese competitors have done extremely well inChina, as well as Casey. And innovation that we have coming over the next fiscal year and beyond, we think will position us well. On Olay, our first step was to get our portfolio cleaned up. That's been done. If you step back and look at the 4 core collections on Olay, we're starting to see a meaningful difference, which is to me a very positive sign, and that's Total FX, Regenerist, our whitening segment and Pro-X, on those, we see back half doing better than second half. We still have to anniversary some of the discontinued SKUs. And the second key innovation on Olay will be getting our counters right. Our counters, and having been to China many times and previously lived in Greater China, our counters have gotten quite tired and have not been upgraded recently. So we've shut down the counters that earn in stores that are unproductive. And we've made meaningful investments in upgrading the counters in the stores that we think have a basis -- places we have  a basis to compete. So counter-innovation is coming. It's already happening. It is funded, and showing up now. And the innovations will be coming on, primarily, the 4 core collections and then some new innovations that we'll be doing. And then the last category is, Hair is our largest category in China. We have meaningful innovations coming on both the conditioner, that are superior, and I mentioned earlier. It's already been launched in the U.S. and launched in China. It is superior-perform. We had Hair innovation coming on many of our brands. Pantene and Head & Shoulders, historically have been stronger. [indiscernible] is actually growing share, and we've got innovation coming on in Rejoice, which has been the weakest of our brands in China. So on each one of the brands, those focus, we've also made the choice funded and staffed on the ground resources to ensure we keep up with the pace of innovation required in the Beauty segment, which to me is an important choice about winning in the future in China. Thank you."

I am joined this morning by our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, David Taylor; and by our Vice President of Investor Relations, John Chevalier. I plan to take you through the quarter and provide an update on productivity an",2365,"Good morning. I am joined this morning by our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, David Taylor; and by our Vice President of Investor Relations, John Chevalier. 
I plan to take you through the quarter and provide an update on productivity and our portfolio projects. David will discuss our efforts to accelerate top line growth, we'll briefly review progress in each of our 10 business categories and we'll discuss our plans to further strengthen our organization and culture, all to reliably drive balanced top and bottom line growth. 
We're making progress in moving P&G's results to a balanced top line, bottom line and cash flow growth. We increased investments in innovation, advertising and sales coverage to enhance our long-term prospects for faster, sustainable top line growth, and stabilized top line growth rates in several key markets. We have delivered another strong year of productivity improvement and cost savings to help fund this. 
Cash flow continues to be strong with fiscal year adjusted free cash flow productivity of 115%. Organic sales for the quarter were up 2%. This includes about a 1 point drag from the combination of the cleanup work we're doing within the ongoing portfolio and the impact of reduced finished product sales to our Venezuelan subsidiaries. As we get through the cleanup work and annualize the Venezuelan headwinds, we'll be closer to 3% growth. 
Importantly, the sales growth was volume driven, with organic volume growing 2%. Organic volume was ahead of year-ago in every segment, ranging from plus 1% to plus 5%. Organic sales grew in every segment, ranging from plus 1% to plus 8%. Organic sales were up 1.5 points in developed markets and 3.5 points in developing markets. In North America, organic sales grew 2%, roughly in line with underlying market growth, our second consecutive quarter at this level. Organic volume in North America grew 3% for the second consecutive quarter, slightly ahead of underlying market growth. In China, organic sales were in line versus the prior year, an improvement over last quarter and another step toward returning to market-level growth or better. All-in sales for the company were down 3%, including the 3 point headwind from foreign exchange and a 2 point drag from the combination of Venezuela deconsolidation and minor brand divestitures. 
Core gross margin increased 160 basis points versus the prior year. On a constant-currency basis, core gross margin was up 240 basis points, including 280 basis points of productivity improvements. Core operating margin was down 150 basis points for the quarter due to foreign exchange headwinds and a significant increase in advertising support versus the prior year. On a constant-currency basis, core operating margin was down 30 basis points. Productivity improvements contributed 360 basis points of operating margin benefit in the fourth quarter. 
Core earnings per share were $0.79, slightly above the high end of our implied guidance range. This is a reduction of 15% versus the prior year, due mainly to foreign exchange, lower nonoperating income and a higher tax rate. Foreign exchange was a $0.07 per share or $200 million after-tax headwind on fourth quarter earnings. Nonoperating income was $0.02 per share headwind, as the base period quarter included higher gains from minor brand divestitures. The core effective tax rate was a $0.06 per share impact on core earnings per share for the quarter at 23.8%, up 540 basis points versus last year. This is a little better than we initially projected, but still a substantial increase compared to last year. These 3 impacts, foreign exchange, nonoperating income and tax, were a combined core earnings per share growth headwind of $0.15 per share this quarter. Adjusting for these impacts, fourth quarter core EPS was up modestly versus the prior year. On an all-in GAAP basis, earnings per share were $0.69 for the quarter, up 283% versus the prior year quarter that included a significant onetime impact from the deconsolidation of Venezuelan results. 
We generated $2.8 billion of free cash flow with 145% adjusted free cash flow productivity. Over the course of the fiscal year, we generated $12.1 billion in free cash flow, yielding adjusted free cash flow productivity of 115%. 
We were able to reduce outstanding shares at a value of over $8 billion through a combination of share repurchase and shares that were exchanged in the Duracell transaction. We paid dividends of more than $7.4 billion. In total, nearly $16 billion in dividend payments, share exchanges and share repurchase. 
Now looking forward, we continue to focus on large opportunities that should be within our control: executing what is the largest transformation in our company's history; reaccelerating top line growth with strengthened category business models, innovation plans, and where appropriate, improved value equations; step change in cost and cash productivity; simplifying and strengthening our product portfolio; and strengthening our organization and culture, all to win more consistently. This transformation is aimed at delivering balanced top and bottom line growth and leadership value creation. 
Top line growth is our biggest improvement need and is enabled by both our productivity efforts and the portfolio strengthening that are underway. I'll talk briefly about these enabling efforts and then turn it over to David for a discussion on top line acceleration itself. 
We continue to dramatically improve cost and cash productivity, with significant upside still ahead. We have accelerated and exceeded each of our productivity objectives and have now raised them. Our original 5-year cost-of-goods savings target was $6 billion. We delivered $7.2 billion, more than $1 billion over our initial target. We delivered cost-of-goods savings which were at or above target each of the last 5 fiscal years. We've reduced manufacturing enrollment by 22% over the last 4 years. This includes new staffing necessary to support capacity additions. On a same-site basis, manufacturing enrollment was down about 27% through June 2016 with additional progress planned in fiscal 2017. These figures exclude divestiture impacts. 
In February of 2012, we announced that we would reduce nonmanufacturing or overhead enrollment by 10% over 5 years. As of July 1, we've reduced roles by nearly 25%, 2.5x the original target. Including divestitures, we'll reduce nonmanufacturing or overhead roles by about 35% by the end of fiscal '17. 
We're reducing nonworking marketing expenditures, costs that don't impact reach, frequency or continuity of our advertising and trial-generation programs. We were spending $2 billion per year on agency fees. 2 years ago, we reduced the roughly 6,000 agencies we work with by nearly 40% and cut agency and production spending by about $370 million. In fiscal 2016, we delivered an additional $250 million of agency-related savings, reinvesting these savings in advertising and sampling of consumer-preferred products, over $600 million of savings in 2 years. 
We're driving productivity improvement up and down the income statement and across the balance sheet. Inventory days are down. Payables days are up. Net of reinvestments in innovation, sales coverage, media and sampling, productivity has enabled us to deliver constant-currency gross and operating profit margin improvement and high single to double-digit constant-currency core earnings per share growth in each of the last 4 fiscal years. We improved gross and operating margins by triple-digit indices, both including and excluding currency, in fiscal 2016. 
We said over 4 years ago that we needed to make cost and cash productivity part of our culture, as integral to our culture as innovation. We've made significant progress, and we have significant opportunity. Our strong track record and our line of sight to additional opportunity inform our intent to save as much as another $10 billion in cost over the next 5 years. The majority of these savings will again come from cost of goods sold, an area where we have consistently met or exceeded our targets. 
Supply chain transformation is in its early stages. First in North America, next in Europe, then in Latin America and India, the Middle East and Africa. We're in investment mode now with savings to ramp up in 2, 3 and 4 years. 
Our new U.S. mixing centers are up and running, putting roughly 80% of volume within 24 hours of store shelves. On-time deliveries and frequency of deliveries have increased. We've already seen an improvement in customer service levels, resulting in improved on-shelf ability -- excuse me, availability in the U.S. by more than 1 point to roughly 96%. 
We're constructing multi-category manufacturing sites in geographically strategic locations to replace smaller, single-category sites in less cost-effective locations. We're well underway with the construction of a new site in West Virginia, that's scheduled to start production in calendar 2017. We've announced moves of production for some laundry detergent, fabric enhancer, perfume, body wash and haircare products, and we've announced our complete shutdown of 3 sites. In Europe, we've announced plans to consolidate production of laundry powders, deodorants and hard surface cleaners to fewer plants across our European manufacturing network. We're now beginning the consolidation work in Latin America. 
As we make these moves, we're upgrading and standardizing manufacturing platforms to lower cost and to facilitate faster innovation. We're employing smart automation and digitization to improve manufacturing productivity, raw material and finished product logistics and demand planning. We have additional opportunity to optimize working capital and further increase the efficiency of our capital spend. 
After 2 strong years of savings, we'll enter next year still spending about $1.4 billion on agency-related costs, still more room to improve. And as we fully operationalize the new focused 10-category company, there will be additional opportunities to increase organization efficiency, agility and speed of decision-making, enabled in many cases by digitization and automation. 
Finally, we're working to improve the effectiveness of our promotional spending. We currently spend about $18 billion in deductions between gross and net sales. We see clear opportunities to improve the effectiveness of the spend for us and our retail partners to build the value of our categories and the share of P&G brands. So again, we're targeting up to $10 billion of additional savings over the next 5 years. We expect to reinvest a significant amount of the savings in R&D and product and packaging improvements, sales coverage and in brand awareness and trial-building programs to deliver balanced top and bottom line growth. 
Moving to portfolio. Over the last 18 months, we've divested, discontinued or consolidated 61 brands, including the completion of the Duracell transaction at the end of February. We have 44 more brands in the exit process, including 41 brands in the deal with Coty. We're currently winding down transition support for Duracell. We have completed the systems work in standing up the Beauty business for the transaction with Coty. We've received antitrust clearance in all markets. We currently remain on track to close the deal with Coty in October 2016. By the end of the fiscal year, we will have exited 105 brands and all of the complexity they create. These brands represent only about 6% of base period profit. 
Going forward, our portfolio will be anchored on 10 category-based business units and 65 brands. These are categories where P&G has leading market positions and where product technologies deliver performance differences that matter to consumers. These 10 businesses have historically grown faster with higher margins than the balance of the company. We're moving away from businesses that are more trend driven, where fashion, fragrance and flavor drive consumer purchase decisions. We're focusing our businesses where products and performance drive purchase decisions, where there are clear consumer jobs to be done and clear objective measures of performance. These are products that consumers purchase and use on a daily basis, and they're in structurally attractive categories. 
Within these core businesses, we're focusing our offerings, making smart choices for short-, mid- and long-term value creation, foregoing bad businesses even when these choices create near-term top line pressure. In our Mexico Family Care business, we discontinued low-tier, unprofitable and commoditizing products and are focusing instead on very profitable, high-tier differentiated products, moving from double-digit negative margins to double-digit positive margins. While we first talked about this a year ago, it took several quarters to sell out remaining inventories of the discontinued products. As a result, the top line drag doesn't fully annualize until the end of this calendar year. 
In India, we've made a similar choice to de-prioritize several unprofitable lines of business, which negatively impact short-term top line growth rates, but will lead longer term to a much more profitable business that will grow strongly. The strategic part of our India business is growing at a high single-digit pace. Sales in the portion of the business we're fixing or exiting, about 15% of the portfolio, have been down more than 35%. The top line pain is worth it. We're making significant progress in improving local profit margins, up 750 basis points over the last 2 years. We've gone from losing significant money in India to triple-digit profits in just 2 years. 
We're taking a similar approach in our Fabric Care product portfolio, discontinuing product forms, additives, bars, bleaches and tablets and value-tier and powder detergents that have been a drag on profitability and value creation. These choices are causing a top line drag in the global fabric care business, but improve the profitability and the long-term attractiveness of the business. 
The SKUs we've eliminated to simplify our Olay lineup cause an incremental drag on sales growth. As we annualize this headwind next year and as we focus our innovation and marketing support on the core boutiques and SKUs in the portfolio, we'll have set the stage for faster, more profitable growth. Combined, these choices have been causing about 1 point drag on organic sales growth. We expect this headwind to continue for the balance of the calendar year and then dissipate in the second half of next year as we begin annualizing these effects. 
So that's productivity and portfolio, both on or ahead of track, with, and this is important, a significant amount of benefits still ahead of us. 
I'll now hand over it over to David to update you on the top line, provide a brief status review across the 10 product categories and talk about important steps we've undertaken to strengthen our organization and culture to more consistently create value."

Our objective is very clear: balanced top and bottom line growth that delivers total shareholder returns that place P&G consistently in the top third of our peer group. A critically important element of our transformation is reacceleration of our top line growth to reach and sustain organic sales growth at or slightly ahead of underlying growth of the markets where we compete. Productivity improvement and cost savings are a necessity in this effort, providing fuel for innovation, advertising, sales coverage and trial and sampling to grow users and usage. 
Top and bottom line growth are not separate endeavors. They reinforce and fuel each other. Now everything in this model starts with delighting consumers and shoppers. Winning at the zero, first and second moments of truth, when consumers research our categories and brands, purchase them in the store or online and use them in homes. Winning these critical moments requires consumer and shopper insights that lead to improved product innovations, consumer communication and retail programs that lead to competitive advantages for P&G brands and products. 
Now we're making progress in accelerating organic sales growth, but we're not yet where we need to be. There's more work to be done. As Jon just shared, organic sales grew in all 5 reporting segments and were in line or higher in 9 of 10 product categories in that April-June quarter. In most of these businesses, the back half of the year was stronger than the first half. Organic sales for the company was essentially flat in the first half of the year and were up 1.5% in the second half. Obvious acceleration, but not where we want to be. 
Let me spend a minute on each of the 10 categories. We're growing our Fabric Care business with consumer-preferred brands and product offerings like our premium performance and premium-priced unit-dose detergents and our market-leading and importantly expanding scent bead fabric enhancers. We're exiting slower-growing, lower-priced, more commoditized product forms where it's more difficult to distinguish our products and create value. 
Fabric Care results in the U.S. demonstrate what is possible when we deliver superior value from best-in-class performance at a modest price premium. The U.S. laundry detergent market is continuing to grow behind our efforts, with the category up 4 points last year. The same is true for fabric enhancers. Spurred by the rapid growth of scent beads, the U.S. fabric enhancers category is growing, up 7 points on a value basis last year, with scent beads form growing in the mid-20s. Our share is growing. P&G's laundry detergent and fabric enhancer value shares were up in fiscal 2016. 
And we will continue to be the innovation leader in Fabric Care. In North America, we're introducing a new regimen on Tide and Downy that addresses the odor problems common to the growing athletic wear segment. 70% of consumers wear athletic gear multiple times each week. The Odor Defense Collection, anchored by innovation on Tide PODS, brings a proprietary formula of enzymes and surfactants that break down and remove stubborn soils and residues -- residue for a great clean and fresh scent. Now paired with the added cleaning power of Tide Odor Defense Rescue laundry booster and Downy Fresh Protect Odor Defense beads, this regimen promises to eliminate odors from the fast-growing market of athleisure clothes people are wearing far beyond the gym. 
We opened a learning market of Tide Pure Clean liquid detergent in the U.S. Naturals is a large and growing segment in several categories, but Naturals are only about 3% of the laundry category currently. Unlocking growth in Naturals is about solving the tension between green and clean. People want performance and sustainability. Pure Clean provides the cleaning power of Tide with 65% bio-based ingredients and is produced with 100% renewable wind power electricity in a facility operating with 0 manufacturing waste to landfill. Now it's very early to read results, but after just 5 weeks on shelf, with no TV advertising, Pure Clean is approaching a 1 share of detergents within the learning market stores. We're increasing sampling in new washing machines, a key point of category entry and change for consumers. In fiscal 2015, we distributed 5 million samples in washing machines globally. Last fiscal year, we increased that to 17 million. In fiscal 2017, we'll distribute 30 million samples of our best-performing products. 
Turning to Home Care. Our performance in this category has been very strong. Cascade grew sales high single digits last year behind the continued success of Cascade Platinum, our best-performing and most premium-priced auto dish detergent. In North America, we increased sampling on Cascade Premium by 20% last year. The Dawn brand delivered its ninth consecutive year of organic sales growth in the U.S. Dish results have also been strong in Japan and Europe on hand washing liquids and auto detergent products. Febreze had a challenging year, down low singles, but we have innovations coming next fiscal. 
In Hair Care, we launched our new conditioner innovation on Pantene in the U.S. early this calendar year. The new conditioner technology is a consumer blind-test winner versus our best competition in North America, China and Japan. Pantene and Head & Shoulders each delivered solid organic sales growth in the U.S. for the second consecutive year. Herbal Essences was the main drag on the Hair Care growth, down mid-teens last fiscal year. Now we have plans in the works for product, package and consumer communication improvements in fiscal 2017. 
In the Skin and Personal Care category, SK-II had another very strong year with organic sales up mid -- low teens. As Jon mentioned, Olay completed a significant streamlining of SKUs in North America last year. In China, Olay's second-biggest market, we're executing a similar streamlining of sales counters, retaining the top-selling and most profitable counters to focus resources where it matters most, on the doors that create the most value. On Old Spice, sales were up versus the prior year and accelerated in the second half behind the Hardest Working Collection innovation bundle that included performance and scent upgrades to Old Spice detergents and body wash -- or rather deodorants and body washes in the U.S. 
In Grooming, Gillette delivered steady growth in international markets last fiscal, holding or growing value share in each region outside the U.S. behind strong innovation, advertising and sampling programs. The growth in international markets was offset by soft results in the U.S. To improve our growth and the growth of the market, we are reinvesting in innovation, new user trial and improved consumer value. We completed the global expansion of our very successful Gillette Fusion FlexBall innovation into Asia in 2016. We expanded our performance advantage at the top end of the market. Our most recent cartridge innovation, Gillette Fusion ProShield, launched in January. We're supporting a broader range of our product ladder from our best product, Fusion FlexBall ProShield, to MACH3 systems, to premium-priced and superior performance disposables with stronger consumer value communication. We're facing more aggressive competition at lower price points, and we will respond to ensure our brands remain a superior consumer value. We're driving trial at point of market entry. We put Fusion ProGlide FlexBall razors in the hands of nearly 80% of young men, over 2 million samples last year in the U.S. with our 18th birthday sampling program. We're now sampling the FlexBall razor handle and ProShield cartridge, our very best combination of shaving technologies. 
Fiscal 2016 was a difficult year in Personal Health Care due to the very weak cough/cold season in the U.S. The category was also compared against a base period that contained the launch of many new items in the Metamucil and Vicks brands. Even with these headwinds, the category delivered positive organic sales growth for the year. Organic sales in Oral Care were up low single digits in fiscal 2016 with high single-digit after-tax profit growth behind strong productivity improvements. Sales of our top-performing items grew fast this last fiscal with premium Oral-B power toothbrushes and premium HD toothpaste, each up mid-teens. Organic sales in the 42 Oral-B toothpaste expansion markets were up double digits last fiscal year. The solid growth in developed markets was partially offset by lower sales in several developing markets, where we took pricing to offset foreign exchange impacts. 
In U.S. Baby Care, strong innovation, consumer communication, trial programs and a robust online presence have led to strong growth for Pampers. Pampers value share of U.S. diapers was up 1 point last fiscal. Pampers latest Swaddlers and Cruisers innovation, Extra Absorb Channels, is driving share growth in the premium-tier diaper category with Swaddlers and Cruisers share up more than 1 point last fiscal year. 
We strengthened investments in brand awareness and trial at the point of category entry. Now 70% of new moms in the U.S. will receive samples of our best products through our prenatal and hospital programs. 
Fiscal 2015 marked the seventh consecutive year of sales and value share growth of the Luvs brand in the U.S., however, results were down in fiscal 2016 following a significant price reduction taken by our primary competitor. Now we've taken steps to improve the awareness, trial and consumer value of Luvs. We're increasing equity-building advertising, strengthening in-store programs, and we're currently launching product and packaging improvements. In Japan, Pampers value share grew more than 2 points last year. Pampers is now the value share leader in Japan diapers and also the share leader in the pants segment. Baby Care results have been softer in other markets. To address this, we strengthened our value proposition in several markets and accelerated premium innovation on both taped and pull-on diapers to restore our competitiveness at the top end of the market. We're strengthening our selling resources and programs for baby center stores and e-commerce, and we're increasing investments in point-of-market-entry programs to drive higher awareness and trial of Pampers among new moms. 
Fem care organic sales were up low single digits for the fiscal year with improved momentum in the second of half, including a strong fourth quarter with mid-single digit organic volume and sales growth. Expansion and leverage of innovations such as Always Infinity and Always Discreet have been the key drivers of improved top line growth. We've also made consumer value interventions in markets like Russia to restore pricing to competitive levels, which helped in the second half. 
In Family Care, the top-tier segments of the Bounty and Charmin brands delivered solid organic sales growth last fiscal. Now as Jon discussed, we made the choice to discontinue low-tier products in Mexico, which drove overall category sales down versus the prior year. Global bottom line results were strong with after-tax profits up high single digits in fiscal 2016. We have product and packaging innovations coming this year on the Bounty Basic and Charmin Basic brands to improve their positioning with consumers in the U.S. 
Now look briefly at our top 2 markets. First, the U.S. Organic sales and shipment volume was up about 0.5 point in the first half of the fiscal year. We accelerated this growth in the back half of the year to plus 2% and 2.5% organic sales and shipments, respectively. The second half growth rates are roughly in line with underlying growth of our categories. We plan to build on this momentum. 
China organic sales were down 5 points last fiscal, but improved sequentially in the third and fourth quarters. The fourth quarter was in line with prior year. Progress, but nothing worth celebrating yet. In fiscal 2017, we'll relaunch product lines in several categories and will implement a new go-to-market program across retailers and distributors in China. These improvements will take some time to fully take hold. Recovery will not be a straight line, but in aggregate, fiscal year results should improve. 
As we work to accelerate top line growth, enabled by productivity and portfolio choices, we are transforming our organization and culture. We're making many changes that by themselves may seem small and obvious, but together, they are significant and important. 
As an example, we've made several important changes in how we go to market. We've talked previously about eliminating overlapping resources and duplicative structures and responsibilities of marketing and sales professionals in the global business units and the market development organizations, clarifying responsibilities and strengthening accountability. Reflecting this, a while back, we changed the name of our market development organizations to selling and market operations, a small but very important change. We're changing our talent development and assignment planning to drive more mastery and depth. The objective is simple: Improve business results by getting and keeping the right people in the right places to develop and apply deep category mastery to win. 
Consistent with this, we've dedicated sales resources to categories or sectors. In our larger markets, sales resources have greater accountability back to the categories they serve, which is also a change. We're running incentives at a lower and more specific level of granularity to better match these responsibilities and to increase accountability. Now P&G is fortunate to consistently source and develop strong talent, and we intend to maintain our develop-from-within approach. But there are times when the best talent for a role may not be inside our organization. We are now implementing and supplementing key businesses with outside hiring more often, when we need to field the best team possible. As an example, we've dedicated and added resources to improve category mastery in our North American Personal Health Care sales force. 2 years ago, the average tenure of salespeople within the category was less than 12 months. About half of the salespeople were dedicated only to Personal Health Care and 100% of the people were either new hires coming to P&G with no work experience or transfers from other P&G businesses. Over the last year or so, we've added resources to the consumer Health Care sales force. Almost half of those people had prior Health Care sales experience. Today, 100% of people selling the business are dedicated to Personal Health Care and the average experience level is now more than 5 years of Health Care sales experience inside or outside of P&G. Over the last 2 years, we've added 115 people to the U.S. retail sales force through external hiring, and more than half of them had prior sales experience. Over the last 2 years, we've increased category dedication of the U.S. sales force by 20%, with more than 90% of salespeople now focused on one category. We've doubled the number of experienced external hires last fiscal versus the prior year, bringing in experienced talent at 5 different levels of management, including the vice president level. Experienced hires comprised about 5% of all management hiring in fiscal 2016. 
Bottom line, we -- we're committed to getting, keeping and growing the right people in the right place to drive better business results. Again, each of these changes may seem small and rather obvious, but collectively, they're big and important changes for our organization and culture. Each area of transformation, top line acceleration, productivity, portfolio and strengthening our organizational culture, requires change. Let me say again what I've said at the CAGNY Conference in February. ""P&G is ready to adapt, evolve and change whatever is needed to win."" We're making good progress in each of these areas, but we know our success will ultimately be graded on the sales, profit, cash and value-creation results we deliver, not on the activities that get us there. We are committed to do everything we can and to change what must be changed to deliver these results. 
Now let me hand it back to Jon to discuss fiscal 2017 guidance, and then I'll be happy to take your questions."

To frame guidance, I think it's helpful to look briefly at the macro environment that confronts us as we start fiscal 2017. Category growth rates slowed throughout last fiscal year and are currently growing at about a 3% pace for our global footprint. As you know, GDP growth rate had slowed to the point that at least 10 countries have moved to negative interest rates, including Germany, Japan, Denmark, France, Italy, Spain and Switzerland. Political, economic and foreign exchange volatility each continue to have a large impact on the markets and on the currencies in which we operate. The recent Brexit decision is but one example of a political disruption impact that has knock-on effects on consumer confidence and resulting market growth. The recent coup attempt in Turkey is another example. We continue to face significant FX volatility such as the recent 40% devaluation of the Nigerian currency and 25% devaluation for open-market transactions in Egypt. Our ability to ensure supply and stay on shelf in many markets is dependent upon our ability to source in U.S. dollars. Currency exchange constraints in markets such as Egypt, Nigeria, Venezuela, and historically, Argentina, make operations in those countries very difficult to manage and sometimes result in production shutdowns. Net, we continue to face a relatively slow-growth volatile world, which is reflected in our fiscal 2017 guidance. We're currently expecting organic sales growth of around 2%. This includes between 0.5 point and 1 point of headwind from the cleanup work within the ongoing 10 product categories. It also includes the remaining 2 quarters of headwind from lost sales for our Venezuelan subsidiaries. As we annualize more of the cleanup work and as we make progress in markets like China, we should be getting back towards market-level growth rates by fiscal year's end. We expect fiscal 2017 all-in sales growth of about 1%, including a 1 point drag on growth from the net impact of foreign exchange and divestitures. 
Our bottom line guidance is core earnings-per-share growth of mid-single digits. This range reflects the volatility of the markets in which we compete and it reflects the investments we intend to make in the business to accelerate organic sales growth in a sustainable long-term market-constructive and value-accretive way. We'll work with our retail partners to build the value of our categories behind strong product innovation and more effective in-store and online merchandising of our leading brands. We'll reinvest savings to improve product formulations and packaging, sales coverage and media programs, product sampling and in-store demand creation. We'll also invest in consumer value equations, correcting value gaps and quickly responding to competitive challenges as they emerge throughout the year. 
This guidance includes the fiscal year average share count reduction of approximately 4%, the net outstanding share reductions from the full year impact of the Duracell deal, the Beauty transaction with Coty, discretionary share repurchase and stock option exercises. The actual impact on outstanding shares from the Beauty transaction won't be known until the deal is completed in October and will, of course, be dependent on the stock prices of both companies and the transaction discount. 
We're forecasting a reduction in nonoperating income in fiscal 2017 due to lower gains from minor brand divestitures. The core effective tax rate should be roughly in line with the fiscal 2016 level. All-in GAAP earnings per share should increase 45% to 55%, due primarily to the significant onetime gain from the Beauty transaction with Coty. Also included in the GAAP earnings-per-share range are $0.10 per share of noncore restructuring charges. 
We expect adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% or better, CapEx should be in the range of 5% to 5.5% of sales. Fiscal 2017 will be a year of significant value return to share owners. We expect to pay dividends of over $7 billion. In addition, we expect to reduce outstanding shares at a value of approximately of $15 billion through a combination of direct share repurchase and shares that will be exchanged in the Beauty transaction. In total, over $22 billion in dividend payments, share exchanges and share repurchase. 
To summarize fiscal 2017 guidance. Our current forecast calls for around 2% organic sales growth, all-in sales growth will be about -- around 1%, and we should have a small improvement in profit margins. Nonoperating income will be a headwind, and share count will contribute about 4% of earnings-per-share benefit. All current rates -- at current rates and prices, FX and commodities are a modest headwind to fiscal 2017 earnings. Significant currency weaknesses, commodity increases or additional geopolitical disruptions are not anticipated within this guidance. While we currently expect FX to only be a small headwind for the year, it will still be a notable headwind in Q1. We'll still be impacted by significant devaluations in the U.K., Argentina, Egypt, Nigeria, among others. We'll also still be annualizing the loss of finished product sales to our Venezuelan subsidiaries. 
Please take these factors into account as you consider the quarterly profile of your sales and earnings estimate. 
With that, I'll hand it back to David for his closing comments."

We expect this year to represent another significant step toward our goal of balanced growth and value creation. We're committed to continued productivity improvement and cost savings that provide the fuel for innovation and investments needed to accelerate and sustain faster top line growth. We have created and are sustaining strong cash productivity momentum. We're nearing the completion of the major portfolio moves to simplify and strengthen the category portfolio, and we're making similar moves at the brand and product form level to improve the profitability and value-creation capability of the categories we retain. We're strengthening the organization and culture by improving our approaches to our talent acquisition, career management, decision-making, accountability and incentives. Our standards are high. We're not satisfied with just being a little better. We want to be the best. We're making progress and we're determined to win, but we're also realistic about the time it will take for the improvements and investments we're making to fully play out in our results.

So in terms of the relative priority of market share versus profitability, it's an and. In our view, we need to be growing at or slightly ahead of the markets in which we're operating, and we fully intend to do that. We're -- as we have said, we're going to reinvest a significant portion of the savings that we're generating behind that effort to get back to market share growth. And that will -- that started. You see it in the numbers in the fourth quarter and will continue as we go forward. Just one thing on share trends. I mean, you're absolutely right in your overall observation. But if you look at across the 5 reporting segments, market share trends, past 6 months, past 12 months, were better past 6 months in 5 out of 5 segments. The same holds for the past 3 months versus the past 6 months. So again, 5 out of 5 segments improving. And the same for the past 1 month versus past 3-month comparison. Again, as David very clearly said, we're not where we want to be, but we're starting to see that progress as we reinvest behind the opportunities that are in front of us. In terms of the savings proration across the 5 years, this program will be a little bit more backloaded than our prior program, in part because of the nature of some of the projects that are contained in it, specifically the supply chain transformation, where as I said, we're in investment mode now and the savings will come 2, 3, 4 years from now. Having said that, there will be significant contributions from productivity again next year, which will give us the ability to increase investment in the business. We're expecting increases in advertising spend this year versus last, think about it in the probably mid-single-digit range. We want to increase, as David said in his remarks, sampling of consumer-preferred products and trial generation. We want to be more relevant in-store and online, and all of that is part of an activity system that we believe will help us restore the market share growth that you rightly cite as necessary going forward."

So I guess, why aren't you expecting more of a sales recovery and market share payback? And then separately, are you comfortable that the level of spending as we leave fiscal 2017 is the right level of spending behind the business longer term? Should we assume we get back to more of that normal EPS growth algorithm post-2017?"

First, we are very committed to get back to a little above the market growth, and we recognize 2% is not market growth. Having said that, and Jon highlighted in the formal remarks, we've still got quite a few choices to annualize. We made the choice, and I think it's very evident in AMJ, that we're going to get back to investing at the business at the level we need to. We also demonstrated to be in the second half of the year that we're committed to 4 quarters of brand support. The fourth quarter, we increased meaningfully our media investment versus previous year, and we're going to continue that in fiscal '17. Having said that, we will not stop making key choices where we have businesses that are structurally not profitable. But we think, on balance, the majority of that, choices have been made and we'll annualize it through this year. So we actually feel very good that the businesses that we have, especially post the close of Coty, we're very well positioned to grow sequentially. So I expect the first half to continue to make progress. Second half will be better. And much like we said at CAGNY, you're going to see just continued building of our business strength behind a very clear choice in investing in brand-building, and that biased toward point of market entry and bringing new consumers on and investing in innovation, both in current brands but also in our P&G ventures, to ensure we're planting the seeds for the mid- and long-term future. And we're going to continue to make the investments in go-to-market capability, including sales coverage, to make sure that we can reach and win in fast-moving channels, be that e-commerce, baby stores, cosmetic stores, or wherever the consumer and shopper want to shop."

But as Jon laid out, even after Duracell transaction and with Coty coming to a close here in a couple of months, there's still a lot of change afoot, still a lot of cost-cutting underway. So as you step back and think of what you've observed over the last 3 quarters or so as CEO, what's your confidence at this point that the people of P&G, the culture of the organization, they can truly take on both challenges at once? In other words, is the productivity culture truly ingrained enough that you can layer on or reemphasize top line focus without risk that you end up kind of breaking the back of the organization, so to speak? And then if I could, just a related bolt-on question or 2 for Jon. First is, you may have said this, but as you reaccelerate and reinvest, can you maintain that 100% or so free cash flow productivity? And second, should we expect a volume-centric organic growth algorithm for '17 similar to what we saw in Q4? Or is there a reason for that to reverse as you move through the year?"

Of all the transformation variables, the one I'm most confident in is the P&G people are up for the challenge. I think we demonstrated this year, which is clearly the peak in terms of the Duracell transaction, the enormous complexity of the Coty transaction, folks have risen to the occasion to be able to stand up those companies, still sequentially improving the operating companies, and while doing some of the heavy lifting in both the North American and European supply chain work. So it's a very good point. And I think at times we underestimate the amount of additional work beyond operating the businesses, but I think the heaviest load is -- was this last fiscal year and for the next quarter. So the organization's demonstrated the resiliency. In our P&G survey, the confidence that people have that the choices are right and the confidence they have and pride they have in P&G is at an all-time high. So we're going to build off that, and I have a lot of confidence in P&G people. The second one on is productivity ingrained? My hope now is, after 5 years of making the kind of improvement we have, that we've demonstrated externally, and I believe internally built the confidence that this is critical and a key enabler for getting back to the kind of balanced top and bottom line results we need. We've certainly emphasized that. But as we've added some additional focus on bringing more users on board, I think it's been very empowering to our people. They see then the outcome of all the productivity work, leading into investments in brand-building innovation, and that gives them confidence that the future of the company is going to be strong."

Why isn't driving incremental wash loads enough versus it needing to be 3 products to do the job of remove the odors? Same thing on the Tide PODS, right? The advertising with 2 pods being chucked in the wash, which categorically wasn't the dosing recommendation when the product launched.

One, Fabric Care is a good example of what happens when we get all the elements working together, and you've seen both the category growth and the share growth associated with it. On the specific comments, we go where the consumer goes and expresses interest and/or frustration. And the athleisure area is an area she has expressed frustration, and so we're trying to address a very specific need some consumers have. And to-date, that's tested very, very well. And we're actually quite excited about it, bringing some additional users in, and it may lead to increased consumption for existing users. But both will be important. And I think it will grow the category a little bit as well. The idea is very much to understand the needs consumers have and ensure we've got a product offering that meets them. And to the extent there's an unmet need, we will continue to innovate. The -- each of the add-on products that we've had the last year, whether it's in the fabric enhancer or the base Fabric Care business, I think has demonstrated the ability to grow the category and grow the share. So to-date, at least, I have not seen an indication that it is causing unneeded proliferation. In fact, if I step back and look across the company, we have meaningfully less SKUs today than we had a year ago. Many categories are down 10% to 20% in the number of SKUs they've offered, but what they are doing is trying to bring more meaningful consumer benefits to areas that are underserved or needs are unmet. And then the last comment I'd make on the 2-pods instruction, if you look at consumer habits today, they have higher-capacity washing machines. And some consumers are putting meaningfully more into each load. And what we're trying to do is provide consumers the understanding of what is the best amount of detergent or number of pods to use to get ideal performance. And in the U.S. at least, many consumers were underdosing, and this will allow consumers to get a much better outcome. And we've given them at least the guidance so that they do get the best outcome, and then it would be up to them certainly to choose what's right for them."

I'll give a couple of comments overall, but then it's very category-specific. On restarting top line growth, I will first emphasize we're getting back to making consumers aware of the product and communicating the benefit. So making sure we were consistently having the reach and frequency needed with the right message was key. And we've also, I think, adjusted our communication, both to TV, digital, in any way that's appropriate to reach target consumers, and I believe that's going to make a big difference. A second area that is helping, and you're going to see it continue and probably increase next year, is point-of-market entry and point-of-market change-focused spending. We understand, and we look back over several years, that had gone down on many categories, and it was showing up in lower shares with entry-point consumers. And that doesn't bode well for the future, and that's played out with some of the share losses that you and others have highlighted. The right way to build it back is to bring consumers in, and the best most effective way is to bring consumers into your category when they first have the need for the category. So we have prioritized point of market entry and point of market change, and that will continue to increase. We gave the example on laundry. It's also happening in many other categories. The second, which I think is critically important, and that will play out consistently over time, more even in the mid to long term, is the increased investment in innovation and showing that we have products that have meaningful consumer -- we call it consumer wow. We have adjusted our evaluation of innovation to not just have technically superior products but to have products and brands that have a meaningful difference that consumers see and appreciate. This higher bar is pushing us to go back on some of the innovations coming in the sheer amount of the product but also the package, and the experience is at a higher level so the consumer can play back it's meaningfully different. An example of a test that we're using frequently is deprivation: give the consumer product, and then take it away, and get their reaction. And if you get a really significant reaction, you probably have a product that really means something to the consumer. So I would say the areas that I would -- what we did focus on, and I believe to be very meaningful next year, would be point of market entry, continued consistent building of appropriate reach and frequency, and then consumer meaningful and appreciated innovation that has an impact on market growth, which is the last point I want to make, is our innovation at times has been very focused at trying to be a little bit better than our best competition. We've added the expectation for each of our categories that their role is to grow the category size because that has meaningful impact both on the support we get from customers but also the financial attractiveness of each of the innovations and, therefore, categories."

Stepping back kind of at a macro level on the kind of 4 pillars of transformation, productivity, portfolio, top line acceleration, organization and culture, I think the benefit from those efforts is primarily ahead of us. So the portfolio, we don't complete until October, and we still have a bunch of transition work to do to execute that big transaction. We have not yet been able to operate as a company in a 10-category-focused fashion. So all of that benefit, I think, is ahead. Our productivity, we have benefited from, and we will continue to benefit from. The acceleration, the investments really have just started in the last 6 months. And things like point of market entry, point of market change investments will increase as we go through next year. And frankly, they take some time to pay out themselves, but the payout is significant. And I think the other change that is sometimes underestimated in terms of its importance are the organization and cultural changes that David talked about. I think those will be significant, and frankly, we're just putting them in place. So the new incentive system goes into place in July. We moved, as David said, to dedicated sales resources in North America. We're just starting that move in some of the other big markets. So I think there's a lot of benefit ahead. Last comment as it relates to priority. These are all part of an ecosystem that's designed to work together to produce balanced top line, bottom line and cash flow growth. And I really like them because I think they're mutually reinforcing, as David said in his remarks. We get this top line growing, that will generate cost savings in itself through top line leverage, which will then give us the ability to invest. We'll have a motivated organization that's properly and strongly incented to deliver both. I think, without getting ahead of ourselves here, again, a lot of the benefit still comes in the future."

First, let me just take the cut at the China and then Jon can comment a little bit on the $18 billion from gross to net, and I'm happy to comment on conversations I've had with most of the leading customers. First on China. We see it sequentially improving. We are not done yet with getting our portfolio right in China. That will take time. There are several categories that we are still losing share, and we're not positioned with the appropriate portfolio in the premium, super premium segments. We started with the Oral-B effort last year. We've got some -- and we have innovation also in Fabric Care. But each of the categories has stepped up both the innovation pace but also making sure they have on-the-ground resources in China to ensure the product and the package and the proposition have been fine-tuned to really win the Chinese consumers. And that will take time. So I see that one building over time. The other comment I'd make on China based on a lot that I've heard and read is there's been a lot said about the attractiveness of China. Through our lens, it continues to be extremely attractive. Jon mentioned some of the reasons why, but I'd also say the published data often shows a very rapid slowdown. And that is true in the off-line portion of the business. We see it going to very low single digits, and some categories are now flat in China. Having said that, the online portion is accelerated and is certainly in the double digit, but you see many categories 1 30, 1 40, 1 50, and what is encouraging to me is our on online business is starting to accelerate. We're growing share in the past 6 months. And we've at least now got a couple of our categories where our online share is higher than our off-line share, which bodes well for the future, given the choice Chinese consumers are making. So it will continue to get better over time. Over the next 12 to 18 months, we'll see more and more innovation hitting that has been specifically designed for China versus adapted to be used in China, and I think that will increase our hit rate and our growth rate."

That's not the design intent here. But what we do want to do is ensure that [indiscernible] dollars, both in the form of trade spending but also in the form of marketing, in ways that maximize category growth, which benefits both ourselves and our retail partners. Now there are kind of 3 opportunities within that. One is, just like with our advertising budgets, including the agency and production cost, there are sources of inefficiency that we can access without impacting the market in any way or our retail partners in a significant way, and we ought to go after those. Two, ensuring that we're spending the money in a way that's most productive in terms of driving market basket both, again, for ourselves and our retail customers. And we have big opportunities there to sharpen the focus of where the money gets spent and, again, to the benefit of both our retail partners and ourselves. And the third one is a little bit trickier, but we have some good examples of this already, and we'll be testing others, is looking across the buckets of spend beyond trade spending, there are cases where if we would reduce trade spending, shift that money to advertising or sampling, we may be able to increase the rate of growth in a category, again, in a way that's beneficial to both our retail partners and ourselves. We did some of that, for example, on Olay in North America this year and got fairly broad support for that. So you're absolutely right.

The digital and social space, to me, is a powerful opportunity for any consumer marketing company, and it's left to all of us to figure out how to best leverage the capability that has been developed, and frankly, continues to emerge rapidly. P&G has shifted significantly its resources and our investments to ensure that we are showing up with communication that wins mobile back. And that's a big shift for us, and that's critically important because whether it's e-commerce or whether it's consumption of media, in many markets, it's now primarily through the mobile phone. And more and more you're seeing P&G winning with the marketing programs that are adapted for digital and social. And a good example of one -- of a social program that has done extraordinarily well is the Always Like A Girl, where we've leveraged that communication and that very strong social platform, but used and leveraged the social media capability to drive the brand. I do understand, and certainly there's very real -- the cost to enter a category has changed dramatically today versus 5 and 10 years ago. And part of what we are doing, by category, then is looking to see how do we leverage the capability that exists. I expect we'll continue to see competitors that can pop up. But generally, to sustain and grow a business, you have to have a product and a product experience that meets the consumers' need. There are many, many examples of Internet-based competitors that have been popping up both here and China. Tremendous number of those. They get trial, repurchase those is another story, and repurchase in a profitable business model is the highest bar, and that's the one that we're working against. It's just have a substantive product that meets the consumers' need, to have communication programs that meet consumers when and where they're receptive to the message and understand they want less to be sold and more to be part of their life, and we're adjusting our marketing and communication programs to do just that. And I think that's the right way by category to win."

If you look at price inclusive of promotion as a component of top line, we've been neutral to positive for 23 straight quarters and 12 consecutive years. And I don't think that relative preference in the drivers for business growth changes going forward. But we've had 2 dynamics that we've been dealing with in the last year that kind of inform next year's view. One is we've been pricing significantly to recover foreign exchange impacts, which has resulted in volume being less of a component of the top line, in fact, in many cases, a negative component. We're hopeful that we're going to be operating in a more stable currency environment. So that volume negative goes away. Also, as you have and others have rightly pointed out on several occasions, we've had category-country combinations where our pricing got too high. In many cases, that's where we were trying to recover from devaluation and competitors didn't follow. In other cases, Dave talked about Luvs in his prepared remarks, a major competitor took pricing down in that segment, and we'll be adjusting prices to deal with those realities, which makes price, in those instances, less of the top line component and volume more of it. We have no interest in spending unproductively. Our intent is to drive, as David said, category growth. And we do not see the business in most parts of the world through a zero-sum lens in any way."

And it's been most acute in places like Russia, where the differential impact we had was very severe for a U.S.-domiciled company. And you're seeing even Russia volume share has recovered. And until we annualize that, it will show up with the dynamic that you highlighted. But there, our front half was below 100 and our back half is double digit, and especially the fourth quarter. That will annualize, and we get back to exactly what Jon said, which is our business model is very, very clear, which is we want to invest in innovation and brand-building, especially focus the brand-building and bringing consumers in, and then we want to delight them so they stay with our brand. And the spending is heavily focused there other than some selective value interventions, almost all driven by foreign exchange and the category settling out to a place where we're back in an acceptable price corridor and where we're getting into the end of that."

We have, already this year, increased our support for our U.S. Shave Care business, and we'll continue to make sure we support it at the level required to get back to growing. The strategic choice we made that I highlighted earlier, which is very important and should play out positively, in spite of Unilever's acquisition of Dollar Shave Club, is activating more than just the high end of the portfolio. Where we've been most vulnerable is at the mid- and lower tier. And if you look at our share losses, that's where we've been most acute. And Dollar Shave Club has come in with, in some cases, a lower absolute cash outlay. Not a better-performing product, and actually not a better-value product, when you look over time. And for that reason, we have -- and we had other challenges which I think are well known in private label and disposables. So we've gone back and innovated on all 3 tiers and also addressed and now funded marketing programs aimed at all 3: disposables; the MACH3 segment, both in innovation and brand support; and in the premium tier. To me, that will continue to be funded. That is anticipated in our guidance. That's part of the base plan for fiscal '17 for Shave Care. Moving to the second one on Fabric Care, Henkel's acquisition of Sun. Certainly, we're very aware. There was a lot of concern, if you go back a year ago, for sale, when it came in, that, that would have a real detrimental impact on our business. And the view we took then is the same view we take now, is that there will be dynamics in the marketplace that could change, and we'll see how the category sorts itself out. But the way we were able to win is the same strategy going into fiscal '17. Fabric Care focused on consumers and shoppers. They brought aggressive innovation to make sure that they're meeting the shoppers' needs better than anybody else, premium performing products. And they did a great job communicating and sampling their products. And you see, this fiscal year built into our guidance is increased level sampling. And with a broader sampling program as well as the marketing program that is in place, and I just mentioned some additional innovation coming on the product front, I think we are actually well positioned. And the objective going in, independent of what happens in terms of industry consolidation, is that we win with consumers and shoppers. And we'll see how it plays out on the other point."

It shows up and it's one of the most acute categories in terms of share loss, period. The category is very -- understand -- the categories [ph] we focus on winning in China. We -- 6, 9 months ago, made a choice that we're going to win in China and then allocated the resources and the capital to ensure that we had the appropriate product innovation coming. It's not yet publicly announced when some of these major innovations are coming. But on both diapers and pants, we're very committed to win. An encouraging sign to me about the future in China is to look at what we've been able to do recently in Japan, where in Japan, you've seen us now take share leadership. And frankly, we're losing to primarily -- Japanese competitors have done extremely well in China, as well as KC [ph]. And innovation that we have coming over the next fiscal year and beyond, we think will position us well. On Olay, our first step was to get our portfolio cleaned up. That's been done. If you step back and look at the 4 core collections on Olay, we're starting to see a meaningful difference, which is to me a very positive sign, and that's Total Effects, Regenerist, our whitening segment and ProX. On those, we see back half doing better than second half. We still have to anniversary some of the discontinued SKUs. And the second key innovation on Olay will be getting our counters right. Our counters, and having been to China many times and previously lived in Greater China, our counters have gotten quite tired and have not been upgraded recently. So we've shut down the counters that are in stores that aren't productive. And we've made meaningful investments in upgrading the counters in the stores that we think have a basis -- places where we have a basis to compete. So counter innovation is coming. It's already happening. It is funded, and showing up now. And the innovations will be coming on, primarily, the 4 core collections and then some new innovations that we'll be doing. And then the last category is -- hair is our largest category in China. We have meaningful innovations coming on both the conditioner that are superior. And I mentioned earlier, it's already been launched in the U.S. and launched in China. It is superior performing. We have hair innovation coming on many of our brands. Pantene and Head & Shoulders, historically, have been stronger. VS is actually growing share, and we've got innovation coming on in Rejoice, which has been the weakest of our brands in China. So on each one of the brands there's focus. We've also made the choice, funded and staffed on-the-ground resources to ensure we keep up with the pace of innovation required in the Beauty segment, which to me is an important choice about winning in the future in China. Thank you."

I'm going to be relatively brief today. Our results are fairly straightforward, and we're together soon for our Analyst Day when we'll go into much more detail on our progress and plans. Our first quarter results marked a good start to the",2086,"Good morning. I'm going to be relatively brief today. Our results are fairly straightforward, and we're together soon for our Analyst Day when we'll go into much more detail on our progress and plans. 
Our first quarter results marked a good start to the new fiscal, though work and opportunity remain. One of our key priorities has been to accelerate top line growth. Organic sales for the quarter grew 3%. This includes about a 1 point drag from the combination of the rationalization and strengthening work we're doing within the ongoing portfolio and the impact of reduced finished product sales to our Venezuelan subsidiaries. Top line growth was broad-based across categories and across markets. Organic sales growth in the U.S. progressed from 1% in the first half of last fiscal year to 2% in the second half to 3% in the quarter we just completed. Growth in China, minus 8% to minus 2% to plus 2% over those same time periods. 
We've been making sequential progress in each of our largest categories: Baby Care, minus 2%, flat to plus 2%; Grooming, plus 2% to plus 3% to plus 3%; Fabric Care, plus 1%, plus 1% to plus 5%; and Hair Care, minus 1% to flat to plus 2%. 
July-September organic sales grew in each reporting segment and in all 10 product categories. Still, as I said before, work and opportunity remain. Hair Care and Baby Care, 2 of our largest categories, were both up 2%, but below the rates of market growth in these categories. These businesses, along with the Grooming business in the U.S., represent notable opportunities for further top line acceleration. 
Organic sales grew in each region and in 9 of the 10 largest markets. Here, too, opportunities remain. Sales in the U.K., which continues to be a very challenging, highly promotional market, were down 2%. Organic sales in China and Russia were both up 2%, but again below the pace of market growth. 
So in summary, progress with more work to do. Sales growth in the quarter was volume-driven. Organic volume was up 3%. Pricing and mix were each essentially neutral for organic sales growth. All-in sales for the company were in line with the prior year, including the 3-point headwind from foreign exchange. 
As we move forward, progress will not come in a straight line. There will be quarter-to-quarter volatility. Comps will get more difficult. We need to manage significant geopolitical and economic volatility in markets like Egypt, Nigeria, Argentina, even the Philippines. And of course, our competition is not standing still. We still have work remaining in some categories and markets to get our brands back to market levels of growth. These opportunities need to be addressed category by category, market by market, channel by channel. We're after it, but it won't happen overnight. 
Moving to the bottom line. Core earnings per share were $1.03, up 5% versus the prior year. Foreign exchange had a negative 7-point headwind on the first quarter earnings. On a constant-currency basis, core earnings per share were up 12%. Core gross margin increased 50 basis points versus the prior year. On a constant-currency basis, core gross margin was up 130 basis points, including 190 basis points of productivity improvement. 
Commodities were a modest hurt to gross margin in the quarter. Feedstock costs for propylene, ethylene and tropical oils are up as much as mid-teens since we set our initial budgets for the year. Wage inflation is also an increasing challenge in many developing markets. 
Productivity improvements contributed 270 basis points of operating margin benefit. We reinvested a significant portion of those savings in product and packaging innovation, media reach and continuity, sampling, R&D, sales coverage and targeted consumer value adjustments in order to accelerate our top line growth.  Core operating margin as a result was up 20 basis points for the quarter. On a constant-currency basis, core operating margin was up 120 basis points. 
The core effective tax rate was 23%, about a point below last year's first quarter level. This includes the adoption of new accounting standards for share-based compensation, which reduced the quarterly tax rate by about 3 points, about $0.04 per share benefit to core earnings per share. The impact on the balance of the quarters [ph] this fiscal year from this accounting change is expected to be minimal. The fiscal year impact of this change was assumed in our initial guidance for the year. 
All-in GAAP earnings per share were $0.96 for the quarter, also up 5% versus the prior year. We generated $2.3 billion in free cash flow with 85% free cash flow productivity, returning $2.9 billion to share owners, $1.9 billion in dividends and $1 billion of share repurchase. Our share repurchase flexibility was limited in the first quarter due to trading restrictions related to the Coty transaction. 
The day after the quarter ended, on October 1, we reached a very important milestone in our portfolio transformation program, closing the Beauty transaction with Coty. This marks the completion of the most significant portfolio transformation in P&G's history. We've created value for share owners every step of the way, including over $4 billion versus our key price [ph] in the Beauty deal. 
While we will be supporting transition efforts for some time, we can now begin focusing our efforts on the 10 core categories we identified 2 years ago. The market in each of these 10 core categories is large and is growing between 1% and 7% per year. These are structurally attractive categories, where P&G holds leading market positions. Our businesses in these categories have historically grown sales a point faster than the company and held margins that are 2 points higher than the company average. They leverage P&G core strengths of consumer understanding, innovation, branding and go-to-market and benefit from the company scale. Consumers use these categories on a frequent basis, typically daily. Purchase choice is driven more by product performance against a clear consumer need or job to be done than by self-expression or fashion trends. These categories lend themselves to innovation, which creates noticeable superiority. We'll compete within these categories from the top of the market, building down across middle price tiers that are profitable and growing. We will not compete in the lowest price tiers, which are generally commoditized and where no money is made. We will, however, serve cash-constrained consumers with smaller, more affordable pack sizes requiring less cash outlay per purchase. We're in the midst, as you know, of exiting unprofitable commoditizing price tiers, forms and segments, enabling us to focus our resources on forms and segments that are profitable and growing.  Our objective for the new 10-category company is very clear: balanced top and bottom line growth that delivers total shareholder return that places P&G consistently in the top 1/3 of our peer group. 
I spoke earlier about the reacceleration of our top line, and we're going to spend more time on this on Analyst Day. This is critically important. But productivity improvement and cost savings are also a necessity in achieving our TSR objective. They provide fuel for investment and innovation, advertising, sales coverage, trial and sampling to grow our brands and grow our categories and build margin. Top and bottom line growth are not separate endeavors. They reinforce and fuel each other. They're part of the same ecosystem. They live together and depend on each other. They can't be separated. 
Last fiscal year, we completed our first 5-year productivity program -- improvement program, accelerating and exceeding each of our cost savings and enrollment reduction objectives. We saved over $7 billion in cost of goods sold. We've reduced manufacturing enrollment by 22% over the last 4 years. This includes new staffing necessary to support capacity additions. On a same-site basis, manufacturing enrollment was down 27% through last fiscal, with additional progress planned this year. We've reduced the number of manufacturing platforms we produce with by 30% over this same period. Over the last 5 years, we reduced nonmanufacturing roles by nearly 25%. This excludes the impact of divestitures. Including divestitures, we've reduced overhead roles by about 35%. 
As we've decreased the size of the organization, we've also simplified it. We've gone from managing the global business through 50-market cluster organizations to just 25. We simplified our network of suppliers, reducing, for example, commercial agency support from 6,000 vendors to about half of that. Excluding reinvestments in innovation, sales coverage, media and sampling, productivity has enabled us to deliver constant-currency gross and operating margin improvement and high-single to double-digit constant currency core earnings per share growth in each of the last 4 fiscal years. We improved gross and operating margins by triple-digit indices, both including and excluding currency, in fiscal 2016. And we continue the trend in Q1 with double-digit constant currency core earnings per share growth and triple-digit constant currency margin expansion. 
We're driving productivity improvement up and down the income statement and across the balance sheet. Inventory days are down about 10 days over the last 5 years. Payables days are up more than 30 days, enabled significantly by our supply chain financing program. We've made significant progress, and we have significant opportunity. Our strong track record and our line of sight to additional opportunity inform our intent to save as much as another $10 billion in cost over the next 5 years. We expect to reinvest a significant amount of the savings in R&D and product and packaging improvements and sales coverage and a brand awareness at trial-building programs to deliver balanced top and bottom line growth, which brings me to fiscal year guidance. 
We're maintaining our organic sales and core earnings per share outlook for this fiscal year. The first quarter was a good start, but comps get more difficult, and we continue to face a relatively slow-growth, volatile world. We're expecting organic sales growth of around 2% for the year. This includes between 0.5 point and 1 point of headwind from the portfolio rationalization and strengthening work within the ongoing 10 product categories. It also includes a headwind from lost sales to our Venezuelan subsidiaries in the first half of the fiscal year. 
We expect fiscal 2017 all-in sales growth of about 1%, including around a 1 point drag on growth from the net impact of foreign exchange and divestitures. Our bottom line guidance for core earnings per share growth is for core earnings per share growth of mid-single digits. This range reflects the volatility of the markets in which we compete, and it reflects the investments we tend to make in the business to accelerate organic sales growth in a sustainable, long-term, market-constructive and value-accretive way. 
We continue to forecast a reduction in core nonoperating income in fiscal 2017 due to lower gains from minor brand divestitures. The core effective tax rate should be roughly in line with the fiscal 2016 level. All-in GAAP earnings per share should increase 45% to 50%, including the significant onetime gain from the Beauty transaction with Coty that will be recognized in the October-December results. Also included in GAAP earnings per share are approximately $0.10 per share of noncore restructuring charges and $0.13 per share of charges related to early debt retirement that we initiated earlier this month. 
At current rates and prices, FX and commodities combined are about a $0.12 per share headwind to fiscal 2017 earnings. Significant currency weakness, commodity cost increases or additional geopolitical disruptions are not anticipated within this guidance range. We expect adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% or better. Fiscal 2017 will be a year of significant value returned to share owners. We expect to pay over $7 billion in dividends. We reduced [ph] outstanding shares by $9.4 billion in the transaction with Coty, and we expect to make over $5 billion of direct share repurchase. In total, about $22 billion in dividend payments, share exchanges and share repurchases this fiscal year.

Because the optimism in me wants to believe that we'll start to see incremental returns on all this investment you've been making the last 9 months. But then the pessimist in me says, ""This Q1 momentum may be short-lived as Q2 kind of rears its head."" So again, I know it's tough to call quarters, especially in this environment, but maybe just put a little more context around how you're measuring returns on the investments you've made so far, where you're seeing the biggest bang for the buck and again, how you're thinking about top line progression over the balance of the year."

In terms of return on the investments we're making, I think you see that both from a top line and a bottom line standpoint in the first quarter. I mean, on a constant currency basis, very significant returns with 12% core earnings per share growth on 3% top line. We are reinvesting as we said we would productivity [ph] savings. But as we also have said we would, we're going to continue to modestly improve margins, and that is the only recipe for sustained success in this industry. And we're intent on following it and so far, are pleased with the results."

In the new 10-category company, where we have leading positions across those categories, we become increasingly dependent on moving markets, on growing markets. There are category country combinations where we have 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% market shares. So one more point of share isn't the margin of victory or defeat. And that doesn't mean that share isn't important. Share is important. But we need to be growing markets, increasing the number of users for our brands. And that's what our activity system is all set up to do. So when you talk about, for example, increasing trial and sampling at point of market entry and point of market change with noticeably superior products, that moves markets over time. And being able to price behind superior innovation also moves markets over time. What doesn't move markets is, for example, leading the march down on promotion spending. If you look at the quarter we just completed, price, inclusive of promotion, was a neutral contributor to the top line. It's been a neutral to positive contributor to the top line for the last 24 quarters, been a positive contributor for many years. I think it's 12 in a row. So that's going to continue to be what we're going to emphasize, which is market-accretive, market-constructive, growth-driving investments. Now having said that, we won't be successful in that endeavor and maintain our shares if we're uncompetitive. And so we will take moves where warranted to ensure that we're offering a competitive value proposition to consumers. We've made several of those moves in the last quarter. What moves happen in the future will be largely dependent on where others take us. But thanks for picking up on that point. It's an important one."

So how do you think about the balance of investments between innovation and ad spend, sampling and -- versus kind of less-than-peer pricing on the top line? Because the perception we're hearing -- and you heard one of your competitors yesterday say it effectively, the perception you're hearing from them is -- from the other competitors is that it is just starting another price war. I mean, we've heard this from P&G before. It's going to be a pyrrhic victory or at least, a fleeting victory for now. So how do you get comfortable that that's not going to be the case? You can't really control perceptions of competitors, obviously, but the perception is already clearly forming. So how are you sure that's not going to be a pyrrhic or fleeting victory for you guys?

We do expect -- we compete in a very strong industry with strong competitors, and we expect them to be working just as hard as we are to protect and build their businesses. And that's one of the factors that I cited in terms of guiding to [ph] 2% top line growth on the year against the backdrop of a 3% Q1. In terms of ensuring that we're engaged in the activities that best support our brands and businesses, there's really not an aggregate answer to that. Though I'm comfortable in aggregate, that's really a choice that's made in individual categories and countries. And the way I think about this very simplistically is in line with your question. If we grow business by, for example, significantly increasing promotion spending, that will be, I think you're absolutely right, a pyrrhic victory. Why? Two reasons: Number one, nothing proprietary can be matched instantly. That's very different than an investment -- than a successful investment in innovation or equity building or sampling, which can create unique advantage; two, promotion spending, by definition -- almost by definition, is market-dilutive, whereas those other activity streams can be, if executed with excellence, are market-accretive. And that's just a better place for us to be in. So I'm not going to give a formula or an algorithm not because I'm afraid of giving one, but simply because it doesn't exist at an aggregate level. That's not how we manage the company. But the emphasis points, we'll continue to be focused on long-term drivers of market growth and brand growth, long-term drivers of new users to our brands, but short-term competitiveness."

First of all, from a comparison of reported results to track channel trends -- the quarter track channel trends, there are 2 big drivers within that: One of them is simply the amount of business and the relative growth of that business that's moving online versus off-line; and two, nontrack customers like Costco, as an example. So in the U.S., for example, that explains about a point of difference -- a full point of difference between the track channel sales growth numbers and our reported sales growth numbers. In China, that number represents a 5-point reconciliation item between those 2 numbers. So that's becoming increasingly significant. And as you know, the relative growth rates there are very, very different. 30% in one to, call it, 3%, 2% in the other. The other difference that exists in the U.S. track channel reports, as it should, is the inclusion of the Beauty businesses that were transitioned to Coty as of October 1. So any of the share reports or sales growth reports that have come out to date rightly include that business. They won't going forward. And that dynamic in the U.S. explains about 0.5 point of difference between the track channel numbers and the core nondiscontinued business numbers that we're reporting today. And that's about -- well, that's another big part of the equation. There are -- there -- we do have one situation, which I'll make you aware of, that falls kind of into your last bucket, which is timing differences that would affect the different quarterly reporting numbers. And that's in China, where we transitioned our Hong Kong business to a new distributor. And so there's some pipeline fill to that distributor in the numbers on the quarter, call it, 1 to 2 points. Relatively small on a total company basis, but that's -- but a 1 to 2-point impact in China itself. So those are the primary drivers of the differences."

In terms of payout on sampling, I'm glad you asked that question. This is something that is very -- is typically -- if you can sample consumers at point-of-market entry or point-of-market change, with noticeably superior products and categories where brand loyalty is relatively higher, the lifetime benefit from that relatively modest investment can be significant. But it is a lifetime benefit. The consumer will take a period of time just to use the product that you've sampled them with. And so that's not an investment endeavor that we typically see immediate returns in. That's why, unfortunately, we got into a practice of reducing that spending because it wasn't producing -- never produces immediate short-term results. But it's really the area of spending that should be the last that we cut because of its importance in building users for potentially a lifetime of consumption. So we're happy with our efforts to date, but it's an area of return that we'll be monitoring and measuring for several years to come."

We continue to have 4 of the top leading brands in the market in Head & Shoulders, Rejoice, Pantene and without Sassoon. I think those are, respectively, #1, #2, #4 and #5 in the market. We're essentially flat there versus a year ago. So we do have some -- and part of that is driven by some new entrants into the market. One thing -- but clearly, it continues to be a strong business and offers some upside. The one business where we need to make much more progress is on Baby Care, which was down again double digits in the quarter. We feel very good about portions of our portfolio, Our pant offering, for example, is doing extremely well. We have some new premium tape innovation coming to market in the next 6 to 9 months, which we're also very excited about. But that is a business that we need to keep working on. In terms of channels in China, we're doing very well in e-commerce, growing ahead of the market, building share in e-commerce. Still not yet to the level of our brick-and-mortar shares, but improving significantly. We've stabilized and started growing shares in the hyper and super part of the business, which is encouraging. We still have some challenges both in the wholesale market and in building distribution and some of the specialty channels that are among the fastest-growing. But as you rightly point out, overall, real progress. And as I think about China long term, a significant opportunity on both the top and bottom line for the company."

The organic volume growth number was strong, albeit against a soft comp. Was there any timing benefit in the quarter or anything notable that you comment on with respect to retail inventory levels? And then the broader question. And I apologize if I missed this. What are the market growth assumptions contemplated in your outlook? And maybe you could separate the comments, Jon, into U.S., other developed markets and then emerging markets. And I ask that in the context -- we've seen some of your competitors talk about slowing market growth rates, particularly in Latin America. And maybe you could also comment on whether that outlook or those growth rate assumptions have changed over the past few months."

The biggest driver there is sell-through to consumption as well as the base peer dynamic, which you rightly cited. There are certain categories which events are at different times across quarters, this year versus last year. But in aggregate, that's not a significant driver of the volume progress that occurred. In terms of the market growth assumptions, split developed and developing, this is kind of like foreign exchange or commodities in that I don't know what the future holds. And so our forecast is predicated really on the equivalent of FX or commodities spot rates, which is just simply the latest data. And the latest data we have past 3 months shows market growth of a little over 1% in developed markets. That's inclusive of Western Europe, Japan, et cetera. And it shows 5% growth in developing markets. When average together, you get close to the 3% to 3.5% number that I was speaking with Jason about. If you look at the trend of those numbers, and I'm looking at 3 -- sequential 3-month periods, I really don't see a significant difference or significant trend change across those markets. So point 1 and point 2s, but nothing of significance."

So we did build share of about 0.4 points [ph] in the past 3 months basis in North America. The most important thing, though, in North America is the improvement in the rate of market growth, going back to our earlier conversations, up 4 points on a past 3-month basis, driven by innovation in the category, which is exactly what we hope to see. Also, growth within that segment is being fueled by our fabric enhancers business. The U.S. up 7 points versus last year with the scent beads segment, the one that we're innovating in the most significantly, growing in the mid-20s. Our fabric enhancers share up 1.5 points on a past 3-month basis. We've withstood fairly successfully several competitive dynamics. We don't take that casually, though. But if we can continue being an innovation leader in the market and moving the market, we believe, we'll continue to be in a good position. Will the growth rates stay at that level? I would say likely not to that full extent in developed markets, but they continue to be attractive. On the other hand, what's implied deductively in those numbers is declines in developing markets. A lot of that is being driven by the portfolio-focusing efforts within Fabric Care getting out of some of the lower-priced tiers, the bars, tiers even powders in some markets. And so that's having an impact on the growth from a negative standpoint, which should dissipate as we grow forward. And so when you put those 2 things together, I would expect that Fabric Care will continue to be a strong contributor of growth at a total company level."

If I look at, for example, Feminine Care, again fairly simple -- fairly standard growth rates. Fabric Care, 4.5%, 4.2%, 4.2%. Where you do see a significant reduction in the market growth rates in the track channel data is in some of the Beauty businesses, but I don't have all the data here in front of me, but that is largely driven by the movement of that business online.

The pricing activity that would be engaging and in developing markets would, in all likelihood, will be lower. At the same time, though, that absence of price increase should lead to stronger volume growth over time. So I wouldn't necessarily look at developing market growth rates as inherently declining, but I think you're absolutely right that the components of that growth should be different. That's relative to price, specifically. Relative to mix, I think you're still going to see some benefit there as major portions of the developing world move up the pricing ladder, the premium-ization that we've seen in China, which is the largest developing market, as one example of that. And I expect that will occur in other markets as well as economies stabilize and improve. So in that I still am relatively bullish, our positions in developing markets and the growth prospects that they bring with them. In terms of market share losses, I mentioned that the categorized on a global aggregate basis where we're growing behind the market, and one of them is Hair Care. The other is Baby Care. And I also mentioned an opportunity in the U.S. premium market. We are on all of those. If you take Hair Care, for example, we're making great progress on Head & Shoulders, up 5 points in the quarter. Making great progress on Pantene, up 5 points in the quarter. We have some issues, though, with some of our smaller brands, like Herbal Essences, for example. And we have a whole new program in every stage coming to market in the second half of the year. I've mentioned some of the products work we're doing in Baby Care. And when we get that right, we tend to perform very well. If you look at the U.S., for example, where we do have that right, we're building market share both on Pampers and in aggregate. So as I mentioned, there's opportunity to improve. It's not something that will happen overnight, but it's clearly identified and being aggressively focused on."

But what I'd ask is, first, just -- could we -- I mean, following to Caroline's question, could we expect -- based on what you know right now of foreign exchange, would pricing be a component of the 2% -- positive price be a component of the 2% organic sales target for this year, based on what you know right?

You may recall, when we headed into the most recent round of big FX impacts, which was last year, we said that while historically we've been able to regain about 2/3 of the impact through pricing, we didn't feel we were going to able to do that this time around. And that was driven, in large part, simply by divergence and what was happening to the dollar and what was happening to the functional currencies for some of our significant competitors, namely the euro, the pound and the yen. And those currencies were weakening over that period of time. And so there was less need for competitors who were reporting results on those currencies to price. And as much as anything, that's what you're seeing being reflected in the actuals. We're going to be pragmatic. We're going to offer good value to consumers, but we're also going to work through every means we have available to us, including cost savings and mix improvement innovation, to maintain attractive structural economic so that growth is worth something in these markets. And so that's a different answer in every category, in every market, month to month, week to week. And so we're going to try to manage that as intelligently as we can. I wouldn't expect them at this point, based on your point on where we sit today, ""Do I expect pricing to be significant part of the equation the balance of the year?"" I do not. In terms of how people are compensated, we are a U.S.-dollar functional currency company. We pay dividends in dollars. We repurchase shares in dollars. And our investor base, as you well know, really doesn't care how many Russian rubles we have or pesos we have. What they care about is how many dollars we have. And so the primary compensation lens is through all-in performance on dollar terms. We do, though, also have a look because we don't want to incent behavior that's too short-term-oriented at constant currency. But over period of time, we're going to measure our success or failure based on earnings per share and earnings growth and importantly cash growth in dollars."

Let me address green and sustainable first. While we're open to both inorganic and organic ways of increasing our product superiority and the sustainability of our products, and that's an important end, it hasn't been our experience that there's a lot available on the market that delivers that end, which something like Tide Pure Clean definitely delivers. We've been on this for a while. While Tide Pure Clean is new and is doing very well. If you look at the share of the segment, it's done remarkably well in a short period of time. Things like Tide Coldwater. Now if you look at the entire energy consumption stream involved in washing clothes, there's more consumed in terms of energy to heat water than there is in the process of manufacturing and distributing detergent. So we're going to continue to look at all vectors that enable us to improve our sustainability across the value chain, from a sustainability standpoint, to have products that consumers can choose that enable them to improve their impact on the environment while still delivering against the need or the job to be done. So I don't think anything is required from an acquisition standpoint, but I also don't want you to think that we're not very open-minded in our pursuit of this objective. Because we are. As relates to DTC, this is an area -- I think it's an important that we frame, first of all, direct-to-consumer sales in our product category globally currently represent 0.3% of sales. And it's not a reason -- I'm not saying that to indicate that it's not a potentially important tool for us. I believe it is. And we've been going direct to consumer. Think about SK-II as an example for a period of time. There are opportunities for us to increase our relevance from a selling and brand-building standpoint in a direct-to-consumer context across several of our categories, and we're mobilizing against those. And again, I don't want this to be taken the wrong way, but I don't see a mass move, call it, 20% or 30% of the market, to direct-to-consumer consumption. If you just think about the experience of that, I mean, how many people do you really know that want to satisfy their household products shopping needs in a month or 2 by going to 40 different websites with 40 different passwords and 40 different packages that arrive at 40 different times? Again, I'm not in any way denigrating the opportunity that tool presents us, and we need to fully capitalize on that which we're working to do, but I did want to provide a little bit of context."

I'm going to be relatively brief today. Our results are fairly straightforward, and we're together soon for our Analyst Day when we'll go into much more detail on our progress and plans. Our first quarter results marked a good start to the",2083,"Good morning. I'm going to be relatively brief today. Our results are fairly straightforward, and we're together soon for our Analyst Day when we'll go into much more detail on our progress and plans. 
Our first quarter results marked a good start to the new fiscal, though work and opportunity remain. One of our key priorities has been to accelerate top line growth. Organic sales for the quarter grew 3%. This includes about a 1 point drag from the combination of the rationalization and strengthening work we're doing within the ongoing portfolio and the impact of reduced finished product sales to our Venezuelan subsidiaries. Top line growth was broad-based across categories and across markets. Organic sales growth in the U.S. progressed from 1% in the first half of last fiscal year to 2% in the second half to 3% in the quarter we just completed. Growth in China, minus 8% to minus 2% to plus 2% over those same time periods. 
We've been making sequential progress in each of our largest categories: Baby Care, minus 2%, flat to plus 2%; Grooming, plus 2% to plus 3% to plus 3%; Fabric Care, plus 1%, plus 1% to plus 5%; and Hair Care, minus 1% to flat to plus 2%. 
July-September organic sales grew in each reporting segment and in all 10 product categories. Still, as I said before, work and opportunity remain. Hair Care and Baby Care, 2 of our largest categories, were both up 2%, but below the rates of market growth in these categories. These businesses, along with the Grooming business in the U.S., represent notable opportunities for further top line acceleration. 
Organic sales grew in each region and in 9 of the 10 largest markets. Here, too, opportunities remain. Sales in the U.K., which continues to be a very challenging, highly promotional market, were down 2%. Organic sales in China and Russia were both up 2%, but again below the pace of market growth. 
So in summary, progress with more work to do. Sales growth in the quarter was volume-driven. Organic volume was up 3%. Pricing and mix were each essentially neutral for organic sales growth. All-in sales for the company were in line with the prior year, including the 3-point headwind from foreign exchange. 
As we move forward, progress will not come in a straight line. There will be quarter-to-quarter volatility. Comps will get more difficult. We need to manage significant geopolitical and economic volatility in markets like Egypt, Nigeria, Argentina, even the Philippines. And of course, our competition is not standing still. We still have work remaining in some categories and markets to get our brands back to market levels of growth. These opportunities need to be addressed category by category, market by market, channel by channel. We're after it, but it won't happen overnight. 
Moving to the bottom line. Core earnings per share were $1.03, up 5% versus the prior year. Foreign exchange had a negative 7-point headwind on the first quarter earnings. On a constant-currency basis, core earnings per share were up 12%. Core gross margin increased 50 basis points versus the prior year. On a constant-currency basis, core gross margin was up 130 basis points, including 190 basis points of productivity improvement. 
Commodities were a modest hurt to gross margin in the quarter. Feedstock costs for propylene, ethylene and tropical oils are up as much as mid-teens since we set our initial budgets for the year. Wage inflation is also an increasing challenge in many developing markets. 
Productivity improvements contributed 270 basis points of operating margin benefit. We reinvested a significant portion of those savings in product and packaging innovation, media reach and continuity, sampling, R&D, sales coverage and targeted consumer value adjustments in order to accelerate our top line growth. Core operating margin as a result was up 20 basis points for the quarter. On a constant-currency basis, core operating margin was up 120 basis points. 
The core effective tax rate was 23%, about a point below last year's first quarter level. This includes the adoption of new accounting standards for share-based compensation, which reduced the quarterly tax rate by about 3 points, about $0.04 per share benefit to core earnings per share. The impact on the balance of the quarters this fiscal year from this accounting change is expected to be minimal. The fiscal year impact of this change was assumed in our initial guidance for the year. 
All-in GAAP earnings per share were $0.96 for the quarter, also up 5% versus the prior year. We generated $2.3 billion in free cash flow with 85% free cash flow productivity, returning $2.9 billion to share owners, $1.9 billion in dividends and $1 billion of share repurchase. Our share repurchase flexibility was limited in the first quarter due to trading restrictions related to the Coty transaction. 
The day after the quarter ended, on October 1, we reached a very important milestone in our portfolio transformation program, closing the Beauty transaction with Coty. This marks the completion of the most significant portfolio transformation in P&G's history. We've created value for share owners every step of the way, including over $4 billion versus our keep price in the Beauty deal. 
While we will be supporting transition efforts for some time, we can now begin focusing our efforts on the 10 core categories we identified 2 years ago. The market in each of these 10 core categories is large and is growing between 1% and 7% per year. These are structurally attractive categories, where P&G holds leading market positions. Our businesses in these categories have historically grown sales a point faster than the company and held margins that are 2 points higher than the company average. They leverage P&G core strengths of consumer understanding, innovation, branding and go-to-market and benefit from the company scale. Consumers use these categories on a frequent basis, typically daily. Purchase choice is driven more by product performance against a clear consumer need or job to be done than by self-expression or fashion trends. These categories lend themselves to innovation, which creates noticeable superiority. We'll compete within these categories from the top of the market, building down across middle price tiers that are profitable and growing. We will not compete in the lowest price tiers, which are generally commoditized and where no money is made. We will, however, serve cash-constrained consumers with smaller, more affordable pack sizes requiring less cash outlay per purchase. We're in the midst, as you know, of exiting unprofitable commoditizing price tiers, forms and segments, enabling us to focus our resources on forms and segments that are profitable and growing. Our objective for the new 10-category company is very clear: balanced top and bottom line growth that delivers total shareholder return that places P&G consistently in the top 1/3 of our peer group. 
I spoke earlier about the reacceleration of our top line, and we're going to spend more time on this on Analyst Day. This is critically important. But productivity improvement and cost savings are also a necessity in achieving our TSR objective. They provide fuel for investment and innovation, advertising, sales coverage, trial and sampling to grow our brands and grow our categories and build margin. Top and bottom line growth are not separate endeavors. They reinforce and fuel each other. They're part of the same ecosystem. They live together and depend on each other. They can't be separated. 
Last fiscal year, we completed our first 5-year productivity program -- improvement program, accelerating and exceeding each of our cost savings and enrollment reduction objectives. We saved over $7 billion in cost of goods sold. We've reduced manufacturing enrollment by 22% over the last 4 years. This includes new staffing necessary to support capacity additions. On a same-site basis, manufacturing enrollment was down 27% through last fiscal, with additional progress planned this year. We've reduced the number of manufacturing platforms we produce with by 30% over this same period. Over the last 5 years, we reduced nonmanufacturing roles by nearly 25%. This excludes the impact of divestitures. Including divestitures, we've reduced overhead roles by about 35%. 
As we've decreased the size of the organization, we've also simplified it. We've gone from managing the global business through 50-market cluster organizations to just 25. We simplified our network of suppliers, reducing, for example, commercial agency support from 6,000 vendors to about half of that. Excluding reinvestments in innovation, sales coverage, media and sampling, productivity has enabled us to deliver constant-currency gross and operating margin improvement and high-single to double-digit constant currency core earnings per share growth in each of the last 4 fiscal years. We improved gross and operating margins by triple-digit indices, both including and excluding currency, in fiscal 2016. And we continue the trend in Q1 with double-digit constant currency core earnings per share growth and triple-digit constant currency margin expansion. 
We're driving productivity improvement up and down the income statement and across the balance sheet. Inventory days are down about 10 days over the last 5 years. Payables days are up more than 30 days, enabled significantly by our supply chain financing program. We've made significant progress, and we have significant opportunity. Our strong track record and our line of sight to additional opportunity inform our intent to save as much as another $10 billion in cost over the next 5 years. We expect to reinvest a significant amount of the savings in R&D and product and packaging improvements and sales coverage and a brand awareness at trial-building programs to deliver balanced top and bottom line growth, which brings me to fiscal year guidance. 
We're maintaining our organic sales and core earnings per share outlook for this fiscal year. The first quarter was a good start, but comps get more difficult, and we continue to face a relatively slow-growth, volatile world. We're expecting organic sales growth of around 2% for the year. This includes between 0.5 point and 1 point of headwind from the portfolio rationalization and strengthening work within the ongoing 10 product categories. It also includes a headwind from lost sales to our Venezuelan subsidiaries in the first half of the fiscal year. 
We expect fiscal 2017 all-in sales growth of about 1%, including around a 1 point drag on growth from the net impact of foreign exchange and divestitures. Our bottom line guidance for core earnings per share growth is for core earnings per share growth of mid-single digits. This range reflects the volatility of the markets in which we compete, and it reflects the investments we tend to make in the business to accelerate organic sales growth in a sustainable, long-term, market-constructive and value-accretive way. 
We continue to forecast a reduction in core nonoperating income in fiscal 2017 due to lower gains from minor brand divestitures. The core effective tax rate should be roughly in line with the fiscal 2016 level. All-in GAAP earnings per share should increase 45% to 50%, including the significant onetime gain from the Beauty transaction with Coty that will be recognized in the October-December results. Also included in GAAP earnings per share are approximately $0.10 per share of noncore restructuring charges and $0.13 per share of charges related to early debt retirement that we initiated earlier this month. 
At current rates and prices, FX and commodities combined are about a $0.12 per share headwind to fiscal 2017 earnings. Significant currency weakness, commodity cost increases or additional geopolitical disruptions are not anticipated within this guidance range. We expect adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% or better. Fiscal 2017 will be a year of significant value returned to share owners. We expect to pay over $7 billion in dividends. We reduced outstanding shares by $9.4 billion in the transaction with Coty, and we expect to make over $5 billion of direct share repurchase. In total, about $22 billion in dividend payments, share exchanges and share repurchases this fiscal year. 
We look forward to seeing many of you at our Analyst Day here in Cincinnati on November 17 and 18. David Taylor will lead the session. We'll have nearly all of our top leadership team available to meet with you on the evening of the 17th, with many of them discussing their businesses during the management presentation on the 18th, along with David Taylor and myself. If you can't make it to Cincinnati, we hope you join the webcast of the presentation on the morning of the 18th. 
That concludes our prepared remarks for this morning. I'd be happy to take questions."

And as you say, a fairly straightforward quarter, all things considered. But now we look forward, and I guess my question -- really, the question I've been feeling for the last hour or so is, where do we go from here? I know you don't want to give quarterly guidance, and I don't expect you to. But just given how significantly the year-over-year comps ramp in Q2 and really how significantly the volume comps ramp all the way through Q4, I was hoping you could just help frame for us your expectations for the O&D quarter and really the cadence of organic growth over the balance of the year, fully appreciating you're not in a straight line comments. Because the optimism in me wants to believe that we'll start to see incremental returns on all this investment you've been making the last 9 months. But then the pessimist in me says, ""This Q1 momentum may be short-lived as Q2 kind of rears its head."" So again, I know it's tough to call quarters, especially in this environment, but maybe just put a little more context around how you're measuring returns on the investments you've made so far, where you're seeing the biggest bang for the buck and again, how you're thinking about top line progression over the balance of the year."

I think you said several important things -- or repeated several important things: One is not a straight line; two is increasingly difficult comps. Obviously, we started the year with a 3% and provide guidance for the year at 2%. There will be a quarter or some quarters below 3%. We've also said that we want to exit the fiscal year closer to the rate of market growth in our categories, setting ourselves up for a strong subsequent year, and so that kind of backs you in to the next 2 quarters being the more challenging ones in front of us. That's really as far as I want to go in terms of specific guidance. In terms of return on the investments we're making, I think you see that both from a top line and a bottom line standpoint in the first quarter. I mean, on a constant currency basis, very significant returns with 12% core earnings per share growth on 3% top line. We are reinvesting as we said we would productivity savings. But as we also have said we would, we're going to continue to modestly improve margins, and that is the only recipe for sustained success in this industry. And we're intent on following it and so far, are pleased with the results."

Kathy took over the R&D function a couple of years ago. And usually, when you have leadership changes in R&D, it takes a couple of years to fill the pipeline.

But I know that over the year, we're going to continue to reinvest productivity savings. Those would be more significant as the year progresses. We've also said we want to increase our continuity of marketing spend and trial and sampling building programs. So I don't -- I expect that statement to lead to relatively constant levels of increase across the quarter. But it's honestly a figure by quarter I don't have currently in my head. The second part of your question about the cadence of new product introductions. We have significant programs coming to market in the third quarter and another batch towards the end of the fourth quarter.

In the new 10-category company, where we have leading positions across those categories, we become increasingly dependent on moving markets, on growing markets. There are category country combinations where we have 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% market shares. So one more point of share isn't the margin of victory or defeat. And that doesn't mean that share isn't important. Share is important. But we need to be growing markets, increasing the number of users for our brands. And that's what our activity system is all set up to do. So when you talk about, for example, increasing trial and sampling at point of market entry and point of market change with noticeably superior products, that moves markets over time. And being able to price behind superior innovation also moves markets over time. What doesn't move markets is, for example, leading the march down on promotion spending. If you look at the quarter we just completed, price, inclusive of promotion, was a neutral contributor to the top line. It's been a neutral to positive contributor to the top line for the last 24 quarters, been a positive contributor for many years. I think it's 12 in a row. So that's going to continue to be what we're going to emphasize, which is market-accretive, market-constructive, growth-driving investments. Now having said that, we won't be successful in that endeavor and maintain our shares if we're uncompetitive. And so we will take moves where warranted to ensure that we're offering a competitive value proposition to consumers. We've made several of those moves in the last quarter. What moves happen in the future will be largely dependent on where others take us. But thanks for picking up on that point. It's an important one."

I get the long-term trajectory from a top line perspective hasn't been that great. But just now, it's starting to look a little bit better, again volume being the driver. So how do you think about the balance of investments between innovation and ad spend, sampling and -- versus kind of less-than-peer pricing on the top line? Because the perception we're hearing -- and you heard one of your competitors yesterday say it effectively, the perception you're hearing from them is -- from the other competitors is that it is just starting another price war. I mean, we've heard this from P&G before. It's going to be a pyrrhic victory or at least, a fleeting victory for now. So how do you get comfortable that that's not going to be the case? You can't really control perceptions of competitors, obviously, but the perception is already clearly forming. So how are you sure that's not going to be a pyrrhic or fleeting victory for you guys? And how do you think about the competitors' reaction to you guys clearly being a little bit more aggressive in pushing more volume?"

We do expect -- we compete in a very strong industry with strong competitors, and we expect them to be working just as hard as we are to protect and build their businesses. And that's one of the factors that I cited in terms of guiding to 2% top line growth on the year against the backdrop of a 3% Q1. In terms of ensuring that we're engaged in the activities that best support our brands and businesses, there's really not an aggregate answer to that. Though I'm comfortable in aggregate, that's really a choice that's made in individual categories and countries. And the way I think about this very simplistically is in line with your question. If we grow business by, for example, significantly increasing promotion spending, that will be, I think you're absolutely right, a pyrrhic victory. Why? Two reasons: Number one, nothing proprietary can be matched instantly. That's very different than an investment -- than a successful investment in innovation or equity building or sampling, which can create unique advantage; two, promotion spending, by definition -- almost by definition, is market-dilutive, whereas those other activity streams can be, if executed with excellence, are market-accretive. And that's just a better place for us to be in. So I'm not going to give a formula or an algorithm not because I'm afraid of giving one, but simply because it doesn't exist at an aggregate level. That's not how we manage the company. But the emphasis points, we'll continue to be focused on long-term drivers of market growth and brand growth, long-term drivers of new users to our brands, but short-term competitiveness."

First of all, from a comparison of reported results to track channel trends -- the quarter track channel trends, there are 2 big drivers within that: One of them is simply the amount of business and the relative growth of that business that's moving online versus off-line; and two, nontrack customers like Costco, as an example. So in the U.S., for example, that explains about a point of difference -- a full point of difference between the track channel sales growth numbers and our reported sales growth numbers. In China, that number represents a 5-point reconciliation item between those 2 numbers. So that's becoming increasingly significant. And as you know, the relative growth rates there are very, very different. 30% in one to, call it, 3%, 2% in the other. The other difference that exists in the U.S. track channel reports, as it should, is the inclusion of the Beauty businesses that were transitioned to Coty as of October 1. So any of the share reports or sales growth reports that have come out to date rightly include that business. They won't going forward. And that dynamic in the U.S. explains about 0.5 point of difference between the track channel numbers and the core nondiscontinued business numbers that we're reporting today. And that's about -- well, that's another big part of the equation. There are -- there -- we do have one situation, which I'll make you aware of, that falls kind of into your last bucket, which is timing differences that would affect the different quarterly reporting numbers. And that's in China, where we transitioned our Hong Kong business to a new distributor. And so there's some pipeline fill to that distributor in the numbers on the quarter, call it, 1 to 2 points. Relatively small on a total company basis, but that's -- but a 1 to 2-point impact in China itself. So those are the primary drivers of the differences."

And it's really working together in a joint context to identify where those opportunities are, where today, we're potentially both engaged in activities that are both market- and profit-dilutive to both sides of the partnership and looking for ways to redirect those funds in a way that can be more accretive to both sides of the partnership.

In terms of payout on sampling, I'm glad you asked that question. This is something that is very -- is typically -- if you can sample consumers at point-of-market entry or point-of-market change with noticeably superior products and categories where brand loyalty is relatively higher, the lifetime benefit from that relatively modest investment can be significant. But it is a lifetime benefit. A consumer will take a period of time just to use the product that you've sampled them with. And so that's not an investment endeavor that we typically see immediate returns in. That's why, unfortunately, we got into a practice of reducing that spending because it wasn't producing -- it never produces immediate short-term results. But it's really the area of spending that should be the last that we cut because of its importance in building users for potentially, a lifetime of consumption. So we're happy with our efforts to date, but it's an area of return that we'll be monitoring and measuring for several years to come."

I mentioned sequential Hair Care acceleration that --that's occurred over the last 18 months or so. In the quarter, the -- as you mentioned, Pantene was up mid-single digits.

It's been declining modestly quarter-to-quarter, 6-month period to 6-month period, but I expect we're going to be somewhere in the 3% to 3.5% range overall. In terms of China, we've made some real progress on a couple of important businesses and continue to do reasonably well in some others with some work and the balance still to do. If we look at Oral Care, for example, in China, it was up almost 15% on the quarter. That's driven by continued progress with the Oral-B brush as well as the high-end premium Oral-B paste that we launched a couple of quarters ago. Shave Care, to the point of the question, is a growth in Grooming. That remains up 17% in the quarter in China. Our Personal Care business is doing extremely well in China, as is SK-II, so that the entire Skin and Personal Care business was up about 10% in the quarter. Our biggest business in China, as you know, is our Hair Care business. It's a significant portion of the total. We continue to have 4 of the top leading brands in the market in Head & Shoulders, Rejoice, Pantene and Vidal Sassoon. I think those are, respectively, #1, #2, #4 and #5 in the market. We're essentially flat there versus a year ago. So we do have some -- and part of that is driven by some new entrants into the market. One thing -- but clearly, it continues to be a strong business and offers some upside. The one business where we need to make much more progress is on Baby Care, which was down again double digits on the quarter. We feel very good about portions of our portfolio. Our pant offering, for example, is doing extremely well. We have some new premium tape innovation coming into the market in the next 6 to 9 months, which we're also very excited about. But that is a business that we need to keep working on. In terms of channels in China, we're doing very well in e-commerce, growing ahead of the market, building share in e-commerce. Still not yet to the level of our brick-and-mortar shares, but improving significantly. We've stabilized and started growing shares in the hyper and super part of the business, which is encouraging. We still have some challenges both in the wholesale market and in building distribution in some of the specialty channels that are among the fastest-growing. But as you rightly pointed out, overall, real progress. And as I think about China long term, a significant opportunity on both the top and bottom line for the company."

And so our forecast is predicated really on the equivalent of FX or commodity spot rates, which is just simply the latest data.

So we did build share of about 0.4 points on the past 3 months basis in North America. The most important thing, though, in North America is the improvement in the rate of market growth, going back to our earlier conversations, up 4 points on a past 3-month basis, driven by innovation in the category, which is exactly what we hope to see. Also, growth within that segment is being fueled by our fabric enhancers business. The U.S. is up 7 points versus last year, with the scent beads segment, the one that we're innovating and most significantly growing in the mid-20s, our fabric enhancer share up 1.5 points on a past 3-month basis. We've withstood fairly successfully several competitive dynamics. We don't take that casually, though. But if we can continue being an innovation leader in the market and moving the market, we believe we'll continue to be in a good position. Will the growth rates stay at that level? I would say likely not to that full extent in developed markets, but they'll continue to be attractive. On the other hand, what's implied deductively in those numbers is declines in developing markets. A lot of that is being driven by the portfolio-focusing efforts within Fabric Care getting out of some of the lower-priced tiers, the bars, even powders in some markets. And so that's having an impact on growth from a negative standpoint, which should dissipate as we go forward. And so when you put those 2 things together, I would expect that Fabric Care will continue to be a strong contributor of growth at a total company level."

Where you do see a significant reduction in the market growth rates in the track channel data is in some of the Beauty businesses.

To the extent that foreign exchange headwinds diminish, the pricing activity that we'll be engaging in, in developing markets would, in all likelihood, be lower. At the same time, though, that absence of price increase should lead to stronger volume growth over time. So I wouldn't necessarily look at developing market growth rates as inherently declining, but I think you're absolutely right that the components of that growth should be different. That's relative to price, specifically. Relative to mix, I think you're still going to see some benefit there as major portions of the developing world move up the pricing ladder, the premiumization that we've seen in China, which is the largest developing market, as one example of that. And I expect that will occur in other markets as well as economies stabilize and improve. So in that, I still am relatively bullish on our positions in developing markets and the growth prospects that they bring with them. In terms of market share losses, I mentioned that the categories on a global aggregate base is where we're growing behind the market, and one of them is Hair Care. The other is Baby Care. And I also mentioned an opportunity in the U.S. Grooming market. We are on all of those. If you take Hair Care, for example, we're making great progress on Head & Shoulders, up 5 points in the quarter. We're making great progress on Pantene, up 5 points in the quarter. We have some issues, though, with some of our smaller brands like Herbal Essences, for an example. And we have a whole new program in every stage coming to market in the second half of the year. I mentioned some of the products work we're doing in Baby Care. And when we get that right, we tend to perform very well. If you look at the U.S., for example, where we do have that right, we're building market share both on Pampers and in aggregate. So as I mentioned, there's opportunity to improve. It's not something that will happen overnight, but it's clearly identified and being aggressively focused on."

You may recall, when we headed into the most recent round of big FX impacts, which was last year, we said that while historically we've been able to regain about 2/3 of the impact through pricing, we didn't feel we were going to be able to do that this time around. And that was driven, in large part, simply by divergence and what was happening to the dollar and what was happening to the functional currencies for some of our significant competitors, namely the euro, the pound and the yen. And those currencies were weakening over that period of time. And so there was less need for competitors who were reporting results on those currencies to price. And as much as anything, that's what you're seeing being reflected in the actuals. We're going to be pragmatic. We're going to offer a good value to consumers, but we're also going to work through every means we have available to us, including cost savings and mix improvement innovation, to maintain attractive structural economic so that growth is worth something in these markets. And that's a different answer in every category, in every market month to month, week to week. So we're going to try to manage that as intelligently as we can. I wouldn't expect at this point -- based on your point on where we sit today, ""Do I expect pricing to be a significant part of the equation the balance of the year?"" I do not. In terms of how people are compensated, we are a U.S.-dollar functional currency company. We pay dividends in dollars. We repurchase shares in dollars. And our investor base, as you well know, really doesn't care how many rubles we have or pesos we have. What they care about is how many dollars we have. And so the primary compensation lens is through all-in performance on dollar terms. We do, though, also have a look, because we don't want to incent behavior that's too short term-oriented, at constant currency. But over periods of time, we're going to measure our success or failure based on earnings per share and earnings growth and importantly, cash growth in dollars."

One is direct-to-consumer and the second is, I don't know, green or environmentally sound or sustainable, whatever you like to call it. Are you happy or satisfied overall with kind of the progress that the company is making here? And I know you have programs like Gillette Shave Club and products like Tide purclean. Is this kind of something that you can accomplish internally, be it internal focus, organic focus? Or do you think you need to supplement or look to accelerate it with M&A as well?"

Let me address green and sustainable first. While we're open to both inorganic and organic ways of increasing our product superiority and the sustainability of our products, and that's an important end, it hasn't been our experience that there's a lot available on the market that delivers that end, which something like Tide purclean definitely delivers. We've been on this for a while, while Tide purclean is new and is doing very well. If you look at share of the segment, it's done remarkably well in a short period of time. Things like Tide Coldwater. Now if you look at the entire energy consumption stream involved in washing clothes, there's more consumed in terms of energy to heat water than there is in the process of manufacturing and distributing detergent. So we're going to continue to look at all vectors that enable us to improve our sustainability across the value chain from a sustainability standpoint to have products that consumers can choose that enable them to improve their impact on the environment while still delivering against the need or the job to be done. So I don't think anything is required from an acquisition standpoint, but I also don't want you to think that we're not very open-minded in our pursuit of this objective because we are. As it relates to DTC, this is an area -- I think it's important that we frame, first of all. Direct-to-consumer sales in our product category globally currently represent 0.3% of sales. And it's not a reason -- I'm not saying that to indicate that it's not a potentially important tool for us. I believe it is. And we've been going direct to consumer, think about SK-II as an example, for a period of time. There are opportunities for us to increase our relevance from a selling and brand-building standpoint in a direct-to-consumer context across several of our categories, and we're mobilizing against those. And again, I don't want this to be taken the wrong way, but I don't see a mass move, call it, 20% or 30% of the market, to direct-to-consumer consumption. If you just think about the experience of that, I mean, how many people do you really know that want to satisfy their household products shopping needs in a month or 2 by going to 40 different websites with 40 different passwords and 40 different packages that arrive at 40 different times? Again, I'm not in any way denigrating the opportunity that, that tool presents us, and we need to fully capitalize on that, which we're working to do. But I did want to provide just a little bit of context."

I'm going to be relatively brief today. Our results are fairly straightforward, and we're together soon for our Analyst Day when we'll go into much more detail on our progress and plans. Our first quarter results marked a good start to the",2083,"Good morning. I'm going to be relatively brief today. Our results are fairly straightforward, and we're together soon for our Analyst Day when we'll go into much more detail on our progress and plans. 
Our first quarter results marked a good start to the new fiscal, though work and opportunity remain. One of our key priorities has been to accelerate top line growth. Organic sales for the quarter grew 3%. This includes about a 1 point drag from the combination of the rationalization and strengthening work we're doing within the ongoing portfolio and the impact of reduced finished product sales to our Venezuelan subsidiaries. Top line growth was broad-based across categories and across markets. Organic sales growth in the U.S. progressed from 1% in the first half of last fiscal year to 2% in the second half to 3% in the quarter we just completed. Growth in China, minus 8% to minus 2% to plus 2% over those same time periods. 
We've been making sequential progress in each of our largest categories: Baby Care, minus 2%, flat to plus 2%; Grooming, plus 2% to plus 3% to plus 3%; Fabric Care, plus 1%, plus 1% to plus 5%; and Hair Care, minus 1% to flat to plus 2%. 
July-September organic sales grew in each reporting segment and in all 10 product categories. Still, as I said before, work and opportunity remain. Hair Care and Baby Care, 2 of our largest categories, were both up 2%, but below the rates of market growth in these categories. These businesses, along with the Grooming business in the U.S., represent notable opportunities for further top line acceleration. 
Organic sales grew in each region and in 9 of the 10 largest markets. Here, too, opportunities remain. Sales in the U.K., which continues to be a very challenging, highly promotional market, were down 2%. Organic sales in China and Russia were both up 2%, but again below the pace of market growth. 
So in summary, progress with more work to do. Sales growth in the quarter was volume-driven. Organic volume was up 3%. Pricing and mix were each essentially neutral for organic sales growth. All-in sales for the company were in line with the prior year, including the 3-point headwind from foreign exchange. 
As we move forward, progress will not come in a straight line. There will be quarter-to-quarter volatility. Comps will get more difficult. We need to manage significant geopolitical and economic volatility in markets like Egypt, Nigeria, Argentina, even the Philippines. And of course, our competition is not standing still. We still have work remaining in some categories and markets to get our brands back to market levels of growth. These opportunities need to be addressed category by category, market by market, channel by channel. We're after it, but it won't happen overnight. 
Moving to the bottom line. Core earnings per share were $1.03, up 5% versus the prior year. Foreign exchange had a negative 7-point headwind on the first quarter earnings. On a constant-currency basis, core earnings per share were up 12%. Core gross margin increased 50 basis points versus the prior year. On a constant-currency basis, core gross margin was up 130 basis points, including 190 basis points of productivity improvement. 
Commodities were a modest hurt to gross margin in the quarter. Feedstock costs for propylene, ethylene and tropical oils are up as much as mid-teens since we set our initial budgets for the year. Wage inflation is also an increasing challenge in many developing markets. 
Productivity improvements contributed 270 basis points of operating margin benefit. We reinvested a significant portion of those savings in product and packaging innovation, media reach and continuity, sampling, R&D, sales coverage and targeted consumer value adjustments in order to accelerate our top line growth. Core operating margin as a result was up 20 basis points for the quarter. On a constant-currency basis, core operating margin was up 120 basis points. 
The core effective tax rate was 23%, about a point below last year's first quarter level. This includes the adoption of new accounting standards for share-based compensation, which reduced the quarterly tax rate by about 3 points, about $0.04 per share benefit to core earnings per share. The impact on the balance of the quarters this fiscal year from this accounting change is expected to be minimal. The fiscal year impact of this change was assumed in our initial guidance for the year. 
All-in GAAP earnings per share were $0.96 for the quarter, also up 5% versus the prior year. We generated $2.3 billion in free cash flow with 85% free cash flow productivity, returning $2.9 billion to share owners, $1.9 billion in dividends and $1 billion in share repurchase. Our share repurchase flexibility was limited in the first quarter due to trading restrictions related to the Coty transaction. 
The day after the quarter ended, on October 1, we reached a very important milestone in our portfolio transformation program, closing the Beauty transaction with Coty. This marks the completion of the most significant portfolio transformation in P&G's history. We've created value for share owners every step of the way, including over $4 billion versus our keep price in the Beauty deal. 
While we will be supporting transition efforts for some time, we can now begin focusing our efforts on the 10 core categories we identified 2 years ago. The market in each of these 10 core categories is large and is growing between 1% and 7% per year. These are structurally attractive categories, where P&G holds leading market positions. Our businesses in these categories have historically grown sales a point faster than the company and held margins that are 2 points higher than the company average. They leverage P&G core strengths of consumer understanding, innovation, branding and go-to-market and benefit from the company's scale. Consumers use these categories on a frequent basis, typically daily. Purchase choice is driven more by product performance against a clear consumer need or job to be done than by self-expression or fashion trends. These categories lend themselves to innovation, which creates noticeable superiority. We'll compete within these categories from the top of the market, building down across middle price tiers that are profitable and growing. We will not compete in the lowest price tiers, which are generally commoditized and where no money is made. We will, however, serve cash-constrained consumers with smaller, more affordable pack sizes requiring less cash outlay per purchase. We're in the midst, as you know, of exiting unprofitable commoditizing price tiers, forms and segments, enabling us to focus our resources on forms and segments that are profitable and growing. Our objective for the new 10-category company is very clear: balanced top and bottom line growth that delivers total shareholder return that places P&G consistently in the top 1/3 of our peer group. 
I spoke earlier about the reacceleration of our top line, and we're going to spend more time on this on Analyst Day. This is critically important. But productivity improvement and cost savings are also a necessity in achieving our TSR objective. They provide fuel for investment and innovation, advertising, sales coverage, trial and sampling to grow our brands and grow our categories and build margin. Top and bottom line growth are not separate endeavors. They reinforce and fuel each other. They're part of the same ecosystem. They live together and depend on each other. They can't be separated. 
Last fiscal year, we completed our first 5-year productivity program -- improvement program, accelerating and exceeding each of our cost savings and enrollment reduction objectives. We saved over $7 billion in cost of goods sold. We've reduced manufacturing enrollment by 22% over the last 4 years. This includes new staffing necessary to support capacity additions. On a same-site basis, manufacturing enrollment was down 27% through last fiscal, with additional progress planned this year. We've reduced the number of manufacturing platforms we produce with by 30% over this same period. Over the last 5 years, we reduced nonmanufacturing roles by nearly 25%. This excludes the impact of divestitures. Including divestitures, we've reduced overhead roles by about 35%. 
As we've decreased the size of the organization, we've also simplified it. We've gone from managing the global business through 50-market cluster organizations to just 25. We simplified our network of suppliers, reducing, for example, commercial agency support from 6,000 vendors to about half of that. Including reinvestments in innovation, sales coverage, media and sampling, productivity has enabled us to deliver constant-currency gross and operating margin improvement and high-single to double-digit constant currency core earnings per share growth in each of the last 4 fiscal years. We improved gross and operating margins by triple-digit indices, both including and excluding currency, in fiscal 2016. And we continue the trend in Q1 with double-digit constant currency core earnings per share growth and triple-digit constant currency margin expansion. 
We're driving productivity improvement up and down the income statement and across the balance sheet. Inventory days are down about 10 days over the last 5 years. Payables days are up more than 30 days, enabled significantly by our supply chain financing program. We've made significant progress, and we have significant opportunity. Our strong track record and our line of sight to additional opportunity inform our intent to save as much as another $10 billion in cost over the next 5 years. We expect to reinvest a significant amount of the savings in R&D and product and packaging improvements and sales coverage and a brand awareness at trial-building programs to deliver balanced top and bottom line growth, which brings me to fiscal year guidance. 
We're maintaining our organic sales and core earnings per share outlook for this fiscal year. The first quarter was a good start, but comps get more difficult, and we continue to face a relatively slow-growth, volatile world. We're expecting organic sales growth of around 2% for the year. This includes between 0.5 point and 1 point of headwind from the portfolio rationalization and strengthening work within the ongoing 10 product categories. It also includes a headwind from lost sales to our Venezuelan subsidiaries in the first half of the fiscal year. 
We expect fiscal 2017 all-in sales growth of about 1%, including around a 1 point drag on growth from the net impact of foreign exchange and divestitures. Our bottom line guidance for core earnings per share growth is for core earnings per share growth of mid-single digits. This range reflects the volatility of the markets in which we compete, and it reflects the investments we tend to make in the business to accelerate organic sales growth in a sustainable, long-term, market-constructive and value-accretive way. 
We continue to forecast a reduction in core nonoperating income in fiscal 2017 due to lower gains from minor brand divestitures. The core effective tax rate should be roughly in line with the fiscal 2016 level. All-in GAAP earnings per share should increase 45% to 50%, including the significant onetime gain from the Beauty transaction with Coty that will be recognized in the October-December results. Also included in GAAP earnings per share are approximately $0.10 per share of noncore restructuring charges and $0.13 per share of charges related to early debt retirement that we initiated earlier this month. 
At current rates and prices, FX and commodities combined are about a $0.12 per share headwind to fiscal 2017 earnings. Significant currency weakness, commodity cost increases or additional geopolitical disruptions are not anticipated within this guidance range. We expect adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% or better. Fiscal 2017 will be a year of significant value returned to share owners. We expect to pay over $7 billion in dividends. We reduced outstanding shares by $9.4 billion in the transaction with Coty, and we expect to make over $5 billion of direct share repurchase. In total, about $22 billion in dividend payments, share exchanges and share repurchases this fiscal year. 
We look forward to seeing many of you at our Analyst Day here in Cincinnati on November 17 and 18. David Taylor will lead this session. We'll have nearly all of our top leadership team available to meet with you on the evening of the 17th, with many of them discussing their businesses during the management presentation on the 18th, along with David Taylor and myself.

And as you say, a fairly straightforward quarter, all things considered. But now we look forward, and I guess my question -- really, the question I've been feeling for the last hour or so is, where do we go from here? I know you don't want to give quarterly guidance, and I don't expect you to. But just given how significantly the year-over-year comps ramp in Q2 and really how significantly the volume comps ramp all the way through Q4, I was hoping you could just help frame for us your expectations for the O&D quarter and really the cadence of organic growth over the balance of the year, fully appreciating your not in a straight line comments. Because the optimism in me wants to believe that we'll start to see incremental returns on all this investment you've been making the last 9 months. But then the pessimist in me says, ""This Q1 momentum may be short-lived as Q2 kind of rears its head."" So again, I know it's tough to call quarters, especially in this environment, but maybe just put a little more context around how you're measuring returns on the investments you've made so far, where you're seeing the biggest bang for the buck and again, how you're thinking about top line progression over the balance of the year."

I think you said several important things -- or repeated several important things: One is not a straight line; two is increasingly difficult comps. Obviously, we start the year with a 3% and provide guidance for the year at 2%. There will be a quarter or some quarters below 3%. We've also said that we want to exit the fiscal year closer to the rate of market growth in our categories, setting ourselves up for a strong subsequent year, and so that kind of backs you in to the next 2 quarters being the more challenging ones in front of us. And that's really as far as I want to go in terms of specific guidance. In terms of return on the investments we're making, I think you see that both from a top line and a bottom line standpoint in the first quarter. I mean, on a constant currency basis, very significant returns with 12% core earnings per share growth on 3% top line. We are reinvesting as we said we would productivity savings. But as we also have said we would, we're going to continue to modestly improve margins, and that is the only recipe for sustained success in this industry. And we're intent on following it and so far, are pleased with the results."

In the new 10-category company, where we have leading positions across those categories, we become increasingly dependent on moving markets, on growing markets. There are category country combinations where we have 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% market shares. So one more point of share isn't the margin of victory or defeat. And that doesn't mean that share isn't important. Share is important. But we need to be growing markets, increasing the number of users for our brands. And that's what our activity system is all set up to do. So when you talk about, for example, increasing trial and sampling at point of market entry and point of market change with noticeably superior products, that moves markets over time. And being able to price behind superior innovation also moves markets over time. What doesn't move markets is, for example, leading the march down on promotion spending. If you look at the quarter we just completed, price, inclusive of promotion, was a neutral contributor to the top line. It's been a neutral to positive contributor to the top line for the last 24 quarters, been a positive contributor for many years. I think it's 12 in a row. So that's going to continue to be what we're going to emphasize, which is market-accretive, market-constructive, growth-driving investments. Now having said that, we won't be successful in that endeavor and maintain our shares if we're uncompetitive. And so we will take moves where warranted to ensure that we're offering a competitive value proposition to consumers. We've made several of those moves in the last quarter. What moves happen in the future will be largely dependent on where others take us. But thanks for picking up on that point. It's an important one."

So how do you think about the balance of investments between innovation and ad spend, sampling and -- versus kind of less-than-peer pricing on the top line? Because the perception we're hearing -- and you heard one of your competitors yesterday say it effectively, the perception you're hearing from them and some of your other competitors is that it is just starting another price war. I mean, we've heard this from P&G before. It's going to be a pyrrhic victory or at least a fleeting victory for now. So how do you get comfortable that, that's not going to be the case? You can't really control perceptions of competitors, obviously, but the perception is already clearly forming. So how are you sure that's not going to be a pyrrhic or fleeting victory for you guys?

And that's one of the factors that I cited in terms of guiding to 2% top line growth on the year against the backdrop of a 3% Q1. In terms of ensuring that we're engaged in the activities that best support our brands and businesses, there's really not an aggregate answer to that. Though I'm comfortable in aggregate, that's really a choice that's made at individual categories and countries. And the way I think about this very simplistically is in line with your question. If we grow business by, for example, significantly increasing promotion spending, that will be, I think you're absolutely right, a pyrrhic victory. Why? Two reasons: Number one, nothing proprietary can be matched instantly. That's very different than an investment -- than a successful investment in innovation or equity building or sampling, which can create unique advantage; two, promotion spending, by definition -- almost by definition, is market-dilutive, whereas those other activity streams can be, if executed with excellence, are market-accretive. And that's just a better place for us to be in. So I'm not going to give a formula or an algorithm not because I'm afraid of giving one, but simply because it doesn't exist at an aggregate level. That's not how we manage the company. But the emphasis points, we'll continue to be focused on long-term drivers of market growth and brand growth, long-term drivers of new users to our brands, but short-term competitiveness."

First of all, from a comparison of reported results to track channel trends -- the reported track channel trends, there are 2 big drivers within that: One of them is simply the amount of business and the relative growth of that business that's moving online versus off-line; and two, nontrack customers like Costco, as an example. So in the U.S., for example, that explains about a point of difference -- a full point of difference between the track channel sales growth numbers and our reported sales growth numbers. In China, that number represents a 5-point reconciliation item between those 2 numbers. So that's becoming increasingly significant. And as you know, the relative growth rates there are very, very different. 30% in one to, call it, 3%, 2% in the other. The other difference that exists in the U.S. track channel reports, as it should, is the inclusion of the Beauty businesses that were transitioned to Coty as of October 1. So any of the share reports or sales growth reports that have come out to date rightly include that business. They won't going forward. And that dynamic in the U.S. explains about 0.5 point of difference between the track channel numbers and the core nondiscontinued business numbers that we're reporting today. And that's about -- well, that's another big part of the equation. There are -- there -- we do have one situation, which I'll make you aware of, that falls kind of into your last bucket, which is timing differences that would affect the different quarterly reporting numbers. And that's in China, where we transitioned our Hong Kong business to a new distributor. And so there's some pipeline fill to that distributor in the numbers on the quarter, call it, 1 to 2 points. Relatively small on a total company basis, but that's -- but a 1 to 2-point impact in China itself. So those are the primary drivers of the differences."

In terms of payout on sampling, I'm glad you asked that question. This is something that is very -- is typically -- if you can sample consumers at point-of-market entry or point-of-market change with noticeably superior products and categories where brand loyalty is relatively higher, the lifetime benefit from that relatively modest investment can be significant. But it is a lifetime benefit. A consumer will take a period of time just to use the product that you've sampled them with. And so that's not an investment endeavor that we typically see immediate returns in. That's why, unfortunately, we got into a practice of reducing that spending because it wasn't producing -- it never produces immediate short-term results. But it's really the area of spending that should be the last that we cut because of its importance in building users for potentially, a lifetime of consumption. So we're happy with our efforts to date, but it's an area of return that we'll be monitoring and measuring for several years to come."

I mentioned sequential Hair Care acceleration that --that's occurred over the last 18 months or so. In the quarter, the -- as you mentioned, Pantene was up mid-single digits. Head & Shoulders was up mid-single digits. SK-II was up strong double digits. Our Personal Care business is doing fairly well. Olay is stabilizing.

In terms of China, we've made some real progress on a couple of important businesses and continue to do reasonably well in some others with some work and the balance still to do. If we look at Oral Care, for example, in China, it was up almost 15% on the quarter. That's driven by continued progress with the Oral-B brush as well as the high-end premium Oral-B paste that we launched a couple of quarters ago. Shave Care, to the point of the question, is a growth in Grooming. That remains up 17% in the quarter in China. Our Personal Care business is doing extremely well in China, as is SK-II, so that the entire Skin and Personal Care business was up about 10% in the quarter. Our biggest business in China, as you know, is our Hair Care business. It's a significant portion of the total. We continue to have 4 of the top leading brands in the market in Head & Shoulders, Rejoice, Pantene and Vidal Sassoon. I think those are, respectively, #1, #2, #4 and #5 in the market. We're essentially flat there versus a year ago. So we do have some -- and part of that's driven by some new entrants into the market. One thing -- but clearly, it continues to be a strong business and offers some upside. The one business where we need to make much more progress is on Baby Care, which was down again double digits on the quarter. We feel very good about portions of our portfolio. Our pant offering, for example, is doing extremely well. We have some new premium tape innovation coming into the market in the next 6 to 9 months, which we're also very excited about. But that is a business that we need to keep working on. In terms of channels in China, we're doing very well in e-commerce, growing ahead of the market, building share in e-commerce. Still not yet to the level of our brick-and-mortar shares, but improving significantly. We've stabilized and started growing shares in the hyper and super part of the business, which is encouraging. We still have some challenges both in the wholesale market and in building distribution in some of the specialty channels that are among the fastest-growing. But as you rightly point out, overall, real progress. And as I think about China long term, a significant opportunity on both the top and bottom line for the company."

The most important thing, though, in North America, is the improvement in the rate of market growth, going back to our earlier conversations, up 4 points on a past 3-month basis, driven by innovation in the category, which is exactly what we hope to see. Also, growth within that segment is being fueled by our fabric enhancers business, the U.S. up 7 points versus last year, with the scent beads segment, the one that we're innovating and most significantly growing in the mid-20s, our fabric enhancer share up 1.5 points on a past 3-month basis. We've withstood fairly successfully several competitive dynamics. We don't take that casually, though. But if we can continue being an innovation leader in the market and moving the market, we believe we'll continue to be in a good position. Will the growth rates stay at that level? I would say likely not to that full extent in developed markets, but they'll continue to be attractive. On the other hand, what's implied deductively in those numbers is declines in developing markets. A lot of that is being driven by the portfolio-focusing efforts within Fabric Care getting out of some of the lower-priced tiers, the bars, even powders in some markets. And so that's having an impact on growth from a negative standpoint, which should dissipate as we go forward.

If I look at, for example, Feminine Care, again, fairly simple -- fairly standard growth rates. Fabric Care, 4.5%, 4.2%, 4.2%. Where you do see a significant reduction in the market growth rates in the track channel data is in some of the Beauty businesses. But I don't have all the data here in front of me, but that is largely driven by the movement of that business online. It's one of the disproportionate growers on e-commerce in China. And in aggregate, we still see relatively healthy market growths. In total, call it, 5% to 6% to 7% without a significant change in that trend over the past 12 months. In terms of input costs, I said in the prepared remarks that the combination of FX and commodities was a $0.12 headwind to earnings per share. About 2/3 of that is coming from commodities."

I'm assuming it's Olay, China and the U.S. and there's a couple of other big things. But if you could just touch on that."

To the extent that foreign exchange headwinds diminish, the pricing activity that we'll be engaging in, in developing markets would, in all likelihood, be lower. At the same time, though, that absence of price increase should lead to stronger volume growth over time. So I wouldn't necessarily look at developing market growth rates as inherently declining, but I think you're absolutely right that the components of that growth should be different. That's relative to price, specifically. Relative to mix, I think you're still going to see some benefit there as major portions of the developing world move up the pricing ladder, the premiumization that we've seen in China, which is the largest developing market, as one example of that. And I expect that will occur in other markets as well as economies stabilize and improve. So in that, I still am relatively bullish on our positions in developing markets and the growth prospects that they bring with them. In terms of market share losses, I mentioned the categories on a global aggregate basis where we're growing behind the market, and one of them is Hair Care. The other is Baby Care. And I also mentioned an opportunity in the U.S. Grooming market. We are on all of those. If you take Hair Care, for example, we're making great progress on Head & Shoulders, up 5 points in the quarter. We're making great progress on Pantene, up 5 points in the quarter. We have some issues, though, with some of our smaller brands like Herbal Essences, for an example. And we have a whole new program and a restage coming to market in the second half of the year. I mentioned some of the products work we're doing in Baby Care. And when we get that right, we tend to perform very well. If you look at the U.S., for example, where we do have that right, we're building market share both on Pampers and in aggregate. So as I mentioned, there's opportunity to improve. It's not something that will happen overnight, but it's clearly identified and being aggressively focused on."

And now we've had 2 quarters in a row where you haven't and absorbed the foreign exchange hit. Now that could just be coincidence or, I guess, it could be an indication of a new direction broadly. But what I'd ask is, first, just could we -- I mean, following to Caroline's question, can we expect -- based on what you know right now of foreign exchange, would pricing be a component of the 2% -- positive pricing be a component of the 2% organic sales target for this year based on what you know right now? And when you think about value, as you mentioned in your remarks, can that include the -- probably the highly likely benefits you'd get from gaining market share right now in developing markets at a time when foreign currency is almost sure to turn around at some point? Is that included in the sort of value equation when you compensate people when you manage these businesses?"

You may recall when we headed into the most recent round of big FX impacts, which was last year, we said that while historically we've been able to regain about 2/3 of the impact through pricing, we didn't feel we were going to be able to do that this time around. And that was driven, in large part, simply by divergence and what was happening to the dollar and what was happening to the functional currencies for some of our significant competitors, namely the euro, the pound and the yen. And those currencies were weakening over that period of time. And so there was less need for competitors who were reporting results on those currencies to price. And as much as anything, that's what you're seeing being reflected in the actuals. We're going to be pragmatic. We're going to offer a good value to consumers, but we're also going to work through every means we have available to us, including cost savings and mix improvement innovation, to maintain attractive structural economics so that growth is worth something in these markets. And that's a different answer in every category, in every market month to month, week to week. So we're going to try to manage that as intelligently as we can. I wouldn't expect at this point -- based on your point on where we sit today, ""Do I expect pricing to be a significant part of the equation the balance of the year?"" I do not. In terms of how people are compensated, we are a U.S.-dollar functional currency company. We pay dividends in dollars. We repurchase shares in dollars. And our investor base, as you well know, really doesn't care how many rubles we have or pesos we have. What they care about is how many dollars we have. And so the primary compensation lens is through all-in performance on dollar terms. We do, though, also have a look, because we don't want to incent behavior that's too short term-oriented, at constant currency. But over periods of time, we're going to measure our success or failure based on earnings per share and earnings growth and importantly, cash growth in dollars."

Let me address green and sustainable first. While we're open to both inorganic and organic ways of increasing our product superiority and the sustainability of our products, and that's an important and, it hasn't been our experience that there's a lot available on the market that delivers that and, which something like Tide purclean definitely delivers. We've been on this for a while, while Tide purclean is new and is doing very well. If you look at share of the segment, it's done remarkably well in a short period of time. Things like Tide Coldwater. Now if you look at the entire energy consumption stream involved in washing clothes, there's more consumed in terms of energy to heat water than there is in the process of manufacturing and distributing detergent. So we're going to continue to look at all vectors that enable us to improve our sustainability across the value chain from a sustainability standpoint to have products that consumers can choose that enable them to improve their impact on the environment while still delivering against the need or the job to be done. So I don't think anything is required from an acquisition standpoint, but I also don't want you to think that we're not very open-minded in our pursuit of this objective because we are. As relates to DTC, this is an area -- I think it's important that we frame, first of all. Direct-to-consumer sales in our product category globally currently represent 0.3% of sales. And it's not a reason -- I'm not saying that to indicate that it's not a potentially important tool for us. I believe it is. And we've been going direct to consumer, think about SK-II as an example, for a period of time. There are opportunities for us to increase our relevance from a selling and brand-building standpoint in a direct-to-consumer context across several of our categories, and we're mobilizing against those. And again, I don't want this to be taken the wrong way, but I don't see a mass move, call it, 20% or 30% of the market, to direct-to-consumer consumption. If you just think about the experience of that, I mean, how many people do you really know that want to satisfy their household products shopping needs in a month or 2 by going to 40 different websites with 40 different passwords and 40 different packages that arrive at 40 different times? Again, I'm not in any way denigrating the opportunity that, that tool presents us, and we need to fully capitalize on that, which we're working to do. But I did want to provide just a little bit of context."

I'm going to be relatively brief today. Our results are fairly straightforward, and we're together soon for our Analyst Day when we'll go into much more detail on our progress and plans. Our first quarter results marked a good start to the",2083,"Good morning. I'm going to be relatively brief today. Our results are fairly straightforward, and we're together soon for our Analyst Day when we'll go into much more detail on our progress and plans. 
Our first quarter results marked a good start to the new fiscal, though work and opportunity remain. One of our key priorities has been to accelerate top line growth. Organic sales for the quarter grew 3%. This includes about a 1 point drag from the combination of the rationalization and strengthening work we're doing within the ongoing portfolio and the impact of reduced finished product sales to our Venezuelan subsidiaries. Top line growth was broad-based across categories and across markets. Organic sales growth in the U.S. progressed from 1% in the first half of last fiscal year to 2% in the second half to 3% in the quarter we just completed. Growth in China, minus 8% to minus 2% to plus 2% over those same time periods. 
We've been making sequential progress in each of our largest categories: Baby Care, minus 2%, flat to plus 2%; Grooming, plus 2% to plus 3% to plus 3%; Fabric Care, plus 1%, plus 1% to plus 5%; and Hair Care, minus 1% to flat to plus 2%. 
July-September organic sales grew in each reporting segment and in all 10 product categories. Still, as I said before, work and opportunity remain. Hair Care and Baby Care, 2 of our largest categories, were both up 2%, but below the rates of market growth in these categories. These businesses, along with the Grooming business in the U.S., represent notable opportunities for further top line acceleration. 
Organic sales grew in each region and in 9 of the 10 largest markets. Here, too, opportunities remain. Sales in the U.K., which continues to be a very challenging, highly promotional market, were down 2%. Organic sales in China and Russia were both up 2%, but again below the pace of market growth. 
So in summary, progress with more work to do. Sales growth in the quarter was volume-driven. Organic volume was up 3%. Pricing and mix were each essentially neutral for organic sales growth. All-in sales for the company were in line with the prior year, including the 3-point headwind from foreign exchange. 
As we move forward, progress will not come in a straight line. There will be quarter-to-quarter volatility. Comps will get more difficult. We need to manage significant geopolitical and economic volatility in markets like Egypt, Nigeria, Argentina, even the Philippines. And of course, our competition is not standing still. We still have work remaining in some categories and markets to get our brands back to market levels of growth. These opportunities need to be addressed category by category, market by market, channel by channel. We're after it, but it won't happen overnight. 
Moving to the bottom line. Core earnings per share were $1.03, up 5% versus the prior year. Foreign exchange had a negative 7-point headwind on the first quarter earnings. On a constant-currency basis, core earnings per share were up 12%. Core gross margin increased 50 basis points versus the prior year. On a constant-currency basis, core gross margin was up 130 basis points, including 190 basis points of productivity improvement. 
Commodities were a modest hurt to gross margin in the quarter. Feedstock costs for propylene, ethylene and tropical oils are up as much as mid-teens since we set our initial budgets for the year. Wage inflation is also an increasing challenge in many developing markets. 
Productivity improvements contributed 270 basis points of operating margin benefit. We reinvested a significant portion of those savings in product and packaging innovation, media reach and continuity, sampling, R&D, sales coverage and targeted consumer value adjustments in order to accelerate our top line growth. Core operating margin as a result was up 20 basis points for the quarter. On a constant-currency basis, core operating margin was up 120 basis points. 
The core effective tax rate was 23%, about a point below last year's first quarter level. This includes the adoption of new accounting standards for share-based compensation, which reduced the quarterly tax rate by about 3 points, about $0.04 per share benefit to core earnings per share. The impact on the balance of the quarters this fiscal year from this accounting change is expected to be minimal. The fiscal year impact of this change was assumed in our initial guidance for the year. 
All-in GAAP earnings per share were $0.96 for the quarter, also up 5% versus the prior year. We generated $2.3 billion in free cash flow with 85% free cash flow productivity, returning $2.9 billion to share owners, $1.9 billion in dividends and $1 billion in share repurchase. Our share repurchase flexibility was limited in the first quarter due to trading restrictions related to the Coty transaction. 
The day after the quarter ended, on October 1, we reached a very important milestone in our portfolio transformation program, closing the Beauty transaction with Coty. This marks the completion of the most significant portfolio transformation in P&G's history. We've created value for share owners every step of the way, including over $4 billion versus our keep price in the Beauty deal. 
While we will be supporting transition efforts for some time, we can now begin focusing our efforts on the 10 core categories we identified 2 years ago. The market in each of these 10 core categories is large and is growing between 1% and 7% per year. These are structurally attractive categories, where P&G holds leading market positions. Our businesses in these categories have historically grown sales a point faster than the company and held margins that are 2 points higher than the company average. They leverage P&G core strengths of consumer understanding, innovation, branding and go-to-market and benefit from the company's scale. Consumers use these categories on a frequent basis, typically daily. Purchase choice is driven more by product performance against a clear consumer need or job to be done than by self-expression or fashion trends. These categories lend themselves to innovation, which creates noticeable superiority. We'll compete within these categories from the top of the market, building down across middle price tiers that are profitable and growing. We will not compete in the lowest price tiers, which are generally commoditized and where no money is made. We will, however, serve cash-constrained consumers with smaller, more affordable pack sizes requiring less cash outlay per purchase. We're in the midst, as you know, of exiting unprofitable commoditizing price tiers, forms and segments, enabling us to focus our resources on forms and segments that are profitable and growing. Our objective for the new 10-category company is very clear: balanced top and bottom line growth that delivers total shareholder return that places P&G consistently in the top 1/3 of our peer group. 
I spoke earlier about the reacceleration of our top line, and we're going to spend more time on this on Analyst Day. This is critically important. But productivity improvement and cost savings are also a necessity in achieving our TSR objective. They provide fuel for investment and innovation, advertising, sales coverage, trial and sampling to grow our brands and grow our categories and build margin. Top and bottom line growth are not separate endeavors. They reinforce and fuel each other. They're part of the same ecosystem. They live together and depend on each other. They can't be separated. 
Last fiscal year, we completed our first 5-year productivity program -- improvement program, accelerating and exceeding each of our cost savings and enrollment reduction objectives. We saved over $7 billion in cost of goods sold. We've reduced manufacturing enrollment by 22% over the last 4 years. This includes new staffing necessary to support capacity additions. On a same-site basis, manufacturing enrollment was down 27% through last fiscal, with additional progress planned this year. We've reduced the number of manufacturing platforms we produce with by 30% over this same period. Over the last 5 years, we reduced nonmanufacturing roles by nearly 25%. This excludes the impact of divestitures. Including divestitures, we've reduced overhead roles by about 35%. 
As we've decreased the size of the organization, we've also simplified it. We've gone from managing the global business through 50-market cluster organizations to just 25. We simplified our network of suppliers, reducing, for example, commercial agency support from 6,000 vendors to about half of that. Including reinvestments in innovation, sales coverage, media and sampling, productivity has enabled us to deliver constant-currency gross and operating margin improvement and high-single to double-digit constant currency core earnings per share growth in each of the last 4 fiscal years. We improved gross and operating margins by triple-digit indices, both including and excluding currency, in fiscal 2016. And we continue the trend in Q1 with double-digit constant currency core earnings per share growth and triple-digit constant currency margin expansion. 
We're driving productivity improvement up and down the income statement and across the balance sheet. Inventory days are down about 10 days over the last 5 years. Payables days are up more than 30 days, enabled significantly by our supply chain financing program. We've made significant progress, and we have significant opportunity. Our strong track record and our line of sight to additional opportunity inform our intent to save as much as another $10 billion in cost over the next 5 years. We expect to reinvest a significant amount of the savings in R&D and product and packaging improvements and sales coverage and a brand awareness at trial-building programs to deliver balanced top and bottom line growth, which brings me to fiscal year guidance. 
We're maintaining our organic sales and core earnings per share outlook for this fiscal year. The first quarter was a good start, but comps get more difficult, and we continue to face a relatively slow-growth, volatile world. We're expecting organic sales growth of around 2% for the year. This includes between 0.5 point and 1 point of headwind from the portfolio rationalization and strengthening work within the ongoing 10 product categories. It also includes a headwind from lost sales to our Venezuelan subsidiaries in the first half of the fiscal year. 
We expect fiscal 2017 all-in sales growth of about 1%, including around a 1 point drag on growth from the net impact of foreign exchange and divestitures. Our bottom line guidance for core earnings per share growth is for core earnings per share growth of mid-single digits. This range reflects the volatility of the markets in which we compete, and it reflects the investments we tend to make in the business to accelerate organic sales growth in a sustainable, long-term, market-constructive and value-accretive way. 
We continue to forecast a reduction in core nonoperating income in fiscal 2017 due to lower gains from minor brand divestitures. The core effective tax rate should be roughly in line with the fiscal 2016 level. All-in GAAP earnings per share should increase 45% to 50%, including the significant onetime gain from the Beauty transaction with Coty that will be recognized in the October-December results. Also included in GAAP earnings per share are approximately $0.10 per share of noncore restructuring charges and $0.13 per share of charges related to early debt retirement that we initiated earlier this month. 
At current rates and prices, FX and commodities combined are about a $0.12 per share headwind to fiscal 2017 earnings. Significant currency weakness, commodity cost increases or additional geopolitical disruptions are not anticipated within this guidance range. We expect adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% or better. Fiscal 2017 will be a year of significant value returned to share owners. We expect to pay over $7 billion in dividends. We reduced outstanding shares by $9.4 billion in the transaction with Coty, and we expect to make over $5 billion of direct share repurchase. In total, about $22 billion in dividend payments, share exchanges and share repurchases this fiscal year. 
We look forward to seeing many of you at our Analyst Day here in Cincinnati on November 17 and 18. David Taylor will lead this session. We'll have nearly all of our top leadership team available to meet with you on the evening of the 17th, with many of them discussing their businesses during the management presentation on the 18th, along with David Taylor and myself.

I know you don't want to give quarterly guidance, and I don't expect you to. But just given how significantly the year-over-year comps ramp in Q2 and really how significantly the volume comps ramp all the way through Q4, I was hoping you could just help frame for us your expectations for the O&D quarter and really the cadence of organic growth over the balance of the year, fully appreciating your not in a straight line comments. Because the optimism in me wants to believe that we'll start to see incremental returns on all this investment you've been making the last 9 months. But then the pessimist in me says, ""This Q1 momentum may be short-lived as Q2 kind of rears its head."" So again, I know it's tough to call quarters, especially in this environment, but maybe just put a little more context around how you're measuring returns on the investments you've made so far, where you're seeing the biggest bang for the buck and again, how you're thinking about top line progression over the balance of the year."

In terms of return on the investments we're making, I think you see that both from a top line and a bottom line standpoint in the first quarter. I mean, on a constant currency basis, very significant returns with 12% core earnings per share growth on 3% top line. We are reinvesting as we said we would productivity savings. But as we also have said we would, we're going to continue to modestly improve margins, and that is the only recipe for sustained success in this industry. And we're intent on following it and so far, are pleased with the results."

In the new 10-category company, where we have leading positions across those categories, we become increasingly dependent on moving markets, on growing markets. There are category country combinations where we have 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% market shares. So one more point of share isn't the margin of victory or defeat. And that doesn't mean that share isn't important. Share is important. But we need to be growing markets, increasing the number of users for our brands. And that's what our activity system is all set up to do. So when you talk about, for example, increasing trial and sampling at point of market entry and point of market change with noticeably superior products, that moves markets over time. And being able to price behind superior innovation also moves markets over time. What doesn't move markets is, for example, leading the march down on promotion spending. If you look at the quarter we just completed, price, inclusive of promotion, was a neutral contributor to the top line. It's been a neutral to positive contributor to the top line for the last 24 quarters, been a positive contributor for many years. I think it's 12 in a row. So that's going to continue to be what we're going to emphasize, which is market-accretive, market-constructive, growth-driving investments. Now having said that, we won't be successful in that endeavor and maintain our shares if we're uncompetitive. And so we will take moves where warranted to ensure that we're offering a competitive value proposition to consumers. We've made several of those moves in the last quarter. What moves happen in the future will be largely dependent on where others take us. But thanks for picking up on that point. It's an important one."

I get the long-term trajectory from a top line perspective hasn't been that great. But just now, it's starting to look a little bit better, again volume being the driver. So how do you think about the balance of investments between innovation and ad spend, sampling and -- versus kind of less-than-peer pricing on the top line? Because the perception we're hearing -- and you heard one of your competitors yesterday say it effectively, the perception you're hearing from them and some of your other competitors is that it is just starting another price war. I mean, we've heard this from P&G before. It's going to be a pyrrhic victory or at least a fleeting victory for now. So how do you get comfortable that, that's not going to be the case? You can't really control perceptions of competitors, obviously, but the perception is already clearly forming. So how are you sure that's not going to be a pyrrhic or fleeting victory for you guys? And how do you think about the competitors' reaction to you guys clearly being a little bit more aggressive in pushing more volume?"

We do expect -- we compete in a very strong industry with strong competitors, and we expect them to be working just as hard as we are to protect and build their businesses. And that's one of the factors that I cited in terms of guiding to 2% top line growth on the year against the backdrop of a 3% Q1. In terms of ensuring that we're engaged in the activities that best support our brands and businesses, there's really not an aggregate answer to that. Though I'm comfortable in aggregate, that's really a choice that's made at individual categories and countries. And the way I think about this very simplistically is in line with your question. If we grow business by, for example, significantly increasing promotion spending, that will be, I think you're absolutely right, a pyrrhic victory. Why? Two reasons: Number one, nothing proprietary can be matched instantly. That's very different than an investment -- than a successful investment in innovation or equity building or sampling, which can create unique advantage; two, promotion spending, by definition -- almost by definition, is market-dilutive, whereas those other activity streams can be, if executed with excellence, are market-accretive. And that's just a better place for us to be in. So I'm not going to give a formula or an algorithm not because I'm afraid of giving one, but simply because it doesn't exist at an aggregate level. That's not how we manage the company. But the emphasis points, we'll continue to be focused on long-term drivers of market growth and brand growth, long-term drivers of new users to our brands, but short-term competitiveness."

First of all, from a comparison of reported results to track channel trends -- the reported track channel trends, there are 2 big drivers within that: One of them is simply the amount of business and the relative growth of that business that's moving online versus off-line; and two, nontrack customers like Costco, as an example. So in the U.S., for example, that explains about a point of difference -- a full point of difference between the track channel sales growth numbers and our reported sales growth numbers. In China, that number represents a 5-point reconciliation item between those 2 numbers. So that's becoming increasingly significant. And as you know, the relative growth rates there are very, very different. 30% in one to, call it, 3%, 2% in the other. The other difference that exists in the U.S. track channel reports, as it should, is the inclusion of the Beauty businesses that were transitioned to Coty as of October 1. So any of the share reports or sales growth reports that have come out to date rightly include that business. They won't going forward. And that dynamic in the U.S. explains about 0.5 point of difference between the track channel numbers and the core nondiscontinued business numbers that we're reporting today. And that's about -- well, that's another big part of the equation. There are -- there -- we do have one situation, which I'll make you aware of, that falls kind of into your last bucket, which is timing differences that would affect the different quarterly reporting numbers. And that's in China, where we transitioned our Hong Kong business to a new distributor. And so there's some pipeline fill to that distributor in the numbers on the quarter, call it, 1 to 2 points. Relatively small on a total company basis, but that's -- but a 1 to 2-point impact in China itself. So those are the primary drivers of the differences."

In terms of payout on sampling, I'm glad you asked that question. This is something that is very -- is typically -- if you can sample consumers at point-of-market entry or point-of-market change with noticeably superior products and categories where brand loyalty is relatively higher, the lifetime benefit from that relatively modest investment can be significant. But it is a lifetime benefit. A consumer will take a period of time just to use the product that you've sampled them with. And so that's not an investment endeavor that we typically see immediate returns in. That's why, unfortunately, we got into a practice of reducing that spending because it wasn't producing -- it never produces immediate short-term results. But it's really the area of spending that should be the last that we cut because of its importance in building users for potentially, a lifetime of consumption. So we're happy with our efforts to date, but it's an area of return that we'll be monitoring and measuring for several years to come."

We continue to have 4 of the top leading brands in the market in Head & Shoulders, Rejoice, Pantene and Vidal Sassoon. I think those are, respectively, #1, #2, #4 and #5 in the market. We're essentially flat there versus a year ago. So we do have some -- and part of that's driven by some new entrants into the market. One thing -- but clearly, it continues to be a strong business and offers some upside. The one business where we need to make much more progress is on Baby Care, which was down again double digits on the quarter. We feel very good about portions of our portfolio. Our pant offering, for example, is doing extremely well. We have some new premium tape innovation coming into the market in the next 6 to 9 months, which we're also very excited about. But that is a business that we need to keep working on. In terms of channels in China, we're doing very well in e-commerce, growing ahead of the market, building share in e-commerce. Still not yet to the level of our brick-and-mortar shares, but improving significantly. We've stabilized and started growing shares in the hyper and super part of the business, which is encouraging. We still have some challenges both in the wholesale market and in building distribution in some of the specialty channels that are among the fastest-growing. But as you rightly point out, overall, real progress. And as I think about China long term, a significant opportunity on both the top and bottom line for the company."

What are the market growth assumptions contemplated in your outlook? And maybe you could separate the comments, Jon, into U.S., other developed markets and then emerging markets. And I ask that in the context we've seen some of your competitors talk about slowing market growth rates, particularly in Latin America. And maybe you could also comment on whether that outlook or those growth rate assumptions have changed over the past few months."

The biggest driver there is sell-through to consumption as well as the base period dynamic, which you rightly cited. There are certain categories where events are at different times and across quarters this year versus last year. But in aggregate, that's not a significant driver of the volume progress that occurred. In terms of the market growth assumptions, split developed and developing, this is kind of like foreign exchange or commodities in that I don't know what the future holds. And so our forecast is predicated really on the equivalent of FX or commodity spot rates, which is just simply the latest data. And the latest data we have past 3 months shows market growth of a little over 1% in developed markets. That's inclusive of Western Europe, Japan, et cetera. And it shows 5% growth in developing markets. Weighted average together, you get close to the 3% and the 3.5% number that I was speaking with Jason about. If you look at the trend of those numbers, and I'm looking at 3 -- sequential 3-month periods, I really don't see a significant difference or a significant trend change across those markets. So point 1s and point 2s, but nothing of significance."

So we did build share of about 0.4 points on a past 3 months basis in North America. The most important thing, though, in North America, is the improvement in the rate of market growth, going back to our earlier conversations, up 4 points on a past 3-month basis, driven by innovation in the category, which is exactly what we hope to see. Also, growth within that segment is being fueled by our fabric enhancers business, the U.S. up 7 points versus last year, with the scent beads segment, the one that we're innovating and most significantly growing in the mid-20s, our fabric enhancer share up 1.5 points on a past 3-month basis. We've withstood fairly successfully several competitive dynamics. We don't take that casually, though. But if we can continue being an innovation leader in the market and moving the market, we believe we'll continue to be in a good position. Will the growth rates stay at that level? I would say likely not to that full extent in developed markets, but they'll continue to be attractive. On the other hand, what's implied deductively in those numbers is declines in developing markets. A lot of that is being driven by the portfolio-focusing efforts within Fabric Care getting out of some of the lower-priced tiers, the bars, even powders in some markets. And so that's having an impact on growth from a negative standpoint, which should dissipate as we go forward. And so when you put those 2 things together, I would expect that Fabric Care will continue to be a strong contributor of growth at a total company level."

If I look at, for example, Feminine Care, again, fairly simple -- fairly standard growth rates. Fabric Care, 4.5%, 4.2%, 4.2%. Where you do see a significant reduction in the market growth rates in the track channel data is in some of the Beauty businesses. But I don't have all the data here in front of me, but that is largely driven by the movement of that business online. It's one of the disproportionate growers on e-commerce in China. And in aggregate, we still see relatively healthy market growths. In total, call it, 5% to 6% to 7% without a significant change in that trend over the past 12 months.

To the extent that foreign exchange headwinds diminish, the pricing activity that we'll be engaging in, in developing markets would, in all likelihood, be lower. At the same time, though, that absence of price increase should lead to stronger volume growth over time. So I wouldn't necessarily look at developing market growth rates as inherently declining, but I think you're absolutely right that the components of that growth should be different. That's relative to price, specifically. Relative to mix, I think you're still going to see some benefit there as major portions of the developing world move up the pricing ladder, the premiumization that we've seen in China, which is the largest developing market, as one example of that. And I expect that will occur in other markets as well as economies stabilize and improve. So in that, I still am relatively bullish on our positions in developing markets and the growth prospects that they bring with them. In terms of market share losses, I mentioned the categories on a global aggregate basis where we're growing behind the market, and one of them is Hair Care. The other is Baby Care. And I also mentioned an opportunity in the U.S. Grooming market. We are on all of those. If you take Hair Care, for example, we're making great progress on Head & Shoulders, up 5 points in the quarter. We're making great progress on Pantene, up 5 points in the quarter. We have some issues, though, with some of our smaller brands like Herbal Essences, for an example. And we have a whole new program and a restage coming to market in the second half of the year. I mentioned some of the products work we're doing in Baby Care. And when we get that right, we tend to perform very well. If you look at the U.S., for example, where we do have that right, we're building market share both on Pampers and in aggregate. So as I mentioned, there's opportunity to improve. It's not something that will happen overnight, but it's clearly identified and being aggressively focused on."

And now we've had 2 quarters in a row where you haven't and absorbed the foreign exchange hit. Now that could just be coincidence or, I guess, it could be an indication of a new direction broadly. But what I'd ask is, first, just could we -- I mean, following to Caroline's question, can we expect -- based on what you know right now of foreign exchange, would pricing be a component of the 2% -- positive pricing be a component of the 2% organic sales target for this year based on what you know right now? And when you think about value, as you mentioned in your remarks, can that include the -- probably the highly likely benefits you'd get from gaining market share right now in developing markets at a time when foreign currency is almost sure to turn around at some point? Is that included in the sort of value equation when you compensate people when you manage these businesses?"

You may recall when we headed into the most recent round of big FX impacts, which was last year, we said that while historically we've been able to regain about 2/3 of the impact through pricing, we didn't feel we were going to be able to do that this time around. And that was driven, in large part, simply by divergence and what was happening to the dollar and what was happening to the functional currencies for some of our significant competitors, namely the euro, the pound and the yen. And those currencies were weakening over that period of time. And so there was less need for competitors who were reporting results on those currencies to price. And as much as anything, that's what you're seeing being reflected in the actuals. We're going to be pragmatic. We're going to offer a good value to consumers, but we're also going to work through every means we have available to us, including cost savings and mix improvement innovation, to maintain attractive structural economics so that growth is worth something in these markets. And that's a different answer in every category, in every market month to month, week to week. So we're going to try to manage that as intelligently as we can. I wouldn't expect at this point -- based on your point on where we sit today, ""Do I expect pricing to be a significant part of the equation the balance of the year?"" I do not. In terms of how people are compensated, we are a U.S.-dollar functional currency company. We pay dividends in dollars. We repurchase shares in dollars. And our investor base, as you well know, really doesn't care how many rubles we have or pesos we have. What they care about is how many dollars we have. And so the primary compensation lens is through all-in performance on dollar terms. We do, though, also have a look, because we don't want to incent behavior that's too short term-oriented, at constant currency. But over periods of time, we're going to measure our success or failure based on earnings per share and earnings growth and importantly, cash growth in dollars."

Let me address green and sustainable first. While we're open to both inorganic and organic ways of increasing our product superiority and the sustainability of our products, and that's an important and, it hasn't been our experience that there's a lot available on the market that delivers that and, which something like Tide purclean definitely delivers. We've been on this for a while, while Tide purclean is new and is doing very well. If you look at share of the segment, it's done remarkably well in a short period of time. Things like Tide Coldwater. Now if you look at the entire energy consumption stream involved in washing clothes, there's more consumed in terms of energy to heat water than there is in the process of manufacturing and distributing detergent. So we're going to continue to look at all vectors that enable us to improve our sustainability across the value chain from a sustainability standpoint to have products that consumers can choose that enable them to improve their impact on the environment while still delivering against the need or the job to be done. So I don't think anything is required from an acquisition standpoint, but I also don't want you to think that we're not very open-minded in our pursuit of this objective because we are. As relates to DTC, this is an area -- I think it's important that we frame, first of all. Direct-to-consumer sales in our product category globally currently represent 0.3% of sales. And it's not a reason -- I'm not saying that to indicate that it's not a potentially important tool for us. I believe it is. And we've been going direct to consumer, think about SK-II as an example, for a period of time. There are opportunities for us to increase our relevance from a selling and brand-building standpoint in a direct-to-consumer context across several of our categories, and we're mobilizing against those. And again, I don't want this to be taken the wrong way, but I don't see a mass move, call it, 20% or 30% of the market, to direct-to-consumer consumption. If you just think about the experience of that, I mean, how many people do you really know that want to satisfy their household products shopping needs in a month or 2 by going to 40 different websites with 40 different passwords and 40 different packages that arrive at 40 different times? Again, I'm not in any way denigrating the opportunity that, that tool presents us, and we need to fully capitalize on that, which we're working to do. But I did want to provide just a little bit of context."
