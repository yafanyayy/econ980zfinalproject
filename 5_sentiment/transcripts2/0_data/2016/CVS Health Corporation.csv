Our fourth quarter results wrapped up a terrific 2015, and during the year, we achieved strong performance across our enterprise and completed key acquisitions that will support our st",1884,"Well, thanks, Nancy. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. Our fourth quarter results wrapped up a terrific 2015, and during the year, we achieved strong performance across our enterprise and completed key acquisitions that will support our strategy for growth in the evolving health care market. We grew our core business with the acquisition of Target's pharmacies and clinics and we expanded our reach with the acquisition of Omnicare, the leader in long-term care pharmacy, and we remain very optimistic that these acquisitions will help drive our long-term growth, and I'll update you shortly on our integration progress. 
Now for the full year 2015, we delivered 10% growth in consolidated revenues, 11% growth in consolidated operating profit and 15% growth in adjusted earnings per share excluding amortization, any acquisition-related items and the legal charge we mentioned in this morning's release. As expected, growth in the fourth quarter was especially strong with revenues increasing 11% and adjusted earnings per share increasing 26.5% to $1.53 right in line with our guidance. We generated approximately $3.1 billion of free cash during the quarter and $6.5 billion for the full year, above the high end of our guidance, and our continued ability to deliver substantial free cash is enabling us to return significant value to our shareholders. 
Now for 2016, we are confirming the guidance we've provided at Analyst Day back in December. As a reminder, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year of $5.73 to $5.88, reflecting year-over-year growth of 11% to 14%. And Dave will review the details for the year and the first quarter in his remarks. 
So let me turn to the business update and start with our very successful 2016 PBM selling season. Gross client with for '16 have increased and they now stand at 14.8 billion with net new business at 12.7 billion. The increase in net new business of about $1.2 billion from our last update largely reflects incremental growth from our new health plan clients as they closed out their enrollment year. While these numbers exclude enrollment results from our SilverScript PDP, and I'll touch on that shortly, and our 2016 retention rate remains at approximately 98%. Now our success is a testament to our unmatched products and services, our strong service and execution along with our competitive pricing. And surveys continue to show that our ability to manage cost is our clients' top priority and this is followed by a variety of additional factors with each of our client channels having different priorities. Our flexibility and expertise in addressing those very priorities has certainly been a key to our success. 
Now with so much new business being transition in January, I'm also very pleased to report that we have had an extremely successful welcome season. We effectively added more than 9 million new members, 9 million new members who generated a significant year-over-year increase in January's claims volume, and clients have given us very positive feedback on our diligence and process and we're pleased with the level of oversight we provided to ensure success. It's also worth noting that in the past 2 welcome seasons combined, we have successfully added nearly 16 million new Caremark lives. 
Looking ahead to 2017, selling season is just underway and we are well positioned competitively for another strong year. Now it's too early to provide a specific update, but our size, scale, service record and unmatched capabilities make us confident that we will continue to be successful in the marketplace. 
Now as we've been discussing top of mind for our clients is their rapidly growing specialty costs, and our specialty pharmacy business offers a comprehensive set of programs to help clients effectively manage specialty trend. As a result, we continue to outpace the market and gain share. In the fourth quarter, specialty revenues increased 32% and continued to outpace market growth rates. Our Medicare Part D business has risen to a leadership position. We had a successful 2016 annual enrollment period. Consistent with our expectations, we added approximately 0.5 million net lives and began the '16 plan year with more than 5 million captive PDP lives and that includes EGWPs. Now when you add in the Med D lives that we manage for our health plan clients, the non-captive lives, our total rise is to 11.3 million Med D lives under management and that's up 41% from the prior year. Furthermore, our enterprise clinical capabilities, combined with our strong operational execution, enable us to drive Med D Star ratings, not only for our own SilverScript PDP, but also for our health plan clients Med D offerings. In fact, SilverScript was the largest PDP to achieve a 4-star rating and 73% of our clients lives are now enrolled in a high-performing plan for the 2016 year. 
Now turning to our retail long-term care segment, and I'll start with an update on the integrations, on the care target, which are well underway. In the fourth quarter, Omnicare performed well and in line with our expectations as we began to realize some of the anticipated synergies. As we detailed at Analyst Day, there are multiple opportunities for driving enterprise value from Omnicare in both the near and long term. In the first half of this year, we expect to achieve the benefits of purchasing synergies, and by the end of the year, we will phase in technology to support high-quality customer surveys and leverage best practices across the organization. We're combining operational infrastructures and developing programs to improve work streams and enhance delivery service, and we expect to complete the vast majority of the Omnicare integration activities by year end. 
Now opportunities are also being pursued across the continuum of care that will drive long-term enterprise value. For example, we are developing an enhanced offering for skilled nursing that's driven by improving coordination during care transitions, which should lead to better outcomes for patients, providers and payers. We're also developing segmented assisted living offerings to better align with residents' varying needs and to better target the rapidly growing independent living market. We have a consumer-driven effort underway that utilizes existing CVS pharmacy capabilities including the on-site delivery of health care services. So we expect to generate revenue synergies focused on the transitions of care, market adjacencies and differentiated offerings, and these should begin to be realized in the second half of this year and grow in future periods, and we remain very excited about the opportunities created by this combination along with our enhanced ability to serve seniors across their continuum of care. 
Now as for the Target pharmacy and clinic acquisition, our highly detailed integration plan is complete. The integration activities are underway and we have already successfully converted a handful of pilot stores. As a result, the conversions will begin to ramp up throughout this quarter and next, and we expect to complete all store conversions by the end of summer. Now as we complete each store conversion, and it's rebranded as CVS Pharmacy, at that point, we'll launch our additional core offerings, core pharmacy offerings, to include Specialty Connect, ExtraCare pharmacy rewards along with our digital tools, and that's in addition to Maintenance Choice that was available upon the transaction close. We'll begin adding marketing elements as geographies convert, all with the goal of converting Target guests who currently don't use the pharmacy. 
Now moving on to the fourth quarter results in the retail business. Pharmacy same-store sales increased 5%. This was negatively impacted by approximately 470 basis points due to recent generic introductions. Pharmacy same-store prescription volumes increased 5% on a 30-day equivalent basis, outperforming overall market growth. And our retail pharmacy market share, again on a 30-day equivalent basis, was 21.8% in Q4, and that's up about 65 basis points versus the same quarter a year ago. 
For the full year 2015, CVS Pharmacy's Med D share increased 35 basis points versus '14 and we continue to gain share in this growing market while maintaining a disciplined approach to evaluating participation in preferred Med D networks. And we expect to maintain our market share position in 2016 helped by our preferred physicians in a variety of national and regional plans. So overall, our pharmacy business remains quite strong and continues to gain share. 
Our digital team has been working to create a connected health experience that makes it easier to save time and money and to stay healthy by connecting patients to our unique assets when, where and how they want. To date, we've seen 12.7 million downloads of the CVS Pharmacy app, 18 million members enrolled in text messaging driving adherence and more than the 300 million text messages sent by CVS Pharmacy this past year, enhancing the patient experience. So we continue to focus on driving member adoption of our highly related apps. 
In the front store business, comps were down slightly, 0.5% in the quarter, and reflected softer customer traffic partially offset by an increase in basket size. However, front store margins increased notably in the quarter, benefiting from efforts to. Rationalize our promotional strategies along with growth in the higher-margin health and beauty businesses. ExtraCare continues its commitment to reward our loyal customers with savings through weekly ads and personalized offers as well as extra bucks rewards. And in 2015, this generated about $4 billion in savings for our loyal customers. So we continue to see ExtraCare as a source of growth as we leverage customer data to create even more relevant and personalized communications. 
Our Store Brand penetration was 22% in the quarter. That was down slightly from the prior year, and for the full year, Store Brand penetration was 21.3% and that's up about 75 basis points. In 2015, we gained within the drug channel about 140 basis points of share in overall brand sales and about 60 basis points of share in Store Brand health care. And there remained significant opportunities to expand our share of Store Brand products by building on core equities in health and beauty and seeking opportunistic growth in other areas where we can link new products to our customers' path to better health. 
Turning to our store base. We ended the year with about 9,600 retail pharmacies, and for the full year 2015, we opened 130 net new stores, equating to an increase in retail square footage of 2.2%. And when you add in the acquired Target pharmacies, our retail square footage growth for the year comes to 3.1%. In the fourth quarter, in addition to the acquired pharmacies, we opened 53 new stores, relocated 19, closed 14, resulting in 39 net new stores. We also continued to grow the number of clinics. MinuteClinic is the largest walk-in clinic operator in the country. And in the fourth quarter, we opened 36 new clinics in addition to the 79 acquired clinics in Target, ending the year with 1,135 clinics across 33 states plus the District of Columbia. Now excluding the Target clinics, MinuteClinic revenues increased 4.4% in the quarter. That's below our usual trend due to the mild cold flu season versus the year ago, however, we achieved our full year 2015 revenue target of about $340 million -- $345 million. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Dave for the financial review."
93625,323673611,928884,"CVS Health Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2016",2016-02-09,"Earnings Calls","CVS Health Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will provide a detailed review of our 2015 fourth quarter results and briefly touch upon our 2016 guidance, which remains unchanged from what we outlined in December at our Analyst Day. First,",1586,"Thank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will provide a detailed review of our 2015 fourth quarter results and briefly touch upon our 2016 guidance, which remains unchanged from what we outlined in December at our Analyst Day. First, I'll start with a summary of last year's capital allocation program, which should clearly demonstrate how we're continuing to use our strong free cash flow to return value to our shareholders through both dividends as well as share repurchases. I'm pleased to say that we continue to drive steady improvement in our dividend payout ratio. Recall that back in 2010 that our payout ratio was approximately 14%. We finished 2015 with a payout ratio of 30.1%, more than double 2010's level and 240 basis points higher than 2014 on a comparable basis. We paid approximately $1.6 billion in dividends in '15 and $391 million in the fourth quarter alone. Our strong earnings outlook this year, combined with a 21% increase in a dividend that we announced at our Analyst Day, keeps us well on track to achieve our targeted payout ratio of 35% by 2018. 
Along with the significant increases in our dividend, we have continued to repurchase our shares. For all of 2015, we repurchased approximately 48 million shares for about $5 billion, averaging $101.23 per share. In the fourth quarter alone, we repurchased approximately 10.2 million shares for $1.1 billion. Now if you look back over the past 3 years, we have purchased -- we purchased approximately 166 million shares for about $13 billion at an average price of $78.37 per share. For the year 2015, between dividends and share repurchases, we've returned a very significant $6.6 billion to our shareholders. Now looking forward we have nearly $7.7 billion left in repurchased authorizations and we continue to expect to repurchase $4 billion this year. Our expectation is that we're going we'd return more than $5 billion to our shareholders in '16 through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. 
We've generated $3.1 billion of free cash in the fourth quarter. In all of 2015, we've generated approximately $6.5 billion of free cash, which exceeded the high end of our guidance by about $200 million but was essentially flat year-over-year. The outperformance was driven by client collections. At the same time, we improved our cash cycle by approximately 2 days, thanks to continued improvements in payables management that were partially offset by growth in receivables. We remain committed to further improvements in working capital as we move forward. For the year, our net capital expenditures were approximately $2 billion. This included $2.4 billion of gross CapEx offset by about $410 million in sale-leaseback proceeds as well as capital spend associated with the acquisitions. 
As for the income statement, adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.53 per share at the midpoint of our guidance, up 26.5% over LY. As you can see in our press release, in 2015, this excludes amortization, the impact of transaction and integration costs related to the Omnicare and Target acquisitions as well as a $90 million legal charge. The charge is related to a legacy lawsuit challenging the 1999 settlement by MedPartners of various security class actions and related derivative claim. For those of you who may not be familiar, MedPartners was the former parent company to Caremark, so this issue goes back a long time. The growth rate also excludes the loss on early establishment of debt that we recorded in 2014. GAAP diluted EPS was $1.34 per share. Results across our operating segments were strong as expected. 
And with that, let me quickly walk down the P&L. On a consolidated basis, revenues in the fourth quarter increased 11% to $41.1 billion. In the PBM segment, net revenues increased 11.1% to $26.5 billion. This growth was attributable to specialty pharmacy as well as increased volume in pharmacy network claims. Overall, PBM adjusted claims grew 6.4% in the quarter. Partially offsetting sales growth was 165 basis point increase in our generic dispensing rate to 83.7%. In our retail long-term care business, revenues increased 12.5% in the quarter to $19.9 billion, driven primarily by strong pharmacy same-store sales growth as well as the addition of the Omnicare business. Retail long-term care exceeded our revenue guidance primarily due to the addition of the Target assets a couple of weeks earlier than planned as well as lower generic dispensing rate than expected. During the quarter, GDR increased by approximately 155 basis points to 84%. 
Turning to gross margin. We reported 17.7% for the consolidated company in the quarter, a contraction of approximately 50 -- 15 basis points compared to Q4 '14 and again consistent with our expectations. Within the PBM segment, gross margins improved approximately 45 basis points versus Q4 '14 to 5.6%, while gross profit dollars increased 20.5% year-over-year. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to increases in volumes, the improvement in GDR and favorable rebate and purchasing economics. Partially offsetting these drivers was the impact of client and drug mix as well as continued price compression. The improvement in gross margin rate in the PBM was primarily due to the timing of Medicare Part D profits. 
Now gross margins in the retail long-term care segment was 30.2%, down 125 basis points from LY. The decline was primarily driven by continued pressure on reimbursement rates and, to a lesser degree, the addition of the Omnicare business must carry the lower margin than retail. Partially offsetting these were the increased -- were the increases in GDR and a strong front store margin improvement, aided by continued rationalization of our promotional strategies and improved product mix. Gross profit dollars increased 8% throughout the quarter. 
Turning to operating expenses, operating profit and the tax rate. The numbers that I'm citing exclude acquisition-related costs and the legal charge where applicable. Total operating expenses as a percentage of revenues notably improved from Q4 '14 to 10.7%. The PBM segment's SG&A rate improved 10 basis points to 1.3%, and SG&A as a percent of sales in the retail long-term care segment improved significantly by 190 basis points to 19.4%. This was driven by lower advertising cost due to last year's rebranding campaign following our tobacco exit, lower legal cost and the addition of the Omnicare business which carries lower SG&A relative to sales. Within the Corporate segment. SG&As were up approximately $10 million to $215 million within our expectations. 
Operating margin for the total enterprise improved approximately 75 basis points in the quarter to 7%. Operating margin in the PBM improved by approximately 55 basis points to 4.3%, while operating margin at retail long-term care segment improved approximately 65 basis points to 10.7% on our adjusted basis. For the quarter, operating profit growth in each segment was in line with expectations with the PBM increasing a very solid 26.8% and the retail long-term care segment growing 19.8%, again on an adjusted basis. 
Going below the line on the consolidated income statement. Net interest expense from the quarter increased approximately $145 million from LY to $276 million due primarily to the debt associated with the acquisitions that we took on last year. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 38.9% and our weighted average share count was 1.1 billion shares. For the year, our effective tax rate was 39.1%, just slightly lower than expected. 
So with that, now let me touch on our 2016 guidance, which again remains essentially unchanged from Analyst Day. You can find the details in the slide presentation that we posted on our website, but I'll focus on the highlights here. In 2016, we continue to expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share, which excludes amortization, in the range of $5.73 to $5.88, reflecting very healthy year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is still expected to be in the range of $5.28 to $5.43. Keep in mind that we have not included any estimate of integration costs from Omnicare nor Target in either range. We'll, of course, report those as we progress throughout the year, but they are excluded from our guidance. We expect consolidated net revenue growth of 17% to 18.5%, reflecting solid growth across the enterprise. And we expect consolidated operating profit margin to decline by 40 to 50 basis points. 
The first quarter guidance also remains unchanged. We expect consolidated net revenue growth of 17% to 18.5%. And as you may recall, we highlighted several timing factors at Analyst Day that affect the cadence of profit delivery throughout the year. And while 2016 is expected to be a strong year, the cadence of profit growth is expected to be significantly back-half-weighted. We expect adjusted earnings per share, which excludes amortization, to be in the range of $1.14 to $1.17, while GAAP diluted EPS from continuing ops is expected to be in the range of $1.03 to $1.06 in the first quarter. Additionally, our free cash flow guidance for the year, which includes acquisition-related activities, remains in the range of $5.3 billion to $5.6 billion. 
In closing, I want to say that I'm very pleased with the company's significant cash flow generation capabilities. I believe these capabilities will continue to play an important role in driving shareholder value over the long term. To that point, 2016 will be another year where we demonstrate our ongoing commitment to returning value to our shareholders through both share buybacks as well as through the increase in our dividend. 
And with that, I'll now turn it back over to Larry."

And I think as we've been talking for quite a while now, those opportunities will really manifest themselves across our retail business. So I think we don't expect to begin to come online until the second half of the year. And I think, Lisa, it's a similar story with Target. We've got a lot of heavy lifting to do. When you think about the store and system conversions, 1,700 of those. At the same time, we've had a lot of practice with that. And as I mentioned in the remarks, the pilot stores have gone extremely well. So we are now in rollout mode and it'll take the better part of the next 6, 7 months to complete those activities. So that's really when you'll begin to see the marketing efforts ramp up. So the benefits that we'll see from beginning, again, I think that's going to be more of a second half impact."

So clients have never been more open to adopting client designs to control these costs. And I really think about that in 3 primary buckets. First is channel. So the ability to adopt our Maintenance Choice programs, which we're now up over 23 million members participating in that program, and network solutions, preferred network solutions for Medicare, as an example, and narrowing the network in commercial and Managed Medicaid. So continue to see lots of interest in those plans' designs and also lots of interest with formulary plan designs, and we offer options from excluding formulary from our template clients. We introduced that back in 2012 all the way to much more aggressive formularies where we essentially take most of the brands off the formulary that really is the most effective tool we have to managing trend because it gets rid of the branded inflation. And then the third primary buckets is really all the solutions we have in specialty from exclusive specialty to site of care to aggressive formulary solutions and specialty. So we do continue to see a lot of interest. We see employers able to make decisions faster and adopting these plan designs. We do see health plans much more interested than they've ever been in these plan designs but their adoption rate is slower. They may have to sell these plan designs into their downstream clients. And as you recall, as our clients adopt these plan designs and we lower their costs, we generally see more share movement to our channel. So [indiscernible] clearly is a win-win."

And now a specialty patient can walk in to any one of our 9,600 retail pharmacies and get the same high levels of service because we integrated them into our back-end specialty platform. It's the same high level of service. We see similar adherence. So it's been favorably received by specialty patients. And we know that is it acts very similarly to Maintenance Choice. We see half of the patients want to pick up their specialty prescription at their local CVS that are using Specialty Connect and the other half want it mailed at their home. So it really opens up convenience for our clients where we are the exclusive specialty provider. It enhances service. It's enhancing revenue from the open market where we're competing with other specialty pharmacies, so positions that are much more active in referring patients in the specialty space than in the nonspecialty space like the capabilities and the service that we deliver. So we think it's a real competitive advantage in the marketplace."

Secondly we have several initiatives underway both as we look at the acquisitions but, more importantly, as we look at different efforts that we have across our business, meaning those initiatives delivered benefit back half versus the first half.

I think as you look at the remaining states, they'll be -- it's our understanding that states will have 12 months with which to implement some type of acquisition reimburse -- acquisition cost reimbursement model and along with corresponding changes in dispensing fees. So I think as we sit here today, we think, we believe that the rollout across the rest of the country with this will be immaterial to our results.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Our fourth quarter results wrapped up a terrific 2015. And during the year, we achieved strong performance across our enterprise and completed key acquisitions that will support our strategy for growth in the evolving health care market. 
We grew our core business with the acquisition of Target's pharmacies and clinics, and we expanded our reach with the acquisition of Omnicare, the leader in long-term care pharmacy, and we remain very optimistic that these acquisitions will help drive our long-term growth. And I'll update you shortly on our integration progress. 
Now, for the full year 2015, we delivered 10% growth in consolidated revenues; 11% growth in consolidated operating profit; and 15% growth in adjusted earnings per share, excluding amortization, any acquisition-related items and the legal charge we mentioned in this morning's release. 
As expected, growth in the fourth quarter was especially strong with revenues increasing 11% and adjusted earnings per share increasing 26.5% to $1.53 right in line with our guidance. We generated approximately $3.1 billion of free cash during the quarter and $6.5 billion for the full year, above the high end of our guidance, and our continued ability to deliver substantial free cash is enabling us to return significant value to our shareholders. 
Now, for 2016, we are confirming the guidance we've provided at Analyst Day back in December. As a reminder, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year of $5.73 to $5.88, reflecting year-over-year growth of 11% to 14%. And Dave will review the details for the year and the first quarter in his remarks. 
So let me turn to the business update and start with our very successful 2016 PBM selling season. Gross client wins for '16 have increased, and they now stand at $14.8 billion with net new business at $12.7 billion. The increase in net new business of about $1.2 billion from our last update largely reflects incremental growth from our new health plan clients as they closed out their enrollment year. 
These numbers exclude enrollment results from our SilverScript PDP, and I'll touch on that shortly. And our 2016 retention rate remains at approximately 98%. Now, our success is a testament to our unmatched products and services, our strong service and execution, along with our competitive pricing. And surveys continue to show that our ability to manage cost is our client's top priority and this is followed by a variety of additional factors with each of our client channels having different priorities. Our flexibility and expertise in addressing those varying priorities has certainly been a key to our success. 
Now, with so much new business being transitioned in January, I'm also very pleased to report that we have had an extremely successful welcome season. We effectively added more than 9 million new members, 9 million new members, who generated a significant year-over-year increase in January's claims volume, and clients have given us very positive feedback on our diligence and process and we're pleased with the level of oversight we provided to ensure success. It's also worth noting that in the past 2 welcome seasons combined, we have successfully added nearly 16 million new Caremark lives. 
Looking ahead, the 2017 selling season is just underway and we are well positioned competitively for another strong year. Now, it's too early to provide a specific update, but our size, scale, service record and unmatched capabilities make us confident that we will continue to be successful in the marketplace. 
Now, as we've been discussing top of mind for our clients is their rapidly growing specialty costs, and our specialty pharmacy business offers a comprehensive set of programs to help clients effectively manage specialty trend. As a result, we continue to outpace the market and gain share. In the fourth quarter, specialty revenues increased 32% and continued to outpace market growth rates. 
Our Medicare Part D business has risen to a leadership position. We had a successful 2016 annual enrollment period. Consistent with our expectations, we added approximately 0.5 million net lives and began the '16 plan year with more than 5 million captive PDP lives and that includes EGWPs. 
Now, when you add in the Med D lives that we manage for our health plan clients, the non-captive lives, our total rises to 11.3 million Med D lives under management, and that's up 41% from the prior year. Furthermore, our enterprise clinical capabilities, combined with our strong operational execution, enable us to drive Med D Star ratings, not only for our own SilverScript PDP, but also for our health plan clients Med D offerings. 
In fact, SilverScript was the largest PDP to achieve a 4-star rating, and 73% of our clients' lives are now enrolled in a high-performing plan for the 2016 year. 
Now, turning to our Retail/Long-Term Care segment. And I'll start with an update on the integrations, Omnicare and Target, which are well underway. In the fourth quarter, Omnicare performed well and in line with our expectations as we began to realize some of the anticipated synergies. 
As we detailed at Analyst Day, there are multiple opportunities for driving enterprise value from Omnicare in both the near and long term. In the first half of this year, we expect to achieve the benefits of purchasing synergies. And by the end of the year, we will phase in technology to support high-quality customer service and leverage best practices across the organization. 
We are combining operational infrastructures and developing programs to improve work streams and enhance delivery service, and we expect to complete the vast majority of the Omnicare integration activities by year-end. 
Now, opportunities are also being pursued across the continuum of care that will drive long-term enterprise value. For example, we are developing an enhanced offering for skilled nursing that's driven by improving coordination during care transitions, which should lead to better outcomes for patients, providers and payers. We're also developing segmented assisted living offerings to better align with residents' varying needs. 
And to better target the rapidly growing independent living market, we have a consumer-driven effort underway that utilizes existing CVS pharmacy capabilities, including the on-site delivery of health care services. So we expect to generate revenue synergies focused on the transitions of care, market adjacencies and differentiated offerings, and these should begin to be realized in the second half of this year and grow in future periods. And we remain very excited about the opportunities created by this combination, along with our enhanced ability to serve seniors across their continuum of care. 
Now, as for the Target pharmacy and clinic acquisition, our highly detailed integration plan is complete. The integration activities are underway, and we have already successfully converted a handful of pilot stores. 
As a result, the conversions will begin to ramp up throughout this quarter and next, and we expect to complete all store conversions by the end of summer. Now, as we complete each store conversion, and it's rebranded as CVS Pharmacy, at that point, we'll launch our additional core offerings -- core pharmacy offerings to include Specialty Connect, ExtraCare Pharmacy Rewards, along with our digital tools. And that's in addition to Maintenance Choice that was available upon the transaction close. We'll begin adding marketing elements as geographies convert, all with the goal of converting Target guests, who currently don't use the pharmacy. 
Now, moving on to the fourth quarter results in the retail business. Pharmacy same-store sales increased 5%. This was negatively impacted by approximately 470 basis points due to recent generic introductions. Pharmacy same-store prescription volumes increased 5% on a 30-day equivalent basis, outperforming overall market growth. And our retail pharmacy market share, again, on a 30-day equivalent basis, was 21.8% in Q4. And that's up about 65 basis points versus the same quarter a year ago. 
For the full year 2015, CVS Pharmacy's Med D share increased 35 basis points versus '14, and we continue to gain share in this growing market, while maintaining a disciplined approach to evaluating participation in preferred Med D networks. And we expect to maintain our market share position in 2016 helped by our preferred physicians in a variety of national and regional plans. So overall, our pharmacy business remains quite strong and continues to gain share. 
Our digital team has been working to create a connected health experience that makes it easier to save time and money and to stay healthy by connecting patients to our unique assets when, where and how they want. To date, we've seen 12.7 million downloads of the CVS Pharmacy app; 18 million members enrolled in text messaging, driving adherence; and more than the 300 million text messages sent by CVS Pharmacy this past year enhancing the patient experience. So we continue to focus on driving member adoption of our highly-related apps. 
In the front store business, comps were down slightly, 0.5% in the quarter, and reflected softer customer traffic partially offset by an increase in basket size. However, front store margins increased notably in the quarter, benefiting from efforts to rationalize our promotional strategies, along with growth in the higher-margin health and beauty businesses. 
ExtraCare continues its commitment to reward our loyal customers with savings through weekly ads and personalized offers as well as Extrabucks Rewards. And in 2015, this generated about $4 billion in savings for our loyal customers. So we continue to see ExtraCare as a source of growth as we leverage customer data to create even more relevant and personalized communications. 
Our Store Brand penetration was 22% in the quarter. That was down slightly from the prior year. And for the full year, Store Brand penetration was 21.3%, and that's up about 75 basis points. In 2015, we gained, within the drug channel, about 140 basis points of share in overall brand sales and about 60 basis points of share in Store Brand health care. And there remained significant opportunities to expand our share of Store Brand products by building on core equities in health and beauty and seeking opportunistic growth in other areas, where we can link new products to our customers' path to better health. 
Turning to our store base. We ended the year with about 9,600 retail pharmacies. And for the full year 2015, we opened 130 net new stores, equating to an increase in retail square footage of 2.2%. And when you add in the acquired Target pharmacies, our retail square footage growth for the year comes to 3.1%. 
In the fourth quarter, in addition to the acquired pharmacies, we opened 53 new stores, relocated 19, closed 14, resulting in 39 net new stores. We also continued to grow the number of clinics. MinuteClinic is the largest walk-in clinic operator in the country. And in the fourth quarter, we opened 36 new clinics in addition to the 79 acquired clinics from Target, ending the year with 1,135 clinics across 33 states, plus the District of Columbia. 
Now, excluding the Target clinics, MinuteClinic revenues increased 4.4% in the quarter. That's below our usual trend due to the mild cold flu season versus the year ago, however, we achieved our full year 2015 revenue target of about $340 million -- $345 million. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Dave for the financial review."
93625,323673611,929105,"CVS Health Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2016",2016-02-09,"Earnings Calls","CVS Health Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will provide a detailed review of our 2015 fourth quarter results and briefly touch upon our 2016 guidance, which remains unchanged from what we outlined in December at our Analyst Day. First",1577,"Thank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will provide a detailed review of our 2015 fourth quarter results and briefly touch upon our 2016 guidance, which remains unchanged from what we outlined in December at our Analyst Day. 
First, I'll start with a summary of last year's capital allocation program, which should clearly demonstrate how we're continuing to use our strong free cash flow to return value to our shareholders through both dividends as well as share repurchases. 
I'm pleased to say that we continue to drive steady improvement in our dividend payout ratio. Recall that back in 2010 that our payout ratio was approximately 14%. We finished 2015 with a payout ratio of 30.1%, more than double 2010's level and 240 basis points higher than 2014 on a comparable basis. We paid approximately $1.6 billion in dividends in '15 and $391 million in the fourth quarter alone. Our strong earnings outlook this year, combined with a 21% increase in the dividend that we announced at our Analyst Day, keeps us well on track to achieve our targeted payout ratio of 35% by 2018. 
Along with the significant increases in our dividend, we have continued to repurchase our shares. For all of 2015, we repurchased approximately 48 million shares for about $5 billion, averaging $101.23 per share. In the fourth quarter alone, we repurchased approximately 10.2 million shares for $1.1 billion. 
Now, if you look back over the past 3 years, we have purchased -- repurchased approximately 166 million shares for about $13 billion at an average price of $78.37 per share. For the year 2015, between dividends and share repurchases, we've returned a very significant $6.6 billion to our shareholders. 
Now, looking forward, we have nearly $7.7 billion left in repurchased authorizations, and we continue to expect to repurchase $4 billion this year. Our expectation is that we'd return more than $5 billion to our shareholders in '16 through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. 
We generated $3.1 billion of free cash in the fourth quarter. In all of 2015, we generated approximately $6.5 billion of free cash, which exceeded the high end of our guidance by about $200 million, but was essentially flat year-over-year. The outperformance was driven by client collections. At the same time, we improved our cash cycle by approximately 2 days, thanks to continued improvements in payables management that were partially offset by growth in receivables. We remain committed to further improvements in working capital as we move forward. 
For the year, our net capital expenditures were approximately $2 billion. This included $2.4 billion of gross CapEx offset by about $410 million in sale-leaseback proceeds as well as capital spend associated with the acquisitions. 
As for the income statement, adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.53 per share at the midpoint of our guidance, up 26.5% over LY. As you can see in our press release, in 2015, this excludes amortization, the impact of transaction and integration costs related to the Omnicare and Target acquisitions as well as a $90 million legal charge. The charge was related to a legacy lawsuit challenging the 1999 settlement by MedPartners of various security class actions and of related derivative claim. 
For those of you who may not be familiar, MedPartners was the former parent company to Caremark, so this issue goes back a long time. The growth rate also excludes the loss on early extinguishment of debt that we recorded in 2014. GAAP diluted EPS was $1.34 per share. Results across our operating segments were strong as expected. 
And with that, let me quickly walk down the P&L. On a consolidated basis, revenues in the fourth quarter increased 11% to $41.1 billion. In the PBM segment, net revenues increased 11.1% to $26.5 billion. This growth was attributable to specialty pharmacy as well as increased volume in pharmacy network claims. Overall, PBM adjusted claims grew 6.4% in the quarter. Partially offsetting sales growth was 165 basis point increase in our generic dispensing rate to 83.7%. 
In our Retail/Long-Term Care business, revenues increased 12.5% in the quarter to $19.9 billion, driven primarily by strong pharmacy same-store sales growth as well as the addition of the Omnicare business. Retail/Long-Term Care exceeded our revenue guidance, primarily due to addition of the Target assets a couple weeks earlier than planned as well as a lower generic dispensing rate that -- than expected. During the quarter, GDR increased by approximately 155 basis points to 84%. 
Turning to gross margin. We reported 17.7% for the consolidated company in the quarter, a contraction of approximately 50 -- 15 basis points compared to Q4 '14, and again, consistent with our expectations. Within the PBM segment, gross margins improved approximately 45 basis points versus Q4 '14 to 5.6%, while gross profit dollars increased 20.5% year-over-year. 
The increase in gross profit was primarily due to increases in volumes, the improvement in GDR and favorable rebate and purchasing economics. Partially offsetting these drivers was the impact of client and drug mix as well as continued price compression. The improvement in gross margin rate in the PBM was primarily due to the timing of Medicare Part D profits. 
Now, gross margins in the Retail/Long-Term Care segment was 30.2%, down 125 basis points from LY. The decline was primarily driven by continued pressure on reimbursement rates, and to a lesser degree, the addition of the Omnicare business, which carries a lower margin than retail. Partially offsetting these were the increases in GDR and a strong front store margin improvement, aided by continued rationalization of our promotional strategies and improved product mix. Gross profit dollars increased 8% throughout the quarter. 
Turning to operating expenses, operating profit and the tax rate. The numbers that I'm citing exclude acquisition-related cost and the legal charge where applicable. Total operating expenses as a percentage of revenues notably improved from Q4 '14 to 10.7%. The PBM segment's SG&A rate improved 10 basis points to 1.3%. And SG&A as a percent of sales in the Retail/Long-Term Care segment improved significantly by 190 basis points to 19.4%. This was driven by lower advertising costs due to last year's rebranding campaign following our tobacco exit, lower legal costs and the addition of the Omnicare business, which carries lower SG&A relative to sales. Within the Corporate segment. SG&As were up approximately $10 million to $215 million within our expectations. 
Operating margin for the total enterprise improved approximately 75 basis points in the quarter to 7%. Operating margin in the PBM improved by approximately 55 basis points to 4.3%, while operating margin at Retail/Long-Term Care segment improved approximately 65 basis points to 10.7% on our adjusted basis. 
For the quarter, operating profit growth in each segment was in line with expectations, with the PBM increasing a very solid 26.8% and the Retail/Long-Term Care segment growing 19.8%, again, on our adjusted basis. 
Going below the line on the consolidated income statement. Net interest expense from the quarter increased approximately $145 million from LY to $276 million due primarily to the debt associated with the acquisitions that we took on last year. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 38.9%, and our weighted average share count was 1.1 billion shares. For the year, our effective tax rate was 39.1%, just slightly lower than expected. 
So with that, now, let me touch on our 2016 guidance, which again remains essentially unchanged from Analyst Day. You can find the details in the slide presentation that we posted on our website, but I'll focus on the highlights here. 
In 2016, we continue to expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share, which excludes amortization in the range of $5.73 to $5.88, reflecting very healthy year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is still expected to be in the range of $5.28 to $5.43. Keep in mind that we have not included any estimate of integration costs from Omnicare nor Target in either range. We'll, of course, report those as we progress throughout the year, but they are excluded from our guidance. We expect consolidated net revenue growth of 17% to 18.5%, reflecting solid growth across the enterprise. And we expect consolidated operating profit margin to decline by 40 to 50 basis points. 
The first quarter guidance also remains unchanged. We expect consolidated net revenue growth of 17% to 18.5%. And as you may recall, we highlighted several timing factors at Analyst Day that affect the cadence of profit delivery throughout the year. And while 2016 is expected to be a strong year, the cadence of profit growth is expected to be significantly back half-weighted.
We expect adjusted earnings per share, which excludes amortization, to be in the range of $1.14 to $1.17, while GAAP diluted EPS from continuing ops is expected to be in the range of $1.03 to $1.06 in the first quarter. Additionally, our free cash flow guidance for the year, which includes acquisition-related activities, remains in the range of $5.3 billion to $5.6 billion. 
In closing, I want to say that I'm very pleased with the company's significant cash flow generation capabilities. I believe these capabilities will continue to play an important role in driving shareholder value over the long term. To that point, 2016 will be another year in which we demonstrate our ongoing commitment to returning value to our shareholders through both share buybacks as well as through the increase in our dividend. 
And with that, I'll now turn it back over to Larry."

And I think as we've been talking for quite a while now, those opportunities will really manifest themselves across our retail business. So I think, again, it's early in the process, and the benefits that we'll see from that, we don't expect to begin to come online until the second half of the year. And I think, Lisa, it's a similar story with Target. We've got a lot of heavy lifting to do, when you think about the store and system conversions, 1,700 of those. At the same time, we've had a lot of practice with that. And as I mentioned in the remarks, the pilot stores have gone extremely well. So we are now in rollout mode. And it'll take the better part of the next 6, 7 months to complete those activities. So that's really when you'll begin to see the marketing efforts ramp up. So the benefits that we'll see from beginning to create customer conversion within the Target stores with the Target guests, again, I think that's going to be more of a second half impact."

That was primarily driven by branded inflation, branded price increases, and we're seeing that same dynamic in '16 as well. So clients have never been more open to adopting plan designs to control these costs. And I would really think about that within 3 primary buckets. First is channel, so the ability to adopt our Maintenance Choice programs, which we're now up over 23 million members participating in that program. And network solutions, preferred network solutions for the -- for Medicare, as an example, and narrowing the network in commercial and Managed Medicaid. So continue to see lots of interest in those plans' designs, and also lots of interest with formulary plan designs. And we offer options from excluding formulary for our template clients. We introduced that back in 2012, all the way to much more aggressive formularies, where we essentially take most of the brands off the formulary that really is the most effective tool we have to managing trend because it gets rid of the branded inflation. And then the third primary bucket is really all the solutions we have in specialty from exclusive specialty to side of care to aggressive formulary solutions and specialty. So yes, we do continue to see a lot of interest. We see employers able to make decisions faster in adopting these plan designs. We do see health plans much more interested than they've ever been in these plan designs, but their adoption rate is slower. They may have to sell these plan designs into their downstream clients. And as you recall, as our clients adopt these plan designs and we lower their costs, we generally see more share move into our channels. So it clearly is a win-win."

And when you look at the estimates of what CBO had predicted, the cost of that would be 10 years ago and what it's costing today, it's a fraction of that, which I think is one of the key reasons for that is private sector innovation and the fact that competition ultimately drives down cost.

So now a specialty patient can walk into any one of our 9,600 retail pharmacies and get the same high levels of service because we've integrated them into our back-end specialty platform. You get the same high levels of service. We see similar adherence. So it's been favorably received by specialty patients. And how we know that is it acts very similarly to Maintenance Choice. We see half of the patients want to pick up their specialty prescription at their local CVS that are using Specialty Connect, and the other half want it mailed at their home. So it really opens up the convenience for our clients where we are the exclusive specialty provider. It enhances service. It's enhancing revenue from the open market where we're competing with other specialty pharmacies. So physicians that are much more active in referring patients in the specialty space than in the non-specialty space like the capabilities and the service that we deliver, so we think it's a real competitive advantage in the marketplace."

And I think it's consistent with what we've been talking about that the objective of AMP we have been seeing for the last several years in the form of reimbursement pressures. I think as you look at the remaining states, they'll be -- it's our understanding that states will have 12 months with which to implement some type of acquisition reimburse -- acquisition-cost reimbursement model and along with corresponding changes in dispensing fees. So I think as we sit here today, we think we believe that the rollout across the rest of the country with this will be immaterial to our results.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Our fourth quarter results wrapped up a terrific 2015. And during the year, we achieved strong performance across our enterprise and completed key acquisitions that will support our strategy for growth in the evolving health care market. 
We grew our core business with the acquisition of Target's pharmacies and clinics, and we expanded our reach with the acquisition of Omnicare, the leader in long-term care pharmacy, and we remain very optimistic that these acquisitions will help drive our long-term growth. And I'll update you shortly on our integration progress. 
Now, for the full year 2015, we delivered 10% growth in consolidated revenues; 11% growth in consolidated operating profit; and 15% growth in adjusted earnings per share, excluding amortization, any acquisition-related items and the legal charge we mentioned in this morning's release. 
As expected, growth in the fourth quarter was especially strong, with revenues increasing 11% and adjusted earnings per share increasing 26.5% to $1.53, right in line with our guidance. We generated approximately $3.1 billion of free cash during the quarter and $6.5 billion for the full year, above the high end of our guidance, and our continued ability to deliver substantial free cash is enabling us to return significant value to our shareholders. 
Now, for 2016, we are confirming the guidance we provided at Analyst Day back in December. As a reminder, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year of $5.73 to $5.88, reflecting year-over-year growth of 11% to 14%. And Dave will review the details for the year and the first quarter in his remarks. 
So let me turn to the business update and start with our very successful 2016 PBM selling season. Gross client wins for '16 have increased, and they now stand at $14.8 billion with net new business at $12.7 billion. The increase in net new business of about $1.2 billion from our last update largely reflects incremental growth from our new health plan clients as they closed out their enrollment year. 
These numbers exclude enrollment results from our SilverScript PDP, and I'll touch on that shortly. And our 2016 retention rate remains at approximately 98%. Now our success is a testament to our unmatched products and services, our strong service and execution, along with our competitive pricing. And surveys continue to show that our ability to manage cost is our clients' top priority and this is followed by a variety of additional factors with each of our client channels having different priorities. Our flexibility and expertise in addressing those varying priorities has certainly been a key to our success. 
Now with so much new business being transitioned in January, I'm also very pleased to report that we have had an extremely successful welcome season. We effectively added more than 9 million new members, 9 million new members who generated a significant year-over-year increase in January's claims volume, and clients have given us very positive feedback on our diligence and process and we're pleased with the level of oversight we provided to ensure success. It's also worth noting that in the past 2 welcome seasons combined, we have successfully added nearly 16 million new Caremark lives. 
Looking ahead, the 2017 selling season is just underway and we are well positioned competitively for another strong year. Now it's too early to provide a specific update, but our size, scale, service record and unmatched capabilities make us confident that we will continue to be successful in the marketplace. 
Now as we've been discussing, top of mind for our clients is their rapidly growing specialty costs, and our specialty pharmacy business offers a comprehensive set of programs to help clients effectively manage specialty trend. As a result, we continue to outpace the market and gain share. In the fourth quarter, specialty revenues increased 32% and continued to outpace market growth rates. 
Our Medicare Part D business has risen to a leadership position. We had a successful 2016 annual enrollment period. Consistent with our expectations, we added approximately 0.5 million net lives and began the '16 plan year with more than 5 million captive PDP lives and that includes EGWPs. 
Now when you add in the Med D lives that we manage for our health plan clients, the non-captive lives, our total rises to 11.3 million Med D lives under management, and that's up 41% from the prior year. Furthermore, our enterprise clinical capabilities, combined with our strong operational execution, enable us to drive Med D Star ratings, not only for our own SilverScript PDP, but also for our health plan clients' Med D offerings. 
In fact, SilverScript was the largest PDP to achieve a 4-star rating, and 73% of our clients' lives are now enrolled in a high-performing plan for the 2016 year. 
Now turning to our Retail/Long-Term Care segment. And I'll start with an update on the integrations, Omnicare and Target, which are well underway. In the fourth quarter, Omnicare performed well and in line with our expectations as we began to realize some of the anticipated synergies. 
As we detailed at Analyst Day, there are multiple opportunities for driving enterprise value from Omnicare in both the near and long term. In the first half of this year, we expect to achieve the benefits of purchasing synergies. And by the end of the year, we will phase in technology to support high-quality customer service and leverage best practices across the organization. 
We are combining operational infrastructures and developing programs to improve work streams and enhance delivery service, and we expect to complete the vast majority of the Omnicare integration activities by year end. 
Now opportunities are also being pursued across the continuum of care that will drive long-term enterprise value. For example, we are developing an enhanced offering for skilled nursing that's driven by improving coordination during care transitions, which should lead to better outcomes for patients, providers and payers. We're also developing segmented assisted living offerings to better align with residents' varying needs. 
And to better target the rapidly growing independent living market, we have a consumer-driven effort underway that utilizes existing CVS pharmacy capabilities, including the on-site delivery of health care services. So we expect to generate revenue synergies focused on the transitions of care, market adjacencies and differentiated offerings, and these should begin to be realized in the second half of this year and grow in future periods. And we remain very excited about the opportunities created by this combination, along with our enhanced ability to serve seniors across their continuum of care. 
Now as for the Target pharmacy and clinic acquisition, our highly detailed integration plan is complete. The integration activities are underway, and we have already successfully converted a handful of pilot stores. 
As a result, the conversions will begin to ramp up throughout this quarter and next, and we expect to complete all store conversions by the end of summer. Now as we complete each store conversion, and it's rebranded as CVS Pharmacy, at that point, we launch our additional core offerings -- core pharmacy offerings to include Specialty Connect, ExtraCare Pharmacy Rewards, along with our digital tools. And that's in addition to Maintenance Choice that was available upon the transaction close. We'll begin adding marketing elements as geographies convert, all with the goal of converting Target guests who currently don't use the pharmacy. 
Now moving on to the fourth quarter results in the retail business. Pharmacy same-store sales increased 5%. This was negatively impacted by approximately 470 basis points due to recent generic introductions. Pharmacy same-store prescription volumes increased 5% on a 30-day equivalent basis, outperforming overall market growth. And our retail pharmacy market share, again on a 30-day equivalent basis, was 21.8% in Q4. And that's up about 65 basis points versus the same quarter a year ago. 
For the full year 2015, CVS Pharmacy's Med D share increased 35 basis points versus '14, and we continue to gain share in this growing market, while maintaining a disciplined approach to evaluating participation in preferred Med D networks. And we expect to maintain our market share position in 2016, helped by our preferred positions in a variety of national and regional plans. So overall, our pharmacy business remains quite strong and continues to gain share. 
Our digital team has been working to create a connected health experience that makes it easier to save time and money and to stay healthy by connecting patients to our unique assets when, where and how they want. To date, we've seen 12.7 million downloads of the CVS Pharmacy app; 18 million members enrolled in text messaging, driving adherence; and more than 300 million text messages sent by CVS Pharmacy this past year enhancing the patient experience. So we continue to focus on driving member adoption of our highly-related apps. 
In the front store business, comps were down slightly, 0.5% in the quarter, and reflected softer customer traffic, partially offset by an increase in basket size. However, front store margins increased notably in the quarter, benefiting from efforts to rationalize our promotional strategies, along with growth in the higher-margin health and beauty businesses. 
ExtraCare continues its commitment to reward our loyal customers with savings through weekly ads and personalized offers as well as Extrabucks Rewards. And in 2015, this generated about $4 billion in savings for our loyal customers. So we continue to see ExtraCare as a source of growth as we leverage customer data to create even more relevant and personalized communications. 
Our Store Brand penetration was 22% in the quarter. That was down slightly from the prior year. And for the full year, Store Brand penetration was 21.3%, and that's up about 75 basis points. In 2015, we gained, within the drug channel, about 140 basis points of share in overall brand sales and about 60 basis points of share in Store Brand health care. And there remains significant opportunities to expand our share of Store Brand products by building on core equities in health and beauty and seeking opportunistic growth in other areas where we can link new products to our customers' path to better health. 
Turning to our store base. We ended the year with about 9,600 retail pharmacies. And for the full year 2015, we opened 130 net new stores, equating to an increase in retail square footage of 2.2%. And when you add in the acquired Target pharmacies, our retail square footage growth for the year comes to 3.1%. 
In the fourth quarter, in addition to the acquired pharmacies, we opened 53 new stores, relocated 19, closed 14, resulting in 39 net new stores. We also continued to grow the number of clinics. MinuteClinic is the largest walk-in clinic operator in the country. And in the fourth quarter, we opened 36 new clinics in addition to the 79 acquired clinics from Target, ending the year with 1,135 clinics across 33 states, plus the District of Columbia. 
Now excluding the Target clinics, MinuteClinic revenues increased 4.4% in the quarter. That's below our usual trend due to the mild cold flu season versus the year ago, however, we achieved our full year 2015 revenue target of about $340 million -- $345 million. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Dave for the financial review."
93625,323673611,929432,"CVS Health Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2016",2016-02-09,"Earnings Calls","CVS Health Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will provide a detailed review of our 2015 fourth quarter results and briefly touch upon our 2016 guidance, which remains unchanged from what we outlined in December at our Analyst Day. First",1580,"Thank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will provide a detailed review of our 2015 fourth quarter results and briefly touch upon our 2016 guidance, which remains unchanged from what we outlined in December at our Analyst Day. 
First, I'll start with a summary of last year's capital allocation program, which should clearly demonstrate how we're continuing to use our strong free cash flow to return value to our shareholders through both dividends as well as share repurchases. 
I'm pleased to say that we continue to drive steady improvement in our dividend payout ratio. Recall that back in 2010 that our payout ratio was approximately 14%. We finished 2015 with a payout ratio of 30.1%, more than double 2010's level and 240 basis points higher than 2014 on a comparable basis. We paid approximately $1.6 billion in dividends in '15 and $391 million in the fourth quarter alone. Our strong earnings outlook this year, combined with a 21% increase in the dividend that we announced at our Analyst Day, keeps us well on track to achieve our targeted payout ratio of 35% by 2018. 
Along with the significant increases in our dividend, we have continued to repurchase our shares. For all of 2015, we repurchased approximately 48 million shares for about $5 billion, averaging $101.23 per share. In the fourth quarter alone, we repurchased approximately 10.2 million shares for $1.1 billion. 
Now if you look back over the past 3 years, we have purchased -- repurchased approximately 166 million shares for about $13 billion at an average price of $78.37 per share. For the year 2015, between dividends and share repurchases, we've returned a very significant $6.6 billion to our shareholders. 
Now looking forward, we have nearly $7.7 billion left in repurchase authorizations, and we continue to expect to repurchase $4 billion this year. Our expectation is that we'd return more than $5 billion to our shareholders in '16 through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. 
We generated $3.1 billion of free cash in the fourth quarter. In all of 2015, we generated approximately $6.5 billion of free cash, which exceeded the high end of our guidance by about $200 million, but was essentially flat year-over-year. The outperformance was driven by client collections. At the same time, we improved our cash cycle by approximately 2 days, thanks to continued improvements in payables management that were partially offset by growth in receivables. We remain committed to further improvements in working capital as we move forward. 
For the year, our net capital expenditures were approximately $2 billion. This included $2.4 billion of gross CapEx, offset by about $410 million in sale-leaseback proceeds as well as capital spend associated with the acquisitions. 
As for the income statement, adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.53 per share at the midpoint of our guidance, up 26.5% over LY. As you can see in our press release, in 2015, this excludes amortization, the impact of transaction and integration costs related to the Omnicare and Target acquisitions as well as a $90 million legal charge. The charge was related to a legacy lawsuit challenging the 1999 settlement by MedPartners of various security class actions and a related derivative claim. 
For those of you who may not be familiar, MedPartners was the former parent company to Caremark, so this issue goes back a long time. The growth rate also excludes the loss on early extinguishment of debt that we recorded in 2014. GAAP diluted EPS was $1.34 per share. Results across our operating segments were strong, as expected. 
And with that, let me quickly walk down the P&L. On a consolidated basis, revenues in the fourth quarter increased 11% to $41.1 billion. In the PBM segment, net revenues increased 11.1% to $26.5 billion. This growth was attributable to specialty pharmacy as well as increased volume in pharmacy network claims. Overall, PBM adjusted claims grew 6.4% in the quarter. Partially offsetting the sales growth was a 165 basis point increase in our generic dispensing rate to 83.7%. 
In our Retail/Long-Term Care business, revenues increased 12.5% in the quarter to $19.9 billion, driven primarily by strong pharmacy same-store sales growth as well as the addition of the Omnicare business. Retail/Long-Term Care exceeded our revenue guidance, primarily due to the addition of the Target assets a couple weeks earlier than planned as well as a lower generic dispensing rate that -- than expected. During the quarter, GDR increased by approximately 155 basis points to 84%. 
Turning to gross margin, we reported 17.7% for the consolidated company in the quarter, a contraction of approximately 50 -- 15 basis points compared to Q4 '14, and again, consistent with our expectations. Within the PBM segment, gross margins improved approximately 45 basis points versus Q4 '14 to 5.6%, while gross profit dollars increased 20.5% year-over-year. 
The increase in gross profit was primarily due to increases in volumes, the improvement in GDR and favorable rebate and purchasing economics. Partially offsetting these drivers was the impact of client and drug mix as well as continued price compression. The improvement in gross margin rate in the PBM was primarily due to the timing of Medicare Part D profits. 
Now gross margins in the Retail/Long-Term Care segment was 30.2%, down 125 basis points from LY. The decline was primarily driven by continued pressure on reimbursement rates, and to a lesser degree, the addition of the Omnicare business, which carries a lower margin than retail. Partially offsetting these were the increases in GDR and a strong front store margin improvement, aided by continued rationalization of our promotional strategies and improved product mix. Gross profit dollars increased 8% throughout the quarter. 
Turning to operating expenses, operating profit and the tax rate. The numbers that I'm citing exclude acquisition-related cost and the legal charge where applicable. Total operating expenses as a percentage of revenues notably improved from Q4 '14 to 10.7%. The PBM segment's SG&A rate improved 10 basis points to 1.3%. And SG&A as a percent of sales in the Retail/Long-Term Care segment improved significantly by 190 basis points to 19.4%. This was driven by lower advertising costs due to last year's rebranding campaign following our tobacco exit, lower legal costs and the addition of the Omnicare business, which carries lower SG&A relative to sales. Within the Corporate segment, SG&As were up approximately $10 million to $215 million, within our expectations. 
Operating margin for the total enterprise improved approximately 75 basis points in the quarter to 7%. Operating margin in the PBM improved by approximately 55 basis points to 4.3%, while operating margin at Retail/Long-Term Care segment improved approximately 65 basis points to 10.7% on our adjusted basis. 
For the quarter, operating profit growth in each segment was in line with expectations, with the PBM increasing a very solid 26.8% and the Retail/Long-Term Care segment growing 19.8%, again, on our adjusted basis. 
Going below the line on the consolidated income statement. Net interest expense in the quarter increased approximately $145 million from LY to $276 million, due primarily to the debt associated with the acquisitions that we took on last year. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 38.9%, and our weighted average share count was 1.1 billion shares. For the year, our effective tax rate was 39.1%, just slightly lower than expected. 
So with that, now let me touch on our 2016 guidance, which again remains essentially unchanged from Analyst Day. You can find the details in the slide presentation that we posted on our website, but I'll focus on the highlights here. 
In 2016, we continue to expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share, which excludes amortization, in the range of $5.73 to $5.88, reflecting very healthy year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is still expected to be in the range of $5.28 to $5.43. Keep in mind that we have not included any estimate of integration costs from Omnicare nor Target in either range. We'll, of course, report those as we progress throughout the year, but they are excluded from our guidance. We expect consolidated net revenue growth of 17% to 18.5%, reflecting solid growth across the enterprise. And we expect consolidated operating profit margin to decline by 40 to 50 basis points. 
The first quarter guidance also remains unchanged. We expect consolidated net revenue growth of 17% to 18.5%. And as you may recall, we highlighted several timing factors at Analyst Day that affect the cadence of profit delivery throughout the year. And while 2016 is expected to be a strong year, the cadence of profit growth is expected to be significantly back half-weighted.
We expect adjusted earnings per share, which excludes amortization, to be in the range of $1.14 to $1.17, while GAAP diluted EPS from continuing ops is expected to be in the range of $1.03 to $1.06 in the first quarter. Additionally, our free cash flow guidance for the year, which includes acquisition-related activities, remains in the range of $5.3 billion to $5.6 billion. 
In closing, I want to say that I'm very pleased with the company's significant cash flow generation capabilities. I believe these capabilities will continue to play an important role in driving shareholder value over the long term. To that point, 2016 will be another year in which we demonstrate our ongoing commitment to returning value to our shareholders through both share buybacks as well as through the increase in our dividend. 
And with that, I'll now turn it back over to Larry."

And I think as we've been talking for quite a while now, those opportunities will really manifest themselves across our retail business. So I think, again, it's early in the process, and the benefits that we'll see from that, we don't expect to begin to come online until the second half of the year. And I think, Lisa, it's a similar story with Target. We've got a lot of heavy lifting to do, when you think about the store and system conversions, 1,700 of those. At the same time, we've had a lot of practice with that. And as I mentioned in the remarks, the pilot stores have gone extremely well. So we are now in rollout mode. And it'll take the better part of the next 6, 7 months to complete those activities. So that's really when you'll begin to see the marketing efforts ramp up. So the benefits that we'll see from beginning to create customer conversion within the Target stores with the Target guests, again, I think that's going to be more of a second half impact."

That was primarily driven by branded inflation, branded price increases, and we're seeing that same dynamic in '16 as well. So clients have never been more open to adopting plan designs to control these costs. And I would really think about it in 3 primary buckets. First is channel, so the ability to adopt our Maintenance Choice programs, which we're now up over 23 million members participating in that program. And network solutions, preferred network solutions for the -- for Medicare, as an example, and narrowing the network in commercial and Managed Medicaid. So continue to see lots of interest in those plans' designs, and also lots of interest with formulary plan designs. And we offer options from excluding formulary for our template clients. We introduced that back in 2012, all the way to much more aggressive formularies, where we essentially take most of the brands off the formulary. That really is the most effective tool we have to managing trend because it gets rid of the branded inflation. And then the third primary bucket is really all the solutions we have in specialty, from exclusive specialty to site of care, to aggressive formulary solutions in specialty. So yes, we do continue to see a lot of interest. We see employers able to make decisions faster in adopting these plan designs. We do see health plans much more interested than they've ever been in these plan designs, but their adoption rate is slower. They may have to sell these plan designs into their downstream clients. And as you recall, as our clients adopt these plan designs and we lower their costs, we generally see more share move into our channels. So it clearly is a win-win."

We see half of the patients want to pick up their specialty prescription at their local CVS that are using Specialty Connect, and the other half want it mailed to their home. So it really opens up the convenience. So for our clients, where we are the exclusive specialty provider, it enhances service. It's enhancing revenue from the open market where we're competing with other specialty pharmacies.

Secondly, we have several initiatives underway, both as we look at the acquisitions, but more importantly as we look at different efforts that we have across our business, many of those initiatives deliver benefit in the back half versus the first half.

I think as you look at the remaining states, they'll be -- it's our understanding that states will have 12 months with which to implement some type of acquisition reimburse -- acquisition-cost reimbursement model and along with corresponding changes in dispensing fees. So I think as we sit here today, we think we believe that the rollout across the rest of the country with this will be immaterial to our results.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us to hear about the solid first quarter results we posted today. 
Adjusted earnings per share increased 4% to $1.18, that's $0.01 above the high end of our guidance and total company revenues increased a very healthy 19%, also above our high-end guidance number. 
Excluding acquisition-related integration costs and the true-up of a legal charge, operating profit increased 5% enterprise-wide, with operating profit in the Retail/Long-Term Care segment in line with our expectations and operating profit in the PBM notably exceeding expectations. 
We generated $1.8 billion of free cash during the quarter and continued to return significant value to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. 
Now it's still early in the year, we're maintaining our adjusted EPS guidance range that we provided to you at our December Analyst Day and Dave we'll get into the details of our results and guidance in his remarks. 
So let me turn to the business update, and I'll start with the PBM selling season. Since our last update, the expected revenue impact for 2016 has grown, with growth new business at $15.2 billion, net new business of $13.1 billion, both up about $400 million from our last update. In the vast majority of this increase relates to a new health plan clients, which will increase our revenues in both 2016 and '17. 
We also closed out the '16 selling season with a retention rate of 97.3%. 
Now turning to the 2017 selling season, it's early, but we're off to a very good start. Today, we have completed just over 1/3 of our client renewals, which is pretty typical for this time of the year. 
As for new business, our integrated model continues to resonate strongly, and we've already had some nice wins. Perspective clients value our strong service and execution, competitive pricing, unmatched products and services, along with our ability to meet their unique needs. 
Now many of you have asked about the magnitude of the '17 selling season, and at this point, we're seeing more RFPs and potential revenues in the marketplace than we did at the same time last year. But keep in mind that it ebbs and flows throughout the season and some of that can simply be timing. 
Now given that it's still early and consistent with our past practices, we will provide a quantitative update on our next earnings call once we have a more complete picture of the selling season. 
Now we held our Client Forum in late March, which is attended by about 900 people, and clients acknowledge that their top concern is cost management with service running a close second, and I'm pleased to report that we have been able to deliver on both fronts. 
Now in this environment of rising health care costs, clients are looking to us for proactive cost management solutions that anticipate market changes that impact trend. And they're adopting more aggressive strategies, particularly formulary design and specialty management to mitigate these trend drivers. 
Now we believe we are offering our clients the most comprehensive suite of formulary choices to achieve their savings goals, while addressing member impact and transition to new therapies. 
In addition, specialty drug management has been emphasized in the plan design elections and clients are looking for solutions for managing specialty in both the pharmacy and the medical benefits. Among our unique specialty management programs, we are seeing a growing interest in infusion and side of care services as well as our medical claims management services. 
In addition, innovations in specialty include indications specific pricing, where the cost to the payer is aligned with the drug's effectiveness for a specific indication. 
In the first quarter, specialty revenues increased 23% and our volumes continued to outpace the market. So through our unique suite of specialty capabilities, we remain highly focused on helping our clients manage costs and improve outcomes. 
Now let me turn to the Retail/Long-Term Care segment, and I'll start with an update on the integrations of Target and Omnicare. The integration of the acquired Target pharmacies and clinics is proceeding according to plan and as of the end of April, about half of the 1,670 acquired pharmacies have been successfully converted to the CVS Pharmacy brand and systems. As planned, we expect that all store conversions will be completed by the end of the summer. And as the stores are converted and rebranded, we are launching our additional core pharmacy offerings, and these include Specialty Connect, ExtraCare Pharmacy Rewards and our digital tools, and this is in addition to Maintenance Choice, which has been available since the transaction closed.  So we're pleased with our early progress and remain very enthusiastic about this opportunity to drive growth. 
Turning to Omnicare. The long term care pharmacy business performed in line with our expectations as we benefited from some of the anticipated cost and sourcing synergies. Currently, we are working to combine operational infrastructures and further develop programs to improve work streams and enhance service delivery, and we're on track to complete the vast majority of the Omnicare integration activities by year-end. 
Now in addition to the integration work, we have several initiatives underway. We piloted and have already rolled out the use of CVS pharmacies as an extension of the Omnicare pharmacies to speed the emergency order prescriptions in the skilled nursing facilities. 
We're also currently piloting an integrated service offering to the assisted and independent living communities where we can offer residents enhanced medication delivery options based on their preference and acuity level, all supported by our high touch patient care teams. 
And with a targeted marketing approach that focuses on when people enter these facilities, along with our name brand recognition, we are confident that we can increase our penetration in these segments. And pending the pilot result, this program will begin to roll out later this year. 
So with a combination of CVS and Omnicare, we remain very excited about our enhanced ability to serve seniors along their continuum of care. 
Now moving on the first quarter results in the Retail business. Total same-store sales increased 4.2% and were possibly affected by approximately 125 basis points due to the additional day related to leap year. 
Pharmacy same-store sales increased 5.5%. This was negatively impacted by approximately 360 basis points due to recent generic introductions and about 50 basis points related to the softer flu season. And the flue was pretty soft in the first 2 months of the quarter, but strong in March, somewhat mitigating the quarterly impact. 
Pharmacy comps were positively impacted by about 130 basis points related to the extra leap day and pharmacy same-store prescription volumes increased 5.9% on a 30-day equivalent basis, continuing to outperform overall market growth. 
In our Retail Pharmacy market share on a 30-day equivalent basis was 23.9% in Q1, and that's up about 245 basis points versus the same quarter a year ago. And while the primary driver of shared growth is the addition of the Target pharmacies, we continue to experience strong organic share growth as well. 
Now an important driver of script growth has been our clinical outreach programs, which have allowed us to continue to improve adherence and provide patients helpful reminders. Part of the strength of these programs has been the integration of our digital tools, and today, nearly 19 million people receive text alerts from CVS on a variety of topics, all of which help to enhance the service experience. 
Among other recent pharmacy innovations, ScriptSync retail is expected to continue to improve medication adherence and patient satisfaction. Since the launch, more than 2/3 of the patients offered ScriptSync have adopted to service. And with nearly 350,000 patients enrolled in ScriptSync during the first quarter, we now have more than 1 million patients enrolled since its launch in the third quarter of last year. 
In the front store business, comps increased 0.7%, and this includes the benefit of the extra day from leap year of approximately 105 basis points, as well as the shift of the Easter holiday from April  last year to March this year, positively impacting front store comps by about 80 basis points.  And the negative impact of a late flu season was immaterial to the front store in the quarter. 
Now we've continued to pull back on broad-based promotions, which has resulted in fewer visits from lower valued customers. Front store margins, once again, increased notably in the quarter, benefiting from these efforts to rationalize our promotional strategies, along with growth in the higher-margin health and beauty businesses.  So we continue to test, learn and refine strategies to achieve the optimal balance between traffic and profitable growth. 
Now ExtraCare continues to reward our loyal customers with savings, and we continue to leverage our ExtraCare data to create even more relevant and personalized communications. And we know that our top customers drive the disproportionate amount of our sales and margin, so while store traffic overall is down, our loyal customers are shopping frequently and driving our front store sales and margins. 
As for Store Brands, they represented 21.9% of front store sales in the quarter, that's up 100 basis points from the same quarter last year. And there remains significant opportunities to expand our share of store brand products by building on core equities in health and beauty and seeking opportunistic growth in other areas where we can provide customers a superior value. 
Among our recent front store innovations, we recently announced a partnership with curbside to bring a new level of convenience to our customers. CVS expresses the industry's first retail solution that integrates curbside's market-leading technology right into the CVS Pharmacy app. Customers can make mobile in app purchases from their local CVS Pharmacy and have the products directly delivered to them when they pull up to the store, all at about an hour with no added cost. 
This service is currently available in select markets, including San Francisco, Charlotte and Atlanta, and pending a successful pilot, our goal is to roll out the program to the majority of our markets later this year. 
This exciting new initiative really embodies the digital mission of CVS Health to make healthy lifestyles more accessible and convenient for our customers all across the country. 
Now turning to store openings. In the first quarter, we opened 24 new stores, relocated 14 others, closed 5, resulting in 19 net new stores, and we expect to open about 100 net new stores for the full year. 
As for MinuteClinic, the target integration was completed in 24 clinics, converting them to MinuteClinics branding, electronic health record, systems and health offerings. And we expect the balance of the clinics to be converted by the end of the summer. 
We now operate 1,136 clinics across 33 states plus the District of Columbia and including Target, MinuteClinic's revenues increased 17.7% versus the same quarter last year despite the mild and late flu season. 
Another digital innovation is what the call the Hold my Place in Line Online queuing tool that was launched nationally at MinuteClinic in late March and this tool enhances convenience by allowing patients to view wait times online and hold their place in line through any digital channel. So MinuteClinic continues to advance in innovative ways to increase convenience and access to care. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Dave for the financial review."
93625,331741394,970430,"CVS Health Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 03, 2016",2016-05-03,"Earnings Calls","CVS Health Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone. This morning, I will provide a detailed review of first quarter results, followed briefly with an update on our guidance. And as always, I'll start first with the summary of the various ways we continue to enhance",2001,"Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone. This morning, I will provide a detailed review of first quarter results, followed briefly with an update on our guidance. And as always, I'll start first with the summary of the various ways we continue to enhance shareholder value through our capital allocation program. 
Throughout the quarter, our quarterly cash dividend increased by 21% per share, and we paid approximately $470 million in dividends. Our dividend payout ratio currently stands at 31.9%, and we remain well on track to achieve our target of 35% by 2018. 
In addition, we had continued to repurchase our shares. In the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 22.4 million shares for $2.1 billion or approximately $98.52 per share. So between dividends and share repurchases, we've returned approximately $2.5 billion to our shareholders in the first quarter alone. 
Looking forward to the remainder of the year, we continue to expect to repurchase an additional $1.8 billion worth of our stock, completing the planned $4 billion in repurchases for the full year. 
Our expectation is that we will return more than $5 billion to our shareholders in 2016 through a combination of both dividends and share repurchases. 
As Larry mentioned, we generated approximately $1.8 billion of free cash in the first quarter, and we continue to expect to produce free cash of between $5.3 billion and $5.6 billion this year. 
Turning to the income statement. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.18 per share, $0.01 above the top of our guidance range and 4% over LY. GAAP diluted EPS was $1.04 per share. 
The Retail/Long-Term Care segment delivered solid earnings within expectations, while the PBM segment posted profit growth above the high end of our guidance. The outperformance in the quarter was primarily driven by stronger-than-expected volumes and better purchasing economics within the PBM. 
With that, let me quickly walk down the P&L. On a consolidated basis, revenues in the first quarter increased 18.9% to $43.2 billion. In the PBM segment, net revenues increased 20.5% to $28.8 billion. 
Given the large amount of new business that came onboard on 1/1, this growth was attributable to the increased volume in pharmacy network claims as well as growth in specialty pharmacy. 
Overall, PBM adjusted claims grew 19.4% in the quarter, partially offsetting the sales growth was 170 basis points increase in our generic dispensing rate to 85.2%. 
In our Retail/Long-Term Care business, revenues increased 18.6% in the quarter to $20.1 billion, driven primarily by the addition of Omnicare and the Target pharmacies.  Solid pharmacy same-store sales contributed as well. This revenue growth was just below our guidance range. While script unit growth remains strong, the mix of branded drugs differed slightly from our plan, resulting in a lower average script price. 
To be clear, we have not seen a change in the level of branded drug inflation. It was simply mix that affected the weighted average script price. 
In addition, front store revenues were impacted by promotional strategies in our nonhealth and beauty categories as we gave up some lower value customer traffic to drive an increasingly profitable front store sales mix.  GDR increased by approximately 125 basis points to 85.7%. 
Turning to gross margin. Operating expenses, operating profit and the tax rate, the numbers I'll cite exclude non-GAAP adjustments namely: Amortization, acquisition-related costs and the legal charge where applicable.  Keep in mind that our guidance for the quarter also excluded these items. 
We reported gross margin of 15.6% for the consolidated company in the quarter, a contraction of approximately 135 basis points compared to Q1 '15. 
Gross profit dollars increased a healthy 9.5%, in line with our expectations. 
Within the PBM segment, gross margins contracted by approximately 45 basis points versus Q1 of '15 to 3.8%, primarily due to the mix of new business and price compression, partially offset by the GDR improvement and favorable purchasing economics. However, gross profit dollars increased 7.4% year-over-year due in part to strong volumes, specialty pharmacy, the improvement in GDR and again, favorable purchasing economics.  Partially offsetting these drivers was continued price compression. 
Gross profit dollars increased approximately 10% year-over-year in the Retail/Long-Term Care segment, while gross margin declined approximately 225 basis points to 29%. 
Now about 40% of the decline in the gross margin rate was mix driven due to the inclusion of the Omnicare and Target businesses that we acquired. The decline in gross margin was also due to continued reimbursement pressures. 
Gross margin was positively impacted by the increase in GDR as well as increased front store margins due to our continued rationalization of our promotional strategies and improved mix of the products that we sold. 
Turning to expenses. We saw strong improvement in total operating expenses as a percent of revenues from Q1 of '15 to 10.4%. The PBM segment's SG&A rate improved about 10 basis points to 1.1%, benefiting from the additional sales leverage. SG&A as a percent of sales in the Retail/Long-Term Care segment improved significantly by approximately 120 basis points to 19.9%. These 2 was driven by leverage from revenue growth as well as the addition of the Omnicare business, which carries a lower SG&A relative to sales. 
Within the Corporate segment, expenses were up approximately $20 million to $209 million, slightly better than expectations. 
Operating margin for the total enterprise decreased approximately 70 basis points in the quarter to 5.2%. Operating margin in the PBM decreased approximately 35 basis points to 2.7%, while operating margin at Retail/Long-Term Care decreased approximately 105 basis points to 9.1%. 
For the quarter, operating profit growth in each segment was in line with or better than expectations, with the PBM increasing 6.6% and Retail/Long-Term Care growing 6.4%. 
Going below the line of the consolidated income statement, net interest expense in the quarter increased approximately $149 million from LY to $283 million. This is due primarily to the debt associated with the acquisitions that we took on last year. 
Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 39.3% and our weighted average share count was 1.1 billion shares. 
Now let me update you on our guidance. I'll focus on the highlights, and you can find additional details of our guidance in the slide presentation that we posted on our website earlier this morning. As Larry said, we are confirming our 2016 adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $5.73 to $5.88, which reflects strong year-over-year growth of 11% to 14%. We are very pleased with our strong performance year-to-date and it's still early in the year. 
With respect to GAAP diluted EPS, we're revising our full year guidance to reflect the integration costs and the legal charge that we saw in the first quarter, which we explicitly excluded from our initial guidance. So we now expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.24 to $5.39.  Keep in mind that our GAAP guidance for future periods excludes the impact of acquisition-related integration costs, and we will update for these costs that we incurred throughout the year. 
In the PBM segment, with a better-than-expected increase in network volume from our new business in Q1 expected to flow throughout the full year, we are increasing revenue guidance by 150 basis points to a range of 21.75% to 23.25%. This increase takes into account lower-than-expected volumes of the Hep C and PCSK9 therapies. 
As a result of this, along with stronger expected purchasing economics, we are narrowing and raising the midpoint of the PBM's operating guidance by taking the lower end up 125 basis points, resulting in a new range of 11% to 13.25%. 
In the Retail/Long-Term Care segment, we are lowering our revenue growth guidance and maintaining our operating profit growth guidance. The reduction in our revenue growth expectations reflects several factors, including our decision to discontinue certain Rx crossroads programs to more fully align this business with our focus on cost, quality and access. 
Additionally, the reduction in revenue growth reflects the shift in the mix of branded drugs, along with the earlier than anticipated launch of generic Nasonex as well as slightly weaker front store sales trend as we continue to execute on our targeted promotional strategies. 
We now expect Retail/Long-Term Care revenue growth of 13% to 14.25%, a reduction of 125 basis points on both ends. And we now expect total comps of 1.75% to 3%, while continuing to expect script comps of 3.5% to 4.5%. 
Despite the revenue change, we remain confident in our prior operating profit expectation, given the immaterial impact, the changes I noted are expected to have on profitability. 
Consolidated net revenue growth is now expected to be 17.5% to 19%, with the increase in network volume and a higher GDR, intercompany revenue eliminations are now expected to be approximately 11.4% for segment revenues. 
And as the mix of generics increases within our Maintenance Choice product, we expect higher intercompany profit eliminations. This change essentially offsets the improvement in PBM operating profits. 
And as I said before, our free cash guidance for the full year remains in the range of $5.3 billion to $5.6 billion. 
And with that, now I will provide guidance for the second quarter, which excludes all acquisition-related integration costs. We expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $1.28 to $1.31 per share in the second quarter, reflecting growth of 4.75% to 7.5% versus Q2 of '15. 
GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.17 to $1.20 per share in the second quarter. 
Starting with Analyst Day and continuing with the past several months, we've been highlighting several timing factors that will affect the cadence of profit delivery throughout this year. I want to take a moment and remind you of those factors. The introduction and timing of break-open generics, the timing of profitability in our Medicare Part D business, the timing of the benefits from our strategies to drive growth in their front-end and the timing of share repurchases and certain tax benefits with all factors expected to impact the cadence the most. 
And while we delivered a strong first quarter, slightly above our own expectations, the cadence of profit growth is still expected to be very much back-half weighted. 
Our EPS guidance in the second quarter is very much in line with our budget and what we said at analyst day. All things considered, we see a ramp up in growth, and we still expect a strong back half of the year. 
Within the Retail segment, we expect revenues to increase 15.5% to 17% versus the second quarter of LY, driven in part by the addition of the acquired businesses. Adjusted script comps are expected to increase in the range of 3% to 4%, while we expect total same-store sales to be up 1.25% to up 2.5%. These were shipped out of Q2 as expected to have about a 20 basis points impact on comp growth. 
In the PBM business, we expect second quarter revenue growth of between 22% and 23.25%, driven by continued strong growth in both volumes and specialty. 
Consolidated revenues are expected to grow 18.5% to 20%. We expect retail operating profit to increase 5% to 7% and PBM operating profit to increase 4% to 8% in the second quarter.  Consolidated operating profit is expected to grow 3.25% to 6.5%. 
In closing, I'm very pleased with our solid first quarter results and remain confident in our full year outlook. As we noted when we gave guidance at Analyst Day, our growth this year will be back-half weighted and that is playing out just as we anticipated. 
We continue to expect to deliver solid growth in our core businesses, along with the anticipated benefits from our acquisitions and more importantly, our growth would be very strong at the enterprise level. This growth will help us maintain and generate substantial free cash flow and will continue to execute on our commitment to return significant value to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. 
And with that, I'll now turn it back over to Larry."

So this is very important part of the businesses consumer think about this. And it's why we've been shifting more and more of our focus towards health and beauty. Because I think when our customers think about health care, obviously, they think pharmacy first, but they think health and beauty. And so we're in the process essentially of putting more and more effort around the health and beauty businesses and our top customers. So those have been the trough of the 2 places we've spent time and energy. And I'm actually quite pleased with where we are. If you look at our health and beauty categories, for example, we continue to grow share of across the marketplace in health and beauty. Now where we're pulling back on the category Davis became too early earlier is the promotional business where it might be edibles or general merchandise, not categories we need to win in from consumer's perspective as we think about health care. So I think that piece of it is generally how we think about the role of front. Connected to that is the role of ExtraCare and loyalty and personalization, so we know 30% of our customers drive 80% of our sales and profit. Again, we're focused on those customers giving them more value, more reasons to shop. And we're very happy. So far, we continue to see more trips and more sales and more profits from those customer segments. And then as you said, we certainly are looking very hard at the world of digital. We know that the consumer is living in an omni-channel world, and we need to be relevant. We're excited about curbside because we thought to ourselves we don't need to out Amazon Amazon. We certainly have an e-commerce play, but we really wanted to take advantage of 7,800 convenient locations and the fact that the service need health and beauty products or the milk on the way home from work or diapers, we're the convenient go-to-location for her. So the fact that she can order online, let's say, from the office and pick it up on the way home and not have to get out of her car, we think it's a very big winning as Larry said, we're [indiscernible] on the early stages of testing that in some markets, but the research we've done with consumers is really quite encouraging."

And Maintenance Choice is the only 90-day program that is truly channel-agnostic with the ability to realize the same enterprise economics regardless of the channel that the patient chooses. And our offering is becoming even more relevant with the addition of Target's 1,600 pharmacies into the Maintenance Choice network. And I guess, just one other example of that clinical and operational integration is, as you know, as we've talked about Specialty Connect, which is more recent rollout, we simply define that as a Maintenance Choice product for the specialty patients.

So we actually have a capability I mean there's a benefit across the pharmacy and medical benefit. And we think about unit cost, Larry talked about that, and so size, scale and capabilities really does make a difference there. And we're seeing specialty drugs come to market and be limited to a few providers, so our capabilities enable us to have access to those limited distribution drugs. The other side of it is what can we do clinically to manage the 3% of our clients patients that are driving 25% of their overall health care costs. And so we've integrated a capability that allows us, not to just the specialty prescription, but the manage that patients, not just with her specialty condition, but with all their comorbidities.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us to hear about the solid first quarter results we posted today. 
Adjusted earnings per share increased 4% to $1.18, that's $0.01 above the high end of our guidance and total company revenues increased a very healthy 19%, also above our high-end guidance number. 
Excluding acquisition-related integration costs and the true-up of a legal charge, operating profit increased 5% enterprise-wide with operating profit in the Retail/Long-Term Care segment in line with our expectations and operating profit in the PBM, notably exceeding expectations. 
We generated $1.8 billion of free cash during the quarter and continued to return significant value to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. 
Now it's still early in the year, so we are maintaining our adjusted EPS guidance range that we provided to you at our December Analyst Day, and Dave we'll get into the details of our results and guidance in his remarks. 
So let me turn to the business update, and I'll start with the PBM selling season. Since our last update, the expected revenue impact for 2016 has grown with growth new business at $15.2 billion, net new business of $13.1 billion, both up about $400 million from our last update. In the vast majority of this increase relates to a new health plan client, which will increase our revenues in both 2016 and '17. We also closed out the '16 selling season with a retention rate of 97.3%. 
Now turning to the 2017 selling season, it's early, but we're off to a very good start. To date, we have completed just over 1/3 of our client renewals, which is pretty typical for this time of the year. 
As for new business, our integrated model continues to resonate strongly, and we've already had some nice wins. Perspective clients value our strong service and execution, competitive pricing, unmatched products and services, along with our ability to meet their unique needs. 
Now many of you have asked about the magnitude of the '17 selling season, and at this point, we are seeing more RFPs and potential revenues in the marketplace than we did at the same time last year. But keep in mind that it ebbs and flows throughout the season and some of that could simply be timing. Now given that it's still early and consistent with our past practices, we will provide a quantitative update on our next earnings call once we have a more complete picture of the selling season. 
Now we held our Client Forum in late March, which was attended by about 900 people, and clients acknowledged that their top concern is cost management with service running a close second. And I'm pleased to report that we have been able to deliver on both fronts. Now in this environment of rising health care costs, clients are looking to us for proactive cost management solutions that anticipate market changes that impact trend. And they're adopting more aggressive strategies, particularly formulary design and specialty management to mitigate these trend drivers. 
Now we believe we are offering our clients the most comprehensive suite of formulary choices to achieve their savings goals, while addressing member impact and transition to new therapies. 
In addition, specialty drug management has been emphasized in the plan design elections and clients are looking for solutions for managing specialty in both the pharmacy and the medical benefits. Among our unique specialty management programs, we are seeing a growing interest in our infusion and side of care services as well as our medical claims management services. 
In addition, innovations and specialty include indications' specific pricing, where the cost to the payer is aligned with the drug's effectiveness for a specific indication. 
In the first quarter, specialty revenues increased 23%, and our volumes continued to outpace the market. So through our unique suite of specialty capabilities, we remain highly focused on helping our clients manage costs and improve outcomes. 
Now let me turn to the Retail/Long-Term Care segment, and I'll start with an update on the integrations of Target and Omnicare. The integration of the acquired Target pharmacies and clinics is proceeding according to plan. And as of the end of April, about half of the 1,670 acquired pharmacies have been successfully converted to the CVS Pharmacy brand and systems. As planned, we expect that all store conversions will be completed by the end of this summer. And as the stores are converted and rebranded, we are launching our additional core pharmacy offerings, and these include Specialty Connect, ExtraCare Pharmacy Rewards and our digital tools, and this is in addition to Maintenance Choice, which has been available since the transaction closed. So we're pleased with our early progress and remain very enthusiastic about this opportunity to drive growth. 
Now turning to Omnicare. The Long-Term Care pharmacy business performed in line with our expectations as we benefited from some of the anticipated costs and sourcing synergies. Currently, we are working to combine operational infrastructures and further develop programs to improve work streams and enhance service delivery, and we're on track to complete the vast majority of the Omnicare integration activities by year-end. 
Now in addition to the integration work, we have several initiatives underway. We piloted and have already rolled out the use of CVS pharmacies as an extension of the Omnicare pharmacies to speed the [Audio Gap] emergency order prescriptions in the skilled nursing facilities. 
We're also currently piloting an integrated service offering to the assisted and independent living communities where we can offer residents enhanced medication delivery options based on their preference and acuity level, all supported by our high-touch patient care teams. And with a targeted marketing approach that focuses on when people enter these facilities, along with our name brand recognition, we are confident that we can increase our penetration in these segments. And pending the pilot results, this program will begin to roll out later this year. 
So with the combination of CVS and Omnicare, we remain very excited about our enhanced ability to serve seniors along their continuum of care. 
Now moving on to first quarter results in the Retail business. Total same-store sales increased 4.2% and were positively affected by approximately 125 basis points due to the additional day related to leap year. 
Pharmacy same-store sales increased 5.5%. This was negatively impacted by approximately 360 basis points due to recent generic introductions and about 50 basis points related to the softer flu season. And the flu was pretty soft in the first 2 months of the quarter, but strong in March, somewhat mitigating the quarterly impact. 
Pharmacy comps were positively impacted by about 130 basis points related to the extra leap day and pharmacy same-store prescription volumes increased 5.9% on a 30-day equivalent basis, continuing to outperform overall market growth. 
In our Retail Pharmacy market share on a 30-day equivalent basis was 23.9% in Q1, and that's up about 245 basis points versus the same quarter a year ago. And while the primary driver of shared growth is the addition of the Target pharmacies, we continue to experience strong organic share growth as well. 
Now an important driver of script growth has been our clinical outreach programs, which have allowed us to continue to improve adherence and provide patients helpful reminders. Part of the strength of these programs has been the integration of our digital tools. And today, nearly 19 million people receive text alerts from CVS on a variety of topics, all of which helped to enhance the service experience. 
Among other recent pharmacy innovations, ScriptSync at Retail is expected to continue to improve medication adherence and patient satisfaction. Since the launch, more than 2/3 of the patients offered ScriptSync have adopted the service. And with nearly 350,000 patients enrolled in ScriptSync during the first quarter, we now have more than 1 million patients enrolled since its launch in the third quarter of last year. 
In the front store business, comps increased 0.7%, and this includes the benefit of the extra day from leap year of approximately 105 basis points as well as the shift of the Easter holiday from April  last year to March this year, positively impacting front store comps by about 80 basis points. And the negative impact of a late flu season was immaterial to the front store in the quarter. 
Now we've continued to pull back on broad-based promotions, which has resulted in fewer visits from lower-value customers. Front store margins, once again, increased notably in the quarter, benefiting from these efforts to rationalize our promotional strategies, along with growth in the higher-margin health and beauty businesses. So we continue to test, learn and refine strategies to achieve the optimal balance between traffic and profitable growth. 
Now ExtraCare continues to reward our loyal customers with savings, and we continue to leverage our ExtraCare data to create even more relevant and personalized communications. And we know that our top customers drive the disproportionate amount of our sales and margin. So while store traffic overall is down, our loyal customers are shopping frequently and driving our front store sales and margins. 
As for Store Brands, they represented 21.9% of front store sales in the quarter, that's up 100 basis points from the same quarter last year. And there remain significant opportunities to expand our share of store brand products by building on core equities in health and beauty and seeking opportunistic growth in other areas where we can provide customers a superior value. 
Among our recent front store innovations, we recently announced a partnership with Curbside to bring a new level of convenience to our customers. CVS Express is the industry's first retail solution that integrates Curbside's market-leading technology right into the CVS Pharmacy app. Customers can make mobile in-app purchases from their local CVS Pharmacy and have the products directly delivered to them when they pull up to the store, all at about an hour with no added cost. This service is currently available in select markets, including San Francisco, Charlotte and Atlanta. And pending a successful pilot, our goal is to roll out the program to the majority of our markets later this year. This exciting new initiative really embodies the digital mission of CVS Health to make healthy lifestyles more accessible and convenient for our customers all across the country. 
Now turning to store openings. In the first quarter, we opened 24 new stores; relocated 14 others; closed 5, resulting in 19 net new stores; and we expect to open about 100 net new stores for the full year. 
As for MinuteClinic, the target integration was completed in 24 clinics, converting them to MinuteClinics branding, electronic health record systems and health offerings. And we expect the balance of the clinics to be converted by the end of the summer. 
We now operate 1,136 clinics across 33 states plus the District of Columbia. And including Target, MinuteClinic's revenues increased 17.7% versus the same quarter last year despite the mild and late flu season. 
Another digital innovation is what we call the Hold My Place In Line online queuing tool that was launched nationally at MinuteClinic in late March, and this tool enhances convenience by allowing patients to view wait times online and hold their place in line through any digital channel. So MinuteClinic continues to advance in innovative ways to increase convenience and access to care. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Dave for the financial review."

This morning, I will provide a detailed review of first quarter results, followed briefly with an update on our guidance.

This morning, I will provide a detailed review of first quarter results, followed briefly with an update on our guidance. And as always, I'll start first with the summary of the various ways we continue to enhance shareholder value through our capital allocation program. 
Throughout the quarter, our quarterly cash dividend increased by 21% per share, and we paid approximately $470 million in dividends. Our dividend payout ratio currently stands at 31.9%, and we remain well on track to achieve our target of 35% by 2018. 
In addition, we have continued to repurchase our shares. In the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 22.4 million shares for $2.1 billion or approximately $98.52 per share. So between dividends and share repurchases, we've returned approximately $2.5 billion to our shareholders in the first quarter alone. 
Looking forward to remainder of the year, we continue to expect to repurchase an additional $1.8 billion worth of our stock, completing the planned $4 billion in repurchases for the full year. Our expectation is that we will return more than $5 billion to our shareholders in 2016 through a combination of both dividends and share repurchases. 
As Larry mentioned, we've generated approximately $1.8 billion of free cash in the first quarter, and we continue to expect to produce free cash of between $5.3 billion and $5.6 billion this year. 
Turning to the income statement. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.18 per share, $0.01 above the top of our guidance range and 4% over LY. GAAP diluted EPS was $1.04 per share. 
The Retail/Long-Term Care segment delivered solid earnings within expectations, while the PBM segment posted profit growth above the high end of our guidance. The outperformance in the quarter was primarily driven by stronger-than-expected volumes and better purchasing economics within the PBM. 
With that, let me quickly walk down the P&L. On a consolidated basis, revenues in the first quarter increased 18.9% to $43.2 billion. In the PBM segment, net revenues increased 20.5% to $28.8 billion. Given the large amount of new business that came onboard on 1/1, this growth is attributable to the increased volume in pharmacy network claims as well as growth in specialty pharmacy. Overall, PBM adjusted claims grew 19.4% in the quarter. Partially offsetting the sales growth was 170 basis point increase in our generic dispensing rate to 85.2%. 
In our Retail/Long-Term Care business, revenues increased 18.6% in the quarter to $20.1 billion, driven primarily by the addition of Omnicare and the Target pharmacies. Solid pharmacy same-store sales contributed as well. This revenue growth was just below our guidance range. While script unit growth remains strong, the mix of branded drugs differed slightly from our plan, resulting in a lower average script price. 
To be clear, we have not seen a change in the level of branded drug inflation. It was simply mix that affected the weighted average script price. 
In addition, front store revenues were impacted by our promotional strategies in our nonhealth and beauty categories as we gave up some lower-value customer traffic to drive an increasingly profitable front store sales mix. GDR increased by approximately 125 basis points to 85.7%. 
Turning to gross margin. Operating expenses, operating profit and the tax rate, the numbers I'll cite exclude non-GAAP adjustments, mainly amortization, acquisition-related costs and the legal charge where applicable. Keep in mind that our guidance for the quarter also excluded these items. 
We reported gross margin of 15.6% for the consolidated company in the quarter, a contraction of approximately 135 basis points compared to Q1 '15. Gross profit dollars increased a healthy 9.5%, in line with our expectations. 
Within the PBM segment, gross margins contracted by approximately 45 basis points versus Q1 of '15 to 3.8%, primarily due to the mix of new business and price compression, partially offset by the GDR improvement and favorable purchasing economics. However, gross profit dollars increased 7.4% year-over-year due in part to strong volumes, specialty pharmacy, the improvement in GDR and again, favorable purchasing economics. Partially offsetting these drivers was continued price compression. 
Gross profit dollars increased approximately 10% year-over-year in the Retail/Long-Term Care segment, while gross margin declined approximately 225 basis points to 29%. 
Now about 40% of the decline in the gross margin rate was mix-driven due to the inclusion of the Omnicare and Target businesses that we acquired. The decline in gross margin was also due to continued reimbursement pressures. Gross margin was positively impacted by the increase in GDR as well as increased front store margins due to our continued rationalization of our promotional strategies and improved mix of the products that we sold. 
Turning to expenses. We saw strong improvement in total operating expenses as a percent of revenues from Q1 of '15 to 10.4%. The PBM segment's SG&A rate improved about 10 basis points to 1.1%, benefiting from the additional sales leverage. SG&A as a percent of sales in the Retail/Long-Term Care segment improved significantly by approximately 120 basis points to 19.9%. These 2 was driven by leverage from revenue growth as well as the addition of the Omnicare business, which carries a lower SG&A relative to sales. Within the Corporate segment, expenses were up approximately $20 million to $209 million, slightly better than expectations. 
Operating margin for the total enterprise decreased approximately 70 basis points from the quarter to 5.2%. Operating margin in the PBM decreased approximately 35 basis points to 2.7%, while operating margin at Retail/Long-Term Care decreased approximately 105 basis points to 9.1%. 
For the quarter, operating profit growth in each segment was in line with or better than expectations, with the PBM increasing 6.6% and Retail/Long-Term Care growing 6.4%. 
Going below the line of the consolidated income statement, net interest expense from the quarter increased approximately $149 million from LY to $283 million. This is due primarily to the debt associated with the acquisitions that we took on last year. 
Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 39.3% and our weighted average share count was 1.1 billion shares. 
Now let me update you on our guidance. I'll focus on the highlights, and you can find the additional details of our guidance in the slide presentation that we posted on our website earlier this morning. As Larry said, we are confirming our 2016 adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $5.73 to $5.88, which reflects strong year-over-year growth of 11% to 14%. We are very pleased with our strong performance year-to-date, and it's still early in the year. 
With respect to GAAP diluted EPS, we're revising our full year guidance to reflect the integration costs and the legal charge that we saw in the first quarter, which we explicitly excluded from our initial guidance. So we now expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.24 to $5.39. Keep in mind that our GAAP guidance for future periods excludes the impact of acquisition-related integration costs, and we will update for these costs that we incur throughout the year. 
In the PBM segment, with a better-than-expected increase in network volume from our new business in Q1 expected to flow throughout the full year, we are increasing revenue guidance by 150 basis points to a range of 21.75% to 23.25%. This increase takes into account lower-than-anticipated volumes of the hep C and PCSK9 therapies. As a result of this, along with stronger expected purchasing economics, we are narrowing and raising the midpoint of the PBM's operating profit guidance by taking the lower end up 125 basis points, resulting in a new range of 11% to 13.25%. 
In the Retail/Long-Term Care segment, we are lowering our revenue growth guidance and maintaining our operating profit growth guidance. The reduction in our revenue growth expectations reflect several factors, including our decision to discontinue certain RxCrossroads programs to more fully align this business with our focus on cost, quality and access. Additionally, the reduction in revenue growth reflects the shift in the mix of branded drugs, along with the earlier-than-anticipated launch of generic Nasonex as well as slightly weaker front store sales trends as we continue to execute on our targeted promotional strategies. We now expect Retail/Long-Term Care revenue growth of 13% to 14.25%, a reduction of 125 basis points on both ends. And we now expect total comps of 1.75% to 3%, while continuing to expect script comps of 3.5% to 4.5%. Despite the revenue change, we remain confident in our prior operating profit expectation. Given the immaterial impact, the changes I noted are expected to have on profitability. 
Consolidated net revenue growth is now expected to be 17.5% to 19%. With the increase in network volume and a higher GDR, intercompany revenue eliminations are now expected to be approximately 11.4% for segment revenues. And as the mix of generics increases within our Maintenance Choice product, we expect higher intercompany profit eliminations. This change essentially offsets the improvement in PBM operating profits. And as I said before, our free cash guidance for the full year remains in the range of $5.3 billion to $5.6 billion. 
And with that, now let me provide guidance for the second quarter, which excludes all acquisition-related integration costs. We expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $1.28 to $1.31 per share in the second quarter, reflecting growth of 4.75% to 7.5% versus Q2 of '15. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.17 to $1.20 per share in the second quarter. 
Starting with Analyst Day and continuing with the past several months, we have been highlighting several timing factors that will affect the cadence of profit delivery throughout this year. I want to take a moment and remind you of those factors. The introduction and timing of break-open generics, the timing of profitability in our Medicare Part D business, the timing of the benefits from our strategies to drive growth in their front-end and the timing of share repurchases and certain tax benefits were all factors expected to impact the cadence the most. And while we delivered a strong first quarter, slightly above our own expectations, the cadence of profit growth is still expected to be very much back-half weighted. 
Our EPS guidance for the second quarter is very much in line with our budget and what we said at Analyst Day. All things considered, we see a ramp up in growth and we still expect a strong back half of the year. 
Within the Retail segment, we expect revenues to increase 15.5% to 17% versus the second quarter of LY, driven in part by the addition of the acquired businesses. Adjusted script comps are expected to increase in the range of 3% to 4%, while we expect total same-store sales to be up 1.25% to up 2.5%. These were shipped out of Q2 as expected to have about a 20 basis point impact on comp growth. 
In the PBM business, we expect second quarter revenue growth of between 22% and 23.25%, driven by continued strong growth in both volumes and specialty. Consolidated revenues are expected to grow 18.5% to 20%. 
We expect retail operating profit to increase 5% to 7% and PBM operating profit to increase 4% to 8% in the second quarter.  Consolidated operating profit is expected to grow 3.25% to 6.5%. 
In closing, I'm very pleased with our solid first quarter results and remain confident in our full year outlook. As we noted when we gave guidance at Analyst Day, our growth this year will be back-half weighted and that is playing out just as we anticipated. We continue to expect to deliver solid growth in our core businesses, along with the anticipated benefits from our acquisitions and more importantly, our growth will be very strong at the enterprise level. This growth will help us maintain and generate substantial free cash flow and will continue to execute on our commitment to return significant value to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. 
And with that, I'll now turn it back over to Larry."

This is where consumers get connected to CVS and ultimately, over time, they start using us for prescription. So it's a very important part of the business, it's consumers think about us. And it's why we've been shifting more and more of our focus towards health and beauty. Because think -- when our customers think about health care, obviously, they think pharmacy first, but they think health and beauty. And so we're in the process essentially of putting more and more effort around the health and beauty businesses and our top customers. Those have been the thrust of the 2 places we've spent time and energy. And I'm actually quite pleased with where we are. If you look at our health and beauty categories, for example, we continue to grow share across the marketplace in health and beauty. Now where we're pulling back are the categories Dave was speaking to early -- it's -- earlier. It's the promotional business, where it might be edibles or general merchandise, not categories we need to win in from the consumer's perspective as we think about health care. So I think that piece of it is sort of generally how we're thinking about the role of the front. Connected to that is the role of ExtraCare and loyalty and personalization, so we know 30% of our customers drive 80% of our sales and profit. Again, we're focused on those customers giving them more value, more reasons to shop, and we're very happy. So far, we continue to see more trips and more sales and more profits from those customer segments. And then as you said, we certainly are looking very hard at the world of digital. We know that the consumer is living in an omni-channel world, and we need to be relevant. We're excited about curbside because we thought to ourselves, we don't need to out Amazon Amazon. We certainly have an e-commerce play, but we really wanted to take advantage of 7,800 convenient locations and the fact that when the consumer needs health and beauty aid products or the milk on the way home from work or diapers, we're the convenient go-to-location for her. So the fact that she can order online, let's say, from the office and pick it up on the way home and not have to get out of her car, we think it's a very big winning proposition. As Larry said, we're still in the early stages of testing that in some markets, but the research we've done with consumers is really quite encouraging."

So much more of a focus on their numbers or their employees. And so, as we're out in the marketplace, our integrated assets really position us to work with their employees or their members through all the touch points that we have to communicate and transition them to the new plan design. So this is really resonating, I think, to an even greater degree today than what we've seen historically.

And Maintenance Choice is the only 90-day program that is truly channel-agnostic with the ability to realize the same enterprise economics regardless of the channel that the patient chooses. And our offering is becoming even more relevant with the addition of Target's 1,600 pharmacies into the Maintenance Choice network. And I guess, just one other example of that clinical and operational integration is, as you know, as we've talked about Specialty Connect, which is a more recent rollout, we simply define that as a Maintenance Choice product for the specialty patients. So I think that's another proof point in terms of the real integration that exists that does provide elements of differentiation from those other programs that are attempting to mimic Maintenance Choice."

So client's biggest concern when they think about cost, they're really thinking about specialty. And about half of their specialty spend is on the pharmacy benefit, which PBMs historically have managed and the other half of the specialty spend is under the medical benefit, which is not being managed very well today by the health plans, the platforms that they manage specialty medical on just weren't built for managed drugs. So we actually have the capability to manage that benefit across the pharmacy and medical benefit. And we think about unit costs, Larry talked about that, and so size, scale and capabilities really make a difference there. And we're seeing specialty drugs come to market and be limited to a few providers, so our capabilities enable us to have access to those limited distribution drugs. The other side of it is what can we do clinically to manage the 3% of our client's patients that are driving 25% of their overall health care costs. And so we've integrated a capability that allows us, not to just manage the specialty prescription, but to manage that patient, not just with their specialty condition, but with all their comorbidities. And we've demonstrated that we can reduce overall health care costs. So as we tell that story to clients, it resonates and it's a -- I think it's a key decision point for them as they're making a selection in the workplace."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us to hear about the solid first quarter results we posted today. 
Adjusted earnings per share increased 4% to $1.18, that's $0.01 above the high end of our guidance, and total company revenues increased a very healthy 19%, also above our high-end guidance number. 
Excluding acquisition-related integration costs and the true-up of a legal charge, operating profit increased 5% enterprise-wide with operating profit in the Retail/Long-Term Care segment in line with our expectations and operating profit in the PBM, notably exceeding expectations. 
We generated $1.8 billion of free cash during the quarter and continued to return significant value to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. 
Now it's still early in the year, so we are maintaining our adjusted EPS guidance range that we provided to you at our December Analyst Day, and Dave will get into the details of our results and guidance in his remarks. 
So let me turn to the business update, and I'll start with the PBM selling season. Since our last update, the expected revenue impact for 2016 has grown with gross new business at $15.2 billion, net new business of $13.1 billion, both up about $400 million from our last update, and the vast majority of this increase relates to a new health plan client, which will increase our revenues in both 2016 and '17. We also closed out the '16 selling season with a retention rate of 97.3%. 
Now turning to the 2017 selling season. It's early, but we're off to a very good start. To-date, we have completed just over 1/3 of our client renewals, which is pretty typical for this time of the year. 
As for new business, our integrated model continues to resonate strongly, and we've already had some nice wins. Prospective clients value our strong service and execution, competitive pricing, unmatched products and services, along with our ability to meet their unique needs. 
Now many of you have asked about the magnitude of the '17 selling season, and at this point, we are seeing more RFPs and potential revenues in the marketplace than we did at the same time last year. But keep in mind that it ebbs and flows throughout the season, and some of that could simply be timing. Now given that it's still early and consistent with our past practices, we will provide a quantitative update on our next earnings call once we have a more complete picture of the selling season. 
Now we held our client forum in late March, which was attended by about 900 people, and clients acknowledged that their top concern is cost management with service running a close second. And I'm pleased to report that we have been able to deliver on both fronts. Now in this environment of rising health-care costs, clients are looking to us for proactive cost-management solutions that anticipate market changes that impact trend. And they're adopting more aggressive strategies, particularly formulary design and specialty management, to mitigate these trend drivers. 
Now we believe we are offering our clients the most comprehensive suite of formulary choices to achieve their savings goals while addressing member impact and transition to new therapies. 
In addition, specialty drug management has been emphasized in the plan design elections, and clients are looking for solutions for managing specialty in both the pharmacy and the medical benefits. Among our unique specialty management programs, we are seeing a growing interest in our infusion and site of care services as well as our medical claims management services. 
In addition, innovations in specialty include indication-specific pricing, where the cost to the payer is aligned with the drug's effectiveness for a specific indication. 
In the first quarter, specialty revenues increased 23%, and our volumes continued to outpace the market. So through our unique suite of specialty capabilities, we remain highly focused on helping our clients manage costs and improve outcomes. 
Now let me turn to the Retail/Long-Term Care segment, and I'll start with an update on the integrations of Target and Omnicare. The integration of the acquired Target pharmacies and clinics is proceeding according to plan. And as of the end of April, about half of the 1,670 acquired pharmacies have been successfully converted to the CVS Pharmacy brand and systems. As planned, we expect that all store conversions will be completed by the end of this summer. And as the stores are converted and rebranded, we're launching our additional core pharmacy offerings, and these include Specialty Connect, ExtraCare Pharmacy Rewards and our digital tools, and this is in addition to Maintenance Choice, which has been available since the transaction closed. So we're pleased with our early progress and remain very enthusiastic about this opportunity to drive growth. 
Turning to Omnicare. The Long-Term Care pharmacy business performed in line with our expectations as we benefited from some of the anticipated costs and sourcing synergies. Currently, we are working to combine operational infrastructures and further develop programs to improve work-streams and enhance service delivery, and we're on track to complete the vast majority of the Omnicare integration activities by year-end. 
Now in addition to the integration work, we have several initiatives underway. We piloted and have already rolled out the use of CVS pharmacies as an extension of the Omnicare pharmacies to speed the [indiscernible] emergency order prescriptions in the skilled nursing facilities. 
We're also currently piloting an integrated service offering to the assisted and independent living communities where we can offer residents enhanced medication delivery options based on their preference and acuity level, all supported by our high-touch patient care teams. And with a targeted marketing approach that focuses on when people enter these facilities, along with our name brand recognition, we are confident that we can increase our penetration in these segments. And pending the pilot results, this program will begin to roll out later this year. So with the combination of CVS and Omnicare, we remain very excited about our enhanced ability to serve seniors along their continuum of care. 
Now moving on to first quarter results in the Retail business. Total same-store sales increased 4.2% and were positively affected by approximately 125 basis points due to the additional day related to leap year. 
Pharmacy same-store sales increased 5.5%. This was negatively impacted by approximately 360 basis points due to recent generic introductions and about 50 basis points related to the softer flu season. And the flu was pretty soft in the first 2 months of the quarter but strong in March, somewhat mitigating the quarterly impact. 
Pharmacy comps were positively impacted by about 130 basis points related to the extra Leap Day, and pharmacy same-store prescription volumes increased 5.9% on a 30-day equivalent basis, continuing to outperform overall market growth. 
And our retail pharmacy market share on a 30-day equivalent basis was 23.9% in Q1, and that's up about 245 basis points versus the same quarter a year ago. And while the primary driver of shared growth is the addition of the Target pharmacies, we continued to experience strong organic share growth as well. 
Now an important driver of script growth has been our clinical outreach programs, which have allowed us to continue to improve adherence and provide patients helpful reminders. Part of the strength of these programs has been the integration of our digital tools. And today, nearly 19 million people receive text alerts from CVS on a variety of topics, all of which help to enhance the service experience. 
Among other recent pharmacy innovations, ScriptSync at Retail is expected to continue to improve medication adherence and patient satisfaction. Since the launch, more than 2/3 of the patients offered ScriptSync have adopted the service. And with nearly 350,000 patients enrolled in ScriptSync during the first quarter, we now have more than 1 million patients enrolled since its launch in the third quarter of last year. 
In the front-store business, comps increased 0.7%, and this includes the benefit of the extra day from Leap Year of approximately 105 basis points as well as the shift of the Easter holiday from April last year to March this year positively impacting front-store comps by about 80 basis points. And the negative impact of a late flu season was immaterial to the front store in the quarter. 
Now we've continued to pull back on broad-based promotions, which has resulted in fewer visits from lower-value customers. Front-store margins once again increased notably in the quarter, benefiting from these efforts to rationalize our promotional strategies along with growth in the higher-margin health and beauty businesses. So we continue to test, learn and refine strategies to achieve the optimal balance between traffic and profitable growth. 
Now ExtraCare continues to reward our loyal customers with savings, and we continue to leverage our ExtraCare data to create even more relevant and personalized communications. And we know that our top customers drive a disproportionate amount of our sales and margin. So while store traffic overall is down, our loyal customers are shopping frequently and driving our front-store sales and margins. 
As for Store Brands, they represented 21.9% of front-store sales in the quarter. That's up 100 basis points from the same quarter last year. And there remain significant opportunities to expand our share of Store Brand products by building on core equities in health and beauty and seeking opportunistic growth in other areas where we can provide customers a superior value. 
 
Among our recent front-store innovations, we recently announced a partnership with Curbside to bring a new level of convenience to our customers. CVS Express is the industry's first retail solution that integrates Curbside's market-leading technology right into the CVS Pharmacy app. Customers can make mobile in-app purchases from their local CVS Pharmacy and have the products directly delivered to them when they pull up to the store, all in about an hour with no added costs. This service is currently available in select markets, including San Francisco, Charlotte and Atlanta. And pending a successful pilot, our goal is to roll out the program to the majority of our markets later this year. This exciting new initiative really embodies the digital mission of CVS Health to make healthy lifestyles more accessible and convenient for our customers all across the country. 
Now turning to store openings. In the first quarter, we opened 24 new stores; relocated 14 others; closed 5, resulting in 19 net new stores; and we expect to open about 100 net new stores for the full year. 
As for MinuteClinic, the target integration was completed in 24 clinics, converting them to MinuteClinics' branding, electronic health record systems and health offerings. And we expect the balance of the clinics to be converted by the end of the summer. 
We now operate 1,136 clinics across 33 states plus the District of Columbia. And including Target, MinuteClinic's revenues increased 17.7% versus the same quarter last year despite the mild and late flu season. 
Another digital innovation is what we call the Hold My Place In Line online queuing tool that was launched nationally at MinuteClinic in late March, and this tool enhances convenience by allowing patients to view wait times online and hold their place in line through any digital channel. So MinuteClinic continues to advance in innovative ways to increase convenience and access to care. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Dave for the financial review."

This morning, I will provide a detailed review of first quarter results, followed briefly with an update on our guidance. And as always, I'll start first with the summary of the various ways we continue to enhance shareholder value through our capital allocation program. 
Throughout the quarter, our quarterly cash dividend increased by 21% per share, and we paid approximately $470 million in dividends. Our dividend payout ratio currently stands at 31.9%, and we remain well on track to achieve our target of 35% by 2018. 
In addition, we have continued to repurchase our shares. In the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 22.4 million shares for $2.1 billion or approximately $98.52 per share. So between dividends and share repurchases, we've returned approximately $2.5 billion to our shareholders in the first quarter alone. 
Looking forward to the remainder of the year, we continue to expect to repurchase an additional $1.8 billion worth of our stock, completing the planned $4 billion in repurchases for the full year. Our expectation is that we will return more than $5 billion to our shareholders in 2016 through a combination of both dividends and share repurchases. 
As Larry mentioned, we've generated approximately $1.8 billion of free cash in the first quarter, and we continue to expect to produce free cash of between $5.3 billion and $5.6 billion this year. 
Turning to the income statement. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.18 per share, $0.01 above the top of our guidance range and 4% over LY. GAAP diluted EPS was $1.04 per share. 
The Retail/Long-Term Care segment delivered solid earnings within expectations, while the PBM segment posted profit growth above the high end of our guidance. The outperformance in the quarter was primarily driven by stronger-than-expected volumes and better purchasing economics within the PBM. 
With that, let me quickly walk down the P&L. On a consolidated basis, revenues in the first quarter increased 18.9% to $43.2 billion. In the PBM segment, net revenues increased 20.5% to $28.8 billion. Given the large amount of new business that came onboard on 1/1, this growth is attributable to the increased volume in pharmacy network claims as well as growth in specialty pharmacy. Overall, PBM adjusted claims grew 19.4% in the quarter. Partially offsetting the sales growth was a 170 basis point increase in our generic dispensing rate to 85.2%. 
In our Retail/Long-Term Care business, revenues increased 18.6% in the quarter to $20.1 billion, driven primarily by the addition of Omnicare and the Target pharmacies. Solid pharmacy same-store sales contributed as well. This revenue growth was just below our guidance range. While script unit growth remains strong, the mix of branded drugs differed slightly from our plan, resulting in a lower average script price. 
To be clear, we have not seen a change in the level of branded drug inflation. It was simply mix that affected the weighted average script price. 
In addition, front-store revenues were impacted by our promotional strategies in our nonhealth and beauty categories as we gave up some lower-value customer traffic to drive an increasingly profitable front-store sales mix. GDR increased by approximately 125 basis points to 85.7%. 
Turning to gross margin. Operating expenses, operating profit and the tax rate, the numbers I'll cite exclude non-GAAP adjustments, mainly amortization, acquisition-related cost and the legal charge where applicable. Keep in mind that our guidance for the quarter also excluded these items. 
We reported gross margin of 15.6% for the consolidated company in the quarter, a contraction of approximately 135 basis points compared to Q1 '15. Gross profit dollars increased a healthy 9.5%, in line with our expectations. 
Within the PBM segment, gross margins contracted by approximately 45 basis points versus Q1 of '15 to 3.8%, primarily due to the mix of new business and price compression, partially offset by the GDR improvement and favorable purchasing economics. However, gross profit dollars increased 7.4% year-over-year due in part to strong volumes, specialty pharmacy, the improvement in GDR and, again, favorable purchasing economics. Partially offsetting these drivers was continued price compression. 
Gross profit dollars increased approximately 10% year-over-year in the Retail/Long-Term Care segment, while gross margin declined approximately 225 basis points to 29%. 
Now about 40% of the decline in the gross margin rate was mix driven due to the inclusion of the Omnicare and Target businesses that we acquired. The decline in gross margin was also due to continued reimbursement pressures. Gross margin was positively impacted by the increase in GDR as well as increased front-store margins due to our continued rationalization of our promotional strategies and improved mix of the products that we sold. 
Turning to expenses. We saw strong improvement in total operating expenses as a percent of revenues from Q1 of '15 to 10.4%. The PBM segment's SG&A rate improved about 10 basis points to 1.1%, benefiting from the additional sales leverage. SG&A as a percent of sales in the Retail/Long-Term Care segment improved significantly by approximately 120 basis points to 19.9%. This, too, was driven by leverage from revenue growth as well as the addition of the Omnicare business, which carries a lower SG&A relative to sales. Within the Corporate segment, expenses were up approximately $20 million to $209 million, slightly better than expectations. 
Operating margin for the total enterprise decreased approximately 70 basis points from the quarter to 5.2%. Operating margin in the PBM decreased approximately 35 basis points to 2.7% while operating margin at Retail/Long-Term Care decreased approximately 105 basis points to 9.1%. 
For the quarter, operating profit growth in each segment was in line with or better than expectations with the PBM increasing 6.6% and Retail/Long-Term Care growing 6.4%. 
Going below the line on the consolidated income statement, net interest expense from the quarter increased approximately $149 million from LY to $283 million. This is due primarily to the debt associated with the acquisitions that we took on last year. 
Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 39.3%, and our weighted average share count was 1.1 billion shares. 
Now let me update you on our guidance. I'll focus on the highlights, and you can find the additional details of our guidance in the slide presentation that we posted on our website earlier this morning. As Larry said, we are confirming our 2016 adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $5.73 to $5.88, which reflects strong year-over-year growth of 11% to 14%. We are very pleased with our strong performance year-to-date, and it's still early in the year. 
With respect to GAAP diluted EPS, we're revising our full year guidance to reflect the integration cost and the legal charge that we saw in the first quarter, which we explicitly excluded from our initial guidance. So we now expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.24 to $5.39. Keep in mind that our GAAP guidance for future periods excludes the impact of acquisition-related integration costs, and we will update for these costs that we incur throughout the year. 
In the PBM segment, with a better-than-expected increase in network volume from our new business in Q1 expected to flow throughout the full year, we are increasing revenue guidance by 150 basis points to a range of 21.75% to 23.25%. This increase takes into account lower-than-anticipated volumes of the hep C and PCSK9 therapies. As a result of this, along with stronger expected purchasing economics, we are narrowing and raising the midpoint of the PBM's operating profit guidance by taking the lower end up 125 basis points, resulting in a new range of 11% to 13.25%. 
In the Retail/Long-Term Care segment, we are lowering our revenue growth guidance and maintaining our operating profit growth guidance. The reduction in our revenue growth expectations reflect several factors, including our decision to discontinue certain RxCrossroads programs to more fully align this business with our focus on cost, quality and access. Additionally, the reduction in revenue growth reflects the shift in the mix of branded drugs along with the earlier-than-anticipated launch of generic Nasonex as well as slightly weaker front-store sales trends as we continue to execute on our targeted promotional strategies. We now expect Retail/Long-Term Care revenue growth of 13% to 14.25%, a reduction of 125 basis points on both ends. And we now expect total comps of 1.75% to 3% while continuing to expect script comps of 3.5% to 4.5%. Despite the revenue change, we remain confident in our prior operating profit expectations given the immaterial impact the changes I noted are expected to have on profitability. 
Consolidated net revenue growth is now expected to be 17.5% to 19%. With the increase in network volume and a higher GDR, intercompany revenue eliminations are now expected to be approximately 11.4% of segment revenues. And as the mix of generics increases within our Maintenance Choice product, we expect higher intercompany profit eliminations. This change essentially offsets the improvement in PBM operating profits. And as I said before, our free cash guidance for the full year remains in the range of $5.3 billion to $5.6 billion. 
And with that, now let me provide guidance for the second quarter, which excludes all acquisition-related integration costs. We expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $1.28 to $1.31 per share in the second quarter, reflecting growth of 4.75% to 7.5% versus Q2 of '15. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.17 to $1.20 per share in the second quarter. 
Starting with Analyst Day and continuing with the past several months, we have been highlighting several timing factors that will affect the cadence of profit delivery throughout this year. I want to take a moment and remind you of those factors. The introduction and timing of break-open generics, the timing of profitability in our Medicare Part D business, the timing of the benefits from our strategies to drive growth in their front end, and the timing of share repurchases and certain tax benefits were all factors expected to impact the cadence the most. And while we delivered a strong first quarter, slightly above our own expectations, the cadence of profit growth is still expected to be very much back-half weighted. 
Our EPS guidance for the second quarter is very much in line with our budget and what we said at Analyst Day. All things considered, we see a ramp-up in growth, and we still expect a strong back half of the year. 
Within the Retail segment, we expect revenues to increase 15.5% to 17% versus the second quarter of LY, driven in part by the addition of the acquired businesses. Adjusted script comps are expected to increase in the range of 3% to 4%, while we expect total same-store sales to be up 1.25% to up 2.5%. These were shipped out of Q2, is expected to have about a 20 basis point impact on comp growth. 
In the PBM business, we expect second quarter revenue growth of between 22% and 23.25%, driven by continued strong growth in both volumes and specialty. Consolidated revenues are expected to grow 18.5% to 20%. 
We expect retail operating profit to increase 5% to 7%, and PBM operating profit to increase 4% to 8% in the second quarter. Consolidated operating profit is expected to grow 3.75% to 6.5%. 
In closing, I'm very pleased with our solid first quarter results and remain confident in our full year outlook. As we noted when we gave guidance at Analyst Day, our growth this year will be back-half weighted, and that is playing out just as we anticipated. We continue to expect to deliver solid growth in our core businesses along with the anticipated benefits from our acquisitions, and more importantly, our growth will be very strong at the enterprise level. This growth will help us maintain and generate substantial free cash flow and will continue to execute on our commitment to return significant value to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. 
And with that, I'll now turn it back over to Larry."

And I think some of the next things we're beginning to see is contracting by disease state. So as an example, in the autoimmune category, we might have one rate for drugs that treat rheumatoid arthritis where you have 13 drugs that can treat that condition and a different rate for those same drugs that are prescribed for Crohn's disease, where there's only 4 drugs in that category. So -- and we see similar opportunities in oncology. So I think we're going to continue to see these negotiations and opportunities evolve, and we believe we're very innovative in this area and actually leading the industry."

This is where consumers get connected to CVS, and ultimately, over time, they start using us for prescription. So it's a very important part of the business as consumers think about us. And it's why we've been shifting more and more of our focus towards health and beauty. Because think -- when our customers think about health care, obviously, they think pharmacy first, but they think health and beauty. And so we're in the process, essentially, of putting more and more effort around the health and beauty businesses and our top customers. Those have been the thrust of the 2 places we've spent time and energy. And I'm actually quite pleased with where we are. If you look at our health and beauty categories, for example, we continue to grow share across the marketplace in health and beauty. Now where we're pulling back are the categories Dave was speaking to early -- it's -- earlier. It's the promotional business where it might be edibles or general merchandise, not categories we need to win in from the consumer's perspective as we think about health care. So I think that piece of it is sort of generally how we're thinking about the role of the front. Connected to that is the role of ExtraCare and loyalty and personalization, so we know 30% of our customers drive 80% of our sales and profit. Again, we're focused on those customers giving them more value, more reasons to shop, and we're very happy. So far, we continue to see more trips and more sales and more profits from those customer segments. And then as you said, we certainly are looking very hard at the world of digital. We know that the consumer is living in an omnichannel world, and we need to be relevant. We're excited about curbside because we thought to ourselves, we don't need to out-Amazon Amazon. We certainly have an e-commerce play, but we really wanted to take advantage of 7,800 convenient locations and the fact that when the consumer needs health and beauty aid products or the milk on the way home from work or diapers, we're the convenient go-to-location for her. So the fact that she can order online, let's say, from the office and pick it up on the way home and not have to get out of her car, we think it's a very big winning [indiscernible]. As Larry said, we're still in the early stages of testing that in some markets, but the research we've done with consumers is really quite encouraging."

And so, as we're out in the marketplace, our integrated assets really position us to work with their employees or their members through all the touch points that we have to communicate and transition them to the new plan design.

It applies both clinically as well as operationally. And Maintenance Choice is the only 90-day program that is truly channel-agnostic with the ability to realize the same enterprise economics regardless of the channel that the patient chooses. And our offering is becoming even more relevant with the addition of Target's 1,600 pharmacies into the Maintenance Choice network. And I guess, just one other example of that clinical and operational integration is, as you know, as we've talked about Specialty Connect, which is a more recent rollout, we've simply defined that as a Maintenance Choice product for the specialty patient.

So this program is really, as you can imagine, the 1 million people who signed up for it are basically those patients who are filling roughly 4 prescriptions or more per month. And as we did our research with them, what we saw and heard is their #1 pain point is that they've got a lot of complexity health-care-wise in their lives. Pharmacy is a piece, but there's other elements of it. So they're making lots of trips to the pharmacy, and that's hard for many of them. So a big solve for them is consolidating all of it. The way it works is we help those patients, and we line them up to 1 date per month which they can come in. It sounds simple. But as you can imagine, with all of the insurance plans out there, we've got to work behind the scenes to get them synced up. So that's sort of the hard part behind the solution from a consumer perspective. I think what's exciting for both the patients and the plans that we're serving is that, ultimately, this leads to very high consumer satisfaction and much higher levels of adherence. And that's ultimately the health-care outcome that we were looking for as we developed ScriptSync."

So client's biggest concern when they think about cost, they're really thinking about specialty. And about half of their specialty spend is on the pharmacy benefit, which PBMs historically have managed and the other half of the specialty spend is under the medical benefit, which is not being managed very well today by the health plans, the platforms that they manage specialty medical on just weren't built to manage drugs. So we actually have the capability to manage that benefit across the pharmacy and medical benefit. And we think about unit costs. Larry talked about that, and so size, scale and capabilities really make a difference there. And we're seeing specialty drugs come to market and be limited to a few providers, so our capabilities enable us to have access to those limited distribution drugs. The other side of it is what can we do clinically to manage the 3% of our client's patients that are driving 25% of their overall health-care costs. And so we've integrated a capability that allows us, not to just manage the specialty prescription, but to manage that patient, not just with their specialty condition but with all their comorbidities. And we've demonstrated that we can reduce overall health-care costs. So as we tell that story to clients, it resonates, and it's a -- I think it's a key decision point for them as they're making a selection in the marketplace."

I have one announcement this morning. Our Annual Analyst Day has been scheduled for Thursday, December 15 in New York City. You'll have the opportunity to hear from several members of our senior management team who'll provide a comprehensive update on our strategies for driving long-term growth. We plan to email invitations with more specific details at the end of the summer, but please save the date. Again, that's Thursday, December 15. 
This morning, we posted a slide presentation on our website just before this call. The slides summarize the information in our prepared remarks as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance. 
Later this afternoon, we'll be filing our Form 10-Q, and it will also be available on our website at that time. 
In addition, note that during today's presentation, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities law. By their nature, all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements for a number of reasons as described in our SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section and cautionary statement disclosures in those filings. 
During this call, we'll use some non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company's performance, including free cash flow and adjusted EPS. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP items the comparable GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of our website.

Thanks for joining us, and I'm pleased to have the opportunity to discuss the strong second quarter results we posted today. 
Adjusted earnings per share increased 8.3% to $1.32, that's $0.01 above the high end of our guidance and excluding acquisition-related costs in both years, operating profit increased 6.5% enterprise-wide, with operating profit in the Retail/Long-Term Care segment in line with our expectations and operating profit in the PBM exceeding expectations. 
We generated more than $1.1 billion of free cash during the quarter, more than $2.9 billion year-to-date and as Dave will describe, we are raising our free cash flow target by $1 billion for the year. 
Now given our outperformance this quarter and solid results year to date, we are raising and narrowing our adjusted EPS guidance range. Excluding the costs associated with the debt tender and acquisition-related costs, we currently expect to achieve adjusted EPS for 2016 of $5.81 to $5.89 reflecting year-over-year growth of 12.5% to 14.25% and that compares to our previous range of $5.73 to $5.88, and Dave will discuss this guidance in more detail during his financial review. 
Now let me turn to the business update, and I'll start with the PBM. The marketplace has been active, and I'm pleased to report that with our differentiated value proposition, we see 2017 shaping up to be another successful selling season. 
We currently have gross wins of approximately $7.4 billion and net new business of approximately $4.6 billion. These new business numbers do not include any impact from our individual Med D PDP, I'll touch on that shortly, and I'll also note that only about 7% of the gross wins relate to the previously discussed transition of the Coventry commercial business, which was acquired by Aetna back in 2013. 
Today, we've completed about 75% of our client renewals for '17, that's a bit ahead of where we were at the same time last near and our retention rate is currently at 97.5%. 
Importantly, we have continued to win in the marketplace, while maintaining our pricing discipline. 
Now a lot has been said and written about the competitive dynamics of this selling season, and facts and realities can easily be lost or overlooked amiss the attention being paid to a few client shifts. 
So let me remind you of the things that have not changed in the competitive landscape, along with our ongoing strategic advantages. As you look at our key points of differentiation, we see consumer-directed health care gaining traction and points of access are critical and are more than 9,600 pharmacies give patients immediate access to advice as they take on more responsibility for their health care decisions. And the data has shown the undeniable benefit of the face-to-face interactions for better adherence, reducing health care costs and improving health outcomes. And we have multiple patient touch points through our unique suite of assets, not just our retail pharmacies, but also mail, specialty, infusion, MinuteClinic and now, long-term care. 
At the same time, we're the only company with the ability to impact not only patients, but also payers and providers with our innovative channel-agnostic solutions. Maintenance Choice continues to be a truly integrated program, delivering financial convenience and clinical benefits to clients and members. It's not just about price, it's about enabling clinical programs that require deep integration of data and our health engagement engines serves as data enabler so that products and choice cannot be easily replicated through a partnership or an alliance. 
Additionally, we have the broadest capabilities to holistically manage specialty, which continues to be a key area of focus for clients, and we continue to outperform in this area with specialty revenues increasing 22.9% in the second quarter. 
Clients continue to expect proactive, innovative, realtime solutions to manage their drug trend and the insights tool that we demoed in our last Analyst Day is unmatched, and it delivers those realtime solutions for our clients. 
Furthermore, our scale and innovative purchasing strategies around surpassed, and they continue to drive meaningful value for our clients. 
So in summary, those are just some of the factors that have differentiated us in the past and continue to drive our success this selling season. And we're certainly not sitting still as we continue to find new and innovative ways to drive value for patients, payers and providers. 
I also want to note that we continue to offer our clients cutting edge solutions to formulary management as we believe it is one of the most effective ways to manage rising drug costs, while ensuring access to clinically appropriate care. 
And our 2017 formulary management strategy continues to address emerging cost drivers with new market-leading enhancements, which we have just announced to our clients effective this coming January. 
And given the growing number of supplemental indications from many drugs, we will be creating opportunities for additional client and member savings through an indication-based formulary. 
And on a quarterly basis, products with significant cost inflation that have readily available, clinically appropriate and more cost-effective alternatives may be evaluated and potentially removed from the formulary. 
So effective January 1, 2017, we expect to remove 35 products from our standard formulary, including 10 hyper inflationary products as I just described. Now these formulary changes affect less than 1.5% of plan members, while helping to reduce costs for clients and their members. 
In fact, from 2012 through 2017, this rigorous approach to formulary management will help generate total savings of more than $9 billion for our clients without disrupting member care.  And you can find an overview of our strategy, along with the 2017 formulary details on the Investor Relations portion of our website. 
Now while it's too early to discuss the 2018 selling season, many of you have asked about the timing of the next FEP contract renewal. So let me clarify that the FEP specialty business has a request for information in the marketplace for January 2018. However, the FEP retail and malware businesses, comprising more than 70% of our total FEP revenues of about $9 billion, has been extended until January 2019. 
Before turning to retail, let me touch briefly on our Med D PDP SilverScript. We currently have about 4.1 million captive lives in our individual PDP, about 1.2 million captive EGWP lives, and we serve another 6.4 million lives through our health plan clients.  So in total, we currently serve approximately 11.8 million Med D beneficiaries. 
Late last week, we received the preliminary benchmark results from CMS for 2017, and I'm pleased to report that SilverScript qualified in 32 up to 34 regions. Now these strong benchmark results should enable us to retain the vast majority of the auto-assignees we currently serve, along with the ability to attract new lives, and we're very pleased with these results. 
Now moving on to second quarter results in the Retail/Long-Term Care business. Total same-store sales increased 2.1%, with pharmacy same-store sales up 3.9%. This was negatively impacted by about 355 basis points due to recent generic introductions. Our pharmacy same-store prescription volumes increased 3.5%, that's on a 30-day equivalent basis, continuing to outperform overall market growth. Our Retail Pharmacy market share, again, on a 30-day equivalent basis was 23.9%, and that's up about 230 basis points versus the same quarter a year ago, driven by the inclusion of the Target pharmacies as well as underlying share growth. 
Now I'm pleased to report that the Target integration has been completed ahead of schedule. We converted all of 1,667 Target pharmacies, 79 clinics to CVS systems, programs and interior branding. And this was one of our most smoothest integration ever despite the complexity of the store within a store format, and we certainly appreciate the strong communication and collaboration with our Target partners. 
So with CVS systems and branding now in place, we're ramping up our patient care programs, along with our marketing and member engagement campaigns that are expected to increase awareness and utilization of CVS to Target. 
Our Long-Term Care pharmacy business through Omnicare continues to perform well and in line with our expectations. Our integration efforts are progressing as planned, and we remain on track to complete the vast majority of the integration activities by year-end. 
Now in addition to those integration activities, we're working with our Long-Term Care clients to address the currently unmet needs of their residents, all with the goal of improving patient care and driving operational efficiencies. 
In Q1, we introduced the use of CVS pharmacies to speed the delivery of first bills and emergency needs to the facilities. This program continues to grow, and we now fill nearly half of all emergency scripts using CVS Pharmacy. 
In Q2, we began piloting our transition of care program to enable us to better serve patients as they transition across different care settings, and we also continued to pilot our integrated service offerings to the assisted and independent living communities, offering residents enhanced prescription delivery options based on their preference in key level. 
So while there's still so much work to do, we remain excited about our ability to enhance patient care in these settings. 
Now turning to the front store business, comps decreased 2.5% or 1.7% after adjusting for the negative impact of the shift of Easter from April last year to March of this year. We saw softer customer traffic, which was partially offset by notable increase in basket size. And at the same time, we saw notable front store margin gains in the quarter. 
Now some of the traffic decline was expected as we continue to optimize our promotional spend for our lower value promotionally-oriented customers. 
In contrast, we saw front store spend and margin increase with our most valuable customers. And through our personalization efforts, we continue to deliver a value-based offering, derived from longitudinal shopping habits while increasing engagements through app and email capabilities. 
Now keep in mind that our front store business accounts for about 11% of enterprise revenues, and these personalization efforts are allowing us to invest our promotional spend in a very differentiated way, producing a margin flow through. Now we'll talk more about these efforts at our Analyst Day. 
Now we've also been focused on a mixed shift towards our higher-margin health, beauty and Store Brand categories. We continue to rollout store resets to improve our health and beauty leadership and following last year's health and beauty enhancements across thousands of stores, we continue to scale our healthy food selection, optimize our key categories in the health quadrant and elevate our beauty offerings, while improving shopability. 
Store Brands are another area of significant opportunity. Our Store Brands represented a 21.8% of front store sales in the quarter, and that's up about 85 basis points from the same quarter last year as we continue on our trajectory to a goal of 25%. 
Turning to store openings. In the second quarter, we opened 22 new stores, relocated 9 others, close to 10, resulting in 12 net new stores and we expect to open about 100 net new stores for the full year. 
As for MinuteClinic, we currently operate 1,136 clinics across 33 states plus the District of Columbia. And as I noted earlier, the Target conversion was completed and our nurse practitioner providers are adjusting well to the MinuteClinic scope of services in Epic EHR. 
Now including Target, MinuteClinic revenues increased 15.2% versus the same quarter last year despite mild and late allergy season. 
The Hold My Place In Line online queuing tool that was launched nationality in March continue to gain momentum in Q2 and by the end of the quarter, the use of the tool had increased to 13% of all MinuteClinic business. The customer feedbacks extremely positive and further enhancements are underway to improve the customer experience. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Dave for the financial review."
93625,377278452,1021125,"CVS Health Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","CVS Health Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll provide a detailed review of our second quarter results, followed with an update on our improved guidance. And as I typically do, I'll start first with a summary of the progress we've made in enhancing",2467,"Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll provide a detailed review of our second quarter results, followed with an update on our improved guidance. And as I typically do, I'll start first with a summary of the progress we've made in enhancing shareholder value through our strong capital allocation program. 
During the quarter, we paid $459 million in dividends. Our dividend payout ratio currently stands at 35.5%, but that is artificially high due to a loss on the debt extinguishment we incurred in the second quarter as well as the ongoing integration costs associated with our recent acquisitions. 
On more comparable basis, our payout ratio stands at 31.1%, and we remain well on track to achieve our target of 35% by 2018. 
In addition, we continue to repurchase shares. During the second quarter, we repurchased 18.5 million shares for approximately $1.9 billion or $102.32 per share, and we have now essentially completed our planned $4 billion in repurchases for 2016. 
As I said at our Analyst Day, we expected share repurchases to be front half loaded, and it very much played out that way. 
So between dividends and share repurchases, we returned approximately $2.4 billion to shareholders during this quarter and nearly $4.9 billion year-to-date. We continue to expect to return more than $5 billion to our shareholders in 2016 through both a combination of dividends and share repurchases. 
As Larry mentioned, we generated more than $1.1 billion of free cash in the second quarter, and we have produced more than $2.9 billion year-to-date. We are increasing our full year free cash flow guidance to a range of $6.3 billion to $6.6 billion from the prior range of $5.3 billion to $5.6 billion. This primarily reflects timing in our Medicare Part D SilverScript business as well as overall improvements in the core. 
Basically, healthier members and lower utilization than what we assumed when we submitted our bids are leading to changes in the timing of our cash flows as we expect to continue to be in a payable position with CMS at the end of this year. 
Now turning to our debt. In order to take advantage of the current favorable interest rate environment, during the second quarter, we issued $3.5 billion in debt, refinancing approximately $3.1 billion of outstanding debt through a tender offer transaction. 
As a result, we booked a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $542 million during the quarter. 
Furthermore, last month, we retired an additional $1.1 billion by calling certain debt, and as a result of that, we recorded $102 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt during the third quarter. 
Together, these actions provide an ongoing benefit in terms of lower interest expense going forward. The benefit to 2016 is expected to be in the neighborhood of $50 million. 
Turning to the income statement. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.32 per share, $0.01 above the high end of our guidance range and up 8.3% over LY. 
GAAP diluted EPS was $0.86 per share. The Retail/Long-Term Care segment delivered solid earnings within our expectations, while the PBM segment posted profit growth above the high end of our expectations. The outperformance in the quarter was primarily driven by better purchasing economics in the PBM. 
So with that, let me quickly walk down the P&L. On a consolidated basis, revenues in the second quarter increased 17.6% to $43.7 billion. 
In the PBM segment, net revenues increased 20.7% to $29.5 billion. This growth is largely attributable to the increased volume of pharmacy network claims resulting from the very successful selling season we had last year. 
Additionally, and despite a year-over-year decline in Hep C sales, specialty pharmacy growth has been strong, driven in part by the Omnicare acquisition and the addition of ACS book of business. 
Overall, PBM adjusted claims grew 18.7% in the quarter. Partially offsetting the sales growth was 155 basis point increase in our generic dispensing rate to 85.4%. 
While achieving strong growth year-over-year, the PBM's top line did come in below our expectations. The chief drivers were lower-than-expected specialty revenues from the continued year-over-year decline in Hep C prescription volume due to lower new patient starts and fewer days of therapy. 
In our Retail/Long-Term Care business, revenues increased 16% in the quarter to approximately $20 billion, driven by the addition of Omnicare and the pharmacies within Target as well as solid pharmacy same-store sales. 
GDR increased by approximately 110 basis points to 86.1%, partially offsetting this increase. 
Turning to gross margin. Operating expenses, operating profit and the tax rate where applicable the numbers I am citing exclude non-GAAP adjustments in both current and prior periods in which we have reconciled for you on our website. Keep in mind that our guidance for the quarter also excluded those items. Gross [indiscernible] consolidated company increased to healthy 9.7% versus the same quarter of last year. Consolidated gross margins contracted approximately 115 basis points compared to Q2 of '15 to 16.1%. 
Within the PBM segment, gross margin contracted by approximately 45 basis points versus Q2 of '15 to 4.6%, primarily attributable to the mix of business and continued pricing compression, partially offset by the GDR improvement and favorable purchasing economics. 
However, gross profit dollars in the PBM increased 10.2% year-over-year, primarily due to strong claims growth, membership growth in SilverScript, improvements in GDR and favorable purchasing economics. Of course, partially offsetting these drivers was continued price compression in the market. 
In the Retail/Long-Term Care segment, gross margin declined approximately 165 basis points to 29.2%, about 40% of the decline in gross margin rate was mix driven due to the acquisitions. Lower reimbursement rates also continue to pressure margins. Partially offsetting those pressures were increasing generic dispensing rates as well as increased front store margins as we continue to rationalize our promotional strategies and improve our mix of products sold. 
Gross profit dollars increased 9.8% year-over-year in the Retail/Long-Term Care segment, largely driven by the addition of Omnicare and Target businesses. 
Turning to expenses. We saw strong improvement in total operating expenses as a percentage of revenue from Q2 of '15 to 10.5%. The PBM segment's SG&A rate improved about 10 basis points to 1.1%, benefiting from the additional sales leverage from the volume increases. 
SG&A as a percent of sales in the Retail/Long-Term Care segment improved significantly by approximately 85 basis points to 20.3%. This 2 was driven by leverage from revenue growth as well as the addition of the Omnicare business, which carries a lower SG&A rate relative to sales. 
Within the Corporate segment, expenses were up approximately $25 million to $220 million, slightly better than our expectations. 
Consistent with our expectations, operating margin for the total enterprise decreased approximately 60 basis points in the quarter to 5.6%. Operating margin at PBM decreased approximately 35 basis points to 3.5%, while operating margin at Retail/Long-Term Care decreased approximately 80 basis points to 8.9%. 
For the quarter, operating profit growth in the operating segments and at the enterprise level was in line with or better than expectations. With the PBM increasing 10.5%, Retail/Long-Term Care growing at 6.2% and consolidated operating profit growing at 6.5%.  Consolidated EBITDA was up 9.8% over LY to $3 billion. 
Going below the line of consolidated income statement. Net interest expense in the quarter increased approximately $150 million from last year to $280 million due primarily to the debt issued in the third quarter of '15 to fund the acquisitions we made last year. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 39.3% and our weighted average share count was 1.1 billion shares. 
So with that, now let me update you on our guidance. I'll focus on the highlights. You can find the additional details of our guidance on the slide presentation that we posted on our website earlier this morning. 
As Larry said, we are narrowing and raising our 2016 adjusted earnings per share range to $5.81 to $5.89 from a range of -- from a prior range of $5.73 to $5.88, which reflects strong year-over-year growth of 12.5% to 14.25%. We have raised the midpoint by $0.045, reflecting the positive impact of the interest benefit derived from the debt extinguishment as well as our outperformance in the second quarter. 
With respect to GAAP diluted EPS, in addition to narrowing the range and layering the benefits from interest in the second quarter outperformance, we are revising our full year guidance to also reflect a couple of additional items. One is the integration cost that we saw in the second quarter, which we explicitly excluded from our guidance on the last earnings call. These costs totaled approximately $81 million pretax. The other is the losses on the early extinguishment of debt that we completed in both the second quarter and now, the third quarter. Those losses totaled $644 million pretax. So we now expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.92 to $5 per share. 
Keep in mind that our GAAP guidance for future periods continues to exclude the impact of acquisition-related integration cost, and we will update [indiscernible] cost that we incur as the year progresses. 
Before I continue, let me remind you that the following guidance excludes all acquisition-related integration costs. In the PBM segment, we are decreasing revenue guidance to a range of 21% to 22%, reducing the midpoint by 100 basis points. This decrease takes into account lower-than-anticipated volume of hep C as well as an associated reduction in days of therapy. 
At the same time, we are raising the midpoint of the PBM's operating profit guidance range by about 2.5 percentage points to account for the outperformance in the second quarter as well as continued expectations for better purchasing economics over the course of the remainder of the year. This results in a new range of 13.5% to 15.5%. 
In the Retail/Long-Term Care segment, we are narrowing guidance for revenue growth by taking the top end of the range down by 50 basis points. The reduction in the high end mainly reflects our performance in the second quarter as well as slightly weaker front-store sales trends as we continue to execute on our targeted promotional strategies. We now expect Retail/Long-Term Care revenue growth of 13% to 13.75% and total cost of 1.75% to 2.5%, while continuing to expect scripts comps of 3.5% to 4.5%. 
Despite the revenue change, we remain confident in our prior profit expectations given the in material impact the changes I noted are expected to have on profitability. We are narrowing the range to take into account our performance in the second quarter. 
So we now expect Retail/Long-Term Care operating profit growth of 6.75% to 8%. Consolidated net revenue growth is now expected to be 17% to 17.75% and our company revenue eliminations are now expected to be approximately 11.6% of segment revenues, and we expect higher intercompany profit eliminations. 
And as I said before, we are increasing our free cash flow guidance for the year by $1 billion to a range of $6.3 billion to $6.6 billion. 
Now let me provide guidance for the third quarter, which, again, excludes all acquisition-related integration costs. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.55 to $1.58 per share in the third quarter, reflecting growth of 21% to 23.75% versus Q3 of '15. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.38 to $1.41 per share in the third quarter, which includes a $102 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt that we completed in July. 
At the risk of sounding a little bit like a broken record, I want to take a moment to remind you of several timing factors we have been highlighting since Analyst Day that affect cadence of profit delivery throughout the year. The introduction and timing of break-open generics, the timing of profitability in our Medicare Part D business, the timing the benefits from our strategies to drive profitability in the front-end, the timing of share repurchases and certain tax benefits were all factors expected to impact the cadence. And while we have delivered 2 strong quarter slightly above our own expectations, the cadence of profit growth is still expected to be very much back-half weighted. Our EPS guidance for the third quarter is very much in line with what we said at Analyst Day. All things considered, we see a ramp up in growth in Q3, and we still expect a strong back half to the year. 
As we seen in years past, the timing of Medicare Part D profits in the third quarter remains difficult to forecast since this is the time period where the risksharing quarter is usually least effective at providing risksharing protection. Thus, changes in any current estimates such as utilization, significantly impacts our timing of profits between the third and fourth quarters. This forecasting challenges is compounded by the significant growth in this business. We've made our best estimate and included those in our guidance but keep in mind that there could be a shift the margin between the third and fourth quarters. 
Additionally, the tax benefits I mentioned are forecast to occur in the fourth quarter. If those come earlier, that will obviously benefit the third quarter at the expense of the fourth. We'll update everyone on the final timing of these, again, when we report our results. 
So within the Retail/Long-Term Care segment, we expect revenues to increase 11.5% to 13% versus the third quarter of LY, driven in large part by the addition of the acquired businesses, although sequentially, you'll note a step down due to the mid-August anniversary of the closing of the Omnicare acquisition. 
Adjusted scripts comps are expected to increase in the range of 3% to 4%, while we expect total same-store sales to be up 1% to up 2.25%. 
In the PBM, we expect third quarter revenue growth of between 21.25% to 22.5%, driven by continued strong growth in volumes, Medicare Part C and non-hep C specialty. 
Consolidated revenues are expected to growth 16.5% to 17.75%. We expect the sequential increase in operating profit growth due to the impact of the timing of this year's generic, notably Crestor,  [indiscernible], GLUMETZA are all breaking open this quarter. 
As a result, we expect retail operating profit to increase 10% to 12% and PBM modeling profit to increase 20.25% to 24.25% in the third quarter. 
Consolidated operating profit is expected to grow 14.75% to 17.5%. 
So in summary, we posted strong growth year-to-date. Our 2016 outlook is strong across the enterprise, and we expect to generate very significant free cash this year. We remain committed to using this cash to drive returns for our shareholders through value-enhancing investments, dividends and share repurchases. 
And with that, I'll now turn it back over to Larry."

We're seeing even stronger movement into exclusive specialty and a higher utilization of our specialty formulas. And clients across our --, again, both health plans and employers are becoming even more aggressive with all of our formulas strategies. So Larry talked about our standard formulary option that we offer clients, good uptake of that, but we even have more aggressive formularies, advanced control and Value Formularies that we continue to see increased interest in. And then our integrated programs like Maintenance Choice, Specialty Connect and Pharmacy Advisor are becoming even more important as people not only look at the unit cost in pharmacy but also how pharmacy can help reduce overall health care costs, so strong adoption on those programs as well. And so I think it's been -- as I look at this new business mix and wins and profitability, I think it's pretty consistent with what we've seen over the last couple of years."

And you see more people and consumer-directed health plan, you see more care being chosen individually when you think about some of the government-sponsored care with Medicare and that points to the value associated with multiple consumer touch points.

So you combine that with the ability to touch the consumer in multiple different ways, and we think that, that is our value proposition that will increase its importance and that has a lot allowed us to bring products into the marketplace that can impact patients, payers and providers."

I'll start off here. As you know, the health plan business, it's a little different than the employer business, whereas, in the employer business, typically a benefit manager can make a decision for the population uniquely and those programs can be implemented pretty rapidly. In the health plan business, even despite a health plan, let's say Chief Medical Officer wanting to adopt one of programs, they need to enter and go and sell that through their book of business or in some cases, in the Medicare book of business, the ramp up of shares are just a little slower. So think about it starting off pretty thin margins in that ramping up over time and the cadence of that is probably little slower than the employer book business."

In Medicaid, we see very aggressively clients narrowing their network. With the fully insured book of business, they have to work through the Department of Insurance and historically have opted for consumer choice broad networks. We do see that changing. And for the self-insured, that's no different than our employer clients. So it's really arming them with programs and incentives to sell that into their employer book of business. So it does move slower as Dave said, but we're confident it will move, and we're confident we can grow share."

So first, we've got our normal therapeutic review that we started back in 2012, and that's all about making sure we have cost-effective medications for our clients and their members, and we've been able to deliver the $9 billion in savings that Larry talked about. And over the last several years, we've been able to negotiate price protection into those contracts. So if a manufacturer raises a price over a predetermined threshold, that comes back to client in the form of a rebate and lowers their price. What we introduced this year is indication-based formulary. So think about hepatitis C that has 6 different genotypes, the genotypes are different. So we will have different formulary options based on the genotype or in the case of autoimmune, you have the same drug that treats psoriasis and RA. We may have a different preferred product for psoriasis than we do for rheumatoid arthritis. And the third dynamic is really hyperinflation. We looked at drugs that had a 3-year cumulative WACC increase of greater than 200% and we've taken on kind of those drugs this year and our goal is either we're not going to cover or we're going to get the economics back prior to these WACC increases that they took. And for biosimilars, I think it's just part of that theme. How can we get the lowest cost-effective drugs for our clients to provide as a benefit to their members, and we think biosimilars will be an opportunity. Now when you look at biosimilars, most of the pipeline is still with biosimilars under the medical benefit with the exception of Humira, but we'll continue to look -- to make decisions that are at the best interest of our clients and their members."

The second is around all the member engagement efforts that we've got going on and these are essentially targeted at our members through the PBM.

Later this afternoon, we'll be filing our Form 10-Q, and it will also be available on our website at that time. 
In addition, note that during today's presentation, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities law. By their nature, all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements for a number of reasons as described in our SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section and cautionary statement disclosures in those filings. 
During this call, we'll use some non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company's performance, including free cash flow and adjusted EPS. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find the reconciliations of these non-GAAP items to comparable GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of our website. And as always, today's call is being simulcast on our website, and it will be archived there following the call for 1 year. 
Now I'll turn this over to Larry Merlo."

Thanks, Nancy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us, and I'm pleased to have the opportunity to discuss the strong second quarter results we posted today. Adjusted earnings per share increased 8.3% to $1.32, that's $0.01 above the hig",1977,"Okay. Thanks, Nancy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us, and I'm pleased to have the opportunity to discuss the strong second quarter results we posted today. 
Adjusted earnings per share increased 8.3% to $1.32, that's $0.01 above the high end of our guidance. And excluding acquisition-related costs in both years, operating profit increased 6.5% enterprise-wide, with operating profit in the Retail/Long-Term Care segment in line with our expectations and operating profit in the PBM exceeding expectations. 
We generated more than $1.1 billion of free cash during the quarter, more than $2.9 billion year-to-date, and as Dave will describe, we are raising our free cash flow target by $1 billion for the year. 
Now given our outperformance this quarter and solid results year-to-date, we are raising and narrowing our adjusted EPS guidance range. Excluding the costs associated with the debt tender and acquisition-related costs, we currently expect to achieve adjusted EPS for 2016 of $5.81 to $5.89, reflecting year-over-year growth of 12.5% to 14.25%, and that compares to our previous range of $5.73 to $5.88, and Dave will discuss this guidance in more detail during his financial review. 
Now let me turn to the business update, and I'll start with the PBM. The marketplace has been active, and I'm pleased to report that with our differentiated value proposition, we see 2017 shaping up to be another successful selling season. 
We currently have gross wins of approximately $7.4 billion and net new business of approximately $4.6 billion. These new business numbers do not include any impact from our individual Med D PDP, I'll touch on that shortly, and I'd also note that only about 7% of the gross wins relate to the previously discussed transition of the Coventry commercial business, which was acquired by Aetna back in 2013. 
To date, we've completed about 75% of our client renewals for '17. That's a bit ahead of where we were at the same time last year, and our retention rate is currently at 97.5%. 
Importantly, we have continued to win in the marketplace, while maintaining our pricing discipline. 
Now a lot has been said and written about the competitive dynamics of this selling season, and facts and realities can easily be lost or overlooked amidst the attention being paid to a few client shifts. 
So let me remind you of the things that have not changed in the competitive landscape, along with our ongoing strategic advantages. As you look at our key points of differentiation, we see consumer-directed health care gaining traction and points of access are critical, and our more than 9,600 pharmacies give patients immediate access to advice as they take on more responsibility for their health care decisions. And the data has shown the undeniable benefit of the face-to-face interactions for better adherence, reducing health care costs and improving health outcomes. And we have multiple patient touch points through our unique suite of assets, not just our retail pharmacies, but also mail, specialty, infusion, MinuteClinic and now long-term care. 
At the same time, we're the only company with the ability to impact not only patients, but also payers and providers, with our innovative channel agnostic solutions. Maintenance Choice continues to be a truly integrated program, delivering financial, convenience and clinical benefits to clients and members. It's not just about price, it's about enabling clinical programs that require deep integration of data. And our Health Engagement Engine serves as data enabler, so that products like Maintenance Choice cannot easily be replicated through a partnership or an alliance. 
Additionally, we have the broadest capabilities to holistically manage specialty, which continues to be a key area of focus for clients, and we continue to outperform in this area with specialty revenues increasing 22.9% in the second quarter. 
Clients continue to expect proactive, innovative, realtime solutions to manage their drug trend. And the insights tool that we demoed at our last Analyst Day is unmatched, and it delivers those realtime solutions for our clients. 
Furthermore, our scale and innovative purchasing strategies are unsurpassed, and they continue to drive meaningful value for our clients. 
So in summary, those are just some of the factors that have differentiated us in the past and continue to drive our success this selling season. And we're certainly not sitting still as we continue to find new and innovative ways to drive value for patients, payers and providers. 
I also want to note that we continue to offer our clients cutting-edge solutions to formulary management, as we believe it is one of the most effective ways to manage rising drug costs, while ensuring access to clinically appropriate care. 
And our 2017 formulary management strategy continues to address emerging cost drivers with new market-leading enhancements, which we have just announced to our clients effective this coming January. 
And given the growing number of supplemental indications for many drugs, we will be creating opportunities for additional client and member savings through an indication-based formulary. 
And on a quarterly basis, products with significant cost inflation that have readily available, clinically appropriate and more cost-effective alternatives may be evaluated and potentially removed from the formulary. 
So effective January 1, 2017, we expect to remove 35 products from our standard formulary, including 10 hyper inflationary products, as I just described. These formulary changes affect less than 1.5% of plan members, while helping to reduce costs for clients and their members. 
In fact, from 2012 through 2017, this rigorous approach to formulary management will help generate total savings of more than $9 billion for our clients without disrupting member care.  And you can find an overview of our strategy, along with the 2017 formulary details on the Investor Relations portion of our website. 
Now while it's too early to discuss the 2018 selling season, many of you've asked about the timing of the next FEP contract renewal. So let me clarify that the FEP specialty business has a Request for Information in the marketplace for January 2018. However, the FEP retail and mail order businesses comprising more than 70% of our total FEP revenues of about $9 billion, has been extended until January 2019. 
Before turning to retail, let me touch briefly on our Med D PDP SilverScript. We currently have about 4.1 million captive lives in our individual PDP, about 1.2 million captive EGWP lives, and we serve another 6.4 million lives through our health plan clients.  So in total, we currently serve approximately 11.8 million Med D beneficiaries. 
Late last week, we received the preliminary benchmark results from CMS for 2017, and I'm pleased to report that SilverScript qualified in 32 of the 34 regions. These strong benchmark results should enable us to retain the vast majority of the auto-assignees we currently serve, along with the ability to attract new lives, and we're very pleased with these results. 
Now moving on to second quarter results in the Retail/Long-Term Care business. Total same-store sales increased 2.1%, with pharmacy same-store sales up 3.9%. This was negatively impacted by about 355 basis points due to recent generic introductions. Our pharmacy same-store prescription volumes increased 3.5%, that's on a 30-day equivalent basis, continuing to outperform overall market growth. Our retail pharmacy market share, again, on a 30-day equivalent basis was 23.9%, and that's up about 230 basis points versus the same quarter a year ago, driven by the inclusion of the Target pharmacies as well as underlying share growth. 
Now I'm pleased to report that the Target integration has been completed ahead of schedule. We converted all of 1,667 Target pharmacies, 79 clinics to CVS systems, programs and interior branding. And this was one of our most smoothest integrations ever, despite the complexity of the store-within-a-store format, and we certainly appreciate the strong communication and collaboration with our Target partners. 
So with CVS systems and branding now in place, we're ramping up our patient care programs, along with our marketing and member engagement campaigns that are expected to increase awareness and utilization of CVS to Target. 
Our Long-Term Care pharmacy business through Omnicare continues to perform well and in line with our expectations. Our integration efforts are progressing as planned, and we remain on track to complete the vast majority of the integration activities by year-end. 
Now in addition to those integration activities, we're working with our Long-Term Care clients to address the currently unmet needs of their residents, all with the goal of improving patient care and driving operational efficiencies. 
In Q1, we introduced the use of CVS pharmacies to speed the delivery of first bills and emergency needs to the facilities. This program continues to grow, and we now fill nearly half of all emergency scripts using a CVS pharmacy. 
In Q2, we began piloting our transition of care program to enable us to better serve patients as they transition across different care settings, and we also continue to pilot our integrated service offerings to the assisted and independent living communities, offering residents enhanced prescription delivery options based on their preference and acuity level. 
So while there's still much work to do, we remain excited about our ability to enhance patient care in these settings. 
Now turning to the front store business, comps decreased 2.5% or 1.7% after adjusting for the negative impact of the shift of Easter from April last year to March of this year. We saw softer customer traffic, which was partially offset by a notable increase in basket size. And at the same time, we saw notable front store margin gains in the quarter. 
Now some of the traffic decline was expected as we continue to optimize our promotional spend for our lower-value, promotionally oriented customers. 
In contrast, we saw front store spend and margin increase with our most valuable customers. And through our personalization efforts, we continue to deliver a value-based offering derived from longitudinal shopping habits, while increasing engagement through app and email capabilities. 
Now keep in mind that our front store business accounts for about 11% of enterprise revenues, and these personalization efforts are allowing us to invest our promotional spend in a very differentiated way, producing a margin flow-through. And we'll talk more about these efforts at our Analyst Day. 
Now we've also been focused on a mixed shift towards our higher-margin health, beauty and Store Brand categories. We continue to roll out store resets to improve our health and beauty leadership and following last year's health and beauty enhancements across thousands of stores, we continue to scale our healthy food selection, optimize our key categories in the health quadrant and elevate our beauty offerings, while improving shopability. 
Store Brands are another area of significant opportunity. Our Store Brands represented a 21.8% of front store sales in the quarter, and that's up about 85 basis points from the same quarter last year as we continue on our trajectory to a goal of 25%. 
Turning to store openings. In the second quarter, we opened 22 new stores, relocated 9 others, closed 10, resulting in 12 net new stores, and we expect to open about 100 net new stores for the full year. 
As for MinuteClinic, we currently operate 1,136 clinics across 33 states plus the District of Columbia. And as I noted earlier, the Target conversion was completed, and our nurse practitioner providers are adjusting well to the MinuteClinic scope of services in Epic EHR. 
Now including Target, MinuteClinic revenues increased 15.2% versus the same quarter last year despite a mild and late allergy season. 
The Hold My Place In Line online queuing tool that was launched nationally in March continued to gain momentum in Q2, and by the end of the quarter, the use of the tool had increased to 13% of all MinuteClinic business. The customer feedback is extremely positive and further enhancements are underway to improve the customer experience. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Dave for the financial review."
93625,377278452,1021458,"CVS Health Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","CVS Health Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll provide a detailed review of our second quarter results, followed with an update on our improved guidance. And as I typically do, I'll start first with a summary of the progress we've made in enhancing",2471,"Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll provide a detailed review of our second quarter results, followed with an update on our improved guidance. And as I typically do, I'll start first with a summary of the progress we've made in enhancing shareholder value through our strong capital allocation program. 
During the quarter, we paid $459 million in dividends. Our dividend payout ratio currently stands at 35.5%, but that is artificially high due to a loss on the debt extinguishment we incurred in the second quarter as well as the ongoing integration costs associated with our recent acquisitions. 
On more comparable basis, our payout ratio stands at 31.1%, and we remain well on track to achieve our target of 35% by 2018. 
In addition, we have continued to repurchase shares. During the second quarter, we repurchased 18.5 million shares for approximately $1.9 billion or $102.32 per share, and we have now essentially completed our planned $4 billion in repurchases for 2016. 
As I said at our Analyst Day, we expected share repurchases to be front-half loaded, and it very much played out that way. 
So between dividends and share repurchases, we returned approximately $2.4 billion to shareholders during this quarter and nearly $4.9 billion year-to-date. We continue to expect to return more than $5 billion to our shareholders in 2016 through both a combination of dividends and share repurchases. 
As Larry mentioned, we generated more than $1.1 billion of free cash in the second quarter, and we have produced more than $2.9 billion year-to-date. We are increasing our full year free cash flow guidance to a range of $6.3 billion to $6.6 billion from the prior range of $5.3 billion to $5.6 billion. This primarily reflects timing in our Medicare Part D SilverScript business as well as overall improvements in the core. 
Basically, healthier members and lower utilization than what we assumed when we submitted our bids are leading to changes in the timing of our cash flows, as we expect to continue to be in a payable position with CMS at the end of this year. 
Now turning to our debt. In order to take advantage of the current favorable interest rate environment, during the second quarter, we issued $3.5 billion in debt, refinancing approximately $3.1 billion of outstanding debt through a tender offer transaction. 
As a result, we booked a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $542 million during the quarter. 
Furthermore, last month, we retired an additional $1.1 billion by calling certain debt, and as a result of that, we recorded $102 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt during the third quarter. 
Together, these actions provide an ongoing benefit in terms of lower interest expense going forward. The benefit to 2016 is expected to be in the neighborhood of $50 million. 
Turning to the income statement. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.32 per share, $0.01 above the high end of our guidance range and up 8.3% over LY. 
GAAP diluted EPS was $0.86 per share. The Retail/Long-Term Care segment delivered solid earnings within our expectations, while the PBM segment posted profit growth above the high end of our expectations. The outperformance in the quarter was primarily driven by better purchasing economics in the PBM. 
So with that, let me quickly walk down the P&L. On a consolidated basis, revenues in the second quarter increased 17.6% to $43.7 billion. 
In the PBM segment, net revenues increased 20.7% to $29.5 billion. This growth is largely attributable to the increased volume of pharmacy network claims resulting from the very successful selling season we had last year. 
Additionally, and despite a year-over-year decline in Hep C sales, specialty pharmacy growth has been strong, driven in part by the Omnicare acquisition and the addition of its ACS book of business. 
Overall, PBM adjusted claims grew 18.7% in the quarter. Partially offsetting the sales growth was 155 basis point increase in our generic dispensing rate to 85.4%. 
While achieving strong growth year-over-year, the PBM's top line did come in below our expectations. The chief drivers were lower-than-expected specialty revenues from the continued year-over-year decline in Hep C prescription volume due to lower new patient starts and fewer days of therapy. 
In our Retail/Long-Term Care business, revenues increased 16% in the quarter to approximately $20 billion, driven by the addition of Omnicare and the pharmacies within Target as well as solid pharmacy same-store sales. 
GDR increased by approximately 110 basis points to 86.1%, partially offsetting this increase. 
Turning to gross margin. Operating expenses, operating profit and a tax rate where applicable, the numbers I am citing exclude non-GAAP adjustments in both current and prior periods, which we have reconciled for you on our website. Keep in mind that our guidance for the quarter also excluded those items. Gross [indiscernible] consolidated company increased to healthy 9.7% versus the same quarter of last year. Consolidated gross margins contracted approximately 115 basis points compared to Q2 of '15 to 16.1%. 
Within the PBM segment, gross margin contracted by approximately 45 basis points versus Q2 of '15 to 4.6%, primarily attributable to the mix of business and continued pricing compression, partially offset by the GDR improvement and favorable purchasing economics. 
However, gross profit dollars in the PBM increased 10.2% year-over-year, primarily due to strong claims growth, membership growth in SilverScript, improved -- improvements in GDR and favorable purchasing economics. Of course, partially offsetting these drivers was continued price compression in the market. 
In the Retail/Long-Term Care segment, gross margin declined approximately 165 basis points to 29.2%. About 40% of the decline in gross margin rate was mix driven due to the acquisitions. Lower reimbursement rates also continued to pressure margins. Partially offsetting those pressures were increasing generic dispensing rates as well as increased front store margins as we continue to rationalize our promotional strategies and improve our mix of products sold. 
Gross profit dollars increased 9.8% year-over-year in the Retail/Long-Term Care segment, largely driven by the addition of Omnicare and Target businesses. 
Turning to expenses. We saw strong improvement in total operating expenses as a percentage of revenue from Q2 of '15 to 10.5%. The PBM segment's SG&A rate improved about 10 basis points to 1.1%, benefiting from the additional sales leverage from the volume increases. 
SG&A as a percent of sales in the Retail/Long-Term Care segment improved significantly by approximately 85 basis points to 20.3%. This, too, was driven by leverage from revenue growth as well as the addition of the Omnicare business, which carries a lower SG&A rate relative to sales. 
Within the Corporate segment, expenses were up approximately $25 million to $220 million, slightly better than our expectations. 
Consistent with our expectations, operating margin for the total enterprise decreased approximately 60 basis points in the quarter to 5.6%. Operating margin at PBM decreased approximately 35 basis points to 3.5%, while operating margin at Retail/Long-Term Care decreased approximately 80 basis points to 8.9%. 
For the quarter, operating profit growth in the operating segments and at the enterprise level was in line with or better than expectations. With the PBM increasing 10.5%, Retail/Long-Term Care growing at 6.2% and consolidated operating profit growing at 6.5%.  Consolidated EBITDA was up 9.8% over LY to $3 billion. 
Going below the line of consolidated income statement, net interest expense in the quarter increased approximately $150 million from last year to $280 million due primarily to the debt issued in the third quarter of '15 to fund the acquisitions we made last year. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 39.3%, and our weighted average share count was 1.1 billion shares. 
So with that, now let me update you on our guidance. I'll focus on the highlights. You can find the additional details of our guidance on the slide presentation that we posted on our website earlier this morning. 
As Larry said, we are narrowing and raising our 2016 adjusted earnings per share range to $5.81 to $5.89 from a range of -- from a prior range of $5.73 to $5.88, which reflects strong year-over-year growth of 12.5% to 14.25%. We have raised the midpoint by $0.045, reflecting the positive impact of the interest benefit derived from the debt extinguishment as well as our outperformance in the second quarter. 
With respect to GAAP diluted EPS, in addition to narrowing the range and layering the benefits from interest in the second quarter outperformance, we are revising our full year guidance to also reflect a couple of additional items. One is the integration cost that we saw in the second quarter, which we explicitly excluded from our guidance on the last earnings call. These costs totaled approximately $81 million pretax. The other is the losses on the early extinguishment of debt that we completed in both the second quarter and now the third quarter. Those losses totaled $644 million pretax. So we now expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.92 to $5 per share. 
Keep in mind that our GAAP guidance for future periods continues to exclude the impact of acquisition-related integration costs, and we will update those costs that we incur as the year progresses. 
Before I continue, let me remind you that the following guidance excludes all acquisition-related integration costs. In the PBM segment, we are decreasing revenue guidance to a range of 21% to 22%, reducing the midpoint by 100 basis points. This decrease takes into account lower-than-anticipated volume of hep C as well as an associated reduction in days of therapy. 
At the same time, we are raising the midpoint of the PBM's operating profit guidance range by about 2.5 percentage points to account for the outperformance in the second quarter as well as continued expectations for better purchasing economics over the course of the remainder of the year. This results in a new range of 13.5% to 15.5%. 
In the Retail/Long-Term Care segment, we are narrowing guidance for revenue growth by taking the top end of the range down by 50 basis points. The reduction in the high end mainly reflects our performance in the second quarter as well as slightly weaker front-store sales trends as we continue to execute on our targeted promotional strategies. We now expect Retail/Long-Term Care revenue growth of 13% to 13.75% and total cost of 1.75% to 2.5%, while continuing to expect script comps of 3.5% to 4.5%. 
Despite the revenue change, we remain confident in our prior operating profit expectations, given the immaterial impact the changes I noted are expected to have on profitability. We are narrowing the range to take into account our performance in the second quarter. 
So we now expect Retail/Long-Term Care operating profit growth of 6.75% to 8%. Consolidated net revenue growth is now expected to be 17% to 17.75% and our company revenue eliminations are now expected to be approximately 11.6% of segment revenues, and we expect higher intercompany profit eliminations. 
And as I said before, we are increasing our free cash flow guidance for the year by $1 billion to a range of $6.3 billion to $6.6 billion. 
Now let me provide guidance for the third quarter, which, again, excludes all acquisition-related integration costs. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.55 to $1.58 per share in the third quarter, reflecting growth of 21% to 23.75% versus Q3 of '15. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.38 to $1.41 per share in the third quarter, which includes a $102 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt that we completed in July. 
At the risk of sounding a little bit like a broken record, I want to take a moment to remind you of several timing factors we have been highlighting since Analyst Day that affect the cadence of profit delivery throughout the year. The introduction and timing of break-open generics, the timing of profitability in our Medicare Part D business, the timing of the benefits from our strategies to drive profitability in the front-end, the timing of share repurchases and certain tax benefits were all factors expected to impact the cadence. And while we have delivered 2 strong quarters slightly above our own expectations, the cadence of profit growth is still expected to be very much back-half weighted. Our EPS guidance for the third quarter is very much in line with what we said at Analyst Day. All things considered, we see a ramp-up in growth in Q3, and we still expect a strong back half to the year. 
As we've seen in years past, the timing of Medicare Part D profits in the third quarter remains difficult to forecast, since this is the time period where the risk-sharing quarter is usually least effective at providing risk-sharing protection. Thus, changes in any current estimates such as utilization, significantly impacts our timing of profits between the third and fourth quarters. This forecasting challenges is compounded by the significant growth in this business. We've made our best estimates and included those in our guidance, but keep in mind that there could be a shift of margin between the third and fourth quarters. 
Additionally, the tax benefits I've mentioned are forecast to occur in the fourth quarter. If those come earlier, that will obviously benefit the third quarter at the expense of the fourth. We'll update everyone on the final timing of these, again, when we report our results. 
So within the Retail/Long-Term Care segment, we expect revenues to increase 11.5% to 13% versus the third quarter of LY, driven in large part by the addition of the acquired businesses, although sequentially, you'll note a step-down due to the mid-August anniversary of the closing of the Omnicare acquisition. 
Adjusted script comps are expected to increase in the range of 3% to 4%, while we expect total same-store sales to be up 1% to up 2.25%. 
In the PBM, we expect third quarter revenue growth of between 21.25% to 22.5%, driven by continued strong growth in volumes, Medicare Part C and non-Hep C specialty. 
Consolidated revenues are expected to growth 16.5% to 17.75%. We expect the sequential increase in operating profit growth due to the impact of the timing of this year's generic introductions, notably Crestor, Gleevec, Glumetza, are all breaking open in this quarter. 
As a result, we expect retail operating profit to increase 10% to 12% and PBM operating profit to increase 20.25% to 24.25% in the third quarter. 
Consolidated operating profit is expected to grow 14.75% to 17.5%. 
So in summary, we posted strong growth year-to-date. Our 2016 outlook is strong across the enterprise, and we expect to generate very significant free cash this year. We remain committed to using this cash to drive returns for our shareholders through value-enhancing investments, dividends and share repurchases. 
And with that, I'll now turn it back over to Larry."

And clients across our, again, both health plans and employers are becoming even more aggressive with all of our formulary strategies. So Larry talked about our standard formulary option that we offer clients, good uptake of that, but we even have more aggressive formularies, advanced control and value formularies that we continue to see increased interest in. And then our integrated programs like Maintenance Choice, Specialty Connect and Pharmacy Advisor are becoming even more important as people not only look at the unit cost in pharmacy but also how pharmacy can help reduce overall health care costs. So strong adoption of those programs as well. And so I think it's been -- as I look at this new business mix and wins and profitability, I think it's pretty consistent with what we've seen over the last couple of years."

At the same time, back to your question, if you ask why we've been successful and why we expect to continue to be successful, we continue to see this retailization of health care. And you see more people and consumer-directed health plan, you see more care being chosen individually when you think about some of the government-sponsored care with Medicare and that points to the value associated with multiple consumer touch points. And I touched on those in our prepared remarks that yes, there's 9,600 retail consumer touch points. We've got 80% of the U.S. population that lives within a couple miles of one of our stores, along with MinuteClinic assets and specialty and mail and infusion and now, Long-Term Care. And we have created a true level of integration across these different assets. And Ross, you remember years ago, we were talking about the consumer engagement engine, which we now refer to as the health engagement engine, and it's a piece of technology that connects the dots with these various capabilities so that it's not just about collecting data, it's about how we use that data to affect an outcome. So you combine that with the ability to touch the consumer in multiple different ways, and we think that, that is our value proposition that will increase in importance and that has allowed us to bring products into the marketplace that can impact patients, payers and providers."

In Medicaid, we see very aggressively clients narrowing their network. With the fully insured book of business, they have to work through the Department of Insurance and they historically have opted for consumer choice broad networks. We do see that changing. And for the self-insured, that's no different than our employer clients. So it's really arming them with programs and incentives to sell that into their employer book of business.

So what we've really been focused on is the personalization strategy that Larry talked about and essentially investing in those customers because we can see from the data where we have upside with them. And we segment them either from a value perspective sometimes or we look at them in terms of their shopping behavior. So we might like that beauty enthusiasts who, for example, tend to be less promotionally-oriented and are very focused on new items and what's hot and relevant for them and that might be very different than food and family loyalists who are looking for different kinds of offers and strategies. So for us, it's all about getting at a very micro level and giving them targeted offers that matter for them, and we contract those customers over time. And we're very focused and pleased with the fact that we continue to grow sales and profitability among those customers."

So first, we've got our normal therapeutic review that we started back in 2012, and that's all about making sure we have cost-effective medications for our clients and their members, and we've been able to deliver the $9 billion in savings that Larry talked about. And over the last several years, we've been able to negotiate price protection into those contracts. So if a manufacturer raises a price over a predetermined threshold, that comes back to our client in the form of a rebate and lowers their price. What we introduced this year is indication-based formulary. So think about hepatitis C that has 6 different genotypes. The genotypes are different. So we will have different formulary options based on the genotype or in the case of autoimmune, you have the same drug that treats psoriasis and RA. We may have a different preferred product for psoriasis than we do for rheumatoid arthritis. And the third dynamic is really hyperinflation. We looked at drugs that had a 3-year cumulative WACC increase of greater than 200% and we've taken on 10 of those drugs this year and our goal is to either we're not going to cover or we're going to get the economics back prior to these WACC increases that they took. And for biosimilars, I think it's just part of that theme. How can we get the lowest, most cost-effective drugs for our clients to provide us a benefit to their members, and we think biosimilars will be an opportunity. Now when you look at biosimilars, most of the pipeline is still with biosimilars under the medical benefit with the exception of Humira, but we'll continue to look -- to make decisions that are in the best interest of our clients and their members."

First is the core clinical programs that we've always used at CVS. We call them our patient care program. Things like adherence, outreach and other ways that we can drive clinical outcomes, which drives scripts. The second is around all the member engagement efforts that we've got going on and these are essentially targeted at our members through the PBM. We now have opportunities to fill prescriptions at Target, and so we're letting them know about that, inviting them into those Target pharmacies to experience the new offering, as well as some targeted marketing that we've been doing in conjunction with Target.

I have one announcement this morning. Our Annual Analyst Day has been scheduled for Thursday, December 15, in New York City. You'll have the opportunity to hear from several members of our senior management team, who'll provide a comprehensive update on our strategies for driving long-term growth. We plan to email invitations with more specific details at the end of the summer, but please save the date. Again, that's Thursday, December 15. 
This morning, we posted a slide presentation on our website just before this call. The slides summarize the information in our prepared remarks as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance. 
Later this afternoon, we'll be filing our Form 10-Q, and it will also be available on our website at that time. 
In addition, note that during today's presentation, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities law. By their nature, all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements for a number of reasons as described in our SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section and cautionary statement disclosures in those filings. 
During this call, we'll use some non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company's performance, including free cash flow and adjusted EPS. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find the reconciliations of these non-GAAP items to comparable GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of our website. And as always, today's call is being simulcast on our website, and it will be archived there following the call for 1 year.

Thanks, Nancy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us, and I'm pleased to have the opportunity to discuss the strong second quarter results we posted today.

Thanks for joining us, and I'm pleased to have the opportunity to discuss the strong second quarter results we posted today. 
Adjusted earnings per share increased 8.3% to $1.32, that's $0.01 above the high end of our guidance. And excluding acquisition-related costs in both years, operating profit increased 6.5% enterprise-wide, with operating profit in the Retail/Long-Term Care segment in line with our expectations and operating profit in the PBM exceeding expectations. 
We generated more than $1.1 billion of free cash during the quarter, more than $2.9 billion year-to-date, and as Dave will describe, we are raising our free cash flow target by $1 billion for the year. 
Now given our outperformance this quarter and solid results year-to-date, we are raising and narrowing our adjusted EPS guidance range. Excluding the costs associated with the debt tender and acquisition-related costs, we currently expect to achieve adjusted EPS for 2016 of $5.81 to $5.89, reflecting year-over-year growth of 12.5% to 14.25%, and that compares to our previous range of $5.73 to $5.88, and Dave will discuss this guidance in more detail during his financial review. 
Now let me turn to the business update, and I'll start with the PBM. The marketplace has been active, and I'm pleased to report that with our differentiated value proposition, we see 2017 shaping up to be another successful selling season. 
We currently have gross wins of approximately $7.4 billion and net new business of approximately $4.6 billion. These new business numbers do not include any impact from our individual Med D PDP, I'll touch on that shortly, and I'd also note that only about 7% of the gross wins relate to the previously discussed transition of the Coventry commercial business, which was acquired by Aetna back in 2013. 
To date, we've completed about 75% of our client renewals for '17. That's a bit ahead of where we were at the same time last year, and our retention rate is currently at 97.5%. 
Importantly, we have continued to win in the marketplace, while maintaining our pricing discipline. 
Now a lot has been said and written about the competitive dynamics of this selling season, and facts and realities can easily be lost or overlooked amidst the attention being paid to a few client shifts. 
So let me remind you of the things that have not changed in the competitive landscape, along with our ongoing strategic advantages. As you look at our key points of differentiation, we see consumer-directed health care gaining traction and points of access are critical, and our more than 9,600 pharmacies give patients immediate access to advice as they take on more responsibility for their health care decisions. And the data has shown the undeniable benefit of the face-to-face interactions for better adherence, reducing health care costs and improving health outcomes. And we have multiple patient touch points through our unique suite of assets, not just our retail pharmacies, but also mail, specialty, infusion, MinuteClinic and now long-term care. 
At the same time, we're the only company with the ability to impact not only patients, but also payers and providers, with our innovative channel agnostic solutions. Maintenance Choice continues to be a truly integrated program, delivering financial, convenience and clinical benefits to clients and members. It's not just about price, it's about enabling clinical programs that require deep integration of data. And our Health Engagement Engine serves as that [ph] enabler, so that products like Maintenance Choice cannot easily be replicated through a partnership or an alliance. 
Additionally, we have the broadest capabilities to holistically manage specialty, which continues to be a key area of focus for clients, and we continue to outperform in this area with specialty revenues increasing 22.9% in the second quarter. 
Clients continue to expect proactive, innovative, realtime solutions to manage their drug trend. And the Insights tool that we demoed at our last Analyst Day is unmatched, and it delivers those realtime solutions for our clients. 
Furthermore, our scale and innovative purchasing strategies are unsurpassed, and they continue to drive meaningful value for our clients. 
So in summary, those are just some of the factors that have differentiated us in the past and continue to drive our success this selling season. And we're certainly not sitting still as we continue to find new and innovative ways to drive value for patients, payers and providers. 
I also want to note that we continue to offer our clients cutting-edge solutions to formulary management, as we believe it is one of the most effective ways to manage rising drug costs, while ensuring access to clinically appropriate care. 
And our 2017 formulary management strategy continues to address emerging cost drivers with new market-leading enhancements, which we have just announced to our clients effective this coming January. 
And given the growing number of supplemental indications for many drugs, we will be creating opportunities for additional client and member savings through an indication-based formulary. 
And on a quarterly basis, products with significant cost inflation that have readily available, clinically appropriate and more cost-effective alternatives may be evaluated and potentially removed from the formulary. 
So effective January 1, 2017, we expect to remove 35 products from our standard formulary, including 10 hyper inflationary products, as I just described. These formulary changes affect less than 1.5% of plan members, while helping to reduce costs for clients and their members. 
In fact, from 2012 through 2017, this rigorous approach to formulary management will help generate total savings of more than $9 billion for our clients without disrupting member care. And you can find an overview of our strategy, along with the 2017 formulary details on the Investor Relations portion of our website. 
Now while it's too early to discuss the 2018 selling season, many of you've asked about the timing of the next FEP contract renewal. So let me clarify that the FEP specialty business has a Request for Information in the marketplace for January 2018. However, the FEP retail and mail order businesses comprising more than 70% of our total FEP revenues of about $9 billion, has been extended until January 2019. 
Before turning to retail, let me touch briefly on our Med D PDP SilverScript. We currently have about 4.1 million captive lives in our individual PDP, about 1.2 million captive EGWP lives, and we serve another 6.4 million lives through our health plan clients. So in total, we currently serve approximately 11.8 million Med D beneficiaries. 
Late last week, we received the preliminary benchmark results from CMS for 2017, and I'm pleased to report that SilverScript qualified in 32 of the 34 regions. These strong benchmark results should enable us to retain the vast majority of the auto-assignees we currently serve, along with the ability to attract new lives, and we're very pleased with these results. 
Now moving on to second quarter results in the Retail/Long-Term Care business. Total same-store sales increased 2.1%, with pharmacy same-store sales up 3.9%. This was negatively impacted by about 355 basis points due to recent generic introductions. Our pharmacy same-store prescription volumes increased 3.5%, that's on a 30-day equivalent basis, continuing to outperform overall market growth. Our retail pharmacy market share, again, on a 30-day equivalent basis was 23.9%, and that's up about 230 basis points versus the same quarter a year ago, driven by the inclusion of the Target pharmacies as well as underlying share growth. 
Now I'm pleased to report that the Target integration has been completed ahead of schedule. We converted all of 1,667 Target pharmacies, 79 clinics to CVS systems, programs and interior branding. And this was one of our most smoothest integrations ever, despite the complexity of the store-within-a-store format, and we certainly appreciate the strong communication and collaboration with our Target partners. 
So with CVS systems and branding now in place, we're ramping up our patient care programs, along with our marketing and member engagement campaigns that are expected to increase awareness and utilization of CVS at Target. 
Our Long-Term Care pharmacy business through Omnicare continues to perform well and in line with our expectations. Our integration efforts are progressing as planned, and we remain on track to complete the vast majority of the integration activities by year-end. 
Now in addition to those integration activities, we're working with our Long-Term Care clients to address the currently unmet needs of their residents, all with the goal of improving patient care and driving operational efficiencies. 
In Q1, we introduced the use of CVS pharmacies to speed the delivery of first bills and emergency needs to the facilities. This program continues to grow, and we now fill nearly half of all emergency scripts using a CVS pharmacy. 
In Q2, we began piloting our transition of care program to enable us to better serve patients as they transition across different care settings, and we also continue to pilot our integrated service offerings to the assisted and independent living communities, offering residents enhanced prescription delivery options based on their preference and acuity level. 
So while there's still much work to do, we remain excited about our ability to enhance patient care in these settings. 
Now turning to the front store business, comps decreased 2.5% or 1.7% after adjusting for the negative impact of the shift of Easter from April last year to March of this year. We saw softer customer traffic, which was partially offset by a notable increase in basket size. And at the same time, we saw notable front store margin gains in the quarter. 
Now some of the traffic decline was expected as we continue to optimize our promotional spend for our lower-value, promotionally oriented customers. 
In contrast, we saw front store spend and margin increase with our most valuable customers. And through our personalization efforts, we continued to deliver a value-based offering derived from longitudinal shopping habits, while increasing engagement through app and email capabilities. 
Now keep in mind that our front store business accounts for about 11% of enterprise revenues, and these personalization efforts are allowing us to invest our promotional spend in a very differentiated way, producing a margin flow-through. And we'll talk more about these efforts at our Analyst Day. 
Now we've also been focused on a mix shift towards our higher-margin health, beauty and Store Brand categories. We continue to roll out store resets to improve our health and beauty leadership and following last year's health and beauty enhancements across thousands of stores, we continue to scale our healthy food selection, optimize our key categories in the health quadrant and elevate our beauty offerings, while improving shopability. 
Store Brands are another area of significant opportunity. Our Store Brands represented 21.8% of front store sales in the quarter, and that's up about 85 basis points from the same quarter last year as we continue on our trajectory to a goal of 25%. 
Turning to store openings. In the second quarter, we opened 22 new stores, relocated 9 others, closed 10, resulting in 12 net new stores, and we expect to open about 100 net new stores for the full year. 
As for MinuteClinic, we currently operate 1,136 clinics across 33 states plus the District of Columbia. And as I noted earlier, the Target conversion was completed, and our nurse practitioner providers are adjusting well to the MinuteClinic scope of services and Epic EHR. 
Now including Target, MinuteClinic revenues increased 15.2% versus the same quarter last year despite a mild and late allergy season. 
The Hold My Place In Line online queuing tool that was launched nationally in March continued to gain momentum in Q2, and by the end of the quarter, the use of the tool had increased to 13% of all MinuteClinic business. The customer feedback is extremely positive and further enhancements are underway to improve the customer experience. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Dave for the financial review."
93625,377278452,1022024,"CVS Health Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","CVS Health Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll provide a detailed review of our second quarter results, followed with an update on our improved guidance. And as I typically do, I'll start first with a summary of the progress we've made in enhancing",2472,"Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll provide a detailed review of our second quarter results, followed with an update on our improved guidance. And as I typically do, I'll start first with a summary of the progress we've made in enhancing shareholder value through our strong capital allocation program. 
During the quarter, we paid $459 million in dividends. Our dividend payout ratio currently stands at 35.5%, but that is artificially high due to a loss on the debt extinguishment we incurred in the second quarter as well as the ongoing integration costs associated with our recent acquisitions. 
On more comparable basis, our payout ratio stands at 31.1%, and we remain well on track to achieve our target of 35% by 2018. 
In addition, we have continued to repurchase shares. During the second quarter, we repurchased 18.5 million shares for approximately $1.9 billion or $102.32 per share, and we have now essentially completed our planned $4 billion in repurchases for 2016. 
As I said at our Analyst Day, we expected share repurchases to be front-half loaded, and it very much played out that way. 
So between dividends and share repurchases, we returned approximately $2.4 billion to shareholders during this quarter and nearly $4.9 billion year-to-date. We continue to expect to return more than $5 billion to our shareholders in 2016 through both a combination of dividends and share repurchases. 
As Larry mentioned, we generated more than $1.1 billion of free cash in the second quarter, and we have produced more than $2.9 billion year-to-date. We are increasing our full year free cash flow guidance to a range of $6.3 billion to $6.6 billion from the prior range of $5.3 billion to $5.6 billion. This primarily reflects timing in our Medicare Part D SilverScript business as well as overall improvements in the core. 
Basically, healthier members and lower utilization than what we assumed when we submitted our bids are leading to changes in the timing of our cash flows, as we expect to continue to be in a payable position with CMS at the end of this year. 
Now turning to our debt. In order to take advantage of the current favorable interest rate environment, during the second quarter, we issued $3.5 billion in debt, refinancing approximately $3.1 billion of outstanding debt through a tender offer transaction. 
As a result, we booked a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $542 million during the quarter. 
Furthermore, last month, we retired an additional $1.1 billion by calling certain debt, and as a result of that, we recorded $102 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt during the third quarter. 
Together, these actions provide an ongoing benefit in terms of lower interest expense going forward. The benefit to 2016 is expected to be in the neighborhood of $50 million. 
Turning to the income statement. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.32 per share, $0.01 above the high end of our guidance range and up 8.3% over LY. 
GAAP diluted EPS was $0.86 per share. The Retail/Long-Term Care segment delivered solid earnings within our expectations, while the PBM segment posted profit growth above the high end of our expectations. The outperformance in the quarter was primarily driven by better purchasing economics in the PBM. 
So with that, let me quickly walk down the P&L. On a consolidated basis, revenues in the second quarter increased 17.6% to $43.7 billion. 
In the PBM segment, net revenues increased 20.7% to $29.5 billion. This growth is largely attributable to the increased volume of pharmacy network claims resulting from the very successful selling season we had last year. 
Additionally, and despite a year-over-year decline in Hep C sales, specialty pharmacy growth has been strong, driven in part by the Omnicare acquisition and the addition of its ACS book of business. 
Overall, PBM adjusted claims grew 18.7% in the quarter. Partially offsetting the sales growth was 155 basis point increase in our generic dispensing rate to 85.4%. 
While achieving strong growth year-over-year, the PBM's top line did come in below our expectations. The chief drivers were lower-than-expected specialty revenues from the continued year-over-year decline in Hep C prescription volume due to lower new patient starts and fewer days of therapy. 
In our Retail/Long-Term Care business, revenues increased 16% in the quarter to approximately $20 billion, driven by the addition of Omnicare and the pharmacies within Target as well as solid pharmacy same-store sales. 
GDR increased by approximately 110 basis points to 86.1%, partially offsetting this increase. 
Turning to gross margin. Operating expenses, operating profit and the tax rate where applicable, the numbers I am citing exclude non-GAAP adjustments in both current and prior periods, which we have reconciled for you on our website. Keep in mind that our guidance for the quarter also excluded those items. Gross profit dollars for the consolidated company increased a healthy 9.7% versus the same quarter of last year. Consolidated gross margins contracted approximately 115 basis points compared to Q2 of '15 to 16.1%. 
Within the PBM segment, gross margin contracted by approximately 45 basis points versus Q2 of '15 to 4.6%, primarily attributable to the mix of business and continued pricing compression, partially offset by the GDR improvement and favorable purchasing economics. 
However, gross profit dollars in the PBM increased 10.2% year-over-year, primarily due to strong claims growth, membership growth in SilverScript, improved -- improvements in GDR and favorable purchasing economics. Of course, partially offsetting these drivers was continued price compression in the market. 
In the Retail/Long-Term Care segment, gross margin declined approximately 165 basis points to 29.2%. About 40% of the decline in gross margin rate was mix driven due to the acquisitions. Lower reimbursement rates also continued to pressure margins. Partially offsetting those pressures were increasing generic dispensing rates as well as increased front store margins as we continue to rationalize our promotional strategies and improve our mix of products sold. 
Gross profit dollars increased 9.8% year-over-year in the Retail/Long-Term Care segment, largely driven by the addition of Omnicare and Target businesses. 
Turning to expenses. We saw strong improvement in total operating expenses as a percentage of revenue from Q2 of '15 to 10.5%. The PBM segment's SG&A rate improved about 10 basis points to 1.1%, benefiting from the additional sales leverage from the volume increases. 
SG&A as a percent of sales in the Retail/Long-Term Care segment improved significantly by approximately 85 basis points to 20.3%. This, too, was driven by leverage from revenue growth as well as the addition of the Omnicare business, which carries a lower SG&A rate relative to sales. 
Within the Corporate segment, expenses were up approximately $25 million to $220 million, slightly better than our expectations. 
Consistent with our expectations, operating margin for the total enterprise decreased approximately 60 basis points in the quarter to 5.6%. Operating margin at PBM decreased approximately 35 basis points to 3.5%, while operating margin at Retail/Long-Term Care decreased approximately 80 basis points to 8.9%. 
For the quarter, operating profit growth in the operating segments and at the enterprise level was in line with or better than expectations. With the PBM increasing 10.5%, Retail/Long-Term Care growing at 6.2% and consolidated operating profit growing at 6.5%. Consolidated EBITDA was up 9.8% over LY to $3 billion. 
Going below the line of consolidated income statement, net interest expense in the quarter increased approximately $150 million from last year to $280 million due primarily to the debt issued in the third quarter of '15 to fund the acquisitions we made last year. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 39.3%, and our weighted average share count was 1.1 billion shares. 
So with that, now let me update you on our guidance. I'll focus on the highlights. You can find the additional details of our guidance on the slide presentation that we posted on our website earlier this morning. 
As Larry said, we are narrowing and raising our 2016 adjusted earnings per share range to $5.81 to $5.89 from a range of -- from a prior range of $5.73 to $5.88, which reflects strong year-over-year growth of 12.5% to 14.25%. We have raised the midpoint by $0.045, reflecting the positive impact of the interest benefit derived from the debt extinguishment as well as our outperformance in the second quarter. 
With respect to GAAP diluted EPS, in addition to narrowing the range and layering the benefits from interest in the second quarter outperformance, we are revising our full year guidance to also reflect a couple of additional items. One is the integration cost that we saw in the second quarter, which we explicitly excluded from our guidance on the last earnings call. These costs totaled approximately $81 million pretax. The other is the losses on the early extinguishment of debt that we completed in both the second quarter and now the third quarter. Those losses totaled $644 million pretax. So we now expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.92 to $5 per share. 
Keep in mind that our GAAP guidance for future periods continues to exclude the impact of acquisition-related integration costs, and we will update those costs that we incur as the year progresses. 
Before I continue, let me remind you that the following guidance excludes all acquisition-related integration costs. In the PBM segment, we are decreasing revenue guidance to a range of 21% to 22%, reducing the midpoint by 100 basis points. This decrease takes into account lower-than-anticipated volume of Hep C as well as an associated reduction in days of therapy. 
At the same time, we are raising the midpoint of the PBM's operating profit guidance range by about 2.5 percentage points to account for the outperformance in the second quarter as well as continued expectations for better purchasing economics over the course of the remainder of the year. This results in a new range of 13.5% to 15.5%. 
In the Retail/Long-Term Care segment, we are narrowing guidance for revenue growth by taking the top end of the range down by 50 basis points. The reduction in the high end mainly reflects our performance in the second quarter as well as slightly weaker front-store sales trends as we continue to execute on our targeted promotional strategies. We now expect Retail/Long-Term Care revenue growth of 13% to 13.75% and total cost of 1.75% to 2.5%, while continuing to expect script comps of 3.5% to 4.5%. 
Despite the revenue change, we remain confident in our prior operating profit expectations, given the immaterial impact the changes I noted are expected to have on profitability. We are narrowing the range to take into account our performance in the second quarter. 
So we now expect Retail/Long-Term Care operating profit growth of 6.75% to 8%. Consolidated net revenue growth is now expected to be 17% to 17.75% intercompany revenue eliminations are now expected to be approximately 11.6% of segment revenues, and we expect higher intercompany profit eliminations. 
And as I said before, we are increasing our free cash flow guidance for the year by $1 billion to a range of $6.3 billion to $6.6 billion. 
Now let me provide guidance for the third quarter, which, again, excludes all acquisition-related integration costs. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.55 to $1.58 per share in the third quarter, reflecting growth of 21% to 23.75% versus Q3 of '15. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.38 to $1.41 per share in the third quarter, which includes a $102 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt that we completed in July. 
At the risk of sounding a little bit like a broken record, I want to take a moment to remind you of several timing factors we have been highlighting since Analyst Day that affect the cadence of profit delivery throughout the year. The introduction and timing of break-open generics, the timing of profitability in our Medicare Part D business, the timing of the benefits from our strategies to drive profitability in the front-end, the timing of share repurchases and certain tax benefits were all factors expected to impact the cadence. And while we have delivered 2 strong quarters slightly above our own expectations, the cadence of profit growth is still expected to be very much back-half weighted. Our EPS guidance for the third quarter is very much in line with what we said at Analyst Day. All things considered, we see a ramp-up in growth in Q3, and we still expect a strong back half to the year. 
As we've seen in years past, the timing of Medicare Part D profits in the third quarter remains difficult to forecast, since this is the time period where the risk-sharing quarter is usually least effective at providing risk-sharing protection. Thus, changes in any current estimates such as utilization, significantly impacts our timing of profits between the third and fourth quarters. This forecasting challenge is compounded by the significant growth in this business. We've made our best estimates and included those in our guidance, but keep in mind that there could be a shift of margin between the third and fourth quarters. 
Additionally, the tax benefits I've mentioned are forecast to occur in the fourth quarter. If those come earlier, that will obviously benefit the third quarter at the expense of the fourth. We'll update everyone on the final timing of these, again, when we report our results. 
So within the Retail/Long-Term Care segment, we expect revenues to increase 11.5% to 13% versus the third quarter of LY, driven in large part by the addition of the acquired businesses, although sequentially, you'll note a step-down due to the mid-August anniversary of the closing of the Omnicare acquisition. 
Adjusted script comps are expected to increase in the range of 3% to 4%, while we expect total same-store sales to be up 1% to up 2.25%. 
In the PBM, we expect third quarter revenue growth of between 21.25% to 22.5%, driven by continued strong growth in volumes, Medicare Part C and non-Hep C specialty. 
Consolidated revenues are expected to growth 16.5% to 17.75%. We expect a sequential increase in operating profit growth due to the impact of the timing of this year's generic introductions, notably Crestor, Gleevec, Glumetza, are all breaking open in this quarter. 
As a result, we expect retail operating profit to increase 10% to 12% and PBM operating profit to increase 20.25% to 24.25% in the third quarter. 
Consolidated operating profit is expected to grow 14.75% to 17.5%. 
So in summary, we posted strong growth year-to-date. Our 2016 outlook is strong across the enterprise, and we expect to generate very significant free cash this year. We remain committed to using this cash to drive returns for our shareholders through value-enhancing investments, dividends and share repurchases. 
And with that, I'll now turn it back over to Larry."

We're seeing even stronger movement into exclusive specialty and a higher utilization of our specialty formularies. And clients across our, again, both health plans and employers are becoming even more aggressive with all of our formulary strategies. So Larry talked about our standard formulary option that we offer clients, good uptake of that, but we even have more aggressive formularies, advanced control and value formularies that we continue to see increased interest in. And then our integrated programs like Maintenance Choice, Specialty Connect and Pharmacy Advisor are becoming even more important as people not only look at the unit cost in pharmacy but also how pharmacy can help reduce overall health care costs. So strong adoption of those programs as well.

And you see more people in consumer-directed health plan, you see more care being chosen individually when you think about some of the government-sponsored care with Medicare and that points to the value associated with multiple consumer touch points. And I touched on those in our prepared remarks that yes, there's 9,600 retail consumer touch points. We've got 80% of the U.S. population that lives within a couple miles of one of our stores, along with MinuteClinic assets and specialty and mail and infusion and now, Long-Term Care. And we have created a true level of integration across these different assets. And Ross, you remember years ago, we were talking about the Consumer Engagement Engine, which we now refer to as the Health Engagement Engine, and it's a piece of technology that connects the dots with these various capabilities so that it's not just about collecting data, it's about how we use that data to affect an outcome. So you combine that with the ability to touch the consumer in multiple different ways, and we think that, that is our value proposition that will increase in importance and that has allowed us to bring products into the marketplace that can impact patients, payers and providers."

This is Dave. I'll start off here. As you know, the health plan business, it's a little different than the employer business, whereas, in the employer business, typically a benefit manager can make a decision for the population immediately and those programs can be implemented pretty rapidly. In the health plan business, even despite a health plan, let's say Chief Medical Officer wanting to adopt one of programs, they need to, in turn, go and sell that through their book of business or in some cases, in the Medicare book of business, the ramp-up of share is just a little slower. So think about it starting off pretty thin margins, and that ramping up over time and the cadence of that is probably little slower than the employer book of business."

In Medicaid, we see, very aggressively, clients narrowing their network. With their fully insured book of business, they have to work through the Department of Insurance and they historically have opted for consumer choice broad networks. We do see that changing. And for the self-insured, that's no different than our employer clients. So it's really arming them with programs and incentives to sell that into their employer book of business. So it does move slower as Dave said, but we're confident it will move, and we're confident we can grow share."

So first, we've got our normal therapeutic review that we started back in 2012, and that's all about making sure we have cost-effective medications for our clients and their members, and we've been able to deliver the $9 billion in savings that Larry talked about. And over the last several years, we've been able to negotiate price protection into those contracts. So if a manufacturer raises a price over a predetermined threshold, that comes back to our client in the form of a rebate and lowers their price. What we introduced this year is indication-based formulary. So think about hepatitis C that has 6 different genotypes. The genotypes are different. So we will have different formulary options based on the genotype or in the case of autoimmune, you have the same drug that treats psoriasis and RA. We may have a different preferred product for psoriasis than we do for rheumatoid arthritis. And the third dynamic is really hyperinflation. We looked at drugs that had a 3-year cumulative WACC increase of greater than 200% and we've taken on 10 of those drugs this year and our goal is to either we're not going to cover them or we're going to get the economics back prior to these WACC increases that they took. And for biosimilars, I think it's just part of that theme. How can we get the lowest, most cost-effective drugs for our clients to provide us a benefit to their members, and we think biosimilars will be an opportunity. Now when you look at biosimilars, most of the pipeline is still with biosimilars under the medical benefit with the exception of Humira, but we'll continue to look to make decisions that are in the best interest of our clients and their [ph] members."

And now we're really focused on ramping up our patient care programs. As we looked at this opportunity, there were really 3 big areas where we saw opportunity, and those are beginning now. First is the core clinical programs that we've always used at CVS. We call them our Patient Care program. Things like adherence, outreach and other ways that we can drive clinical outcomes, which drive scripts. The second is around all the member engagement efforts that we've got going on and these are essentially targeted at our members through the PBM. We now have opportunities to fill prescriptions at Target, and so we're letting them know about that, inviting them into those Target pharmacies to experience the new offering, as well as some targeted marketing that we've been doing in conjunction with Target. Most of that has been digital, it's also been radio and that is really just kicking off now as well.

I'm here this morning with Larry Merlo, President and CEO; and Dave Denton, Executive Vice President and CFO. Jon Roberts, President of CVS Caremark; and Helena Foulkes, President of CVS Pharmacy, are also with us today and will participate in the question-and-answer session following our prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] 
I have one announcement this morning. Our Annual Analyst Day has been scheduled for Thursday, December 15, in New York City. You'll have the opportunity to hear from several members of our senior management team, who'll provide a comprehensive update on our strategies for driving long-term growth. We plan to email invitations with more specific details at the end of the summer, but please save the date. Again, that's Thursday, December 15. 
This morning, we posted a slide presentation on our website just before this call. The slides summarize the information in our prepared remarks as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance. 
Later this afternoon, we'll be filing our Form 10-Q, and it will also be available on our website at that time. 
In addition, note that during today's presentation, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities law. By their nature, all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements for a number of reasons as described in our SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section and cautionary statement disclosures in those filings. 
During this call, we'll use some non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company's performance, including free cash flow and adjusted EPS. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find the reconciliations of these non-GAAP items to comparable GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of our website. And as always, today's call is being simulcast on our website, and it will be archived there following the call for 1 year. 
Now I'll turn this over to Larry Merlo."

Thanks, Nancy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us, and I'm pleased to have the opportunity to discuss the strong second quarter results we posted today. Adjusted earnings per share increased 8.3% to $1.32, that's $0.01 above the hig",1977,"Okay. Thanks, Nancy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us, and I'm pleased to have the opportunity to discuss the strong second quarter results we posted today. 
Adjusted earnings per share increased 8.3% to $1.32, that's $0.01 above the high end of our guidance. And excluding acquisition-related costs in both years, operating profit increased 6.5% enterprise-wide, with operating profit in the Retail/Long-Term Care segment in line with our expectations and operating profit in the PBM exceeding expectations. 
We generated more than $1.1 billion of free cash during the quarter, more than $2.9 billion year-to-date, and as Dave will describe, we are raising our free cash flow target by $1 billion for the year. 
Now given our outperformance this quarter and solid results year-to-date, we are raising and narrowing our adjusted EPS guidance range. Excluding the costs associated with the debt tender and acquisition-related costs, we currently expect to achieve adjusted EPS for 2016 of $5.81 to $5.89, reflecting year-over-year growth of 12.5% to 14.25%, and that compares to our previous range of $5.73 to $5.88, and Dave will discuss this guidance in more detail during his financial review. 
Now let me turn to the business update, and I'll start with the PBM. The marketplace has been active, and I'm pleased to report that with our differentiated value proposition, we see 2017 shaping up to be another successful selling season. 
We currently have gross wins of approximately $7.4 billion and net new business of approximately $4.6 billion. These new business numbers do not include any impact from our individual Med D PDP, I'll touch on that shortly, and I'd also note that only about 7% of the gross wins relate to the previously discussed transition of the Coventry commercial business, which was acquired by Aetna back in 2013. 
To date, we've completed about 75% of our client renewals for '17. That's a bit ahead of where we were at the same time last year, and our retention rate is currently at 97.5%. 
Importantly, we have continued to win in the marketplace, while maintaining our pricing discipline. 
Now a lot has been said and written about the competitive dynamics of this selling season, and facts and realities can easily be lost or overlooked amidst the attention being paid to a few client shifts. 
So let me remind you of the things that have not changed in the competitive landscape, along with our ongoing strategic advantages. As you look at our key points of differentiation, we see consumer-directed health care gaining traction and points of access are critical, and our more than 9,600 pharmacies give patients immediate access to advice as they take on more responsibility for their health care decisions. And the data has shown the undeniable benefit of the face-to-face interactions for better adherence, reducing health care costs and improving health outcomes. And we have multiple patient touch points through our unique suite of assets, not just our retail pharmacies, but also mail, specialty, infusion, MinuteClinic and now long-term care. 
At the same time, we're the only company with the ability to impact not only patients, but also payers and providers, with our innovative channel agnostic solutions. Maintenance Choice continues to be a truly integrated program, delivering financial, convenience and clinical benefits to clients and members. It's not just about price, it's about enabling clinical programs that require deep integration of data. And our Health Engagement Engine serves as that [ph] enabler, so that products like Maintenance Choice cannot easily be replicated through a partnership or an alliance. 
Additionally, we have the broadest capabilities to holistically manage specialty, which continues to be a key area of focus for clients, and we continue to outperform in this area with specialty revenues increasing 22.9% in the second quarter. 
Clients continue to expect proactive, innovative, realtime solutions to manage their drug trend. And the Insights tool that we demoed at our last Analyst Day is unmatched, and it delivers those realtime solutions for our clients. 
Furthermore, our scale and innovative purchasing strategies are unsurpassed, and they continue to drive meaningful value for our clients. 
So in summary, those are just some of the factors that have differentiated us in the past and continue to drive our success this selling season. And we're certainly not sitting still as we continue to find new and innovative ways to drive value for patients, payers and providers. 
I also want to note that we continue to offer our clients cutting-edge solutions to formulary management, as we believe it is one of the most effective ways to manage rising drug costs, while ensuring access to clinically appropriate care. 
And our 2017 formulary management strategy continues to address emerging cost drivers with new market-leading enhancements, which we have just announced to our clients effective this coming January. 
And given the growing number of supplemental indications for many drugs, we will be creating opportunities for additional client and member savings through an indication-based formulary. 
And on a quarterly basis, products with significant cost inflation that have readily available, clinically appropriate and more cost-effective alternatives may be evaluated and potentially removed from the formulary. 
So effective January 1, 2017, we expect to remove 35 products from our standard formulary, including 10 hyper inflationary products, as I just described. These formulary changes affect less than 1.5% of plan members, while helping to reduce costs for clients and their members. 
In fact, from 2012 through 2017, this rigorous approach to formulary management will help generate total savings of more than $9 billion for our clients without disrupting member care. And you can find an overview of our strategy, along with the 2017 formulary details on the Investor Relations portion of our website. 
Now while it's too early to discuss the 2018 selling season, many of you've asked about the timing of the next FEP contract renewal. So let me clarify that the FEP specialty business has a Request for Information in the marketplace for January 2018. However, the FEP retail and mail order businesses comprising more than 70% of our total FEP revenues of about $9 billion, has been extended until January 2019. 
Before turning to retail, let me touch briefly on our Med D PDP SilverScript. We currently have about 4.1 million captive lives in our individual PDP, about 1.2 million captive EGWP lives, and we serve another 6.4 million lives through our health plan clients. So in total, we currently serve approximately 11.8 million Med D beneficiaries. 
Late last week, we received the preliminary benchmark results from CMS for 2017, and I'm pleased to report that SilverScript qualified in 32 of the 34 regions. These strong benchmark results should enable us to retain the vast majority of the auto-assignees we currently serve, along with the ability to attract new lives, and we're very pleased with these results. 
Now moving on to second quarter results in the Retail/Long-Term Care business. Total same-store sales increased 2.1%, with pharmacy same-store sales up 3.9%. This was negatively impacted by about 355 basis points due to recent generic introductions. Our pharmacy same-store prescription volumes increased 3.5%, that's on a 30-day equivalent basis, continuing to outperform overall market growth. Our retail pharmacy market share, again, on a 30-day equivalent basis was 23.9%, and that's up about 230 basis points versus the same quarter a year ago, driven by the inclusion of the Target pharmacies as well as underlying share growth. 
Now I'm pleased to report that the Target integration has been completed ahead of schedule. We converted all of 1,667 Target pharmacies, 79 clinics to CVS systems, programs and interior branding. And this was one of our most smoothest integrations ever, despite the complexity of the store-within-a-store format, and we certainly appreciate the strong communication and collaboration with our Target partners. 
So with CVS systems and branding now in place, we're ramping up our patient care programs, along with our marketing and member engagement campaigns that are expected to increase awareness and utilization of CVS at Target. 
Our Long-Term Care pharmacy business through Omnicare continues to perform well and in line with our expectations. Our integration efforts are progressing as planned, and we remain on track to complete the vast majority of the integration activities by year-end. 
Now in addition to those integration activities, we're working with our Long-Term Care clients to address the currently unmet needs of their residents, all with the goal of improving patient care and driving operational efficiencies. 
In Q1, we introduced the use of CVS pharmacies to speed the delivery of first bills and emergency needs to the facilities. This program continues to grow, and we now fill nearly half of all emergency scripts using a CVS pharmacy. 
In Q2, we began piloting our transition of care program to enable us to better serve patients as they transition across different care settings, and we also continue to pilot our integrated service offerings to the assisted and independent living communities, offering residents enhanced prescription delivery options based on their preference and acuity level. 
So while there's still much work to do, we remain excited about our ability to enhance patient care in these settings. 
Now turning to the front store business, comps decreased 2.5% or 1.7% after adjusting for the negative impact of the shift of Easter from April last year to March of this year. We saw softer customer traffic, which was partially offset by a notable increase in basket size. And at the same time, we saw notable front store margin gains in the quarter. 
Now some of the traffic decline was expected as we continue to optimize our promotional spend for our lower-value, promotionally oriented customers. 
In contrast, we saw front store spend and margin increase with our most valuable customers. And through our personalization efforts, we continued to deliver a value-based offering derived from longitudinal shopping habits, while increasing engagement through app and email capabilities. 
Now keep in mind that our front store business accounts for about 11% of enterprise revenues, and these personalization efforts are allowing us to invest our promotional spend in a very differentiated way, producing a margin flow-through. And we'll talk more about these efforts at our Analyst Day. 
Now we've also been focused on a mix shift towards our higher-margin health, beauty and Store Brand categories. We continue to roll out store resets to improve our health and beauty leadership and following last year's health and beauty enhancements across thousands of stores, we continue to scale our healthy food selection, optimize our key categories in the health quadrant and elevate our beauty offerings, while improving shopability. 
Store Brands are another area of significant opportunity. Our Store Brands represented 21.8% of front store sales in the quarter, and that's up about 85 basis points from the same quarter last year as we continue on our trajectory to a goal of 25%. 
Turning to store openings. In the second quarter, we opened 22 new stores, relocated 9 others, closed 10, resulting in 12 net new stores, and we expect to open about 100 net new stores for the full year. 
As for MinuteClinic, we currently operate 1,136 clinics across 33 states plus the District of Columbia. And as I noted earlier, the Target conversion was completed, and our nurse practitioner providers are adjusting well to the MinuteClinic scope of services and Epic EHR. 
Now including Target, MinuteClinic revenues increased 15.2% versus the same quarter last year despite a mild and late allergy season. 
The Hold My Place In Line online queuing tool that was launched nationally in March continued to gain momentum in Q2, and by the end of the quarter, the use of the tool had increased to 13% of all MinuteClinic business. The customer feedback is extremely positive and further enhancements are underway to improve the customer experience. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Dave for the financial review."
93625,377278452,1022508,"CVS Health Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","CVS Health Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll provide a detailed review of our second quarter results, followed with an update on our improved guidance. And as I typically do, I'll start first with a summary of the progress we've made in enhancing",2472,"Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll provide a detailed review of our second quarter results, followed with an update on our improved guidance. And as I typically do, I'll start first with a summary of the progress we've made in enhancing shareholder value through our strong capital allocation program. 
During the quarter, we paid $459 million in dividends. Our dividend payout ratio currently stands at 35.5%, but that is artificially high due to a loss on the debt extinguishment we incurred in the second quarter as well as the ongoing integration costs associated with our recent acquisitions. 
On more comparable basis, our payout ratio stands at 31.1%, and we remain well on track to achieve our target of 35% by 2018. 
In addition, we have continued to repurchase shares. During the second quarter, we repurchased 18.5 million shares for approximately $1.9 billion or $102.32 per share, and we have now essentially completed our planned $4 billion in repurchases for 2016. 
As I said at our Analyst Day, we expected share repurchases to be front-half loaded, and it very much played out that way. 
So between dividends and share repurchases, we returned approximately $2.4 billion to shareholders during this quarter and nearly $4.9 billion year-to-date. We continue to expect to return more than $5 billion to our shareholders in 2016 through both a combination of dividends and share repurchases. 
As Larry mentioned, we generated more than $1.1 billion of free cash in the second quarter, and we have produced more than $2.9 billion year-to-date. We are increasing our full year free cash flow guidance to a range of $6.3 billion to $6.6 billion from the prior range of $5.3 billion to $5.6 billion. This primarily reflects timing in our Medicare Part D SilverScript business as well as overall improvements in the core. 
Basically, healthier members and lower utilization than what we assumed when we submitted our bids are leading to changes in the timing of our cash flows, as we expect to continue to be in a payable position with CMS at the end of this year. 
Now turning to our debt. In order to take advantage of the current favorable interest rate environment, during the second quarter, we issued $3.5 billion in debt, refinancing approximately $3.1 billion of outstanding debt through a tender offer transaction. 
As a result, we booked a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $542 million during the quarter. 
Furthermore, last month, we retired an additional $1.1 billion by calling certain debt, and as a result of that, we recorded $102 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt during the third quarter. 
Together, these actions provide an ongoing benefit in terms of lower interest expense going forward. The benefit to 2016 is expected to be in the neighborhood of $50 million. 
Turning to the income statement. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.32 per share, $0.01 above the high end of our guidance range and up 8.3% over LY. 
GAAP diluted EPS was $0.86 per share. The Retail/Long-Term Care segment delivered solid earnings within our expectations, while the PBM segment posted profit growth above the high end of our expectations. The outperformance in the quarter was primarily driven by better purchasing economics in the PBM. 
So with that, let me quickly walk down the P&L. On a consolidated basis, revenues in the second quarter increased 17.6% to $43.7 billion. 
In the PBM segment, net revenues increased 20.7% to $29.5 billion. This growth is largely attributable to the increased volume of pharmacy network claims resulting from the very successful selling season we had last year. 
Additionally, and despite a year-over-year decline in Hep C sales, specialty pharmacy growth has been strong, driven in part by the Omnicare acquisition and the addition of its ACS book of business. 
Overall, PBM adjusted claims grew 18.7% in the quarter. Partially offsetting the sales growth was 155 basis point increase in our generic dispensing rate to 85.4%. 
While achieving strong growth year-over-year, the PBM's top line did come in below our expectations. The chief drivers were lower-than-expected specialty revenues from the continued year-over-year decline in Hep C prescription volume due to lower new patient starts and fewer days of therapy. 
In our Retail/Long-Term Care business, revenues increased 16% in the quarter to approximately $20 billion, driven by the addition of Omnicare and the pharmacies within Target as well as solid pharmacy same-store sales. 
GDR increased by approximately 110 basis points to 86.1%, partially offsetting this increase. 
Turning to gross margin. Operating expenses, operating profit and the tax rate where applicable, the numbers I am citing exclude non-GAAP adjustments in both current and prior periods, which we have reconciled for you on our website. Keep in mind that our guidance for the quarter also excluded those items. Gross profit dollars for the consolidated company increased a healthy 9.7% versus the same quarter of last year. Consolidated gross margins contracted approximately 115 basis points compared to Q2 of '15 to 16.1%. 
Within the PBM segment, gross margin contracted by approximately 45 basis points versus Q2 of '15 to 4.6%, primarily attributable to the mix of business and continued pricing compression, partially offset by the GDR improvement and favorable purchasing economics. 
However, gross profit dollars in the PBM increased 10.2% year-over-year, primarily due to strong claims growth, membership growth in SilverScript, improved -- improvements in GDR and favorable purchasing economics. Of course, partially offsetting these drivers was continued price compression in the market. 
In the Retail/Long-Term Care segment, gross margin declined approximately 165 basis points to 29.2%. About 40% of the decline in gross margin rate was mix driven due to the acquisitions. Lower reimbursement rates also continued to pressure margins. Partially offsetting those pressures were increasing generic dispensing rates as well as increased front store margins as we continue to rationalize our promotional strategies and improve our mix of products sold. 
Gross profit dollars increased 9.8% year-over-year in the Retail/Long-Term Care segment, largely driven by the addition of Omnicare and Target businesses. 
Turning to expenses. We saw strong improvement in total operating expenses as a percentage of revenue from Q2 of '15 to 10.5%. The PBM segment's SG&A rate improved about 10 basis points to 1.1%, benefiting from the additional sales leverage from the volume increases. 
SG&A as a percent of sales in the Retail/Long-Term Care segment improved significantly by approximately 85 basis points to 20.3%. This, too, was driven by leverage from revenue growth as well as the addition of the Omnicare business, which carries a lower SG&A rate relative to sales. 
Within the Corporate segment, expenses were up approximately $25 million to $220 million, slightly better than our expectations. 
Consistent with our expectations, operating margin for the total enterprise decreased approximately 60 basis points in the quarter to 5.6%. Operating margin at PBM decreased approximately 35 basis points to 3.5%, while operating margin at Retail/Long-Term Care decreased approximately 80 basis points to 8.9%. 
For the quarter, operating profit growth in the operating segments and at the enterprise level was in line with or better than expectations. With the PBM increasing 10.5%, Retail/Long-Term Care growing at 6.2% and consolidated operating profit growing at 6.5%. Consolidated EBITDA was up 9.8% over LY to $3 billion. 
Going below the line of consolidated income statement, net interest expense in the quarter increased approximately $150 million from last year to $280 million due primarily to the debt issued in the third quarter of '15 to fund the acquisitions we made last year. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 39.3%, and our weighted average share count was 1.1 billion shares. 
So with that, now let me update you on our guidance. I'll focus on the highlights. You can find the additional details of our guidance on the slide presentation that we posted on our website earlier this morning. 
As Larry said, we are narrowing and raising our 2016 adjusted earnings per share range to $5.81 to $5.89 from a range of -- from a prior range of $5.73 to $5.88, which reflects strong year-over-year growth of 12.5% to 14.25%. We have raised the midpoint by $0.045, reflecting the positive impact of the interest benefit derived from the debt extinguishment as well as our outperformance in the second quarter. 
With respect to GAAP diluted EPS, in addition to narrowing the range and layering the benefits from interest in the second quarter outperformance, we are revising our full year guidance to also reflect a couple of additional items. One is the integration cost that we saw in the second quarter, which we explicitly excluded from our guidance on the last earnings call. These costs totaled approximately $81 million pretax. The other is the losses on the early extinguishment of debt that we completed in both the second quarter and now the third quarter. Those losses totaled $644 million pretax. So we now expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.92 to $5 per share. 
Keep in mind that our GAAP guidance for future periods continues to exclude the impact of acquisition-related integration costs, and we will update those costs that we incur as the year progresses. 
Before I continue, let me remind you that the following guidance excludes all acquisition-related integration costs. In the PBM segment, we are decreasing revenue guidance to a range of 21% to 22%, reducing the midpoint by 100 basis points. This decrease takes into account lower-than-anticipated volume of Hep C as well as an associated reduction in days of therapy. 
At the same time, we are raising the midpoint of the PBM's operating profit guidance range by about 2.5 percentage points to account for the outperformance in the second quarter as well as continued expectations for better purchasing economics over the course of the remainder of the year. This results in a new range of 13.5% to 15.5%. 
In the Retail/Long-Term Care segment, we are narrowing guidance for revenue growth by taking the top end of the range down by 50 basis points. The reduction in the high end mainly reflects our performance in the second quarter as well as slightly weaker front-store sales trends as we continue to execute on our targeted promotional strategies. We now expect Retail/Long-Term Care revenue growth of 13% to 13.75% and total cost of 1.75% to 2.5%, while continuing to expect script comps of 3.5% to 4.5%. 
Despite the revenue change, we remain confident in our prior operating profit expectations, given the immaterial impact the changes I noted are expected to have on profitability. We are narrowing the range to take into account our performance in the second quarter. 
So we now expect Retail/Long-Term Care operating profit growth of 6.75% to 8%. Consolidated net revenue growth is now expected to be 17% to 17.75% intercompany revenue eliminations are now expected to be approximately 11.6% of segment revenues, and we expect higher intercompany profit eliminations. 
And as I said before, we are increasing our free cash flow guidance for the year by $1 billion to a range of $6.3 billion to $6.6 billion. 
Now let me provide guidance for the third quarter, which, again, excludes all acquisition-related integration costs. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.55 to $1.58 per share in the third quarter, reflecting growth of 21% to 23.75% versus Q3 of '15. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.38 to $1.41 per share in the third quarter, which includes a $102 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt that we completed in July. 
At the risk of sounding a little bit like a broken record, I want to take a moment to remind you of several timing factors we have been highlighting since Analyst Day that affect the cadence of profit delivery throughout the year. The introduction and timing of break-open generics, the timing of profitability in our Medicare Part D business, the timing of the benefits from our strategies to drive profitability in the front-end, the timing of share repurchases and certain tax benefits were all factors expected to impact the cadence. And while we have delivered 2 strong quarters slightly above our own expectations, the cadence of profit growth is still expected to be very much back-half weighted. Our EPS guidance for the third quarter is very much in line with what we said at Analyst Day. All things considered, we see a ramp-up in growth in Q3, and we still expect a strong back half to the year. 
As we've seen in years past, the timing of Medicare Part D profits in the third quarter remains difficult to forecast, since this is the time period where the risk-sharing quarter is usually least effective at providing risk-sharing protection. Thus, changes in any current estimates such as utilization, significantly impacts our timing of profits between the third and fourth quarters. This forecasting challenge is compounded by the significant growth in this business. We've made our best estimates and included those in our guidance, but keep in mind that there could be a shift of margin between the third and fourth quarters. 
Additionally, the tax benefits I've mentioned are forecast to occur in the fourth quarter. If those come earlier, that will obviously benefit the third quarter at the expense of the fourth. We'll update everyone on the final timing of these, again, when we report our results. 
So within the Retail/Long-Term Care segment, we expect revenues to increase 11.5% to 13% versus the third quarter of LY, driven in large part by the addition of the acquired businesses, although sequentially, you'll note a step-down due to the mid-August anniversary of the closing of the Omnicare acquisition. 
Adjusted script comps are expected to increase in the range of 3% to 4%, while we expect total same-store sales to be up 1% to up 2.25%. 
In the PBM, we expect third quarter revenue growth of between 21.25% to 22.5%, driven by continued strong growth in volumes, Medicare Part C and non-Hep C specialty. 
Consolidated revenues are expected to growth 16.5% to 17.75%. We expect a sequential increase in operating profit growth due to the impact of the timing of this year's generic introductions, notably Crestor, Gleevec, Glumetza, are all breaking open in this quarter. 
As a result, we expect retail operating profit to increase 10% to 12% and PBM operating profit to increase 20.25% to 24.25% in the third quarter. 
Consolidated operating profit is expected to grow 14.75% to 17.5%. 
So in summary, we posted strong growth year-to-date. Our 2016 outlook is strong across the enterprise, and we expect to generate very significant free cash this year. We remain committed to using this cash to drive returns for our shareholders through value-enhancing investments, dividends and share repurchases. 
And with that, I'll now turn it back over to Larry."

So Nathan, I mean, I would describe the selling season as pretty typical. The number of RPs are comparable, and we've been consistently -- at a consistent level of performance in the selling seasons over the last several years. If you look at the plan design, which obviously drives profitability, clients continue to be focused on the tools that help them manage the pharmacy spend and their top priority, we talked about many times, is specialty pharmacy, and we see both health plans and employers adopt our utilization management programs. We're seeing even stronger movement into exclusive specialty and a higher utilization of our specialty formularies. And clients across our, again, both health plans and employers are becoming even more aggressive with all of our formulary strategies. So Larry talked about our standard formulary option that we offer clients, good uptake of that, but we even have more aggressive formularies, advanced control and value formularies that we continue to see increased interest in. And then our integrated programs like Maintenance Choice, Specialty Connect and Pharmacy Advisor are becoming even more important as people not only look at the unit cost in pharmacy but also how pharmacy can help reduce overall health care costs. So strong adoption of those programs as well. And so I think it's been -- as I look at this new business mix and wins and profitability, I think it's pretty consistent with what we've seen over the last couple of years."

At the same time, back to your question, if you ask why we've been successful and why we expect to continue to be successful, we continue to see this retailization of health care. And you see more people in consumer-directed health plan, you see more care being chosen individually when you think about some of the government-sponsored care with Medicare and that points to the value associated with multiple consumer touch points. And I touched on those in our prepared remarks that yes, there's 9,600 retail consumer touch points. We've got 80% of the U.S. population that lives within a couple miles of one of our stores, along with MinuteClinic assets and specialty and mail and infusion and now, Long-Term Care. And we have created a true level of integration across these different assets. And Ross, you remember years ago, we were talking about the Consumer Engagement Engine, which we now refer to as the Health Engagement Engine, and it's a piece of technology that connects the dots with these various capabilities so that it's not just about collecting data, it's about how we use that data to affect an outcome. So you combine that with the ability to touch the consumer in multiple different ways, and we think that, that is our value proposition that will increase in importance and that has allowed us to bring products into the marketplace that can impact patients, payers and providers."

So what we've really been focused on is the personalization strategy that Larry talked about and essentially investing in those customers because we can see from the data where we have upside with them. And we segment them either from a value perspective sometimes or we look at them in terms of their shopping behavior. So we might like that beauty enthusiasts who, for example, tend to be less promotionally-oriented and are very focused on new items and what's hot and relevant for them and that might be very different than food and family loyalists who are looking for different kinds of offers and strategies. So for us, it's all about getting at a very micro level and giving them targeted offers that matter for them, and we can track those customers over time.

So first, we've got our normal therapeutic review that we started back in 2012, and that's all about making sure we have cost-effective medications for our clients and their members, and we've been able to deliver the $9 billion in savings that Larry talked about. And over the last several years, we've been able to negotiate price protection into those contracts. So if a manufacturer raises a price over a predetermined threshold, that comes back to our client in the form of a rebate and lowers their price. What we introduced this year is indication-based formulary. So think about hepatitis C that has 6 different genotypes. The genotypes are different. So we will have different formulary options based on the genotype or in the case of autoimmune, you have the same drug that treats psoriasis and RA. We may have a different preferred product for psoriasis than we do for rheumatoid arthritis. And the third dynamic is really hyperinflation. We looked at drugs that had a 3-year cumulative WACC increase of greater than 200% and we've taken on 10 of those drugs this year and our goal is to either we're not going to cover them or we're going to get the economics back prior to these WACC increases that they took. And for biosimilars, I think it's just part of that theme. How can we get the lowest, most cost-effective drugs for our clients to provide us a benefit to their members, and we think biosimilars will be an opportunity. Now when you look at biosimilars, most of the pipeline is still with biosimilars under the medical benefit with the exception of Humira, but we'll continue to look to make decisions that are in the best interest of our clients and their [ph] members."

First is the core clinical programs that we've always used at CVS. We call them our Patient Care program. Things like adherence, outreach and other ways that we can drive clinical outcomes, which drive scripts. The second is around all the member engagement efforts that we've got going on and these are essentially targeted at our members through the PBM. We now have opportunities to fill prescriptions at Target, and so we're letting them know about that, inviting them into those Target pharmacies to experience the new offering, as well as some targeted marketing that we've been doing in conjunction with Target.

Thank you, Nancy, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. While we announced solid results this morning for the third quarter, as Nancy mentioned, we want to spend most of this call addressing the recent changes in the marketplace,",919,"Okay. Thank you, Nancy, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. 
While we announced solid results this morning for the third quarter, as Nancy mentioned, we want to spend most of this call addressing the recent changes in the marketplace, what they mean for CVS Health in the short term and, most important, our plans to address these issues so we can resume our robust growth trajectory. And you can find a detailed business and financial review of the quarter in the slides we posted before the call. 
So let me touch briefly on our strong third quarter we announced this morning. 
Net revenues increased 15.5%, rising 19.2% in the PBM, 12.5% in the Retail/Long-term Care segment. 
Adjusted earnings per share increased 28% to $1.64, including approximately $0.05 related to a lower tax rate primarily due to the resolution of certain tax matters previously anticipated to occur in Q4. So this is basically a timing shift benefiting the third quarter at the expense of Q4. Our results in the third quarter also include another $0.01 related to below-the-line items. 
So putting those benefits aside, we posted strong adjusted earnings per share growth at the high end of our guidance range. 
The PBM performed slightly above the high end of our expectations mostly due to Medicare Part D profitability, while the Retail/Long-Term Care segment performed at the lower end of our expectations. Retail same-store sales grew 2.3% with pharmacy comps up 3.4% and comp scripts up 3%, and that's on a 30-day equivalent basis. Script growth was at the low end of our expectations, reflecting the slowing script growth trend in the overall market and a soft seasonal business. 
However, our Retail Pharmacy share grew more than 200 basis points to 23.8% versus the same quarter last year, and that was driven by the addition of Target along with core CVS share growth. In the front store, we posted a 1% decrease in same-store sales while achieving a nice improvement in front store margins as we continued to execute successfully on our personalization strategy. 
We generated $3.7 billion of free cash in the quarter, $6.6 billion year-to-date, and we are raising our forecast for the year to a range of $6.8 billion to $7 billion. And we'll continue to use this cash to create value for our shareholders. 
Now let me address what has changed in the marketplace and the near-term implications for our business. 
As you know, there had been numerous headwinds over the past couple of months facing our industry that have impacted the overall sentiment on the company. The negative sentiment, largely misplaced in our view, included competitors winning PBM business and the perceived impact on Caremark, broad industry concerns about drug pricing and the value of the PBM and concerns about what the results of today's election might mean for the health care industry. 
None of those are significant factors in our view of the current marketplace or of our performance. However, very recently, there have been some unexpected marketplace actions that will have a negative impact on our results for the fourth quarter of this year and a more meaningful impact on our outlook for 2017. So let me go into further detail. 
Over the past few months, Walgreens has been establishing various network relationships with a number of other PBMs. For example, they have 90-day offerings in the marketplace through both Express Scripts and OptumRx. And since the first announcement, we've said these are not expected to have a major impact, and we continue to believe this. 
Very recently, however, we became aware of additional network changes that are putting a significant number of our retail scripts at risk beginning in the current quarter. For example, there are new restricted network relationships between Walgreens and Prime Therapeutics as well as within the Department of Defense TRICARE program that in both cases take CVS pharmacies entirely out of those networks. 
In total, we believe these network actions will result in more than 40 million retail prescriptions shifting out of our stores on an annualized basis. 
The DoD TRICARE action begins on December 1, but they have already notified members, and we expect to begin seeing these prescriptions migrate out of our stores. The Prime network changes will begin on January 1 and impacts CVS Pharmacy's participation in selected fully insured networks in several key states. And while we continue to participate in Prime's Medicare Part D plans, in many cases it will be as a non-preferred provider. 
Now as you know, we have always said that our last script is our most profitable one given our ability to leverage our fixed costs with incremental volume. And unfortunately, this means that the scripts we'll lose will tend to be our most profitable scripts. And as a result, we will delever as a result of losing more than 40 million prescriptions. 
And as we've stated many times in the past, margin compression is a factor in the business, and our strategy of driving more share through our channels is a key element to achieving our overall retail growth objectives. And this unexpected loss of share will make that a difficult proposition in the short term. 
Now I'm going to turn this over to Dave to walk you through our updated guidance for 2016, our preliminary outlook for '17 and our longer-term outlook and then I'll be back to provide a high-level outline of our plans for responding to these marketplace changes and reaccelerating our growth."

I'll start today with a revised guidance for this year. We currently expect to achieve adjusted earnings per share for 2016 of $5.77 to $5.83 per share, reflecting year-over-year growth of 11.75% to 13%. We'",1264,"Thank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. I'll start today with a revised guidance for this year. 
We currently expect to achieve adjusted earnings per share for 2016 of $5.77 to $5.83 per share, reflecting year-over-year growth of 11.75% to 13%. We've effectively lowered the midpoint by $0.05 per share compared to our prior range of $5.81 to $5.89 per share. This takes into account the recent competitor actions restricting us from pharmacy networks as well as current trends in the Retail business, including a slowing script growth in the overall market and a soft seasonal business, which is affecting both the pharmacy as well as the front store. 
GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $4.84 to $4.90 a share. This now includes the addition of the integration cost in the third quarter, which we explicitly excluded from our prior guidance. Keep in mind that our GAAP guidance for the remainder of the year excludes the impact of acquisition-related integration costs, and we will update for those costs at year-end. 
Before moving to the fourth quarter guidance, let me quickly remind you of the timing factor affecting Q3, Q4 profit cadence. 
As Larry mentioned, we had a timing shift related to a lower tax rate that benefited Q3 by approximately $0.05 a share primarily due to the resolution of certain tax matters. These matters were previously anticipated to occur in Q4, which I talked about on our last earnings call. So in the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.64 to $1.70, up 7% to 10.75% from Q4 '15. 
GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $1.52 per share to $1.58 per share. And you can find the details of guidance in the slides that we posted online early today before the call. 
But let me take a moment to point out a few items. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect enterprise revenues to be up 12.25% to 14%, driven primarily by PBM growth. Total same-store sales at retail are expected to be flat to down 1.75% and adjusted script costs are expected to increase 1% to 2%, a sequential decline that reflects the impact of the network changes and retail trends. 
Additionally, enterprise operating profit is expected to grow by 2% to 5.5%, again, driven primarily by the PBM. 
The network changes and other factors will impact our business next year. So we want to provide you some early clarity on our  outlook for 2017 today. 
In 2017, we currently expect to deliver $5.77 to $5.93 in adjusted earnings per share with results contracting 0.5% to up 2.5%. It will be a tale of 2 parts: our PBM is still expected to deliver healthy growth while the Retail business is challenged. We currently expect an increase in PBM EBIT of about 8% and a decrease in retail EBIT of about 8%. 
As you know, we had another very successful PBM selling season with significant new business wins and a retention rate of about 97%. 
Importantly, we have continued to win in the marketplace while maintaining our pricing discipline. Our specialty business is expected to deliver strong growth next year and our SilverScript business is also expected to continue to perform very well. So the PBM continues its healthy growth trajectory into next year. 
In the Retail business, we completed the integration of the Target pharmacies and clinics and are now better positioned to drive growth. With CVS systems and branding in place, we are ramping up our patient care programs along with our marketing and member engagement campaigns that are expected to increase awareness and utilization of CVS at Target. 
We also completed the vast majority of the Omnicare integration, although there are still much to do to sell our innovative new programs to the market. 
In the front store, we continue to drive health and beauty sales, private label sales and to build upon our personalization strategies as we drive value for customers. However, as we cycle into 2017, our Retail business will be challenged in a few areas, so let me review them now. 
First, the combination -- all the network changes that Larry discussed earlier are carving a significant headwind as more than 40 million prescriptions are expected to cycle out of our stores next year. 
Secondly, although both the Omnicare and Target pharmacy acquisitions are performing well, the ramp-up in the level of accretion is slightly slower than anticipated. 
Between them, the year-over-year improvement in accretion was initially forecasted at $0.26. However, we now currently expect the year-over-year incremental accretion to be about $0.17, which includes the script impact on the CVS pharmacies within Target related to the network changes that we discussed. We are making good progress on these acquisitions, but it's taking a little longer than expected to realize all of the benefits. 
And finally, we continue to see ongoing margin declines related to both reimbursement pressures and the mix of business. The offsets to margin pressures, as you know, are lumpy, and they relate to the anticipated timing of generics, along with the timing of share gains. Recall that our growth model has been based on driving share through our channels to offset the ongoing reimbursement pressures in the business, which we have been very successful at accomplishing for the past several years. Given the recent network changes, it has become more difficult to grow our share and, therefore, offset the ongoing margin pressures in the near term. So 2017 will be a challenging year from that perspective. 
As you know, we are committed to driving shareholder value, and our cash generation capabilities are a real asset to our shareholders. We will continue to increase our dividend on an annual basis and do value-enhancing share repurchases after considering strategic opportunities. 
To that end, our board has just approved a $15 billion share repurchase authorization. Combined with what we have left on our prior authorization, we now have $18.7 billion available for buybacks. Our adjusted earnings per share estimates for 2017 assumes that we complete $5 billion in share repurchases. 
In addition to providing our primary outlook -- or preliminary outlook for 2017, I want to provide a high-level summary of our long-term financial targets, particularly in light of today's news. 
Back in December of 2013, we provided our 5-year financial targets, which included many assumptions. If you look at our cumulative performance from our jump-off point in 2013, we're tracking to the higher end of our adjusted EPS targets with a compounded annual growth rate of about 13.6% from 2013 through 2016. 
Given the sheer scale of our enterprise with about $180 billion in revenue and more than $10 billion in EBIT, we want to acknowledge that maintaining a 10% to 14% adjusted earnings per share growth rate off a much larger base is becoming more challenging. 
So going forward, we are targeting enterprise adjusted earnings per share growth of approximately 10% on average. Some years may be higher than 10%, while some years may be a bit lower than that. And we expect that growth to generate $7 billion to $8 billion in free cash flow per year on average. 
And again, we will provide more detail at our Analyst Day coming up, and we continue to believe that we are very well positioned in the health care marketplace, and we will continue to work diligently to deliver on these targets. 
And so with  that, I'll now turn it back to Larry."

First, we will leverage our enterpr",553,"Well, thanks, Dave. Well, obviously, we are not satisfied with next year's growth projection. We have a plan in place to return to healthy operating profit growth, and let me provide a high-level outline of that plan. 
First, we will leverage our enterprise capabilities and CVS Pharmacy's compelling value proposition to partner more broadly with other PBMs and health plans. We have capabilities that generate results that other retail competitors simply cannot match. So we'll begin to offer a suite of bundled services, including exclusive capabilities such as MinuteClinic services, infusion and long-term care capabilities, as a component of the CVS Pharmacy value proposition. And as the health care market continues its evolution to a value-based environment, the clinical capabilities that are resident today at CVS pharmacies will become increasingly important, making us a clear partner of choice. 
Second, we'll focus on driving growth through new PBM product introductions that capitalize on the benefits inherent in our unique integrated model. Some offerings by others in the market, they have attempted to mimic the success of our programs such as Maintenance Choice. And while they may get part of the way there, we don't believe they can extract the full value that we do through our truly integrated model. 
Our ongoing innovations will encompass clinical solutions to support all stages of care: new value-based contracting approaches in specialty and traditional pharmacy, including partnering with pharma in different ways to drive savings; new CVS Caremark retail network strategies, including performance-based networks; as well as a new generation of Maintenance Choice that will offer even more convenience and help drive further adoption.
Third, in this environment, it's critical to continue to be a low-cost provider. And to that end, we've begun work on a new, multiyear enterprise operations improvement initiative that will generate significant annual savings beginning in 2017 and accelerating beyond. And while we've been efficient and productive in our business, we do see additional opportunities to leverage the technology investments that we have made to further improve enterprise-wide efficiencies. 
And fourth, we'll continue to be very thoughtful with respect to using our strong cash-generation capabilities to return value to our shareholders. We expect to continue to evaluate opportunities for acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial criteria, and we'll be disciplined about investing in the right opportunities that drive long-term growth. 
So before closing, let me reiterate that we continue to be confident in our business model and our ability to drive long-term growth. We've always said that the beauty of our model is that we can pivot to address changes that take place in the market, and we'll continue to do that as the health care market evolves. We're the only company with the ability to impact not just patients but also payers and providers with channel-agnostic solutions. 
Furthermore, our goals around achieving higher quality at a lower cost are very much aligned with our partners. And we'll continue to find new and innovative ways to drive value for patients, payers and providers by making care more accessible, more affordable and more effective. And we certainly look forward to speaking with you in greater detail about all of the initiatives that I just outlined at our Analyst Day next month. 
So with that, let's go ahead and open it up for your questions."

All 3 of those contribute to our slower growth or lack of growth in 2017."

As you know, we typically do not talk about specific contracts or specific RFPs, and as you think about the health care business broadly or health plan business broadly, today, we have over 70 health plan relationships with the PBM. Obviously, it's an important growth component of the business. And there's nothing that prevents us from adding to that list as we've done the last couple of years. I do think that there is an ongoing evaluation of does the health plan in source their pharmacy PBM functionality, or do they outsource it. We continue to believe that whether you're looking at size and scale or the fact that pharmacy is our focus and the clinical capabilities that we bring to that, along with the challenges of the regulatory environment from a compliance point of view and the investments that need to be made to comply with that for the Medicare and Medicaid businesses, we think that it makes a lot of sense for folks to outsource that business. And quite frankly, that's what we've seen this year, this past selling season where I think everyone was trying to figure out that well wait a minute, how can everybody grow, okay? And part of the answer to that is the pie got bigger because there were some health plans that outsourced their PBM, their pharmacy business. Ricky, I think the only other point to add to that is we see opportunities that we have recognizing the assets that we've assimilated are the ones that largely touch the patient or the consumer. And that gives us the opportunity to partner with health plans whether with the PBM or whether we're not the PBM. Obviously, if we are the PBM, there is enhanced offerings that we can provide as a result of the integration, but there are also capabilities that we have that we can partner with health plans in a very differentiated way without having to be the PBM."

But I think our ability to compete in the market hasn't changed in a substantial fashion, and we do believe that if you look at the market probably where it was a few years ago to where it is now, obviously, the government-sponsored plans and health plans have grown, and they continue to be a growth area whereas the employer both has been relatively modest and flattish from a growth perspective. So we'll see more of our growth coming out of government-sponsored plans over time.

Thank you, Nancy, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. While we announced solid results this morning for the third quarter, as Nancy mentioned, we want to spend most of this call addressing the recent changes in the marketplace,",919,"Okay. Thank you, Nancy, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. 
While we announced solid results this morning for the third quarter, as Nancy mentioned, we want to spend most of this call addressing the recent changes in the marketplace, what they mean for CVS Health in the short term and, most important, our plans to address these issues so we can resume our robust growth trajectory. And you can find a detailed business and financial review of the quarter in the slides we posted before the call. 
So let me touch briefly on our strong third quarter we announced this morning. 
Net revenues increased 15.5%, rising 19.2% in the PBM, 12.5% in the Retail/Long-term Care segment. 
Adjusted earnings per share increased 28% to $1.64, including approximately $0.05 related to a lower tax rate primarily due to the resolution of certain tax matters previously anticipated to occur in Q4. So this is basically a timing shift benefiting the third quarter at the expense of Q4. Our results in the third quarter also include another $0.01 related to below-the-line items. 
So putting those benefits aside, we posted strong adjusted earnings per share growth at the high end of our guidance range. 
The PBM performed slightly above the high end of our expectations mostly due to Medicare Part D profitability, while the Retail/Long-Term Care segment performed at the lower end of our expectations. Retail same-store sales grew 2.3% with pharmacy comps up 3.4% and comp scripts up 3%, and that's on a 30-day equivalent basis. Script growth was at the low end of our expectations, reflecting the slowing script growth trend in the overall market and a soft seasonal business. 
However, our Retail Pharmacy share grew more than 200 basis points to 23.8% versus the same quarter last year, and that was driven by the addition of Target along with core CVS share growth. In the front store, we posted a 1% decrease in same-store sales while achieving a nice improvement in front store margins as we continued to execute successfully on our personalization strategy. 
We generated $3.7 billion of free cash in the quarter, $6.6 billion year-to-date, and we are raising our forecast for the year to a range of $6.8 billion to $7 billion. And we'll continue to use this cash to create value for our shareholders. 
Now let me address what has changed in the marketplace and the near-term implications for our business. 
As you know, there had been numerous headwinds over the past couple of months facing our industry that have impacted the overall sentiment on the company. The negative sentiment, largely misplaced in our view, included competitors winning PBM business and the perceived impact on Caremark, broad industry concerns about drug pricing and the value of the PBM and concerns about what the results of today's election might mean for the health care industry. 
None of those are significant factors in our view of the current marketplace or of our performance. However, very recently, there have been some unexpected marketplace actions that will have a negative impact on our results for the fourth quarter of this year and a more meaningful impact on our outlook for 2017. So let me go into further detail. 
Over the past few months, Walgreens has been establishing various network relationships with a number of other PBMs. For example, they have 90-day offerings in the marketplace through both Express Scripts and OptumRx. And since the first announcement, we've said these are not expected to have a major impact, and we continue to believe this. 
Very recently, however, we became aware of additional network changes that are putting a significant number of our retail scripts at risk beginning in the current quarter. For example, there are new restricted network relationships between Walgreens and Prime Therapeutics as well as within the Department of Defense TRICARE program that in both cases take CVS pharmacies entirely out of those networks. 
In total, we believe these network actions will result in more than 40 million retail prescriptions shifting out of our stores on an annualized basis. 
The DoD TRICARE action begins on December 1, but they have already notified members, and we expect to begin seeing these prescriptions migrate out of our stores. The Prime network changes will begin on January 1 and impacts CVS Pharmacy's participation in selected fully insured networks in several key states. And while we continue to participate in Prime's Medicare Part D plans, in many cases it will be as a non-preferred provider. 
Now as you know, we have always said that our last script is our most profitable one given our ability to leverage our fixed costs with incremental volume. And unfortunately, this means that the scripts we'll lose will tend to be our most profitable scripts. And as a result, we will delever as a result of losing more than 40 million prescriptions. 
And as we've stated many times in the past, margin compression is a factor in the business, and our strategy of driving more share through our channels is a key element to achieving our overall retail growth objectives. And this unexpected loss of share will make that a difficult proposition in the short term. 
Now I'm going to turn this over to Dave to walk you through our updated guidance for 2016, our preliminary outlook for '17 and our longer-term outlook and then I'll be back to provide a high-level outline of our plans for responding to these marketplace changes and reaccelerating our growth."

This takes into account the recent competitor actions restricting us from pharmacy networks as well as current trends in the Retail business, including a slowing script growth in the overall market and a soft seasonal business, which is affecting both the pharmacy as well as the front store. 
GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $4.84 to $4.90 a share. This now includes the addition of the integration cost in the third quarter, which we explicitly excluded from our prior guidance. Keep in mind that our GAAP guidance for the remainder of the year excludes the impact of acquisition-related integration costs, and we will update for those costs at year-end. 
Before moving to the fourth quarter guidance, let me quickly remind you of the timing factor affecting Q3, Q4 profit cadence. 
As Larry mentioned, we had a timing shift related to a lower tax rate that benefited Q3 by approximately $0.05 a share primarily due to the resolution of certain tax matters. These matters were previously anticipated to occur in Q4, which I talked about on our last earnings call. So in the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.64 to $1.70, up 7% to 10.75% from Q4 '15. 
GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $1.52 per share to $1.58 per share. And you can find the details of guidance in the slides that we posted online early today before the call. 
But let me take a moment to point out a few items. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect enterprise revenues to be up 12.25% to 14%, driven primarily by PBM growth. Total same-store sales at retail are expected to be flat to down 1.75% and adjusted script costs are expected to increase 1% to 2%, a sequential decline that reflects the impact of the network changes and retail trends. 
Additionally, enterprise operating profit is expected to grow by 2% to 5.5%, again, driven primarily by the PBM. 
The network changes and other factors will impact our business next year. So we want to provide you some early clarity on our  outlook for 2017 today. 
In 2017, we currently expect to deliver $5.77 to $5.93 in adjusted earnings per share with results contracting 0.5% to up 2.5%. It will be a tale of 2 parts: our PBM is still expected to deliver healthy growth while the Retail business is challenged. We currently expect an increase in PBM EBIT of about 8% and a decrease in retail EBIT of about 8%. 
As you know, we had another very successful PBM selling season with significant new business wins and a retention rate of about 97%. 
Importantly, we have continued to win in the marketplace while maintaining our pricing discipline. Our specialty business is expected to deliver strong growth next year and our SilverScript business is also expected to continue to perform very well. So the PBM continues its healthy growth trajectory into next year. 
In the Retail business, we completed the integration of the Target pharmacies and clinics and are now better positioned to drive growth. With CVS systems and branding in place, we are ramping up our patient care programs along with our marketing and member engagement campaigns that are expected to increase awareness and utilization of CVS at Target. 
We also completed the vast majority of the Omnicare integration, although there are still much to do to sell our innovative new programs to the market. 
In the front store, we continue to drive health and beauty sales, private label sales and to build upon our personalization strategies as we drive value for customers. However, as we cycle into 2017, our Retail business will be challenged in a few areas, so let me review them now. 
First, the combination -- all the network changes that Larry discussed earlier are carving a significant headwind as more than 40 million prescriptions are expected to cycle out of our stores next year. 
Secondly, although both the Omnicare and Target pharmacy acquisitions are performing well, the ramp-up in the level of accretion is slightly slower than anticipated. 
Between them, the year-over-year improvement in accretion was initially forecasted at $0.26. However, we now currently expect the year-over-year incremental accretion to be about $0.17, which includes the script impact on the CVS pharmacies within Target related to the network changes that we discussed. We are making good progress on these acquisitions, but it's taking a little longer than expected to realize all of the benefits. 
And finally, we continue to see ongoing margin declines related to both reimbursement pressures and the mix of business. The offsets to margin pressures, as you know, are lumpy, and they relate to the anticipated timing of generics, along with the timing of share gains. Recall that our growth model has been based on driving share through our channels to offset the ongoing reimbursement pressures in the business, which we have been very successful at accomplishing for the past several years. Given the recent network changes, it has become more difficult to grow our share and, therefore, offset the ongoing margin pressures in the near term. So 2017 will be a challenging year from that perspective. 
As you know, we are committed to driving shareholder value, and our cash generation capabilities are a real asset to our shareholders. We will continue to increase our dividend on an annual basis and do value-enhancing share repurchases after considering strategic opportunities. 
To that end, our board has just approved a $15 billion share repurchase authorization. Combined with what we have left on our prior authorization, we now have $18.7 billion available for buybacks. Our adjusted earnings per share estimates for 2017 assumes that we complete $5 billion in share repurchases. 
In addition to providing our primary outlook -- or preliminary outlook for 2017, I want to provide a high-level summary of our long-term financial targets, particularly in light of today's news. 
Back in December of 2013, we provided our 5-year financial targets, which included many assumptions. If you look at our cumulative performance from our jump-off point in 2013, we're tracking to the higher end of our adjusted EPS targets with a compounded annual growth rate of about 13.6% from 2013 through 2016. 
Given the sheer scale of our enterprise with about $180 billion in revenue and more than $10 billion in EBIT, we want to acknowledge that maintaining a 10% to 14% adjusted earnings per share growth rate off a much larger base is becoming more challenging. 
So going forward, we are targeting enterprise adjusted earnings per share growth of approximately 10% on average. Some years may be higher than 10%, while some years may be a bit lower than that. And we expect that growth to generate $7 billion to $8 billion in free cash flow per year on average. 
And again, we will provide more detail at our Analyst Day coming up, and we continue to believe that we are very well positioned in the health care marketplace, and we will continue to work diligently to deliver on these targets. 
And so with  that, I'll now turn it back to Larry."

First, we will leverage our enterpr",553,"Well, thanks, Dave. Well, obviously, we are not satisfied with next year's growth projection. We have a plan in place to return to healthy operating profit growth, and let me provide a high-level outline of that plan. 
First, we will leverage our enterprise capabilities and CVS Pharmacy's compelling value proposition to partner more broadly with other PBMs and health plans. We have capabilities that generate results that other retail competitors simply cannot match. So we'll begin to offer a suite of bundled services, including exclusive capabilities such as MinuteClinic services, infusion and long-term care capabilities, as a component of the CVS Pharmacy value proposition. And as the health care market continues its evolution to a value-based environment, the clinical capabilities that are resident today at CVS pharmacies will become increasingly important, making us a clear partner of choice. 
Second, we'll focus on driving growth through new PBM product introductions that capitalize on the benefits inherent in our unique integrated model. Some offerings by others in the market, they have attempted to mimic the success of our programs such as Maintenance Choice. And while they may get part of the way there, we don't believe they can extract the full value that we do through our truly integrated model. 
Our ongoing innovations will encompass clinical solutions to support all stages of care: new value-based contracting approaches in specialty and traditional pharmacy, including partnering with pharma in different ways to drive savings; new CVS Caremark retail network strategies, including performance-based networks; as well as a new generation of Maintenance Choice that will offer even more convenience and help drive further adoption.
Third, in this environment, it's critical to continue to be a low-cost provider. And to that end, we've begun work on a new, multiyear enterprise operations improvement initiative that will generate significant annual savings beginning in 2017 and accelerating beyond. And while we've been efficient and productive in our business, we do see additional opportunities to leverage the technology investments that we have made to further improve enterprise-wide efficiencies. 
And fourth, we'll continue to be very thoughtful with respect to using our strong cash-generation capabilities to return value to our shareholders. We expect to continue to evaluate opportunities for acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial criteria, and we'll be disciplined about investing in the right opportunities that drive long-term growth. 
So before closing, let me reiterate that we continue to be confident in our business model and our ability to drive long-term growth. We've always said that the beauty of our model is that we can pivot to address changes that take place in the market, and we'll continue to do that as the health care market evolves. We're the only company with the ability to impact not just patients but also payers and providers with channel-agnostic solutions. 
Furthermore, our goals around achieving higher quality at a lower cost are very much aligned with our partners. And we'll continue to find new and innovative ways to drive value for patients, payers and providers by making care more accessible, more affordable and more effective. And we certainly look forward to speaking with you in greater detail about all of the initiatives that I just outlined at our Analyst Day next month. 
So with that, let's go ahead and open it up for your questions."

Keep in mind we still have a very robust specialty business that continues to perform well. We have a very large Medicare Part D business that is performing quite well. And we've done 2 fairly sizable acquisitions in the form of Omnicare and Target, both while are not being as accretive as we once thought as we cycle into 2017. But as we look long term, we have a real opportunity for us to grow and develop that business in a meaningful way. And again and finally not to put this -- to minimize this, if you look at the cash that our organization throws off, we can get a substantial amount of accretion just from the share buyback program as you look at deploying that capital in a very effective way, keeping in mind we might also deploy that capital from a strategic lens to make sure that we bolt on the right businesses to enhance the infrastructure that we have today."

In our prepared remarks, we talked about the 4 areas of new product innovation. Around clinical solutions, new value-based contracting approaches, both in specialty and traditional pharmacy, and then new retail network strategies that would include performance-based networks. We have that a little bit today in Medicare Part D, but we see an opportunity to go further with that to be very much in line with value-based reimbursement and outcomes management. And then a new generation of Maintenance Choice. So again, we'll provide lot more details next month at Analyst Day, but that's our thinking about it.

As we -- as you know, we typically do not talk about specific contracts or specific RFPs. And as you think about the health care business broadly or health plan business broadly, today we have over 70 health plan relationships with a PBM. Obviously, it's an important growth component of the business. And there's nothing that prevents us from adding to that list, as we've done the last couple of years. I do think that there is an ongoing evaluation of does the health plan in-source their pharmacy PBM functionality or do they outsource it? And we continue to believe that whether you're looking at size and scale or the fact that pharmacy is our focus and the clinical capabilities that we bring to that, along with the challenges of the regulatory environment from a compliance point of view and the investments that need to be made to comply with that for the Medicare and Medicaid businesses, we think that it makes a lot of sense for folks to outsource that business. And quite frankly, that's what we've seen this year, this past selling season, where I think everyone was trying to figure out that, well, wait a minute, how can everybody grow, okay? And part of the answer to that is that the pie got bigger because there were some health plans that outsourced their PBM, their pharmacy business. Ricky, I think the only other point to add to that is we see opportunities that we have, recognizing the assets that we have assimilated are the ones that largely touch the patient or the consumer. And that gives us the opportunity to partner with health plans whether we're the PBM or whether we're not the PBM. Obviously, if we are the PBM, there is enhanced offerings that we can provide as a result of the integration, but there are also capabilities that we have that we can partner with health plans in a very differentiated way without having to be the PBM."

With Omnicare, Ricky, it's certainly not a question of if, it's more a question of when.

The most exciting thing, I would say, is that the Target team has responded in a tremendous way to the new systems and programs that we've delivered to them. So the service levels in those pharmacies are quite strong. We're seeing them come out of the integrations and the system changes at a very strong pace. And what we're starting to do now is turn on our patient care programs, which CVS historically had and Target did not.

Most Part D plans have preferred networks. In Managed Medicaid, we see most -- you see many of those plans willing to restrict networks. I think where there has been a reluctance historically has been in the fully insured market. And I think with Prime making a move to narrow their network in fully insured, that may be a catalyst for the rest of the markets. So we view that as an opportunity. And I think with the government programs, it's a little bit of a mixed bag. We see some willing to move into either restricted or Maintenance Choice networks and others like full access.

Obviously, the marketplace has moved a bit and there's been different offerings in the marketplace. But I think our ability to compete in the market hasn't changed in a substantial fashion. And we do believe that if you look at the market probably where it was a few years ago to where it is now, obviously the government-sponsored plans and health plans have grown and they continue to be a growth area, whereas the employer book has been relatively modest and flattish from a growth perspective. So we'll see more of our growth coming out of government-sponsored plans over time.

Thank you, Nancy, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. While we announced solid results this morning for the third quarter, as Nancy mentioned, we want to spend most of this call addressing the recent changes in the marketplace,",919,"Okay. Thank you, Nancy, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. 
While we announced solid results this morning for the third quarter, as Nancy mentioned, we want to spend most of this call addressing the recent changes in the marketplace, what they mean for CVS Health in the short term and, most important, our plans to address these issues so we can resume our robust growth trajectory. And you can find a detailed business and financial review of the quarter in the slides we posted before the call. 
So let me touch briefly on our strong third quarter we announced this morning. 
Net revenues increased 15.5%, rising 19.2% in the PBM, 12.5% in the Retail/Long-term Care segment. 
Adjusted earnings per share increased 28% to $1.64, including approximately $0.05 related to a lower tax rate primarily due to the resolution of certain tax matters previously anticipated to occur in Q4. So this is basically a timing shift benefiting the third quarter at the expense of Q4. Our results in the third quarter also include another $0.01 related to below-the-line items. So putting those benefits aside, we posted strong adjusted earnings per share growth at the high end of our guidance range. 
The PBM performed slightly above the high end of our expectations mostly due to Medicare Part D profitability, while the Retail/Long-Term Care segment performed at the lower end of our expectations. Retail same-store sales grew 2.3% with pharmacy comps up 3.4% and comp scripts up 3%, and that's on a 30-day equivalent basis. Script growth was at the low end of our expectations, reflecting the slowing script growth trend in the overall market and a soft seasonal business. 
However, our Retail Pharmacy share grew more than 200 basis points to 23.8% versus the same quarter last year, and that was driven by the addition of Target along with core CVS share growth. In the front store, we posted a 1% decrease in same-store sales while achieving a nice improvement in front store margins as we continued to execute successfully on our personalization strategy. 
We generated $3.7 billion of free cash in the quarter, $6.6 billion year-to-date, and we are raising our forecast for the year to a range of $6.8 billion to $7 billion. And we'll continue to use this cash to create value for our shareholders. 
Now let me address what has changed in the marketplace and the near-term implications for our business. 
As you know, there had been numerous headwinds over the past couple of months facing our industry that have impacted the overall sentiment on the company. The negative sentiment, largely misplaced in our view, included competitors winning PBM business and the perceived impact on Caremark, broad industry concerns about drug pricing and the value of the PBM and concerns about what the results of today's election might mean for the health care industry. 
None of those are significant factors in our view of the current marketplace or of our performance. However, very recently, there have been some unexpected marketplace actions that will have a negative impact on our results for the fourth quarter of this year and a more meaningful impact on our outlook for 2017. So let me go into further detail. 
Over the past few months, Walgreens has been establishing various network relationships with a number of other PBMs. For example, they have 90-day offerings in the marketplace through both Express Scripts and OptumRx. And since the first announcement, we've said these are not expected to have a major impact, and we continue to believe this. 
Very recently, however, we became aware of additional network changes that are putting a significant number of our retail scripts at risk beginning in the current quarter. For example, there are new restricted network relationships between Walgreens and Prime Therapeutics as well as within the Department of Defense TRICARE program that in both cases take CVS pharmacies entirely out of those networks. 
In total, we believe these network actions will result in more than 40 million retail prescriptions shifting out of our stores on an annualized basis. 
The DoD TRICARE action begins on December 1, but they have already notified members, and we expect to begin seeing these prescriptions migrate out of our stores. The Prime network changes will begin on January 1 and impacts CVS Pharmacy's participation in selected fully insured networks in several key states. And while we continue to participate in Prime's Medicare Part D plans, in many cases it will be as a non-preferred provider. 
Now as you know, we have always said that our last script is our most profitable one given our ability to leverage our fixed costs with incremental volume. And unfortunately, this means that the scripts we lose will tend to be our most profitable scripts. And as a result, we will delever as a result of losing more than 40 million prescriptions. 
And as we've stated many times in the past, margin compression is a factor in the business, and our strategy of driving more share through our channels is a key element to achieving our overall retail growth objectives. And this unexpected loss of share will make that a difficult proposition in the short term. 
Now I'm going to turn this over to Dave to walk you through our updated guidance for 2016, our preliminary outlook for '17 and our longer-term outlook, and then I'll be back to provide a high-level outline of our plans for responding to these marketplace changes and reaccelerating our growth."
93625,407823396,1079705,"CVS Health Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 08, 2016",2016-11-08,"Earnings Calls","CVS Health Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. I'll start today with a revised guidance for this year. We currently expect to achieve adjusted earnings per share for 2016 of $5.77 to $5.83 per share, reflecting year-over-year growth of 11.75% to 13%. We'",1265,"Thank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. I'll start today with a revised guidance for this year. 
We currently expect to achieve adjusted earnings per share for 2016 of $5.77 to $5.83 per share, reflecting year-over-year growth of 11.75% to 13%. We've effectively lowered the midpoint by $0.05 per share compared to our prior range of $5.81 to $5.89 per share. This takes into account the recent competitor actions restricting us from pharmacy networks as well as current trends in the Retail business, including a slowing script growth in the overall market and a soft seasonal business, which is affecting both the pharmacy as well as the front store. 
GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $4.84 to $4.90 a share. This now includes the addition of the integration cost in the third quarter, which we explicitly excluded from our prior guidance. Keep in mind that our GAAP guidance for the remainder of the year excludes the impact of acquisition-related integration costs, and we will update for those costs at year-end. 
Before moving to the fourth quarter guidance, let me quickly remind you of the timing factor affecting Q3, Q4 profit cadence. 
As Larry mentioned, we had a timing shift related to a lower tax rate that benefited Q3 by approximately $0.05 a share primarily due to the resolution of certain tax matters. These matters were previously anticipated to occur in Q4, which I talked about on our last earnings call. So in the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.64 to $1.70, up 7% to 10.75% from Q4 '15. 
GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $1.52 per share to $1.58 per share. And you can find the details of guidance in the slides that we posted online early today before the call. 
But let me take a moment to point out a few items. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect enterprise revenues to be up 12.25% to 14%, driven primarily by PBM growth. Total same-store sales at retail are expected to be flat to down 1.75%, and adjusted script costs are expected to increase 1% to 2%, a sequential decline that reflects the impact of the network changes and retail trends. 
Additionally, enterprise operating profit is expected to grow by 2% to 5.5%, again, driven primarily by the PBM. 
The network changes and other factors will impact our business next year. So we want to provide you some early clarity on our outlook for 2017 today. 
In 2017, we currently expect to deliver $5.77 to $5.93 in adjusted earnings per share with results contracting 0.5% to up 2.5%. It will be a tale of 2 parts: our PBM is still expected to deliver healthy growth while the Retail business is challenged. We currently expect an increase in PBM EBIT of about 8% and a decrease in retail EBIT of about 8%. 
As you know, we had another very successful PBM selling season with significant new business wins and a retention rate of about 97%.
Importantly, we have continued to win in the marketplace while maintaining our pricing discipline. Our specialty business is expected to deliver strong growth next year and our SilverScript business is also expected to continue to perform very well. So the PBM continues its healthy growth trajectory into next year. 
In the Retail business, we completed the integration of the Target pharmacies and clinics and are now better positioned to drive growth. With CVS systems and branding in place, we are ramping up our patient care programs along with our marketing and member engagement campaigns that are expected to increase awareness and utilization of CVS at Target. 
We also completed the vast majority of the Omnicare integration, although there are still much to do to sell our innovative new programs to the market. 
In the front store, we continue to drive health and beauty sales, private label sales and to build upon our personalization strategies as we drive value for customers. However, as we cycle into 2017, our Retail business will be challenged in a few areas, so let me review them now. 
First, the combination -- all the network changes that Larry discussed earlier are causing a significant headwind as more than 40 million prescriptions are expected to cycle out of our stores next year. 
Secondly, although both the Omnicare and Target pharmacy acquisitions are performing well, the ramp-up in the level of accretion is slightly slower than anticipated. 
Between them, the year-over-year improvement in accretion was initially forecasted at $0.26. However, we now currently expect the year-over-year incremental accretion to be about $0.17, which includes the script impact on the CVS pharmacies within Target related to the network changes that we discussed. We are making good progress on these acquisitions, but it's taking a little longer than expected to realize all of the benefits. 
And finally, we continue to see ongoing margin declines related to both reimbursement pressures and the mix of business. The offsets to margin pressures, as you know, are lumpy, and they relate to the anticipated timing of generics, along with the timing of share gains. Recall that our growth model has been based on driving share through our channels to offset the ongoing reimbursement pressures in the business, which we have been very successful at accomplishing for the past several years. Given the recent network changes, it has become more difficult to grow our share and, therefore, offset the ongoing margin pressures in the near term. So 2017 will be a challenging year from that perspective. 
As you know, we are committed to driving shareholder value, and our cash generation capabilities are a real asset to our shareholders. We will continue to increase our dividend on an annual basis and do value-enhancing share repurchases after considering strategic opportunities. 
To that end, our board has just approved a $15 billion share repurchase authorization. Combined with what we have left on our prior authorization, we now have $18.7 billion available for buybacks. Our adjusted earnings per share estimates for 2017 assumes that we complete $5 billion in share repurchases. 
In addition to providing our primary outlook -- or preliminary outlook for 2017, I want to provide a high-level summary of our long-term financial targets, particularly in light of today's news. 
Back in December of 2013, we provided our 5-year financial targets, which included many assumptions. If you look at our cumulative performance from our jump-off point in 2013, we're tracking to the higher end of our adjusted EPS targets with a compounded annual growth rate of about 13.6% from 2013 through 2016. 
Given the sheer scale of our enterprise with about $180 billion in revenue and more than $10 billion in EBIT, we want to acknowledge that maintaining a 10% to 14% adjusted earnings per share growth rate off a much larger base is becoming more challenging. 
So going forward, we are targeting enterprise adjusted earnings per share growth of approximately 10% on average. Some years may be higher than 10%, while some years may be a bit lower than that. And we expect that growth to generate $7 billion to $8 billion in free cash flow per year on average. 
And again, we will provide more detail at our Analyst Day coming up, and we continue to believe that we are very well positioned in the health care marketplace, and we will continue to work diligently to deliver on these targets. 
And so with that, I'll now turn it back over to Larry."

While, obviously, we are not satisfied with next year's growth projection, we have a plan in place to return to healthy operating profit growth, and let me provide a high-level outline of that plan. 
First, we will leverage our enterprise capabilities and CVS Pharmacy's compelling value proposition to partner more broadly with other PBMs and health plans. We have capabilities that generate results that other retail competitors simply cannot match. So we'll begin to offer a suite of bundled services, including exclusive capabilities such as MinuteClinic services, infusion and long-term care capabilities, as a component of the CVS Pharmacy value proposition. And as the health care market continues its evolution to a value-based environment, the clinical capabilities that are resident today at CVS pharmacies will become increasingly important, making us a clear partner of choice. 
Second, we'll focus on driving growth through new PBM product introductions that capitalize on the benefits inherent in our unique integrated model. Some offerings by others in the market, they have attempted to mimic the success of our programs such as Maintenance Choice. And while they may get part of the way there, we don't believe they can extract the full value that we do through our truly integrated model. 
Our ongoing innovations will encompass clinical solutions to support all stages of care: new value-based contracting approaches in specialty and traditional pharmacy, including partnering with pharma in different ways to drive savings; new CVS Caremark retail network strategies, including performance-based networks; as well as a new generation of Maintenance Choice that will offer even more convenience and help drive further adoption.
Third, in this environment, it's critical to continue to be a low-cost provider. And to that end, we've begun work on a new, multiyear enterprise operations improvement initiative that will generate significant annual savings beginning in 2017 and accelerating beyond. And while we've been efficient and productive in our business, we do see additional opportunities to leverage the technology investments that we have made to further improve enterprise-wide efficiencies. 
And fourth, we'll continue to be very thoughtful with respect to using our strong cash-generation capabilities to return value to our shareholders. We expect to continue to evaluate opportunities for acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial criteria, and we'll be disciplined about investing in the right opportunities that drive long-term growth. 
So before closing, let me reiterate that we continue to be confident in our business model and our ability to drive long-term growth. We've always said that the beauty of our model is that we can pivot to address changes that take place in the market, and we'll continue to do that as the health care market evolves. We're the only company with the ability to impact not just patients but also payers and providers with channel-agnostic solutions. 
Furthermore, our goals around achieving higher quality at a lower cost are very much aligned with our partners. And we'll continue to find new and innovative ways to drive value for patients, payers and providers by making care more accessible, more affordable and more effective. And we certainly look forward to speaking with you in greater detail about all of the initiatives that I just outlined at our Analyst Day next month.
So with that, let's go ahead and open it up for your questions."

Or is there some assumption around these 90-days programs? Or any other restrictions around network? And then secondly, can you maybe just give us a better understanding of what the opportunities are in your own Caremark book of business to try to replace some of this volume over time? I know you've talked in the past that especially with health plan business, it takes time to work these programs in.

One, we've lowered our cost of goods sold and our Red Oak joint venture is a great example of that. We've improved the efficiency, and we'll continue to launch a new program this year to further improve the efficiency across our network. And then finally, we've been able to increase the capture of share, dispensing share, into one of our channels. Obviously, in '17, that lever’s not really available to us. But I do think if you look at how we're positioned in the marketplace and our ability to plug in and really add a lot of value to the payers that we serve, I think we're really nicely positioned in a world of which networks begin to narrow and outcomes become more important."

And I think the outlook beyond 2017 as we get into '18 and the years out, I think, is quite strong."

As we -- as you know, we typically do not talk about specific contracts or specific RFPs. And as you think about the health care business broadly or health plan business broadly, today we have over 70 health plan relationships with a PBM. Obviously, it's an important growth component of the business. And there's nothing that prevents us from adding to that list, as we've done the last couple of years. I do think that there is an ongoing evaluation of does the health plan in-source their pharmacy PBM functionality or do they outsource it? And we continue to believe that whether you're looking at size and scale or the fact that pharmacy is our focus and the clinical capabilities that we bring to that, along with the challenges of the regulatory environment from a compliance point of view and the investments that need to be made to comply with that for the Medicare and Medicaid businesses, we think that it makes a lot of sense for folks to outsource that business. And quite frankly, that's what we've seen this year, this past selling season, where I think everyone was trying to figure out that, well, wait a minute, how can everybody grow, okay? And part of the answer to that is that the pie got bigger because there were some health plans that outsourced their PBM, their pharmacy business. Ricky, I think the only other point to add to that is we see opportunities that we have, recognizing the assets that we have assimilated are the ones that largely touch the patient or the consumer. And that gives us the opportunity to partner with health plans whether we're the PBM or whether we're not the PBM. Obviously, if we are the PBM, there is enhanced offerings that we can provide as a result of the integration, but there are also capabilities that we have that we can partner with health plans in a very differentiated way without having to be the PBM."

I think where there has been a reluctance historically has been in the fully insured market.

And we do believe that if you look at the market probably where it was a few years ago to where it is now, obviously the government-sponsored plans and health plans have grown and they continue to be a growth area, whereas the employer book has been relatively modest and flattish from a growth perspective. So we'll see more of our growth coming out of government-sponsored plans over time.

Thank you, Nancy, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. While we announced solid results this morning for the third quarter, as Nancy mentioned, we want to spend most of this call addressing the recent changes in the marketplace,",919,"Okay. Thank you, Nancy, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. 
While we announced solid results this morning for the third quarter, as Nancy mentioned, we want to spend most of this call addressing the recent changes in the marketplace, what they mean for CVS Health in the short term and, most important, our plans to address these issues so we can resume our robust growth trajectory. And you can find a detailed business and financial review of the quarter in the slides we posted before the call. 
So let me touch briefly on our strong third quarter we announced this morning. 
Net revenues increased 15.5%, rising 19.2% in the PBM, 12.5% in the Retail/Long-term Care segment. 
Adjusted earnings per share increased 28% to $1.64, including approximately $0.05 related to a lower tax rate primarily due to the resolution of certain tax matters previously anticipated to occur in Q4. So this is basically a timing shift benefiting the third quarter at the expense of Q4. Our results in the third quarter also include another $0.01 related to below-the-line items. So putting those benefits aside, we posted strong adjusted earnings per share growth at the high end of our guidance range. 
The PBM performed slightly above the high end of our expectations mostly due to Medicare Part D profitability, while the Retail/Long-Term Care segment performed at the lower end of our expectations. Retail same-store sales grew 2.3% with pharmacy comps up 3.4% and comp scripts up 3%, and that's on a 30-day equivalent basis. Script growth was at the low end of our expectations, reflecting the slowing script growth trend in the overall market and a soft seasonal business. 
However, our Retail Pharmacy share grew more than 200 basis points to 23.8% versus the same quarter last year, and that was driven by the addition of Target along with core CVS share growth. In the front store, we posted a 1% decrease in same-store sales while achieving a nice improvement in front store margins as we continued to execute successfully on our personalization strategy. 
We generated $3.7 billion of free cash in the quarter, $6.6 billion year-to-date, and we are raising our forecast for the year to a range of $6.8 billion to $7 billion. And we'll continue to use this cash to create value for our shareholders. 
Now let me address what has changed in the marketplace and the near-term implications for our business. 
As you know, there had been numerous headwinds over the past couple of months facing our industry that have impacted the overall sentiment on the company. The negative sentiment, largely misplaced in our view, included competitors winning PBM business and the perceived impact on Caremark, broad industry concerns about drug pricing and the value of the PBM and concerns about what the results of today's election might mean for the health care industry. 
None of those are significant factors in our view of the current marketplace or of our performance. However, very recently, there have been some unexpected marketplace actions that will have a negative impact on our results for the fourth quarter of this year and a more meaningful impact on our outlook for 2017. So let me go into further detail. 
Over the past few months, Walgreens has been establishing various network relationships with a number of other PBMs. For example, they have 90-day offerings in the marketplace through both Express Scripts and OptumRx. And since the first announcement, we've said these are not expected to have a major impact, and we continue to believe this. 
Very recently, however, we became aware of additional network changes that are putting a significant number of our retail scripts at risk beginning in the current quarter. For example, there are new restricted network relationships between Walgreens and Prime Therapeutics as well as within the Department of Defense TRICARE program that in both cases take CVS pharmacies entirely out of those networks. 
In total, we believe these network actions will result in more than 40 million retail prescriptions shifting out of our stores on an annualized basis. 
The DoD TRICARE action begins on December 1, but they have already notified members, and we expect to begin seeing these prescriptions migrate out of our stores. The Prime network changes will begin on January 1 and impacts CVS Pharmacy's participation in selected fully insured networks in several key states. And while we continue to participate in Prime's Medicare Part D plans, in many cases it will be as a non-preferred provider. 
Now as you know, we have always said that our last script is our most profitable one given our ability to leverage our fixed costs with incremental volume. And unfortunately, this means that the scripts we lose will tend to be our most profitable scripts. And as a result, we will delever as a result of losing more than 40 million prescriptions. 
And as we've stated many times in the past, margin compression is a factor in the business, and our strategy of driving more share through our channels is a key element to achieving our overall retail growth objectives. And this unexpected loss of share will make that a difficult proposition in the short term. 
Now I'm going to turn this over to Dave to walk you through our updated guidance for 2016, our preliminary outlook for '17 and our longer-term outlook, and then I'll be back to provide a high-level outline of our plans for responding to these marketplace changes and reaccelerating our growth."

I'll start today with a revised guidance for this year. We currently expect to achieve adjusted earnings per share for 2016 of $5.77 to $5.83 per share, reflecting year-over-year growth of 11.75% to 13%. We'",1265,"Thank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. I'll start today with a revised guidance for this year. 
We currently expect to achieve adjusted earnings per share for 2016 of $5.77 to $5.83 per share, reflecting year-over-year growth of 11.75% to 13%. We've effectively lowered the midpoint by $0.05 per share compared to our prior range of $5.81 to $5.89 per share. This takes into account the recent competitor actions restricting us from pharmacy networks as well as current trends in the Retail business, including a slowing script growth in the overall market and a soft seasonal business, which is affecting both the pharmacy as well as the front store. 
GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $4.84 to $4.90 a share. This now includes the addition of the integration cost in the third quarter, which we explicitly excluded from our prior guidance. Keep in mind that our GAAP guidance for the remainder of the year excludes the impact of acquisition-related integration costs, and we will update for those costs at year-end. 
Before moving to the fourth quarter guidance, let me quickly remind you of the timing factor affecting Q3, Q4 profit cadence. 
As Larry mentioned, we had a timing shift related to a lower tax rate that benefited Q3 by approximately $0.05 a share primarily due to the resolution of certain tax matters. These matters were previously anticipated to occur in Q4, which I talked about on our last earnings call. So in the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.64 to $1.70, up 7% to 10.75% from Q4 '15. 
GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $1.52 per share to $1.58 per share. And you can find the details of guidance in the slides that we posted online early today before the call. 
But let me take a moment to point out a few items. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect enterprise revenues to be up 12.25% to 14%, driven primarily by PBM growth. Total same-store sales at retail are expected to be flat to down 1.75%, and adjusted script costs are expected to increase 1% to 2%, a sequential decline that reflects the impact of the network changes and retail trends. 
Additionally, enterprise operating profit is expected to grow by 2% to 5.5%, again, driven primarily by the PBM. 
The network changes and other factors will impact our business next year. So we want to provide you some early clarity on our outlook for 2017 today. 
In 2017, we currently expect to deliver $5.77 to $5.93 in adjusted earnings per share with results contracting 0.5% to up 2.5%. It will be a tale of 2 parts: our PBM is still expected to deliver healthy growth while the Retail business is challenged. We currently expect an increase in PBM EBIT of about 8% and a decrease in retail EBIT of about 8%. 
As you know, we had another very successful PBM selling season with significant new business wins and a retention rate of about 97%.
Importantly, we have continued to win in the marketplace while maintaining our pricing discipline. Our specialty business is expected to deliver strong growth next year and our SilverScript business is also expected to continue to perform very well. So the PBM continues its healthy growth trajectory into next year. 
In the Retail business, we completed the integration of the Target pharmacies and clinics and are now better positioned to drive growth. With CVS systems and branding in place, we are ramping up our patient care programs along with our marketing and member engagement campaigns that are expected to increase awareness and utilization of CVS at Target. 
We also completed the vast majority of the Omnicare integration, although there are still much to do to sell our innovative new programs to the market. 
In the front store, we continue to drive health and beauty sales, private label sales and to build upon our personalization strategies as we drive value for customers. However, as we cycle into 2017, our Retail business will be challenged in a few areas, so let me review them now. 
First, the combination -- all the network changes that Larry discussed earlier are causing a significant headwind as more than 40 million prescriptions are expected to cycle out of our stores next year. 
Secondly, although both the Omnicare and Target pharmacy acquisitions are performing well, the ramp-up in the level of accretion is slightly slower than anticipated. 
Between them, the year-over-year improvement in accretion was initially forecasted at $0.26. However, we now currently expect the year-over-year incremental accretion to be about $0.17, which includes the script impact on the CVS pharmacies within Target related to the network changes that we discussed. We are making good progress on these acquisitions, but it's taking a little longer than expected to realize all of the benefits. 
And finally, we continue to see ongoing margin declines related to both reimbursement pressures and the mix of business. The offsets to margin pressures, as you know, are lumpy, and they relate to the anticipated timing of generics, along with the timing of share gains. Recall that our growth model has been based on driving share through our channels to offset the ongoing reimbursement pressures in the business, which we have been very successful at accomplishing for the past several years. Given the recent network changes, it has become more difficult to grow our share and, therefore, offset the ongoing margin pressures in the near term. So 2017 will be a challenging year from that perspective. 
As you know, we are committed to driving shareholder value, and our cash generation capabilities are a real asset to our shareholders. We will continue to increase our dividend on an annual basis and do value-enhancing share repurchases after considering strategic opportunities. 
To that end, our board has just approved a $15 billion share repurchase authorization. Combined with what we have left on our prior authorization, we now have $18.7 billion available for buybacks. Our adjusted earnings per share estimates for 2017 assumes that we complete $5 billion in share repurchases. 
In addition to providing our primary outlook -- or preliminary outlook for 2017, I want to provide a high-level summary of our long-term financial targets, particularly in light of today's news. 
Back in December of 2013, we provided our 5-year financial targets, which included many assumptions. If you look at our cumulative performance from our jump-off point in 2013, we're tracking to the higher end of our adjusted EPS targets with a compounded annual growth rate of about 13.6% from 2013 through 2016. 
Given the sheer scale of our enterprise with about $180 billion in revenue and more than $10 billion in EBIT, we want to acknowledge that maintaining a 10% to 14% adjusted earnings per share growth rate off a much larger base is becoming more challenging. 
So going forward, we are targeting enterprise adjusted earnings per share growth of approximately 10% on average. Some years may be higher than 10%, while some years may be a bit lower than that. And we expect that growth to generate $7 billion to $8 billion in free cash flow per year on average. 
And again, we will provide more detail at our Analyst Day coming up, and we continue to believe that we are very well positioned in the health care marketplace, and we will continue to work diligently to deliver on these targets. 
And so with that, I'll now turn it back over to Larry."

While, obviously, we are not satisfied with next year's growth projection, we have a plan in place to return to healthy operating profit growth, and let me provide a high-level outline of that plan. 
First, we will leverage our enterprise capabilities and CVS Pharmacy's compelling value proposition to partner more broadly with other PBMs and health plans. We have capabilities that generate results that other retail competitors simply cannot match. So we'll begin to offer a suite of bundled services, including exclusive capabilities such as MinuteClinic services, infusion and long-term care capabilities, as a component of the CVS Pharmacy value proposition. And as the health care market continues its evolution to a value-based environment, the clinical capabilities that are resident today at CVS pharmacies will become increasingly important, making us a clear partner of choice. 
Second, we'll focus on driving growth through new PBM product introductions that capitalize on the benefits inherent in our unique integrated model. Some offerings by others in the market, they have attempted to mimic the success of our programs such as Maintenance Choice. And while they may get part of the way there, we don't believe they can extract the full value that we do through our truly integrated model. 
Our ongoing innovations will encompass clinical solutions to support all stages of care: new value-based contracting approaches in specialty and traditional pharmacy, including partnering with pharma in different ways to drive savings; new CVS Caremark retail network strategies, including performance-based networks; as well as a new generation of Maintenance Choice that will offer even more convenience and help drive further adoption.
Third, in this environment, it's critical to continue to be a low-cost provider. And to that end, we've begun work on a new, multiyear enterprise operations improvement initiative that will generate significant annual savings beginning in 2017 and accelerating beyond. And while we've been efficient and productive in our business, we do see additional opportunities to leverage the technology investments that we have made to further improve enterprise-wide efficiencies. 
And fourth, we'll continue to be very thoughtful with respect to using our strong cash-generation capabilities to return value to our shareholders. We expect to continue to evaluate opportunities for acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial criteria, and we'll be disciplined about investing in the right opportunities that drive long-term growth. 
So before closing, let me reiterate that we continue to be confident in our business model and our ability to drive long-term growth. We've always said that the beauty of our model is that we can pivot to address changes that take place in the market, and we'll continue to do that as the health care market evolves. We're the only company with the ability to impact not just patients but also payers and providers with channel-agnostic solutions. 
Furthermore, our goals around achieving higher quality at a lower cost are very much aligned with our partners. And we'll continue to find new and innovative ways to drive value for patients, payers and providers by making care more accessible, more affordable and more effective. And we certainly look forward to speaking with you in greater detail about all of the initiatives that I just outlined at our Analyst Day next month.
So with that, let's go ahead and open it up for your questions."

And yes, I think if you look at our long-term growth rate at approximately 10%, the company generates significant amount of cash. That cash can be effectively utilized to return value to shareholders through value-enhancing share repurchases, which, if you look at the past practices, we've delivered somewhere between 4% to 5% to 6% adjusted earnings per share growth just from the cash that we generate out of the business, which is significant. Obviously, we do believe that the underlying business organically is going to be able to grow healthy. We don't really provide guidance by segment because our businesses are really integrated today, but we do expect to return to that healthy growth outlook in '18 and beyond."

As we -- as you know, we typically do not talk about specific contracts or specific RFPs. And as you think about the health care business broadly or health plan business broadly, today we have over 70 health plan relationships with a PBM. Obviously, it's an important growth component of the business. And there's nothing that prevents us from adding to that list, as we've done the last couple of years. I do think that there is an ongoing evaluation of does the health plan in-source their pharmacy PBM functionality or do they outsource it? And we continue to believe that whether you're looking at size and scale or the fact that pharmacy is our focus and the clinical capabilities that we bring to that, along with the challenges of the regulatory environment from a compliance point of view and the investments that need to be made to comply with that for the Medicare and Medicaid businesses, we think that it makes a lot of sense for folks to outsource that business. And quite frankly, that's what we've seen this year, this past selling season, where I think everyone was trying to figure out that, well, wait a minute, how can everybody grow, okay? And part of the answer to that is that the pie got bigger because there were some health plans that outsourced their PBM, their pharmacy business. Ricky, I think the only other point to add to that is we see opportunities that we have, recognizing the assets that we have assimilated are the ones that largely touch the patient or the consumer. And that gives us the opportunity to partner with health plans whether we're the PBM or whether we're not the PBM. Obviously, if we are the PBM, there is enhanced offerings that we can provide as a result of the integration, but there are also capabilities that we have that we can partner with health plans in a very differentiated way without having to be the PBM."

I guess I would just look at the Prime decision in that it appears to us, and listen, we’re a little bit of an observer here, is that Walgreens acquired their specialty pharmacy and their mail order pharmacy or at least partnered with them from that perspective, and I'm assuming that as part of that arrangement, there were some network participation agreement that was confirmed through Prime. So I think that might be a little bit of a unique animal compared to kind of other network changes in the marketplace."

Obviously, as I said, we're jumping off a lot bigger bite -- base at this point in time given where we were in 2013 as we've grown the company substantially. This is probably a deeper conversation than we probably have time for on the call today, but it is something that we'll talk about more at Analyst Day. I will say, though, that if you just look broadly, I don't believe the fundamentals of our growth algorithm have substantially changed. Obviously, the marketplace has moved a bit and there's been different offerings in the marketplace. But I think our ability to compete in the market hasn't changed in a substantial fashion. And we do believe that if you look at the market probably where it was a few years ago to where it is now, obviously the government-sponsored plans and health plans have grown and they continue to be a growth area, whereas the employer book has been relatively modest and flattish from a growth perspective. So we'll see more of our growth coming out of government-sponsored plans over time. And again, I think we're nicely positioned with all of our assets to compete successfully and gain share in that marketplace. So that's probably the biggest, I'll say, underlying change, is that -- as we pivot to make sure we service that need of the segment in the market."
