I'm going to provide a few highlights of just a few items in our financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement.

I'm going to provide a few highlights of just a few items in our financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement. 
Interest expense decreased in the quarter by $7.1 million to $52 million. This decrease was driven by a less overall debt in our balance sheet. We repaid $150 million of bonds and almost $200 million of mortgages last year. The decrease was also partially due to the inclusion of preferred dividends that were treated as interest expense in the fourth quarter of last year when we redeemed our Series E preferred equity shares in October of 2014. 
Another larger impact was from the recognition of a noncash gain of approximately $4.1 million on interest rate swaps during the quarter, which caused a decrease in net liability and lowered our interest expense. As a reminder, these mark-to-market adjustments on our floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps will tend to cost volatility in our reported interest expense and FFO on a quarterly basis, particularly when there's a significant movement in short term forward curve rates as we saw at the end of the fourth quarter. We do adjust for this noncash gain when computing our cash AFFO earnings. 
On a related note, our coverage ratio has both remained strong with interest coverage of 4.5x and fixed charge coverage at 4.0x. Our fixed charge coverage is the highest it has been in well over 10 years. 
Our G&A in 2015, as a percentage of total rental and other revenues, was only 5%. We estimate this will remain our approximate run rate for G&A in 2016 as well.
Our nonreimbursable property expenses in 2015 as a percentage of total rental and other revenues is only 1.4%. These expenses came in lower this year due to lower portfolio vacancy, faster releasing of vacant properties, lower property insurance premiums and fewer one-time expenses. We estimate our run rate for property expenses in 2016 to be approximately 1.5%.
Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. In September, we established an ATM, or at the market, equity distribution program. 
In Q4, we utilized this program to issue approximately 714,000 shares, generating net proceeds of $35.8 million. And in October, we raised $517 million in net proceeds in a common stock offering. We used the proceeds at that time to pay down all outstanding borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility.
This $2 billion credit facility today has a current balance of $370 million. Other than our current facility and [indiscernible] variable rate debt exposure we have is only just $15.5 million of mortgage debt. 
And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape, with only $170 million in mortgages and $275 million of bonds coming due in 2016, and our maturity schedule is well lathered thereafter.
Finally, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio stands at approximately 5.1x and is only 5.5x inclusive of preferred equity. 
Now let me turn the call back over to John to give you more background on these results."

And let me begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. Occupancy based on a number of properties was 98.4%, 10 basis points higher than last quarter and unchanged from a year ago despite having managed our most active year ever for lease expirations. 
Additionally, economic occupancy remained strong at 99.2%. 
During the year, we released 253 properties with leases expiring, recapturing 101% of expiring rent. 
As is typical for us, we achieved this without any spending on tenant improvements. At the end of the year, we had 71 properties available for lease at a 4,538 properties in the portfolio. 
Over the last 2 years, we have to sold more than 2,000 of properties with expired leases, recapturing approximately 98% of rents in those properties that were re-leased. 
Our same-store rent increased 1.3% during the quarter and also for the year. Each annual same-store rent growth to remain approximately 1.3% in 2016. 90% of our releases have contractile event increases. Approximately 75% of our investment grade leases have rental rate growth that averages about 1.3%. 
Additionally, we have never had a year with negative same-store rent growth since we started reporting this metric 20 years ago. 
Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant and mystery, geography and, to a certain extent, property-type, all of which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. 
We ended the year, our properties were leased to 240 commercial tenants in 47 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico. 79% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. 
The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue. There was not much movement in the composition of our top tenants in our industries during the quarter.
We are going to remains our largest tenant at 6.9% of rental revenue, and drug storage remains our largest industry at 10.9% of rental revenue. 
We continue to have excellent credit quality with portfolio with 44% of our rental revenue generated for an investment grade-rated tenants. This percentage will continue to fluctuate and should be positively impacted in 2016 by Walgreens pending acquisition of Rite Aid, which represents 2% of our annualized rental revenue. 
The store level performance of our retail tenants remained sound. Our weighted average rent coverage ratio to the retail properties continues to be 2.6x on a 4-wall basis, and the median [indiscernible]  2.6x. 
Moving on to acquisitions. During the quarter, we completed $204 million in acquisitions, and we continue to see a high volume of sourced acquisition opportunities. 
In 2015, we've sourced approximately 32 billion in acquisition opportunities, which is our second most active year ever for sourced buy in. We remain disciplined in our investment strategy, acquiring just 4% or nearly $1.3 billion of the amount sourced and continue to see a strong opportunities in our target property tax. 
We continue to expect to complete approximately $750 million in acquisitions for 2016. As always, this principally reflects our typical flow business and does not account large-scale transactions.

During the fourth quarter of 2015, we invested $204 million in 104 properties located in 26 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 7.1%, and with the weighted average lease term of 15.7 years. 
On a revenue basis, 28% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants, 59% of the revenues are generated from retail and 11% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 22 different tenants in 17 industries. We closed 14 independent transactions in the fourth quarter and the average investment per property was approximately $2 million.
During 2015, we invested $1.26 billion in 286 properties located in 40 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.6% and with the weighted average lease term of 16.5 years. On a revenue basis, 46% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants, 87% of the revenues are generated from retail and 13% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 45 different tenants in 21 industries. Of the 49 independent transactions closed during 2015, 3 transactions were above $50 million.
Transaction flow continue to remain healthy. We sourced more than $7 billion in the fourth quarter. During 2015, we've have sourced nearly $32 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of these opportunities, 60% of the volume sourced were portfolios and 40% or approximately $13 billion were one-off assets. 
As the pricing, cup rates remained flat in the quarter with investment grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment-grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. 
Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter, we sold 16 properties for $13.9 million at a net cash cap rate of 8.1% and realized an unlevered IRR of 10.2%. This brings us to 38 properties sold in 2015 or $65.4 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.6% and realized an unlevered IRR of 12.1%. 
Our investment spreads, relative to our weighted average cost of capital, were healthy averaging 236 basis points in the fourth quarter, which were above our historical average spreads. For the year, spreads were 183 basis points. 
In conclusion, during the continued activity in our space, we remain confident in reaching our 2016 acquisition target of approximately $750 million and a disposition volume between $50 million and $75 million.

Our AFFO payout ratio in 2015 is 82.9%, which is a level we are quite comfortable with. 
To wrap it up, we had a great year and remain optimistic for 2016. Our portfolio is performing well, and we continue to see a have the buy-in of acquisition of opportunities.

So we'll pursue opportunities in both sectors, the ones that our investment parameters and makes the most sense for us. The investment grade side, you're seeing some fairly aggressive pricing, as Sumit alluded to earlier. You have around the 5% area on the really higher quality product. The non-investment-grade, you're still seeing right around 6% on the higher quality product. That's not much different than where we were at the end of last year. Cap rates have remained stable. But the ranges on investment grade go up to as high as the high sixes and our non-investment-grade, they go up to as high as 8%. But the spreads are better today from an investment standpoint, given our cost of capital. So the year last year, we had investment spreads of 185 basis points on about $1.3 billion that we acquired. In the fourth quarter that was more like 236 -- yes, 236 basis points on the 204 million we acquired. Today, they're running in excess of 250 basis points. So the margins have never been better than they are now in and the acquisition is strong. So we'll be more driven by the opportunities in both the non and -- noninvestment-grade and investment grade sectors, and we'll react to those versus having sort of a fixed percentage of what we want to buy in. And that's pretty consistent of how we've always done it."

Interest expense decreased in the quarter by $7.1 million to $52 million. This decrease was driven by less overall debt in our balance sheet. We repaid $150 million of bonds and almost $200 million of mortgages last year. The decrease was also partially due to the inclusion of preferred dividends that were treated as interest expense in the fourth quarter of last year when we redeemed our Series E preferred equity shares in October of 2014.
Another larger impact was from the recognition of a noncash gain of approximately $4.1 million on interest rate swaps during the quarter, which caused a decrease in net liability and lowered our interest expense. As a reminder, these mark-to-market adjustments on our floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps will tend to cause volatility in our reported interest expense in FFO on a quarterly basis, particularly when there's a significant movement in short-term forward curve rates as we saw at the end of the fourth quarter. We do adjust for this noncash gain when computing our cash AFFO earnings.
On a related note, our coverage ratios both remained strong, with interest coverage of 4.5x and fixed charge coverage at 4.0x. Our fixed charge coverage is the highest it has been in well over 10 years. 
Our G&A in 2015 as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was only 5%. We estimate this will remain our approximate run rate for G&A in 2016 as well.
Our nonreimbursable property expenses in 2015 as a percentage of total rental and other revenues is only 1.4%. These expenses came in lower this year due to lower portfolio vacancy, faster releasing of vacant properties, lower property insurance premiums and fewer one-time expenses. We estimate our run rate for property expenses in 2016 to be approximately 1.5%.
Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. In September, we established an ATM, or at-the-market equity distribution program.
In Q4, we utilized this program to issue approximately 714,000 shares, generating net proceeds of $35.8 million. And in October, we raised $517 million in net proceeds in a common stock offering. We used the proceeds at that time to pay down all outstanding borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility.
This $2 billion credit facility today has a current balance of $370 million. Other than our current facility, the variable rate debt exposure we have is only just $15.5 million of mortgage debt.
And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape, with only $170 million in mortgages and $275 million of bonds coming due in 2016, and our maturity schedule is well lathered thereafter.
Finally, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio stands at approximately 5.1x and is only 5.5x inclusive of preferred equity.
Now let me turn the call back over to John to give you more background on these results."

And let me begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.4%, 10 basis points higher than last quarter and unchanged from a year ago, despite having managed our most active year ever for lease expirations. 
Additionally, economic occupancy remained strong at 99.2%.
During the year, we released 253 properties with leases expiring, recapturing 101% of expiring rent.
As is typical for us, we achieved this without any spending on tenant improvements. At the end of the year, we had 71 properties available for lease out of 4,538 properties in the portfolio.
Over the last 2 years, we have re-leased to sold more than 2,000 properties with expired leases, recapturing approximately 98% of rents on those properties that were re-leased.
Our same-store rent increased 1.3% during the quarter and also for the year. We expect annual same-store rent growth to remain approximately 1.3% in 2016. 90% of our releases have contractural rent increases. Approximately 75% of our investment grade leases have rental rate growth that averages about 1.3%.
Additionally, we've never had a year with negative same-store rent growth since we started reporting this metric 20 years ago.
Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant and mystery, geography and, to a certain extent, property type, all of which contributes to the stability of our cash flow.
At the end of the year, our properties were leased to 240 commercial tenants in 47 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico. 79% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties.
The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue. There was not much movement in the composition of our top tenants in the industries during the quarter.
Walgreen remains our largest tenant at 6.9% of rental revenue, and drugstores remain our largest industry at 10.9% of rental revenue. 
We continue to have excellent credit quality with portfolio, with 44% of our rental revenue generated from an investment grade-rated tenants. This percentage will continue to fluctuate and should be positively impacted in 2016 by Walgreens pending acquisition of Rite Aid, which represents 2% of our annualized rental revenue. 
The store level performance of our retail tenants remained sound. Our weighted average rent coverage ratio to the retail properties continues to be 2.6x on a 4-wall basis, and the median is also 2.6x. 
Moving on to acquisitions. During the quarter, we completed $204 million in acquisitions, and we continue to see a high volume of sourced acquisition opportunities. 
In 2015, we sourced approximately $32 billion in acquisition opportunities, which is our second-most active year ever for source volume. We remain disciplined in our investment strategy, acquiring just 4% or nearly $1.3 billion on the amount sourced and continue to see strong forward opportunities in our target property tax. 
We continue to expect to complete approximately $750 million in acquisitions for 2016. As always, this principally reflects our typical flow business and does not account for any large-scale transactions.

During the fourth quarter of 2015, we invested $204 million in 104 properties located in 26 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 7.1%, and with a weighted average lease term of 15.7 years.
On a revenue basis, 28% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants, 89% of the revenues are generated from retail and 11% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 23 different tenants in 17 industries. We closed 14 independent transactions in the fourth quarter, and the average investment per property was approximately $2 million.
During 2015, we invested $1.26 billion in 286 properties located in 40 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.6% and with a weighted average lease term of 16.5 years. 
On a revenue basis, 46% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 87% of the revenues are generated from retail and 13% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 45 different tenants in 21 industries. Of the 49 independent transactions closed during 2015, 3 transactions were above $50 million.
Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced more than $7 billion in the fourth quarter. During 2015, we have sourced nearly $32 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of these opportunities, 60% of the volume sourced were portfolios and 40% or approximately $13 billion were one-off assets.
As to pricing, cup rates remained flat in the quarter, with investment-grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment-grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. 
Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter, we sold 16 properties for $13.9 million at a net cash cap rate of 8.1% and realized an unlevered IRR of 10.2%. This brings us to 38 properties sold in 2015 for $65.4 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.6% and realized an unlevered IRR of 12.1%. 
Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy, averaging 236 basis points in the fourth quarter, which were above our historical average spreads. For the year, spreads were 183 basis points. 
In conclusion, given the continued activity in our space, we remain confident in reaching our 2016 acquisition target of approximately $750 million and a disposition volume between $50 million and $75 million.

So we'll pursue opportunities in both sectors, the ones that our investment parameters and makes the most sense for us. On the investment-grade side, you're seeing some fairly aggressive pricing, as Sumit alluded to earlier. You have around the 5% area on a really higher-quality product. The non-investment-grade, you're still seeing right around 6% on the higher-quality product. That's not much different than where we were at the end of last year. Cap rates have remained stable. But the ranges on investment grade go up to as high as the high 6s and non-investment-grade, they go up to as high as 8%. But the spreads are better today from an investment standpoint, given our cost of capital. So for the year -- last year, we had investment spreads of 185 basis points on about $1.3 billion that we acquired. In the fourth quarter, that was more like 236 -- yes, 236 basis points on the $204 million we acquired. Today, they're running in excess of 250 basis points. So the margins have never been better than they are now in on the acquisitions front. So we'll be more driven by the opportunities in both the non-investment-grade and investment-grade sectors, and we'll react to those versus having sort of a fixed percentage of what we want to buy in. And that's pretty -- that's consistent with how we've always done it."

And in fact, some of them even resulted in transactions that we were involved in, in last year. Whereas in 2014, most of the product that we saw different companies that were very familiar with the sale-leaseback market and most of the volume driven by are the resellers of large portfolios, both private and public and/or companies that have done sale leasebacks in the past. So the only real change in terms of the product mix, I would say what we saw, was new entrants coming in that had not engaged in conversations in years past.

I'm going to provide a few highlights of just a few items in our financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement.Interest expense decreased in the quarter by $7.1 million to $52 million. This decrease was driven by le",500,"Thanks, John. I'm going to provide a few highlights of just a few items in our financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement.
Interest expense decreased in the quarter by $7.1 million to $52 million. This decrease was driven by less overall debt in our balance sheet. We repaid $150 million of bonds and almost $200 million of mortgages last year. The decrease was also partially due to the inclusion of preferred dividends that were treated as interest expense in the fourth quarter of last year when we redeemed our Series E preferred equity shares in October of 2014.
Another larger impact was from the recognition of a noncash gain of approximately $4.1 million on interest rate swaps during the quarter, which caused a decrease in net liability and lowered our interest expense. As a reminder, these mark-to-market adjustments on our floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps will tend to cause volatility in our reported interest expense in FFO on a quarterly basis, particularly when there's a significant movement in short-term forward curve rates as we saw at the end of the fourth quarter. We do adjust for this noncash gain when computing our cash AFFO earnings.
On a related note, our coverage ratios both remained strong, with interest coverage of 4.5x and fixed charge coverage at 4.0x. Our fixed charge coverage is the highest it has been in well over 10 years. 
Our G&A in 2015 as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was only 5%. We estimate this will remain our approximate run rate for G&A in 2016 as well.
Our nonreimbursable property expenses in 2015 as a percentage of total rental and other revenues is only 1.4%. These expenses came in lower this year due to lower portfolio vacancy, faster re-leasing of vacant properties, lower property insurance premiums and fewer one-time expenses. We estimate our run rate for property expenses in 2016 to be approximately 1.5%.
Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. In September, we established an ATM, or at-the-market equity distribution program.
In Q4, we utilized this program to issue approximately 714,000 shares, generating net proceeds of $35.8 million. And in October, we raised $517 million in net proceeds in a common stock offering. We used the proceeds at that time to pay down all outstanding borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility.
This $2 billion credit facility today has a current balance of $370 million. Other than our current facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have is only just $15.5 million of mortgage debt.
And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape, with only $170 million in mortgages and $275 million of bonds coming due in 2016, and our maturity schedule is well laddered thereafter.

And let me begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.4%, 10 basis points higher than last quarter and unchanged from a year ago, despite having managed our most active year ever for lease expirations. 
Additionally, economic occupancy remained strong at 99.2%.
During the year, we re-leased 253 properties with leases expiring, recapturing 101% of expiring rent.
As is typical for us, we achieved this without any spending on tenant improvements. At the end of the year, we had 71 properties available for lease out of 4,538 properties in the portfolio.
Over the last 20 [ph] years, we have re-leased or sold more than 2,000 properties with expired leases, recapturing approximately 98% of rents on those properties that were re-leased.
Our same-store rent increased 1.3% during the quarter and also for the year. We expect annual same-store rent growth to remain approximately 1.3% in 2016. 90% of our re-leases have contractual rent increases. Approximately 75% of our investment grade leases have rental rate growth that averages about 1.3%.
Additionally, we've never had a year with negative same-store rent growth since we started reporting this metric 20 years ago.
Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and,to a certain extent, property type, all of which contributes to the stability of our cash flow.
At the end of the year, our properties were leased to 240 commercial tenants in 47 different industries located in 49 states and Puerto Rico. 79% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties.
The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue. There was not much movement in the composition of our top tenants in the industries during the 4th quarter.
Walgreen remains our largest tenant at 6.9% of rental revenue, and drugstores remain our largest industry at 10.9% of rental revenue. 
We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio, with 44% of our rental revenue generated from an investment grade-rated tenants. This percentage will continue to fluctuate and should be positively impacted in 2016 by Walgreens pending acquisition of Rite Aid, which represents 2% of our annualized rental revenue. 
The store level performance of our retail tenants remained sound. Our weighted average rent coverage ratio to the retail properties continues to be 2.6x on a 4-wall basis, and the median is also 2.6x. 
Moving on to acquisitions. During the quarter, we completed $204 million in acquisitions, and we continue to see a high volume of sourced acquisition opportunities. 
In 2015, we sourced approximately $32 billion in acquisition opportunities, which is our second-most active year ever for source volume. We remain disciplined in our investment strategy, acquiring just 4% or nearly $1.3 billion of the amount sourced and continue to see strong forward opportunities in our target property tax. 
We continue to expect to complete approximately $750 million in acquisitions for 2016. As always, this principally reflects our typical flow business and does not account for any large-scale transactions. 
Let me hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions. Sumit?"

During the fourth quarter of 2015, we invested $204 million in 104 properties located in 26 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 7.1%, and with a weighted average lease term of 15.7 years.
On a revenue basis, 28% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants, 89% of the revenues are generated from retail and 11% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 23 different tenants in 17 industries. We closed 14 independent transactions in the fourth quarter, and the average investment per property was approximately $2 million.
During 2015, we invested $1.26 billion in 286 properties located in 40 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.6% and with a weighted average lease term of 16.5 years. 
On a revenue basis, 46% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 87% of the revenues are generated from retail and 13% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 45 different tenants in 21 industries. Of the 49 independent transactions closed during 2015, 3 transactions were above $50 million.
Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced more than $7 billion in the fourth quarter. During 2015, we have sourced nearly $32 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of these opportunities, 60% of the volume sourced were portfolios and 40% or approximately $13 billion were one-off assets.
As to pricing, cup rates remained flat in the 4th quarter, with investment-grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment-grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. 
Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter, we sold 16 properties for $13.9 million at a net cash cap rate of 8.1% and realized an unlevered IRR of 10.2%. This brings us to 38 properties sold in 2015 for $65.4 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.6% and realized an unlevered IRR of 12.1%. 
Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy, averaging 236 basis points in the fourth quarter, which were above our historical average spreads. For the year, spreads were 183 basis points. 
In conclusion, given the continued activity in our space, we remain confident in reaching our 2016 acquisition target of approximately $750 million and a disposition volume between $50 million and $75 million. 
With that, I would like to hand it back to John."

In 2015, we raised approximately $1.2 billion in equity capital, positioning us well as we entered 2016. 
We are now at the lowest leverage levels we've been at in 10 years, with debt to total market cap at approximately 25%. Our balance sheet remains in excellent shape with plenty of liquidity and financial flexibility. And our sector-leading cost of capital continues to allow us to drive strong earnings and dividend growth, while remaining disciplined with our investment strategy. 
Last month, we announced our 84th dividend increase, representing a 5% increase from this time last year. We've increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of just under 5%.
Our AFFO payout ratio in 2015 is 82.9%, which is a level we are quite comfortable with.
To wrap it up, we had a great year and remain optimistic for 2016. Our portfolio is performing well, and we continue to see a healthy volume of acquisition opportunities. We remain well positioned to act on high-quality acquisitions, given our strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and cost of capital advantage.

The non-investment-grade, you're still seeing right around 6% on the higher-quality product. That's not much different than where we were at the end of last year. Cap rates have remained stable. But the ranges on investment grade go up to as high as the high 6s and non-investment-grade, they go up to as high as 8%. But the spreads are better today from an investment standpoint, given our cost of capital. So for the year -- last year, we had investment spreads of 185 basis points on about $1.3 billion that we acquired. In the fourth quarter, that was more like 236 -- yes, 236 basis points on the $204 million we acquired. Today, they're running in excess of 250 basis points. So the margins have never been better than they are now in on the acquisitions front. So we'll be more driven by the opportunities in both the non-investment-grade and investment-grade sectors, and we'll react to those versus having sort of a fixed percentage of what we want to buy in each.

And in fact, some of them even resulted in transactions that we were involved in, in last year. Whereas in 2014, most of the product that we saw were from companies that were very familiar with the sale-leaseback market and most of the volume driven were by either the sellers of large portfolios, both private and public and/or companies that have done sale leasebacks in the past. So the only real change in terms of the product mix, I would say what we saw, was new entrants coming in that had not engaged in conversations in years past.

I'm going to provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter starting with the income statement. Interest expense increased in the quarter by $2.2 million to $60.7 million. This increase was due to the recognition of a non-cash loss of approximately $5.8 million on interest rate swaps during the quarter. As a reminder, these mark to market adjustment on our floating to fixed rate interest rate swaps will tend to cause volatility in our reported interest expense and FFO on a quarterly basis, particularly when there are significant movements and short-term forward curve rates as we saw in the first quarter. Naturally, this valuation will fluctuate based on the outlook for interest rates. Last quarter resulted in a $4.1 million non-cash gain. We do adjust for these non-cash gains or losses when computing our cash AFFO earnings. The increase in interest expense was partially offset by less overall debt in our balance sheet. We repaid $150 million of bonds and over $300 million in mortgages over the last 12 months. On a related note, our coverage ratios both remain strong and continued to tick higher, with interest coverage at 4.6x and fixed charge coverage at 4.1x. Our fixed charge coverage is at the highest it has been in well over 10 years. 
Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was less than 4.8%, which continues to be the lowest percentage in the net lease sector. Our nonreimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 2.3%. As a percentage of revenue, these expenses came in slightly higher than normal due to temporarily higher carry costs for some vacant properties and some timing issues on tenant reimbursement, which will be received in the second quarter. We continue to estimate our run rate for property expenses in 2016 to be approximately 1.5% of revenues. 
Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we continue to maintain our conservative capital structure. Last year, we established an ATM or at-the-market equity distribution program. In the first quarter, we utilized this program to issue 500,000 shares, generating net proceeds of approximately $31 million. Our $2 billion credit facility has a balance of approximately $650 million. Other than our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have is on just $22.8 million of mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape, with only $22 million of mortgages and $275 million of bonds coming due in 2016, and our maturity schedule is well thereafter. And finally, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio stands at approximately 5.3x and is only 5.8x inclusive of preferred equity. 
Now let me turn the call back over to John to give you more background on these results."

Thanks, Paul. I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio which continues to perform well. Occupancy, based on a number of properties, was 97.8%. Occupancy declined a bit due to a number of leases expiring during the quarter, including leases projected through the buffets Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in March. We're working through this additional vacancy with our re-leasing and sales efforts and continue to expect to end the year at approximately 98% occupancy. Economic occupancy was 98.8%. On the 38 properties we re-leased during the quarter, we recaptured 112% of the expiring impact, which represents our strongest quarterly recapture rate since we began reporting this metric in 2014. As is typical for us, we achieved this without any spending on tenant improvement. Our re-leasing results reflect the high quality of our real estate portfolio, a testament to our disciplined investment underwriting and proactive portfolio management efforts. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold more than 2,100 properties with leases expiring, recapturing approximately 98% of rent on these qualities that we re-leased. This compares favorably to our net lease peers who also report this metric. 
Our same store rent increased 1.3% during the quarter and we expect annual same store rent growth to be approximately 1.3% for 2016. 90% of our leases have contractual rent increases, and we remain pleased with the growth we are able to achieve from our properties. Approximately 75% of our investment grade leases have rental rate growth that averages about 1.3%. Additionally, we had never had a year with negative same-store rent growth. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography, and to a certain extent, property type, all of which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 243 commercial tenants in 47 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico. 79% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenues. There was not much movement in the composition of our top tenants and industries during the first quarter. Walgreens remains our largest tenant accounting for 6.8% of rental revenues, and drugstores remain our largest industry at 11% of rental revenues.  We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio, with 44% of our annualized rental revenue generated for our investment grade rated tenants. This percentage will continue to fluctuate and should be positively impacted in the second half of this year by Walgreens' pending acquisition of Rite Aid, which represents about 2% of our annualized rental revenue.  The store level performance of our retail tenants also remains sound. Our weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties increased to 2.7x on a [indiscernible] basis and the median remained at 2.6x for the first quarter. 
Moving on to acquisitions, during the quarter, we completed $353 million in acquisitions at record spreads through our weighted average cost of capital, and we continue to see a strong flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. During the quarter, we sourced $6.2 billion in acquisition opportunities, putting us on pace for another active year in acquisition. We remain disciplined in our investment strategy, acquiring just 6% of the amount we source, which is consistent with our average since 2010. As a reminder, our revised acquisitions guidance of approximately $900 million, principally reflects our typical flow business and does not account for any unidentified large-scale transaction. 
I'll hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions."

During the first quarter of 2016, we invested $353 million in 103 properties located in 31 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.6% and with a weighted average lease term of 155.8 years. On a revenue basis, 23% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants. 86% of the revenues are generated from retail and 14% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 26 different tenants in 18 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are restaurants and motor vehicle dealerships. Retail's 19 independent transactions in the first quarter and the average investment for property was approximately $3.4 million. 
Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced more than $6 billion in the first quarter. Of these opportunities, 48% of the volume sourced were portfolio and 52% or more than $3 billion, were one-off assets. Investment grade opportunities represented 30% for the first quarter. Of the $353 million in acquisitions closed in the first quarter, 37% were one-off transactions. We continue to capitalize in our extensive industry relationship developed over our 47 year operating history. Our surprising cap rates remained flat in the first quarter, with investment grade properties trading up to around 5% to high 6% cap rate range, and non-investment-grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter, we sold 11 properties where net proceeds of $11 million at a cash cap rate of 6.9% and realized an unlevered IRR of 6.6%. Our investment spread relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy averaging 255 basis points in the first quarter, which were well above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year lag. 
In conclusion, as John mentioned, we're raising our acquisition guidance for 2016 to approximately $900 million. We remained confident reaching our 2016 disposition target of between $50 million and $75 million.

Following the very active year we had in the capital markets in 2015, we raised 35 million in common equity during the first quarter. Approximately $31 million of the equity raised during this quarter was through our ATM program. Our leverage continues to be at historical lows with the debt to market cap of approximately 24%, debt-to-EBITDA of 5.3x and a debt service coverage ratio of 4.6x. We currently have more than 1.3 billion of capacity on our $2 billion revolving line of credit, providing us with excellent liquidity as we grow our company. Our sector-leading cost of capital and balance sheet flexibility allows us to drive earnings per share and dividend growth while remaining disciplined with our investment and underwriting strategy.  Last month, we announced our 85th dividend increase, representing a 5% increase from this time last year. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of just under 5%. Our current AFFO payout ratio at the midpoint of our 2016 AFFO per share guidance is 83%, a level we are quite comfortable with. 
To wrap it up, we had a solid quarter and remain optimistic for 2016. As demonstrated by our sector leading EBITDA margin of approximately 94%, we continue to realize the efficiencies associated with our size and the economies of scale and our net lease business. Our portfolio is performing well and be continuing to see a healthy volume of acquisition opportunities. The net lease acquisitions environment remains a very efficient marketplace, and we believe we're in the best position to capitalize on the highest quality opportunities given our strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and distinct cost of capital advantage.

So those are the size of the 2 watch lists at this point. With regard to -- when we look at the material exposures that we have, we thought we are in very good shape. With regard to Sports Authority, which we typically do not talk about tenants outside of our top 20, they've been in our top 20 before, and obviously they're in the news and we don't want to address that today. Sports Authority, we have no more exposure to well under 1% of rent. The stores that we have are receiving significant interest from a number of national retailers. Some sporting goods stores, but also retailers outside of that sector. Our cash flows on those stores, our cash flow coverages are quite strong, and I think this morning, as you probably saw, they announced that they were going to pursue their liquidation. Our guidance has incorporated our expectations with regard to Sports Authority and any other credit issues into it. So that's why we're sticking on the AFFO per share, $2.85 to $2.90. So we think we're going to end up the year at occupancy of approximately 98%. We're at 97.8% today. Obviously, we started the year off at 98.4%. The biggest hit was in the first quarter, late in the first quarter, when we received the Ovation Brands, Buffay's properties back. And that was the sole reason, principally the sole reason from the downtick in occupancy. And they came in late in the quarter. So we didn't have a lot of opportunity to work those properties in terms of re-leasing and sales."

I'm going to provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter starting with the income statement. Interest expense increased in the quarter by $2.2 million to $60.7 million. This increase was due to the recognition of a non-cash loss of approximately $5.8 million on interest rate swaps during the quarter. As a reminder, these mark to market adjustment on our floating to fixed rate interest rate swaps will tend to cause volatility in our reported interest expense and AFFO on a quarterly basis, particularly when there is significant movements in short-term forward curve rates, as we saw in the first quarter. Naturally, this valuation will fluctuate based on the outlook for interest rates. Last quarter resulted in a $4.1 million non-cash gain. We do adjust for these non-cash gains or losses when computing our cash AFFO earnings. The increase in interest expense was partially offset by less overall debt in our balance sheet. We repaid $150 million of bonds and over $300 million in mortgages over the last 12 months. On a related note, our coverage ratios both remained strong and continued to tick higher, with interest coverage at 4.6x and fixed charge coverage at 4.1x. Our fixed charge coverage is the highest it has been in well over 10 years. 
Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was less than 4.8%, which continues to be the lowest percentage in the net lease sector. Our non-reimbursable property expenses, as a percentage of total rental and other revenues, was 2.3%. As a percentage of revenue, these expenses came in slightly higher than normal due to temporarily higher carry cost on some vacant properties and some timing issues on tenant reimbursements, which will be received in the second quarter. We continue to estimate our run rate for property expenses in 2016 to be approximately 1.5% of revenues. 
Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we continue to maintain our conservative capital structure. Last year, we established an ATM or at-the-market equity distribution program. In the first quarter, we utilized this program to issue 500,000 shares, generating net proceeds of approximately $31 million. Our $2 billion credit facility has a balance of approximately $650 million. Other than our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have is on just $22.8 million of mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape, with only $22 million in mortgages and $275 million of bonds coming due in 2016, and our maturity schedule is well laddered thereafter. And finally, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio stands at approximately 5.3x, and is only 5.8x inclusive of preferred equity. 
Now let me turn the call back over to John to give you more background on these results."

Thanks, Paul. I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. Occupancy, based on a number of properties, was 97.8%. Occupancy declined a bit due to a number of leases expiring during the quarter, including leases projected through the buffets Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in March. We're working through this additional vacancy with our re-leasing and sales efforts and continue to expect to end the year at approximately 98% occupancy. Economic occupancy was 98.8%. On the 38 properties we re-leased during the quarter, we recaptured 112% of the expiring rent, which represents our strongest quarterly recapture rate since we began recording this metric in 2014. As is typical for us, we achieved this without any spending on tenant improvement. Our re-leasing results reflect the high quality of our real estate portfolio, a testament to our disciplined investment underwriting and proactive portfolio management efforts. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold more than 2,100 properties with leases expiring, recapturing approximately 98% of rent on those properties that we re-leased. This compares favorably to our net lease peers who also report this metric. 
Our same store rent increased 1.3% during the quarter and we expect annual same store rent growth to be approximately 1.3% for 2016. 90% of our leases have contractual rent increases, and we remain pleased with the growth we are able to achieve from our properties. Approximately 75% of our investment grade leases have rental rate growth that averages about 1.3%. Additionally, we had never had a year with negative same-store rent growth. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography, and to a certain extent, property type, all of which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 243 commercial tenants in 47 different industries, located in 49 states in Puerto Rico. 79% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenues. There was not much movement in the composition of our top tenants and industries during the first quarter. Walgreens remains our largest tenant, accounting for 6.8% of rental revenues, and drugstores remain our largest industry at 11% of rental revenues.  We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio, with 44% of our annualized rental revenue generated for an investment-grade rated tenant. This percentage will continue to fluctuate, and should be positively impacted in the second half of this year by Walgreens' pending acquisition of Rite Aid, which represents about 2% of our annualized rental revenue.  The store level performance of our retail tenants also remains sound. Our weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties increased to 2.7x on a four-wall basis, and the median remained at 2.6x for the first quarter. 
Moving on to acquisitions. During the quarter, we completed $353 million in acquisitions at record spreads through our weighted average cost of capital, and we continue to see a strong flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. During the quarter, we sourced $6.2 billion in acquisition opportunities, putting us on pace for another active year in acquisitions. We remain disciplined in our investment strategy, acquiring just 6% of the amount we sourced, which is consistent with our average since 2010. As a reminder, our revised acquisitions guidance of approximately $900 million principally reflects our typical flow business, and does not account for any unidentified large-scale transaction. 
I'll hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions."

During the first quarter of 2016, we invested $353 million in 103 properties located in 31 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.6% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.8 years. On a revenue basis, 23% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants. 86% of the revenues are generated from retail and 14% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 26 different tenants in 18 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are restaurants and motor vehicle dealerships. Retail's 19 independent transactions in the first quarter and the average investment for property was approximately $3.4 million. 
Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced more than $6 billion in the first quarter. Of these opportunities, 48% of the volume sourced were portfolio and 52% or more than $3 billion were one-off assets. Investment grade opportunities represented 30% for the first quarter. Of the $353 million in acquisitions closed in the first quarter, 37% were one-off transactions. We continue to capitalize on our extensive industry relationships developed over our 47-year operating history. Our surprising cap rates remained flat in the first quarter, with investment grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range, and non-investment-grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter, we sold 11 properties for net proceeds of $11 million at a cash cap rate of 6.9%, and realized an unlevered IRR of 6.6%. Our investment spread, relative to our weighted average cost of capital, were healthy, averaging 255 basis points in the first quarter, which were well above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year lag. 
In conclusion, as John mentioned, we're raising our acquisition guidance for 2016 to approximately $900 million. We remained confident with reaching our 2016 disposition target of between $50 million and $75 million.

Our leverage continues to be at historical lows, with debt to market cap of approximately 24%, debt-to-EBITDA of 5.3x and a debt service coverage ratio of 4.6x. We currently have more than 1.3 billion of capacity on our $2 billion revolving line of credit, providing us with excellent liquidity as we grow our company. Our sector-leading cost of capital and balance sheet flexibility allows us to drive earnings per share and dividend growth, while remaining disciplined with our investment and underwriting strategy. Last month, we announced our 85th dividend increase, representing a 5% increase from this time last year. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of just under 5%. Our current AFFO payout ratio at the midpoint of our 2016 AFFO per share guidance is 83%, a level we are quite comfortable with. 
To wrap it up, we had a solid quarter and remain optimistic for 2016. As demonstrated by our sector leading EBITDA margin of approximately 94%, we continue to realize the efficiencies associated with our size and the economies of scale in our net lease business. Our portfolio is performing well and be continuing to see a healthy volume of acquisition opportunities. The net lease acquisitions environment remains a very efficient marketplace, and we believe we best-positioned to capitalize on the highest quality opportunities, given our strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and distinct cost of capital advantage.

So those are the size of the 2 watch lists at this point. With regard to -- when you look at the material exposures that we have, we thought we are in very good shape. With regard to Sports Authority, which we typically do not talk about tenants outside of our top 20, they've been in our top 20 before, and obviously, they're in the news, and we didn't want to address that today. Sports Authority, we have no more exposure to well under 1% of rent. The stores that we have are receiving significant interest from a number of national retailers, some sporting goods stores, but also retailers outside of that sector. And our cash flows on those stores, our cash flow coverages are quite strong, and I think this morning, as you probably saw, they announced that they were going to pursue a liquidation. Our guidance has incorporated our expectations with regard to Sports Authority and any other credit issues into it. So that's why we're sticking with -- on the AFFO per share, $2.85 to $2.90. So we think we're going to end up the year at occupancy of approximately 98%. We're at 97.8% today. Obviously, we started the year off at 98.4%. The biggest hit was in the first quarter, late in the first quarter, when we received the Ovation Brands or buffets properties back. And that was the sole reason, or principally the sole reason for the downtick in occupancy, and they came in late in the quarter. So we didn't have a lot of opportunity to work those properties in terms of re-leasing and sales."

I'm going to provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter starting with the income statement. Interest expense increased in the quarter by $2.2 million to $60.7 million. This increase was due to the recognition of a non-cash loss of approximately $5.8 million on interest rate swaps during the quarter. As a reminder, these mark to market adjustment on our floating to fixed rate interest rate swaps will tend to cause volatility in our reported interest expense and FFO on a quarterly basis, particularly when there is significant movements in short-term forward curve rates, as we saw in the first quarter. Naturally, this valuation will fluctuate based on the outlook for interest rates. Last quarter resulted in a $4.1 million non-cash gain. We do adjust for these non-cash gains or losses when computing our cash AFFO earnings. The increase in interest expense was partially offset by less overall debt in our balance sheet. We repaid $150 million of bonds and over $300 million in mortgages over the last 12 months. On a related note, our coverage ratios both remained strong and continued to tick higher, with interest coverage at 4.6x and fixed charge coverage at 4.1x. Our fixed charge coverage is the highest it has been in well over 10 years. 
Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was less than 4.8%, which continues to be the lowest percentage in the net lease sector. Our non-reimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 2.3%. As a percentage of revenue, these expenses came in slightly higher than normal due to temporarily higher carry cost on some vacant properties and some timing issues on tenant reimbursements, which will be received in the second quarter. We continue to estimate our run rate for property expenses in 2016 to be approximately 1.5% of revenues. 
Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we’ve continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. Last year, we established an ATM, or at-the-market, equity distribution program. In the first quarter, we utilized this program to issue 500,000 shares, generating net proceeds of approximately $31 million. Our $2 billion credit facility has a balance of approximately $650 million. Other than our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have is on just $22.8 million of mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape, with only $22 million in mortgages and $275 million of bonds coming due in 2016, and our maturity schedule is well laddered thereafter. And finally, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio stands at approximately 5.3x, and is only 5.8x inclusive of preferred equity. 
Now let me turn the call back over to John to give you more background on these results."

Thanks, Paul. I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. Occupancy, based on a number of properties, was 97.8%. Occupancy declined a bit due to a number of leases expiring during the quarter, including leases projected through the buffets Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in March. We're working through this additional vacancy with our re-leasing and sales efforts and continue to expect to end the year at approximately 98% occupancy. Economic occupancy was 98.8%. On the 38 properties we re-leased during the quarter, we recaptured 112% of the expiring rent, which represents our strongest quarterly recapture rate since we began recording this metric in 2014. As is typical for us, we achieved this without any spending on tenant improvement. Our re-leasing results reflect the high quality of our real estate portfolio, a testament to our disciplined investment underwriting and proactive portfolio management efforts. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold more than 2,100 properties with leases expiring, recapturing approximately 98% of rent on those properties that we re-leased. This compares favorably to our net lease peers who also report this metric. 
Our same store rent increased 1.3% during the quarter, and we expect annual same store rent growth to be approximately 1.3% for 2016. 90% of our leases have contractual rent increases, so we remain pleased with the growth we are able to achieve from our properties. Approximately 75% of our investment grade leases have rental rate growth that averages about 1.3%. Additionally, we have never had a year with negative same-store rent growth. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography, and to a certain extent, property type, all of which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 243 commercial tenants in 47 different industries located in 49 states and Puerto Rico. 79% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenues. There was not much movement in the composition of our top tenants and industries during the first quarter. Walgreens remains our largest tenant, accounting for 6.8% of rental revenues, and drugstores remain our largest industry at 11% of rental revenues. We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio, with 44% of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment-grade rated tenant. This percentage will continue to fluctuate, and should be positively impacted in the second half of this year by Walgreens' pending acquisition of Rite Aid, which represents about 2% of our annualized rental revenue.  The store level performance of our retail tenants also remains sound. Our weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties increased to 2.7x on a four-wall basis, and the median remained at 2.6x for the first quarter. 
Moving on to acquisitions. During the quarter, we completed $353 million in acquisitions at record spreads through our weighted average cost of capital, and we continue to see a strong flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. During the quarter, we sourced $6.2 billion in acquisition opportunities, putting us on pace for another active year in acquisitions. We remain disciplined in our investment strategy, acquiring just 6% of the amount we sourced, which is consistent with our average since 2010. As a reminder, our revised acquisitions guidance of approximately $900 million principally reflects our typical flow business, and does not account for any unidentified large-scale transactions. 
I'll hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions."

During the first quarter of 2016, we invested $353 million in 103 properties located in 31 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.6% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.8 years. On a revenue basis, 23% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 86% of the revenues are generated from retail and 14% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 26 different tenants in 18 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are restaurants and motor vehicle dealerships. We closed 19 independent transactions in the first quarter, and the average investment for property was approximately $3.4 million. 
Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced more than $6 billion in the first quarter. Of these opportunities, 48% of the volume sourced were portfolio and 52% or more than $3 billion were one-off assets. Investment grade opportunities represented 30% for the first quarter. Of the $353 million in acquisitions closed in the first quarter, 37% were one-off transactions. We continue to capitalize on our extensive industry relationships developed over our 47-year operating history. Our surprising cap rates remained flat in the first quarter, with investment-grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range, and non-investment-grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter, we sold 11 properties for net proceeds of $11 million at a cash cap rate of 6.9%, and realized an unlevered IRR of 6.6%. Our investment spread relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy, averaging 255 basis points in the first quarter, which were well above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year lag. 
In conclusion, as John mentioned, we're raising our acquisition guidance for 2016 to approximately $900 million. We remained confident with reaching our 2016 disposition target of between $50 million and $75 million.

Following the very active year we had in the capital markets in 2015, we raised $35 million in common equity during the first quarter.

We currently have more than $1.3 billion of capacity on our $2 billion revolving line of credit, providing us with excellent liquidity as we grow our company. Our sector-leading cost of capital and balance sheet flexibility allows us to drive earnings per share and dividend growth while remaining disciplined with our investment and underwriting strategy. Last month, we announced our 85th dividend increase, representing a 5% increase from this time last year. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of just under 5%. Our current AFFO payout ratio at the midpoint of our 2016 AFFO per share guidance is 83%, a level we are quite comfortable with. 
To wrap it up, we had a solid quarter and remain optimistic for 2016. As demonstrated by our sector-leading EBITDA margin of approximately 94%, we continue to realize the efficiencies associated with our size and the economies of scale in our net lease business. Our portfolio is performing well, and we continue to see a healthy volume of acquisition opportunities. The net lease acquisitions environment remains a very efficient marketplace, and we believe we are best-positioned to capitalize on the highest-quality opportunities, given our strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and distinct cost of capital advantage.

One, as you remember, we have a credit watch list that's 5.8%, and then we have an overall watch list. And that overall watch list incorporates everything, including the quality of the real estate location, industry trends, concentrations we may have, not just credit. So those are the size of the 2 watch lists at this point. With regard to -- when we look at the material exposures that we have, we thought we are in very good shape. With regard to Sports Authority, which we typically do not talk about tenants outside of our top 20, they've been in our top 20 before, and obviously, they're in the news, so we did want to address that today. Sports Authority, we have no more exposure to well under 1% of rent. The stores that we have are receiving significant interest from a number of national retailers, some sporting goods stores, but also retailers outside of that sector. And our cash flows on those stores, our cash flow coverages are quite strong, and I think this morning, as you probably saw, they announced that they were going to pursue a liquidation. Our guidance has incorporated our expectations with regard to Sports Authority and any other credit issues into it. So that's why we're sticking with -- on the AFFO per share, $2.85 to $2.90. So we think we're going to end up the year at occupancy of approximately 98%. We're at 97.8% today. Obviously, we started the year off at 98.4%. The biggest hit was in the first quarter, late in the first quarter, when we received the Ovation Brands or buffets properties back. And that was the sole reason, or principally the sole reason for the downtick in occupancy, and they came in late in the quarter. So we didn't have a lot of opportunity to work those properties in terms of re-leasing and sales."

But I'll tell you, we are looking at FedEx 15 year deals in the market that are trading in the mid-5s. So that's one of the reasons why if you look at what our development cap rate or yield was, it was in that 6, 8 zip code. It was because a couple of our forwards came into very high quality forward transactions closed -- and John has mentioned this in some of the question that he's answered -- there is a significant delta between some of these forwards that we have entered into, as well as portfolio deals that we've entered into and one-off market that we are seeing in today's environment. So that's the response on the FedEx. You mentioned that we did sell a couple of NPCs, and you're absolutely right, those are Pizza Hut branded assets. That is something that we have consciously been going through and culling our assets on. I mean, assets that we believe no longer fit our strategic objective. We are trying to cull them, and it wasn't a very big disposition quarter for us, but we expect to get rid of anywhere between $50 million to $75 million of assets through the year."

Other revenue this quarter was a negative amount, negative $129,000. This was the result of a reclassification of some revenue from other revenue where it was booked in Q1 to rental revenue where it's reflected here in Q2. Our G&A, as a percentage of total rental and other revenues, was 5.4% this quarter due to higher stock compensation costs for our Board of Directors in the quarter. Their stock grants occur in May and our higher stock price this spring caused this expense to be a little higher. Year-to-date, our G&A is only 5.1% of revenues and we're still projecting approximately 5% for the year. Our nonreimbursable property expenses, as a percentage of total rental and other revenues, was 1.4% and we are still projecting approximately 1.5% for the year. Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we have continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. We've raised $487 million of common equity capital thus far, this year. Our $2 billion credit facility, which has a $1 billion expansion option, has a balance of approximately $530 million. Other than our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure is only just $22.6 million of our mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape but only $5 million of mortgages and $275 million of bonds coming due during second half of 2016. And our maturity schedules will allow thereafter. Finally our overall leverage remains well with our debt-to-EBITDA ratio standing in approximately 5.1x. So in summary, we have low leverage, excellent liquidity and good access to both equity and debt capital, both of which are well priced financing alternatives for us right now.

Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98%, a 20 basis points increase from last quarter. Economic occupancy was 98.9%, also up from last quarter. We continue to make good progress with our re-leasing and sales efforts and expect to end the year at approximately 98% occupancy. On the 37 properties we re-leased during the quarter, we recaptured 92% of the expiring rent. As is typical for us, we have no spending on tenant improvements in connection with our re-leasing. Year-to-date, we have recaptured 103% of expiring rent on 75 lease rollovers, which remains well above our long-term average. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold more than 2,100 properties with expiring leases, recapturing approximately 98% of rent on those properties that were re-leased. This compares favorably to our other net lease peer companies who also report this metric. Our same-store rent increased 1.4% during the quarter and 1.3% year-to-date. We continue to expect annual same-store rent growth to be approximately 1.3% for 2016. Approximately 90% of our leases have contractual rent increases. So we remain pleased with the growth we are able to achieve from our properties without having to incur any significant incurring -- recurring maintenance capital expenditures to generate this growth. Approximately 75% of our investment grade leases have rental rate growth that averages about 1.3%. Additionally, we have never had a year with negative same-store rent growth. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography, and to a certain extent, property type, all of which contribute to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 246 commercial tenants in 47 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico. 79% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue. There was not much movement in the composition of our top tenants and industries during the second quarter. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.6% of rental revenue and drugstores remain our largest industry to 11% of rental revenue. We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with 44% of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment-grade rated tenants. This percentage will continue to fluctuate and should be positively impacted in the second half of this year while Walgreens' pending acquisition of Rite Aid which represents 2% of our annualized rental revenue. The store level performance of our retail tenants also remains sound. Our weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties remains 2.7x on a 4 wall basis and the medium remains 2.6x. Moving on to acquisitions. We completed $310 million in acquisitions during the quarter and through the first half of the year, we completed $663 million in acquisitions at record high investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital. We continue to see a strong flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. For the first half of the year, we sourced approximately $15 billion in acquisition opportunities, putting us on pace for another active year in acquisitions. We remain disciplined in our investment strategy, acquiring under 5% of the now outsourced year-to-date, which is consistent with our average since 2010.

During the second quarter of 2016, we invested $310 million in 57 properties located in 22 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.3% and with a weighted average lease term of 13.5 years. On a revenue basis, 58% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 68% of the revenues are generated from retail and 32% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 20 different tenants in 14 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are transportation services, motor vehicle dealerships and discount grocery stores. We closed 22 independent transactions in the second quarter and the average investment per property was approximately $5.4 million. Year-to-date 2016, we invested $663 million in 153 properties located in 34 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.5% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.8 years. On a revenue basis, 39% of total acquisitions up from investment-grade tenants, 78% of the revenues are generated from retail and 22% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 35 different tenants in 23 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are casual dining restaurant, transportation services and motor vehicle dealerships. Of the 41 independent transactions closed year-to-date, 1 transaction was about $50 million. Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced more than $8 billion in the second quarter. Year-to-date, we have sourced approximately $15 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of these opportunities, 60% of the volume sourced were portfolios and 40% or approximately $6 billion were one-off assets. Investment grade opportunities represented 64% for the second quarter. Of the $300 million in acquisitions closed in the second quarter, 65% were one-off transactions. As to pricing, cap rates remained flat in the second quarter with investment-grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment-grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. Our disposition program remains active. During the quarter, we sold 15 properties with net proceeds $24 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.5% and realized an unlevered IRR of 10.5%. This brings us to 26 properties sold year-to-date for $35 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.4% and realized an unlevered IRR of 9.3%. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy, averaging 252 basis points in the second quarter, which were well above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield, less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. So in conclusion, as John mentioned, we are raising our acquisition's guidance for 2016 to approximately $1.25 billion and we remain confident in reaching our 2016 disposition target of between $50 million and $75 million. With that, I'll hand it back to John."

As I mentioned, we have successfully issued approximately $0.5 billion in common equity year-to-date. Approximately $55 million of the equity raised was executed opportunistically through our ATM program during the final week of June and reflect at the lowest cost of equity raised in our company's history. Today, our investment spreads relative to our nominal cost of equity are well in excess of our historical investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital, which allows us to drive earnings growth as well as further strengthen our balance sheet. Our leverage continues to be at historical lows with debt to total market cap of approximately 21% and debt-to-EBITDA of 5.1x. Additionally, we currently have approximately $1.5 billion of capacity available on our $2 billion revolving line of credit, providing us with excellent liquidity as we grow our company. We are pleased that our sector leading credit strength was recognized in the second quarter by Moody's and S&P, both of which upgraded us to a positive outlook while reaffirming our BAA line and BBB+ credit ratings. Yesterday, we announced our 87th dividend increase payable in September, which represents a 6.1% increase over the dividend in September of 2015. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of just under 5%. Our current AFFO payout ratio at the midpoint of our 2016 FFO per share guidance is 83.5%, which is a level we are quite comfortable with. To wrap it up, we have another good quarter and remain optimistic about our future. It's demonstrated by our sector-leading EBITDA margins of approximately 94%. We continue to realize the efficiencies associated with our size and the economy of scale in our net lease business. Our portfolio's performing well and we continue to see a healthy volume of acquisition opportunities. The net lease acquisitions environment remains a very efficient marketplace and we believe we are best positioned to capitalize on the highest-quality opportunities given our sector leading positive capital and balance sheet flexibility. At this time, I would now like to open it up to questions. Operator?"

We've been asked this question fairly frequently and we're not going to go out and do transactions that we're not comfortable with just to drive accretion or earnings growth where we think the long-term returns are not going to meet our hurdle rate due to the quality of the investment. So we are fortunate in that we're seeing plenty of opportunities that meet our investment criteria and with our spreads and our distinct cost of capital advantage, we're able to drive growth. So when we underwrite properties, we are really -- we're focusing on the IRR that doesn't meet our hurdle rate over the long-term and we're also looking at what's sort of accretions does it produce today. And usually, that's the easiest hurdle and then the challenging aspect to the underwriting process is getting something that you know and you feel confident about this going to perform over 20-year, 15-year lease term and if the tenant does leave, you're going to be able to have good recapture on that.

We don't have any projections that we put on that, other than to share with you that when you look into these years and you see the portions of subsequent expirations growing, that should give you some level of comfort relative to the fact that we think we're going to do quite well with those tenants, they're probably been a stay at the site, have a rental bump associated with that, et cetera.

We are pleased to report another active quarter for acquisitions and healthy AFFO per share growth of 4.4% to $0.71. As announced in yesterday's press release, we are increasing our 2016 acquisitions guidance from $900 million to approximately $1.25 billion and reiterating our AFFO per share guidance for 2016 of $2.85 to $2.90. Given the attractive capital available in the equity markets, we accelerated our equity-raising activities by raising nearly a $0.5 billion of equity year-to-date at very attractive all-in costs. 
This activity was not in our original plan, but we believe it is a prudent decision as it positions our company well for the future. Our balance sheet is now in the best shape in our company's history. 
Based on the ongoing confidence we have in our business and our financial strength, we have elected to provide our shareholders with an additional 1% increase in the monthly dividend payable in September, which represents a 6.1% increase over September of 2015. 
Let me hand it over to Paul to provide additional detail on our financial results. Paul?"

Other revenue this quarter was a negative amount, negative $129,000. This was the result of a reclassification of some revenue from other revenue where it was booked in Q1 to rental revenue where it's reflected here in Q2. 
Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 5.4% this quarter due to higher stock compensation costs for our Board of Directors in the quarter. Their stock grants occur in May, and our higher stock price this spring caused this expense to be a little higher. Year-to-date, our G&A is only 5.1% of revenues, and we are still projecting approximately 5% for the year. 
Our non-reimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 1.4%, and we are still projecting approximately 1.5% for the year. 
Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we have continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. We have raised $487 million of common equity capital thus far this year. Our $2 billion credit facility, which has a $1 billion expansion option, has a balance of approximately $530 million. Other than our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have is on just $22.6 million of our mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape, with only $5 million of mortgages and $275 million of bonds coming due during the second half of 2016, and our maturity schedule is well-laddered thereafter. 
Finally, our overall leverage remains low, with our debt-to-EBITDA ratio standing in approximately 5.1x. 
So in summary, we have low leverage, excellent liquidity and good access to both equity and debt capital, both of which are well-priced financing alternatives for us right now. 
Let me turn the call back over to John to give you more background."

Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98%, a 20 basis points increase from last quarter. Economic occupancy was 98.9%, also up from last quarter. 
We continue to make good progress with our re-leasing and sales efforts and expect to end the year at approximately 98% occupancy. On the 37 properties we re-leased during the quarter, we recaptured 92% of the expiring rent. As is typical for us, we had no spending on tenant improvements in connection with our re-leasing. Year-to-date, we have recaptured 103% of expiring rent on 75 lease rollovers, which remains well above our long-term average. 
Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold more than 2,100 properties with expiring leases, recapturing approximately 98% of rent on those properties that we re-leased. This compares favorably to our other net lease peer companies who also report this metric. 
Our same-store rent increased 1.4% during the quarter and 1.3% year-to-date. We continue to expect annual same-store rent growth to be approximately 1.3% for 2016. Approximately 90% of our leases have contractual rent increases. So we remain pleased with the growth we are able to achieve from our properties without having to incur any significant incurring -- recurring maintenance capital expenditures to generate this growth. Approximately 75% of our investment-grade leases have rental rate growth that averages about 1.3%. Additionally, we have never had a year with negative same-store rent growth. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant; industry; geography; and to a certain extent, property type, all of which contribute to the stability of our cash flow. 
At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 246 commercial tenants in 47 different industries located in 49 states and Puerto Rico. 79% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue. There was not much movement in the composition of our top tenants and industries during the second quarter. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.6% of rental revenue, and drugstores remain our largest industry at 11% of rental revenue. 
We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with 44% of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment-grade rated tenants. This percentage will continue to fluctuate and should be positively impacted in the second half of this year by Walgreens' pending acquisition of Rite Aid, which represents 2% of our annualized rental revenue. 
The store-level performance of our retail tenants also remains sound. Our weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties remains 2.7x on a four-wall basis, and the median remains 2.6x. 
Moving on to acquisitions. We completed $310 million in acquisitions during the quarter. And through the first half of the year, we completed $663 million in acquisitions at record-high investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital. We continue to see a strong flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. For the first half of the year, we sourced approximately $15 billion in acquisition opportunities, putting us on pace for another active year in acquisitions. We remain disciplined in our investment strategy, acquiring under 5% of the amount sourced year-to-date, which is consistent with our average since 2010. As I mentioned, we are increasing our 2016 acquisitions guidance to approximately $1.25 billion and continue to acquire the highest-quality net lease properties as we grow our portfolio. 
I'll hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions activity."

During the second quarter of 2016, we invested $310 million in 57 properties located in 22 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.3% and with a weighted average lease term of 13.5 years. On a revenue basis, 58% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 68% of the revenues are generated from retail and 32% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 20 different tenants in 14 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are transportation services, motor vehicle dealerships and discount grocery stores. We closed 22 independent transactions in the second quarter, and the average investment per property was approximately $5.4 million. 
Year-to-date 2016, we invested $663 million in 153 properties located in 34 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.5% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.8 years. On a revenue basis, 39% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 78% of the revenues are generated from retail and 22% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 35 different tenants in 23 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are casual dining restaurants, transportation services and motor vehicle dealerships. Of the 41 independent transactions closed year-to-date, one transaction was above $50 million.
Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced more than $8 billion in the second quarter. Year-to-date, we have sourced approximately $15 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of these opportunities, 60% of the volume sourced were portfolios and 40% or approximately $6 billion were one-off assets. Investment-grade opportunities represented 64% for the second quarter. Of the $300 million in acquisitions closed in the second quarter, 65% were one-off transactions. 
As to pricing, cap rates remained flat in the second quarter, with investment-grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and noninvestment-grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. Our disposition program remains active. 
During the quarter, we sold 15 properties for net proceeds of $24 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.5% and realized an unlevered IRR of 10.5%. This brings us to 26 properties sold year-to-date for $35 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.4% and realized an unlevered IRR of 9.3%. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy, averaging 252 basis points in the second quarter, which were well above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. 
So in conclusion, as John mentioned, we are raising our acquisitions guidance for 2016 to approximately $1.25 billion, and we remain confident in reaching our 2016 disposition target of between $50 million and $75 million. 
With that, I'd like to hand it back to John."

As I mentioned, we have successfully issued approximately $0.5 billion in common equity year-to-date. Approximately $55 million of the equity raised was executed opportunistically through our ATM program during the final week of June and reflected the lowest cost of equity raised in our company's history. Today, our investment spreads relative to our nominal cost of equity are well in excess of our historical investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital, which allows us to drive earnings growth as well as further strengthen our balance sheet. Our leverage continues to be at historical lows with debt to total market cap of approximately 21% and debt to EBITDA of 5.1x. Additionally, we currently have approximately $1.5 billion of capacity available on our $2 billion revolving line of credit, providing us with excellent liquidity as we grow our company. 
We are pleased that our sector-leading credit strength was recognized in the second quarter by Moody's and S&P, both of which upgraded us to a positive outlook while reaffirming our Baa1 and BBB+ credit ratings. 
Yesterday, we announced our 87th dividend increase payable in September, which represents a 6.1% increase over the dividend in September of 2015. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of just under 5%. Our current AFFO payout ratio at the midpoint of our 2016 AFFO per share guidance is 83.5%, which is a level we are quite comfortable with. To wrap it up, we have another good quarter and remain optimistic about our future. 
As demonstrated by our sector-leading EBITDA margins of approximately 94%, we continue to realize the efficiencies associated with our size and the economy of scale in our net lease business. Our portfolio is performing well, and we continue to see a healthy volume of acquisition opportunities. The net lease acquisitions environment remains a very efficient marketplace. And we believe we are best positioned to capitalize on the highest-quality opportunities given our sector-leading, positive capital and balance sheet flexibility.

So we are fortunate in that we're seeing plenty of opportunities that meet our investment criteria. And with our spreads and our distinct cost of capital advantage, we were able to drive growth. So when we underwrite properties, we're really -- we're focusing on the IRR that doesn't meet our hurdle rate over the long term. And we're also looking at what sort of accretion does it produce today. And usually, that's the easiest hurdle. And then the challenging aspect to the underwriting process is getting something that you know and you feel confident about is going to perform over a 20-year or a 15-year lease term.

Absent these 3 assets, the 34 remaining assets would have had a rent recapture rate of 106%. And then, of course, year-to-date, our rent recapture rate is 103%. So Josh, this is really a non-issue and certainly not beginning some sort of trend."

I can speak to that a little bit. You may recall some years ago we split out initial expirations versus subsequent to indicate that the subsequent expirations do a lot better because that really is a tenant who's already made a choice at the end of an initial 15- or 20-year term to clearly stay in that site at that property with us. And as such, there is a slightly higher likelihood that 5 years later, they're going to make the same decision and stay at that site. So that was reason we had broken this out initially. We don't have any projections that we put on that, other than to share with you that when you look into these years and you see the portions of subsequent expirations growing, that should give you some level of comfort relative to the fact that we think we're going to do quite well with those tenants. They're probably going to stay at the site, have a rental bump associated with that, et cetera. But that's why we broke it out a few years back."

So we're not trying to target 80% retail. It's more a function of the opportunities we see in the marketplace. So we're seeing many more retail opportunities with our investment parameters than we are industrial opportunities. But this past quarter, industrial kicked off a little bit. But given the market and the opportunities available, we're going to continue to be a predominantly retail net lease company.

Given the attractive capital available in the equity markets, we accelerated our equity-raising activities by raising nearly $0.5 billion of equity year-to-date at very attractive all-in costs. 
This activity was not in our original plan, but we believe it was the prudent decision as it positions our company well for the future. Our balance sheet is now in the best shape in our company's history. 
Based on the ongoing confidence we have in our business and our financial strength, we have elected to provide our shareholders with an additional 1% increase in the monthly dividend payable in September, which represents a 6.1% increase over September of 2015.

Other revenue this quarter was a negative amount, negative $129,000. This was the result of a reclassification of some revenue from other revenue where it was booked in Q1 to rental revenue, where it's reflected here in Q2. 
Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 5.4% this quarter due to higher stock compensation costs for our Board of Directors in the quarter. Their stock grants occur in May, and our higher stock price this spring caused this expense to be a little higher. Year-to-date our G&A is only 5.1% of revenues, and we are still projecting approximately 5% for the year. 
Our non-reimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 1.4%, and we are still projecting approximately 1.5% for the year. 
Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we have continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. We have raised $487 million of common equity capital thus far this year. Our $2 billion credit facility, which has a $1 billion expansion option, has a balance of approximately $530 million. Other than our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have is on just $22.6 million of our mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape, with only $5 million of mortgages and $275 million of bonds coming due during the second half of 2016, and our maturity schedule is well laddered thereafter. 
Finally, our overall leverage remains low, with our debt-to-EBITDA ratio standing at approximately 5.1x. 
So in summary, we have low leverage, excellent liquidity and good access to both equity and debt capital, both of which are well-priced financing alternatives for us right now. 
Let me turn the call back over to John to give you more background."

Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98%, a 20 basis points increase from last quarter. Economic occupancy was 98.9%, also up from last quarter. 
We continue to make good progress with our re-leasing and sales efforts and expect to end the year at approximately 98% occupancy. On the 37 properties we re-leased during the quarter, we recaptured 92% of the expiring rent. As is typical for us, we had no spending on tenant improvements in connection with our re-leasing. Year-to-date we have recaptured 103% of expiring rent on 75 lease rollovers, which remains well above our long-term average. 
Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold more than 2,100 properties with expiring leases, recapturing approximately 98% of rent on those properties that were re-leased. This compares favorably to our other net lease -- our peer companies, who also report this metric. 
Our same-store rent increased 1.4% during the quarter and 1.3% year-to-date. We continue to expect annual same-store rent growth to be approximately 1.3% for 2016. Approximately 90% of our leases have contractual rent increases. So we remain pleased with the growth we are able to achieve from our properties without having to incur any significant incurring -- recurring maintenance capital expenditures to generate this growth. Approximately 75% of our investment-grade leases have rental rate growth that averages about 1.3%. Additionally, we have never had a year with negative same-store rent growth. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry; geography, and to a certain extent property type, all of which contribute to the stability of our cash flow. 
At the end of the quarter our properties were leased to 246 commercial tenants in 47 different industries located in 49 states and Puerto Rico. 79% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue. There was not much movement in the composition of our top tenants and industries during the second quarter. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.6% of rental revenue, and drugstores remain our largest industry at 11% of rental revenue. 
We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with 44% of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment-grade rated tenants. This percentage will continue to fluctuate and should be positively impacted in the second half of this year by Walgreens' pending acquisition of Rite Aid, which represents 2% of our annualized rental revenue. 
The store-level performance of our retail tenants also remains sound. Our weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties remains 2.7x on a four-wall basis, and the median remains 2.6x. 
Moving on to acquisitions. We completed $310 million in acquisitions during the quarter. And through the first half of the year we completed $663 million in acquisitions at record-high investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital. We continue to see a strong flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. For the first half of the year we sourced approximately $15 billion in acquisition opportunities, putting us on pace for another active year in acquisitions. We remain disciplined in our investment strategy, acquiring under 5% of the amount sourced year-to-date, which is consistent with our average since 2010. As I mentioned, we are increasing our 2016 acquisitions guidance to approximately $1.25 billion and continue to acquire the highest-quality net-lease properties as we grow our portfolio. 
I'll hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions activity."

During the second quarter of 2016 we invested $310 million in 57 properties located in 22 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.3% and with a weighted average lease term of 13.5 years. On a revenue basis, 58% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 68% of the revenues are generated from retail and 32% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 20 different tenants in 14 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are transportation services, motor vehicle dealerships and discount grocery stores. We closed 22 independent transactions in the second quarter, and the average investment per property was approximately $5.4 million. 
Year-to-date 2016, we invested $663 million in 153 properties located in 34 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.5% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.8 years. On a revenue basis, 39% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 78% of the revenues are generated from retail and 22% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 35 different tenants in 23 industries. Some of the more significant industries represented are casual dining restaurants, transportation services and motor vehicle dealerships. Of the 41 independent transactions closed year-to-date, one transaction was above $50 million.
Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced more than $8 billion in the second quarter. Year-to-date we have sourced approximately $15 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of these opportunities, 60% of the volume sourced were portfolios and 40% or approximately $6 billion were one-off assets. Investment-grade opportunities represented 64% for the second quarter. Of the $300 million in acquisitions closed in the second quarter, 65% were one-off transactions. 
As to pricing, cap rates remained flat in the second quarter, with investment-grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and noninvestment-grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. Our disposition program remains active. 
During the quarter we sold 15 properties for net proceeds of $24 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.5% and realized an unlevered IRR of 10.5%. This brings us to 26 properties sold year-to-date for $35 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.4% and realized an unlevered IRR of 9.3%. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy, averaging 252 basis points in the second quarter, which were well above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. 
So in conclusion, as John mentioned, we are raising our acquisitions guidance for 2016 to approximately $1.25 billion, and we remain confident in reaching our 2016 disposition target of between $50 million and $75 million. 
With that, I'd like to hand it back to John."

As I mentioned, we have successfully issued approximately $0.5 billion in common equity year-to-date. Approximately $55 million of the equity raised was executed opportunistically through our ATM program during the final week of June and reflected the lowest cost of equity raised in our company's history. Today, our investment spreads relative to our nominal cost of equity are well in excess of our historical investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital, which allows us to drive earnings growth as well as further strengthen our balance sheet. Our leverage continues to be at historical lows with debt to total market cap of approximately 21% and debt to EBITDA of 5.1x. Additionally, we currently have approximately $1.5 billion of capacity available on our $2 billion revolving line of credit, providing us with excellent liquidity as we grow our company. 
We are pleased that our sector-leading credit strength was recognized in the second quarter by Moody's and S&P, both of which upgraded us to a positive outlook while reaffirming our Baa1 and BBB+ credit ratings. 
Yesterday we announced our 87th dividend increase payable in September, which represents a 6.1% increase over the dividend in September of 2015. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of just under 5%. Our current AFFO payout ratio at the midpoint of our 2016 AFFO per share guidance is 83.5%, which is a level we are quite comfortable with. To wrap it up, we had another good quarter and remain optimistic about our future. 
As demonstrated by our sector-leading EBITDA margins of approximately 94%, we continue to realize the efficiencies associated with our size and the economy of scale in our net lease business. Our portfolio is performing well, and we continue to see a healthy volume of acquisition opportunities. The net lease acquisitions environment remains a very efficient marketplace. And we believe we are best positioned to capitalize on the highest-quality opportunities given our sector-leading cost of capital and balance sheet flexibility.

We're going to stay disciplined and invest in what's within our investment parameters. And we've been asked this question fairly frequently. And we're not going to go out and do transactions that we're not comfortable with just to drive accretion or earnings growth where we think the long-term returns are not going to meet our hurdle rate due to the quality of the investment. So we are fortunate in that we're seeing plenty of opportunities that meet our investment criteria. And with our spreads and our distinct cost of capital advantage, we're able to drive growth. 
So when we underwrite properties, Vikram, we really -- we're focusing on the IRR and does it meet our hurdle rate over the long term. And we're also looking at what sort of accretion does it produce today. And usually that's the easiest hurdle. And then the challenging aspect to the underwriting process is getting something that you know and you feel confident about that's going to perform over a 20-year or a 15-year lease term and, if the tenant does leave, you know, you're going to be able to have good recapture on that. So that's how we look at it."

We've reached levels close to this. I'd say since 2011 we've been at spreads that were substantially higher than our long-term average investment spread over our nominal per share weighted average cost of capital.

So the spreads are substantial, but we're going to remain disciplined. We could acquire virtually everything we see given our cost of capital advantage. But a lot of what we see is properties that are not within our investment parameters and are not what we want to own. 
As far as the balance sheet goes, we've remained conservative. We always have. We believe in a conservative balance sheet, and it has enabled us to ride out some difficult recessions over the last 20 years, most recently the Great Recession, where we were one of the few companies that continued to raise the dividend and didn't have to re-equitize.

But we went from leasing land and a building to just leasing land. So we had a big -- you reflected a roll-down there. 
And then there were 2 other assets, a child care center and a casual dining concept, that accounted for the remaining negative impact on the re-leasing spreads. Absent these 3 assets, the 34 remaining assets would have had a rent recapture rate of 106%. And then of course year-to-date our rent recapture rate is 103%.

And as such, there is a slightly higher likelihood that 5 years later they're going to make the same decision and stay at that site. So that was the reason we had broken this out initially. 
We don't have any projections that we put on that, other than to share with you that when you look into these years and you see that portion of subsequent expirations growing, that should give you some level of comfort relative to the fact that we think we're going to do quite well with those tenants. They're probably going to stay at the site, have a rental bump associated with that, et cetera. But that's why we broke it out a few years back."

As far as the difference between retail and industrial, if they fit our investment parameters, we don't have a bias. So we're not trying to target 80% retail. It's more a function of the opportunities we see in the marketplace. So we're seeing many more retail opportunities with our investment parameters than we are industrial opportunities.

With every year that goes by our maturity schedules are going to come down. And what we haven't seen is a distinct differential that we can point to as a trend that says on second-generation re-leasing we get substantially better re-leasing spread -- positive re-leasing spread versus first-generation re-leasing. 
I think Paul sort of addressed some of it, that yes, what we've seen is that if people have exercised an option they will tend to stay there. And most of these options have built-in gain or renewal bumps in rent which is -- which could range anywhere between 3% to 5% and sometimes as high as 10%. So it's very difficult for us to tell you that, hey, the second co-generation assets that are going to be coming due, what is going to be the trend on the renewals on that front. So that's -- and it's a fact that with every year our average renewal rate is going to come down, our re-leasing rate is going to come down."

And it's just the math. When you've got a $20 billion plus portfolio of properties where each year the lease term gets shorter by a year and you're acquiring $1.25 billion at 15 years, 16 years, a mature net-lease company like ourselves will have an average lease term that moves down unless there's something exceptional that occurs. 
So we've thought about this. This has been happening for a long time now. And we had built up our portfolio management group, which is the largest group within the company, and they've executed more than 2,100 lease rollovers, and we're quite experienced at that. So as the frequency will pick up in future years, we've got a great team in place, and we'll continue to grow that team with the proper talent. 
Many peers out there with longer lease terms don't even have that department. So here it's, I'd say, one of our most important departments and certainly our largest department. So we've been focused on this for a while. But it's just, as we all say, it's simple math."

Other revenue this quarter was a negative amount, negative $129,000. This was the result of a reclassification of some revenue from other revenue where it was booked in Q1 to rental revenue, where it's reflected here in Q2. 
Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 5.4% this quarter due to higher stock compensation costs for our Board of Directors in the quarter. Their stock grants occur in May, and our higher stock price this spring caused this expense to be a little higher. Year-to-date our G&A is only 5.1% of revenues, and we are still projecting approximately 5% for the year. 
Our non-reimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 1.4%, and we are still projecting approximately 1.5% for the year. 
Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we have continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. We have raised $487 million of common equity capital thus far this year. Our $2 billion credit facility, which has a $1 billion expansion option, has a balance of approximately $530 million. Other than our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have is on just $22.6 million of our mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape, with only $5 million of mortgages and $275 million of bonds coming due during the second half of 2016, and our maturity schedule is well laddered thereafter. 
Finally, our overall leverage remains low, with our debt-to-EBITDA ratio standing at approximately 5.1x. 
So in summary, we have low leverage, excellent liquidity and good access to both equity and debt capital, both of which are well-priced financing alternatives for us right now. 
Let me turn the call back over to John to give you more background."

Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98%, a 20 basis points increase from last quarter. Economic occupancy was 98.9%, also up from last quarter. 
We continue to make good progress with our re-leasing and sales efforts and expect to end the year at approximately 98% occupancy. On the 37 properties we re-leased during the quarter, we recaptured 92% of the expiring rent. As is typical for us, we had no spending on tenant improvements in connection with our re-leasing. Year-to-date we have recaptured 103% of expiring rent on 75 lease rollovers, which remains well above our long-term average. 
Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold more than 2,100 properties with expiring leases, recapturing approximately 98% of rent on those properties that were re-leased. This compares favorably to our other net lease -- our peer companies, who also report this metric. 
Our same-store rent increased 1.4% during the quarter and 1.3% year-to-date. We continue to expect annual same-store rent growth to be approximately 1.3% for 2016. Approximately 90% of our leases have contractual rent increases. So we remain pleased with the growth we are able to achieve from our properties without having to incur any significant incurring -- recurring maintenance capital expenditures to generate this growth. Approximately 75% of our investment-grade leases have rental rate growth that averages about 1.3%. Additionally, we have never had a year with negative same-store rent growth. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry; geography, and to a certain extent property type, all of which contribute to the stability of our cash flow. 
At the end of the quarter our properties were leased to 246 commercial tenants in 47 different industries located in 49 states and Puerto Rico. 79% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue. There was not much movement in the composition of our top tenants and industries during the second quarter. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.6% of rental revenue, and drugstores remain our largest industry at 11% of rental revenue. 
We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with 44% of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment-grade rated tenants. This percentage will continue to fluctuate and should be positively impacted in the second half of this year by Walgreens' pending acquisition of Rite Aid, which represents 2% of our annualized rental revenue. 
The store-level performance of our retail tenants also remains sound. Our weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties remains 2.7x on a four-wall basis, and the median remains 2.6x. 
Moving on to acquisitions. We completed $310 million in acquisitions during the quarter. And through the first half of the year we completed $663 million in acquisitions at record-high investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital. We continue to see a strong flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. For the first half of the year we sourced approximately $15 billion in acquisition opportunities, putting us on pace for another active year in acquisitions. We remain disciplined in our investment strategy, acquiring under 5% of the amount sourced year-to-date, which is consistent with our average since 2010. As I mentioned, we are increasing our 2016 acquisitions guidance to approximately $1.25 billion and continue to acquire the highest-quality net-lease properties as we grow our portfolio. 
I'll hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions activity."

During the second quarter of 2016 we invested $310 million in 57 properties located in 22 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.3% and with a weighted average lease term of 13.5 years. On a revenue basis, 58% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 68% of the revenues are generated from retail and 32% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 20 different tenants in 14 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are transportation services, motor vehicle dealerships and discount grocery stores. We closed 22 independent transactions in the second quarter, and the average investment per property was approximately $5.4 million. 
Year-to-date 2016, we invested $663 million in 153 properties located in 34 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.5% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.8 years. On a revenue basis, 39% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 78% of the revenues are generated from retail and 22% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 35 different tenants in 23 industries. Some of the more significant industries represented are casual dining restaurants, transportation services and motor vehicle dealerships. Of the 41 independent transactions closed year-to-date, one transaction was above $50 million.
Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced more than $8 billion in the second quarter. Year-to-date we have sourced approximately $15 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of these opportunities, 60% of the volume sourced were portfolios and 40% or approximately $6 billion were one-off assets. Investment-grade opportunities represented 64% for the second quarter. Of the $300 million in acquisitions closed in the second quarter, 65% were one-off transactions. 
As to pricing, cap rates remained flat in the second quarter, with investment-grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and noninvestment-grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. Our disposition program remains active. 
During the quarter we sold 15 properties for net proceeds of $24 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.5% and realized an unlevered IRR of 10.5%. This brings us to 26 properties sold year-to-date for $35 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.4% and realized an unlevered IRR of 9.3%. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy, averaging 252 basis points in the second quarter, which were well above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. 
So in conclusion, as John mentioned, we are raising our acquisitions guidance for 2016 to approximately $1.25 billion, and we remain confident in reaching our 2016 disposition target of between $50 million and $75 million. 
With that, I'd like to hand it back to John."

Our leverage continues to be at historical lows with debt to total market cap of approximately 21% and debt to EBITDA of 5.1x. Additionally, we currently have approximately $1.5 billion of capacity available on our $2 billion revolving line of credit, providing us with excellent liquidity as we grow our company. 
We are pleased that our sector-leading credit strength was recognized in the second quarter by Moody's and S&P, both of which upgraded us to a positive outlook while reaffirming our Baa1 and BBB+ credit ratings. 
Yesterday we announced our 87th dividend increase payable in September, which represents a 6.1% increase over the dividend in September of 2015. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of just under 5%. Our current AFFO payout ratio at the midpoint of our 2016 AFFO per share guidance is 83.5%, which is a level we are quite comfortable with. To wrap it up, we had another good quarter and remain optimistic about our future. 
As demonstrated by our sector-leading EBITDA margins of approximately 94%, we continue to realize the efficiencies associated with our size and the economy of scale in our net lease business. Our portfolio is performing well, and we continue to see a healthy volume of acquisition opportunities. The net lease acquisitions environment remains a very efficient marketplace. And we believe we are best positioned to capitalize on the highest-quality opportunities given our sector-leading cost of capital and balance sheet flexibility. 
At this time I would now like to open it up for questions. Operator?"

So we are fortunate in that we're seeing plenty of opportunities that meet our investment criteria. And with our spreads and our distinct cost of capital advantage, we're able to drive growth. 
So when we underwrite properties, Vikram, we really -- we're focusing on the IRR and does it meet our hurdle rate over the long term. And we're also looking at what sort of accretion does it produce today. And usually that's the easiest hurdle. And then the challenging aspect to the underwriting process is getting something that you know and you feel confident about that's going to perform over a 20-year or a 15-year lease term and, if the tenant does leave, you know, you're going to be able to have good recapture on that. So that's how we look at it."

So the spreads are substantial, but we're going to remain disciplined. We could acquire virtually everything we see given our cost of capital advantage. But a lot of what we see is properties that are not within our investment parameters and are not what we want to own. 
As far as the balance sheet goes, we've remained conservative. We always have. We believe in a conservative balance sheet, and it has enabled us to ride out some difficult recessions over the last 20 years, most recently the Great Recession, where we were one of the few companies that continued to raise the dividend and didn't have to re-equitize.

But we went from leasing land and a building to just leasing land. So we had a big -- you reflected a roll-down there. 
And then there were 2 other assets, a child care center and a casual dining concept, that accounted for the remaining negative impact on the re-leasing spreads. Absent these 3 assets, the 34 remaining assets would have had a rent recapture rate of 106%. And then of course year-to-date our rent recapture rate is 103%.

And as such, there is a slightly higher likelihood that 5 years later they're going to make the same decision and stay at that site. So that was the reason we had broken this out initially. 
We don't have any projections that we put on that, other than to share with you that when you look into these years and you see that portion of subsequent expirations growing, that should give you some level of comfort relative to the fact that we think we're going to do quite well with those tenants.

As far as the difference between retail and industrial, if they fit our investment parameters, we don't have a bias. So we're not trying to target 80% retail. It's more a function of the opportunities we see in the marketplace. So we're seeing many more retail opportunities with our investment parameters than we are industrial opportunities.

I'm going to provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter starting with the income statement.
Interest expense decreased in the quarter by $11 million to $53 million and year-to-date by $10 million to $171 million. This decrease is partly due to a lower average outstanding debt balance over the past year as we primarily sold common equity and repaid outstanding bonds and mortgages. However, this decrease was also driven by the recognition of a non-cash gain of approximately $2.1 million on interest rate swaps during the quarter, which caused a decrease in that liability and lowered our interest expense.
And in the comparative third quarter of 2015, we recognized a non-cash loss of approximately $5.2 million that increased our interest expense in that quarter. As a reminder, we do exclude the impact of these non-cash gains and losses to calculate our AFFO. Our G&A, as a percentage of total rental and other revenues, is only 4.6% this quarter as we continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector.
Year-to-date, our G&A is only 4.9% of revenues and we are still projecting approximately 5% for the year. Our nonreimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 1.6% this quarter and we are still projecting approximately 1.5% for the year.
Provisions for impairment were $8.8 million in the third quarter on 11 sold properties, 5 properties held for sale and 2 properties held for investment. $2 million of this impairment recognized in the quarter relates to the pending sale of our former headquarters office building in Escondido, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter.
Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. We raised approximately $500 million of common equity capital thus far this year. And as John mentioned, we successfully returned to the bond market earlier this month with a $600 million, 10-year senior unsecured bond offering with a yield of 3.15%.
The offering was well oversubscribed and we are very pleased with the quality of the fixed income investors in the offering. This offering extended the weighted average maturity of our senior unsecured bonds from 6.2 to 6.8 years and provide us with additional flexibility under our $2 billion revolving credit facility which following the offering, has a balance of approximately $470 million.
Other than our credit facility, the only variable  rate debt exposure we have is on just $32.4 million of mortgage debt and our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape with only $36 million of mortgages coming due the remainder of this year.
And our maturity schedule is well laddered thereafter with only $284 million of maturing debt in all of 2017.
Finally, our overall leverage remains low with our debt-to-EBITDA ratio standing at approximately 5.3x. In summary, we have low leverage, excellent liquidity and continued access to attractively priced equity and debt capital, both of which remain well priced financing options today.
So let me turn the call now back over to John to give you more background."

Occupancy, based on the number of properties, was 98.3%, a 30 basis points increase from last quarter. We continue to make good progress with our re-leasing and sales efforts and expect to end the year at approximately 98% occupancy. On the 47 properties we re-leased during the quarter, we recaptured 105% of the expiring rent. While we typically do not pay tenant improvements to re-lease assets, we did incur $2.1 million in TIs and $7 million in committed redevelopment  capital to re-lease 3 former Sports Authority properties to a leading national retailer while generating a recapture rate of 136% on these 3 leases and an incremental yield on invested capital of 18%.
Year-to-date, we have recaptured 104% of expiring rent on a 122 lease rollovers, which remains well above our long-term average. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold more than 2,200 properties with leases expiring, recapturing approximately 98% of rent on those properties that were re-leased.
This compares favorably to the handful of net lease companies who also report this metric.
Our same-store rent increased 1.1% during the quarter and 1.2% year-to-date. We continue to expect an annual same-store rent growth to be approximately 1.3% for 2016. 90% of our leases have contractual rent increases so we remain pleased with the growth we are able to achieve from our properties.
Approximately 70% of our investment-grade leases have rental rate growth that averages about 1.3%. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography, and to a certain extent, property type, all of which contribute to the stability of our cash flow.
At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 247 commercial tenants and 47 different industries [ph] located in 49 states and Puerto Rico.
79% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue. There's not much movement in the composition of our top tenants and industries during the third quarter.
Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 7.3% of rental revenue and drugstores remain our largest industry at 11% of rental revenue.
As we discussed our top tenants, I'd like to highlight a positive transaction involving [indiscernible]. Earlier this year, the [indiscernible] sold its wine-related businesses in order to exclusively focus on spirits and beer. We own 17 vineyards and wineries in Napa Valley that are re-leased to [indiscernible]. [indiscernible] sold its operation related to our properties to treasury wine states, the world's largest publicly traded venture. We and are negotiated a buyout of the guarantee of our leases that have approximately 15 years of remaining term. was paying Realty Income $75 million in cash in 2 equal installments in exchange for being re-leased from the guarantee. We received the initial payment in the third quarter and we will received the second payment in January of 2017. At that time, we will fully release from guarantee and treasury wine states will become our tenant.
We believe this is a very attractive transaction for our shareholders for many reasons, including, first, the $75 million payment reduces our investment and Prime Napa Valley real estate approximately 50% of current market value. It also increases our yield on our investment to 10.5%.
We gain as a top tenant Treasury Wineries States who is an excellent venture with an equity market capitalization of approximately $6.5 billion, who has a strong credit profile. While Treasury does not currently have rated public debt, it has a healthy balance sheet with a debt-to-EBITDA of 1.5x and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 5.3x.
It has a singular focus on wine with premier labels such as [indiscernible] and added and Sterling among others through this transaction.
Moving on to tenant credit. We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with 45% of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment-grade rated tenants.
The store level performance of our retail tenants also remains sound. Our weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties increased from 2.7x to 2.8x on a 4-wall basis and a median increased from 2.6x to 2.7x in the third quarter. Moving on to acquisitions. We completed $410 million in acquisitions during the quarter and through the first 9 months of the year, we completed approximately $1.1 billion in acquisitions at record-high investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital. We continue to see a strong flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. Year-to-date, we have sourced $23 billion in acquisition opportunities, putting us on pace for another active year in acquisitions. We remain disciplined in our investment strategy, acquiring less than 5% of the amount sourced year-to-date, which is consistent with our average since 2010. As I mentioned, we're increasing our 2016 acquisitions guidance to approximately $1.5 billion and we continued to acquire the highest quality net lease properties as we grow our portfolio.
Now let me hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions."

During the third quarter of 2016, we invested $410 million in 93 properties located in 29 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.3% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.4 years. On a revenue basis, 69% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 86% of the revenues are generated from retail and 14% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 23 different tenants in 13 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are drugstores, discount grocery stores and automotive services. We closed 20 independent transactions in the third quarter, and the average investment per property was approximately $4.4 million.
Year-to-date 2016, we invested $1.1 billion in 236 properties located in 36 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.4% and with a weighted average lease term of 15 [ph] years. On a revenue basis, 51% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 81% of the revenues are generated from retail and 19% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 41 different tenants in 24 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are drugstores, casual dining restaurants, and transportation services. Of the 61 independent transactions closed year-to-date, 2 transactions were about $50 million.
Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced approximately $9 billion in the third quarter. Year-to-date, we sourced approximately $23 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of these opportunities, 51% of the volume sourced were portfolios and 49% or approximately $11 billion were one-off assets. Investment-grade opportunities represented 24% for the third quarter. Of the $410 million in acquisitions closed in the third quarter, 33% were one-off transactions.
As to pricing, cap rates remained flat in the third quarter with investment-grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and noninvestment-grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. Our disposition program remains active.
During the quarter, we sold 23 properties for net proceeds of $18.1 [ph] million at a net cash cap rate of 9.5% and realized an unlevered IRR of 7.4%. This brings us to 49 properties sold year-to-date for $53.2 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.7% and an unlevered IRR of 8.6%. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy, averaging 271 basis points in the third quarter, which were well above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital.
In conclusion, as John mentioned, we are raising our acquisition guidance for 2016 to approximately $1.5 billion. We're also raising our 2016 disposition target to between $75 million and $100 million.
With that, I'd like to hand it back to John."

As mentioned previously, we returned to the bond market earlier this month with a $600 million, 10-year benchmark senior unsecured bond offering at a yield to maturity of 3.15%. This offering allowed us to term out our loan balance at attractive pricing while repricing our credit curve and the debt capital markets, which will have ongoing benefits to the company and future debt offerings. Since the start of 2015, we have issued a total of $2.5 billion of capital. $1.7 billion of this capital raised has been equity. So we have continued to putting up our capital needs conservatively.
Our leverage remains low with debt to total market cap of approximately 23% and debt-to-EBITDA of 5.3x. Additionally, we currently have approximately $1.5 billion of capacity available on our $2 billion line of credit, providing us with excellent liquidity as we grow our company.
Our credit ratings remain Baa1, BBB+ by all 3 rating agencies with positive outlooks from both Moody's and S&P, providing us with the highest overall credit ratings in the net lease sector.
During the third quarter, we increased the dividend for the 88th time in the company's history. The current annualized dividend represents a 6% increase over the prior year. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of just under 5%. Our year-to-date AFFO payout ratio is 83.5%, which is a level we are quite comfortable with.
To wrap it up, we have another productive quarter across all functions of the organization and remain optimistic about our future. It's demonstrated by our sector leading EBITDA margins of approximately 94%. We continue to realize the efficiencies associated with our size and the economies of scale in the net lease business.
Our portfolio is performing well and we continue to see a healthy volume of acquisition opportunities. The net lease acquisition environment remains a very efficient marketplace and we believe we are best positioned to capitalize on the highest-quality properties given our sector leading cost of capital, access to capital and balance sheet flexibility.

This is not unlike us changing the month at which we look at our dividend on a couple of years ago. Our fifth dividend increase used to be in highest, now it's in January. So we lined it up with our fiscal year. And in an industry like ours, it's largely reliant on external growth to drive overall growth for the company. It is difficult, as you all have seen, to project acquisitions 15 months out. And so I think it's especially pertinent to our sector.

We then look to the permanent capital markets, mostly equity but also long-term bonds, et cetera. But historically, our line was a lot smaller too. So over the past year with a $2 billion, it gives us a little bit more flexibility to be able to carry a little bit larger balance than we had historically. But on a percentage basis relative to the enterprise as a whole, it's quite similar. So we're not taking that one much more variable rate debt overall in the capital structure. What's good about that, the ability to carry a $400 million, $500 million, $600 million balance on the line that again isn't taking that much more risk relative to the enterprise as a whole is it gives you almost a free look at the permanent capital markets where you can wait and time when it's appropriate to issue long-term bonds or perhaps common equity. So that's one side benefit of that. Right now, sitting here with a plus or minus $500 million of balance, that kind of gives us that window but it's not one where we're anxious or feel the need to immediately issue capital any time soon."

So one of the things that we've been talking about now for quite a while is our focus on asset management and we have a very focused input and trying to identify opportunities, not only when it comes to re-leasing assets but even with existing assets, our parcel developments, demising existing assets, having direct conversations with tenants to figure out if they need is 100% of the assets or could be better sold them by taking back some of the asset and re-tenanting it. All those discussions have sort of started to finally bear fruition and that's sort of the reason why you're starting to see 105%, 106%, 110% returns. We currently are looking at 31 different opportunities within our portfolio. and these are just immediate opportunities which should play out over the next 12 months. And some of the returns, as John just mentioned, is around the ZIP Code of what we are expecting on some of these opportunities.

After financing 85% of our capital needs since the start of 2015 with equity, we returned to the bond market this month with a $600 million 10-year senior unsecured bond offering at 3.15%, which represents the lowest all-in yield in our company's history for a 10-year debt transaction.
Our balance sheet remains well capitalized, and access to our sector-leading cost of capital continues to allow us to pursue the highest-quality net lease investments that support our reliable dividend growth.

I'm going to provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement.
Interest expense decreased in the quarter by $11 million to $53 million and year-to-date by $10 million to $171 million. This decrease is partly due to a lower average outstanding debt balance over the past year as we primarily sold common equity and repaid outstanding bonds and mortgages. However, this decrease was also driven by the recognition of a noncash gain of approximately $2.1 million on interest rate swaps during the quarter, which caused a decrease in that liability and lowered our interest expense. And in the comparative third quarter of 2015, we recognized a noncash loss of approximately $5.2 million that increased our interest expense in that quarter. As a reminder, we do exclude the impact of these noncash gains and losses to calculate our AFFO. 
Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was only 4.6% this quarter as we continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector. Year-to-date, our G&A is only 4.9% of revenues, and we are still projecting approximately 5% for the year. 
Our non-reimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 1.6% this quarter. And we are still projecting approximately 1.5% for the year.
Provisions for impairment were $8.8 million in the third quarter on 11 sold properties, 5 properties held for sale and 2 properties held for investment. $2 million of this impairment recognized in the quarter relates to the pending sale of our former headquarters office building in Escondido, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter.
Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. We raised approximately $500 million of common equity capital thus far this year. And as John mentioned, we successfully returned to the bond market earlier this month with a $600 million 10-year senior unsecured bond offering, with a yield of 3.15%. The offering was well oversubscribed, and we are very pleased with the quality of the fixed income investors in the offering. This offering extended the weighted average maturity of our senior unsecured bonds from 6.2 to 6.8 years and provides us with additional flexibility under our $2 billion revolving credit facility, which following the offering, has a balance of approximately $470 million.
Other than our credit facility, the only variable-rate debt exposure we have is on just $32.4 million of mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape with only $36 million of mortgages coming due the remainder of this year. And our maturity schedule is well laddered thereafter, with only $284 million of maturing debt in all of 2017. Finally, our overall leverage remains low, with our debt-to-EBITDA ratio standing at approximately 5.3x. 
In summary, we have low leverage, excellent liquidity and continued access to attractively priced equity and debt capital, both of which remain well-priced financing options today.
So let me turn the call now back over to John to give you more background."

Our occupancy, based on the number of properties, was 98.3%, a 30 basis points increase from last quarter. We continue to make good progress with our re-leasing and sales efforts and expect to end the year at approximately 98% occupancy. 
On the 47 properties we re-leased during the quarter, we recaptured 105% of the expiring rent. While we typically do not pay tenant improvements to re-lease assets, we did incur $2.1 million in TIs and $7 million in committed redevelopment capital to re-lease 3 former Sports Authority properties to a leading national retailer while generating a recapture rate of 136% on these 3 leases and an incremental yield on invested capital of 18%.
Year-to-date, we have recaptured 104% of expiring rent on 122 lease rollovers, which remains well above our long-term average. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold more than 2,200 properties with leases expiring, recapturing approximately 98% of rent on those properties that were re-leased. This compares favorably to the handful of net lease companies who also report this metric.
Our same-store rent increased 1.1% during the quarter and 1.2% year-to-date. We continue to expect annual same-store rent growth to be approximately 1.3% for 2016. 90% of our leases have contractual rent increases, so we remain pleased with the growth we are able to achieve from our properties.
Approximately 70% of our investment-grade leases have rental rate growth that averages about 1.3%. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and, to a certain extent, property type, all of which contribute to the stability of our cash flow.
At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 247 commercial tenants and 47 different industries located in 49 states and Puerto Rico. 79% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue. There's not much movement in the composition of our top tenants and industries during the third quarter. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 7.3% of rental revenue, and drugstores remain our largest industry at 11% of rental revenue.
As we discuss our top tenants, I'd like to highlight a positive transaction involving Diageo. Earlier this year, Diageo sold its wine-related businesses in order to exclusively focus on spirits and beer. We own 17 vineyards and wineries in Napa Valley that are leased to Diageo. Diageo sold its operations related to our properties to Treasury Wine Estates, the world's largest publicly traded venture. We and Diageo negotiated a buyout of the guarantee of our leases that have approximately 15 years of remaining term. Diageo is paying Realty Income $75 million in cash in 2 equal installments in exchange for being released from the guarantee. We received the initial payment in the third quarter, and we will receive the second payment in January of 2017. At that time, we will fully release Diageo from the guarantee, and Treasury Wine Estates will become our tenant. 
We believe this is a very attractive transaction for our shareholders for many reasons, including, first, the $75 million payment reduces our investment in prime Napa Valley real estate to approximately 50% of current market value. It also increases our yield on our investment to 10.5%. We gain as a top tenant Treasury Wine Estates who is an excellent venture, with an equity market capitalization of approximately $6.5 billion, who has a strong credit profile. While Treasury does not currently have rated public debt, it has a healthy balance sheet, with a debt to EBITDA of 1.5x and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 5.3x. It has a singular focus on wine, with premier labels such as Penfolds and Beringer and added BV and Sterling, among others, through this transaction.
Moving on to tenant credit. We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio, with 45% of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade-rated tenants.
The store-level performance of our retail tenants also remains sound. Our weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties increased from 2.7x to 2.8x on a 4-wall basis, and the median increased from 2.6x to 2.7x in the third quarter. 
Moving on to acquisitions. We completed $410 million in acquisitions during the quarter, and through the first 9 months of the year, we completed approximately $1.1 billion in acquisitions at record-high investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital. We continue to see a strong flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. Year-to-date, we have sourced $23 billion in acquisition opportunities, putting us on pace for another active year in acquisitions. We remain disciplined in our investment strategy, acquiring less than 5% of the amount sourced year-to-date, which is consistent with our average since 2010. As I mentioned, we are increasing our 2016 acquisitions guidance to approximately $1.5 billion, and we continue to acquire the highest-quality net lease properties as we grow our portfolio.
Now let me hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions."

During the third quarter of 2016, we invested $410 million in 93 properties located in 29 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.3% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.4 years. On a revenue basis, 69% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 86% of the revenues are generated from retail, and 14% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 23 different tenants in 13 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are drugstores, discount grocery stores and automotive services. We closed 20 independent transactions in the third quarter, and the average investment per property was approximately $4.4 million.
Year-to-date 2016, we invested $1.1 billion in 236 properties located in 36 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.4% and with a weighted average lease term of 15 years. On a revenue basis, 51% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 81% of the revenues are generated from retail, and 19% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 41 different tenants in 24 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are drugstores, casual-dining restaurants and transportation services. Of the 61 independent transactions closed year-to-date, 2 transactions were about $50 million.
Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced approximately $9 billion in the third quarter. Year-to-date, we sourced approximately $23 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of these opportunities, 51% of the volumes sourced were portfolios, and 49% or approximately $11 billion were one-off assets. Investment-grade opportunities represented 24% for the third quarter. Of the $410 million in acquisitions closed in the third quarter, 33% were one-off transactions.
As to pricing, cap rates remained flat in the third quarter, with investment-grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment-grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. 
Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter, we sold 23 properties for net proceeds of $18.1 million at a net cash cap rate of 9.5% and realized an unlevered IRR of 7.4%. This brings us to 49 properties sold year-to-date for $53.2 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.7% and an unlevered IRR of 8.6%. 
Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy, averaging 271 basis points in the third quarter, which were well above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital.
In conclusion, as John mentioned, we are raising our acquisition guidance for 2016 to approximately $1.5 billion. We are also raising our 2016 disposition target to between $75 million and $100 million.
With that, I'd like to hand it back to John."

As we mentioned previously, we returned to the bond market earlier this month with a $600 million 10-year benchmark senior unsecured bond offering at a yield to maturity at 3.15%. This offering allowed us to term out our line balance at attractive pricing while repricing our credit curve and the debt capital markets, which will have ongoing benefits to the company in future debt offerings. Since the start of 2015, we have issued a total of $2.5 billion of capital. $1.7 billion of this capital raise has been equity. So we have continued to finance our capital needs conservatively.
Our leverage remains low, with debt to total market cap of approximately 23% and debt to EBITDA of 5.3x. Additionally, we currently have approximately $1.5 billion of capacity available on our $2 billion line of credit, providing us with excellent liquidity as we grow our company.
Our credit ratings remain Baa1, BBB+ by all 3 rating agencies, with positive outlooks from both Moody's and S&P, providing us with the highest overall credit ratings in the net lease sector.
During the third quarter, we increased the dividend for the 88th time in the company's history. The current annualized dividend represents a 6% increase over the prior year. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of just under 5%. Our year-to-date AFFO payout ratio is 83.5%, which is a level we are quite comfortable with.
To wrap it up, we had another productive quarter across all functions of the organization and remain optimistic about our future. As demonstrated by our sector-leading EBITDA margins of approximately 94%, we continue to realize the efficiencies associated with our size and the economies of scale in the net lease business. Our portfolio is performing well, and we continue to see a healthy volume of acquisition opportunities. 
The net lease acquisition environment remains a very efficient marketplace, and we believe we are best positioned to capitalize on the highest-quality properties given our sector-leading cost of capital, access to capital and balance sheet flexibility.

We raised $1.7 billion of equity over the last 20 months, and our balance sheet has never been in greater shape than it is today, with the debt to total market cap of approximately 22%, 23% and a debt to EBITDA in the low 5s, about 5.2, 5.3. So we elected to issue the bond that we referenced in our opening comments and -- for a number of reasons. One, we had not been in the bond market in 2 years, and we had an opportunity to reset our pricing by issuing a large liquid benchmark 10-year offering. We actually priced 6 basis points through our secondary spreads when we priced the transaction, and we had really incredible demand for the transaction as well. So we didn't want to overequitize. We raised a lot of equity. We'll continue to look at all sources of financing going forward. But the bond, we could not be more pleased with the $600 million unsecured offering and what that did that for us. So we'll continue to look at equity prices going forward. We'll look at all forms of capital. We have, with the recent bond offering, no near-term, immediate needs for significant capital."

But historically, our line was a lot smaller, too. So over the past year, with a $2 billion line, it gives us a little bit more flexibility to be able to carry a little bit larger balance than we had historically. But on a percentage basis relative to the enterprise as a whole, it's quite similar. So we're not taking on that much more variable-rate debt overall in the capital structure. What's good about that, the ability to carry a $400 million, $500 million, $600 million balance on the line that, again, isn't taking that much more risk relative to the enterprise as a whole is it gives you almost a free look at the permanent capital markets where you can wait and time when it's appropriate to issue long-term bonds or perhaps common equity. So that's one side benefit of that. Right now, sitting here with a plus or minus $500 million of balance, that kind of gives us that window, but it's not one where we're anxious or feel the need to immediately issue capital anytime soon."

So there is competition out there, but seldom are we competing with other public companies for transactions. There's some private capital out there.

In one instance, it was done as a ground lease, and we've got a completely new building that would revert to us at the end of the term if this tenant elects to move on.

I'm going to provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement.
Interest expense decreased in the quarter by $11 million to $53 million and year-to-date by $10 million to $171 million. This decrease is partly due to a lower average outstanding debt balance over the past year as we primarily sold common equity and repaid outstanding bonds and mortgages. However, this decrease was also driven by the recognition of a noncash gain of approximately $2.1 million on interest rate swaps during the quarter, which caused a decrease in that liability and lowered our interest expense. And in the comparative third quarter of 2015, we recognized a noncash loss of approximately $5.2 million that increased our interest expense in that quarter. As a reminder, we do exclude the impact of these noncash gains and losses to calculate our AFFO. 
Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was only 4.6% this quarter as we continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector. Year-to-date, our G&A is only 4.9% of revenues, and we are still projecting approximately 5% for the year. 
Our non-reimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 1.6% this quarter. And we are still projecting approximately 1.5% for the year.
Provisions for impairment were $8.8 million in the third quarter on 11 sold properties, 5 properties held for sale and 2 properties held for investment. $2 million of this impairment recognized in the quarter relates to the pending sale of our former headquarters office building in Escondido, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter.
Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. We raised approximately $500 million of common equity capital thus far this year. And as John mentioned, we successfully returned to the bond market earlier this month with a $600 million 10-year senior unsecured bond offering, with a yield of 3.15%. The offering was well oversubscribed, and we were very pleased with the quality of the fixed income investors in the offering. This offering extended the weighted average maturity of our senior unsecured bonds from 6.2 to 6.8 years and provides us with additional flexibility under our $2 billion revolving credit facility, which following the offering, has a balance of approximately $470 million.
Other than our credit facility, the only variable-rate debt exposure we have is on just $32.4 million of mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape with only $36 million of mortgages coming due the remainder of this year. And our maturity schedule is well laddered thereafter, with only $284 million of maturing debt in all of 2017. Finally, our overall leverage remains low, with our debt-to-EBITDA ratio standing at approximately 5.3x. 
In summary, we have low leverage, excellent liquidity and continued access to attractively priced equity and debt capital, both of which remain well-priced financing options today.
So let me turn the call now back over to John to give you more background."
339305,403008736,1064376,"Realty Income Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Realty Income Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Paul. I will begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. Occupancy, based on the number of properties, was 98.3%, a 30 basis points increase from last quarter. We continue to make good progress with our re-leasing and",852,"Thanks, Paul. I will begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. Occupancy, based on the number of properties, was 98.3%, a 30 basis points increase from last quarter. We continue to make good progress with our re-leasing and sales efforts and expect to end the year at approximately 98% occupancy. 
On the 47 properties we re-leased during the quarter, we recaptured 105% of the expiring rent. While we typically do not pay tenant improvements to re-lease assets, we did incur $2.1 million in TIs and $7 million in committed redevelopment capital to re-lease 3 former Sports Authority properties to a leading national retailer, while generating a recapture rate of 136% on these 3 leases and an incremental yield on invested capital of 18%.
Year-to-date, we have recaptured 104% of expiring rent on 122 lease rollovers, which remains well above our long-term average. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold more than 2,200 properties with leases expiring, recapturing approximately 98% of rent on those properties that were re-leased. This compares favorably to the handful of net lease companies who also report this metric.
Our same-store rent increased 1.1% during the quarter and 1.2% year-to-date. We continue to expect annual same-store rent growth to be approximately 1.3% for 2016. 90% of our leases have contractual rent increases, so we remain pleased with the growth we are able to achieve from our properties.
Approximately 70% of our investment-grade leases have rental rate growth that averages about 1.3%. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and, to a certain extent, property type, all of which contribute to the stability of our cash flow.
At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 247 commercial tenants and 47 different industries located in 49 states and Puerto Rico. 79% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue. There's not much movement in the composition of our top tenants and industries during the third quarter. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 7.3% of rental revenue, and drugstores remain our largest industry at 11% of rental revenue.
As we discuss our top tenants, I'd like to highlight a positive transaction involving Diageo. Earlier this year, Diageo sold its wine-related businesses in order to exclusively focus on spirits and beer. We own 17 vineyards and wineries in Napa Valley that are leased to Diageo. Diageo sold its operations related to our properties to Treasury Wine Estates, the world's largest publicly traded venture. We and Diageo negotiated a buyout of the guarantee of our leases that have approximately 15 years of remaining term. Diageo is paying Realty Income $75 million in cash in 2 equal installments in exchange for being released from the guarantee. We received the initial payment in the third quarter, and we will receive the second payment in January of 2017. At that time, we will fully release Diageo from the guarantee, and Treasury Wine Estates will become our tenant. 
We believe this is a very attractive transaction for our shareholders for many reasons, including, first, the $75 million payment reduces our investment in prime Napa Valley real estate to approximately 50% of current market value. It also increases our yield on our investment to 10.5%. We gain as a top tenant Treasury Wine Estates who is an excellent venture, with an equity market capitalization of approximately $6.5 billion, who has a strong credit profile. While Treasury does not currently have rated public debt, it has a healthy balance sheet, with a debt to EBITDA of 1.5x and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 5.3x. It has a singular focus on wine, with premier labels such as Penfolds and Beringer and added BV and Sterling, among others, through this transaction.
Moving on to tenant credit. We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio, with 45% of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade-rated tenants.
The store-level performance of our retail tenants also remains sound. Our weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties increased from 2.7x to 2.8x on a 4-wall basis, and the median increased from 2.6x to 2.7x in the third quarter. 
Moving on to acquisitions. We completed $410 million in acquisitions during the quarter, and through the first 9 months of the year, we completed approximately $1.1 billion in acquisitions at record-high investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital. We continue to see a strong flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. Year-to-date, we have sourced $23 billion in acquisition opportunities, putting us on pace for another active year in acquisitions. We remain disciplined in our investment strategy, acquiring less than 5% of the amount sourced year-to-date, which is consistent with our average since 2010. As I mentioned, we are increasing our 2016 acquisitions guidance to approximately $1.5 billion, and we continue to acquire the highest-quality net lease properties as we grow our portfolio.
Now let me hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions."

Year-to-date 2016, we invested $1.1 billion in 236 properties located in 36 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.4% and with a weighted average lease term of 15 years. On a revenue basis, 51% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 81% of the revenues are generated from retail, and 19% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 41 different tenants in 24 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are drugstores, casual-dining restaurants and transportation services. Of the 61 independent transactions closed year-to-date, 2 transactions were above $50 million.
Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced approximately $9 billion in the third quarter. Year-to-date, we sourced approximately $23 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of these opportunities, 51% of the volumes sourced were portfolios, and 49% or approximately $11 billion were one-off assets. Investment-grade opportunities represented 24% for the third quarter. Of the $410 million in acquisitions closed in the third quarter, 33% were one-off transactions.
As to pricing, cap rates remained flat in the third quarter, with investment-grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment-grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. 
Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter, we sold 23 properties for net proceeds of $18.1 million at a net cash cap rate of 9.5% and realized an unlevered IRR of 7.4%. This brings us to 49 properties sold year-to-date for $53.2 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.7% and an unlevered IRR of 8.6%. 
Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy, averaging 271 basis points in the third quarter, which were well above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital.
In conclusion, as John mentioned, we are raising our acquisition guidance for 2016 to approximately $1.5 billion. We are also raising our 2016 disposition target to between $75 million and $100 million.
With that, I'd like to hand it back to John."

As mentioned previously, we returned to the bond market earlier this month with a $600 million 10-year benchmark senior unsecured bond offering at a yield to maturity at 3.15%. This offering allowed us to term out our line balance at attractive pricing while repricing our credit curve and the debt capital markets, which will have ongoing benefits to the company in future debt offerings. Since the start of 2015, we have issued a total of $2.5 billion of capital. $1.7 billion of this capital raise has been equity. So we have continued to finance our capital needs conservatively.
Our leverage remains low, with debt to total market cap of approximately 23% and debt to EBITDA of 5.3x. Additionally, we currently have approximately $1.5 billion of capacity available on our $2 billion line of credit, providing us with excellent liquidity as we grow our company.
Our credit ratings remain Baa1, BBB+ by all 3 rating agencies, with positive outlooks from both Moody's and S&P, providing us with the highest overall credit ratings in the net lease sector.
During the third quarter, we increased the dividend for the 88th time in the company's history. The current annualized dividend represents a 6% increase over the prior year. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of just under 5%. Our year-to-date AFFO payout ratio is 83.5%, which is a level we are quite comfortable with.
To wrap it up, we had another productive quarter across all functions of the organization and remain optimistic about our future. As demonstrated by our sector-leading EBITDA margins of approximately 94%, we continue to realize the efficiencies associated with our size and the economies of scale in the net lease business. Our portfolio is performing well, and we continue to see a healthy volume of acquisition opportunities. 
The net lease acquisition environment remains a very efficient marketplace, and we believe we are best positioned to capitalize on the highest-quality properties given our sector-leading cost of capital, access to capital and balance sheet flexibility. 
At this time, I would now like to open it up for questions. Operator?"

But historically, our line was a lot smaller, too. So over the past year, with a $2 billion line, it gives us a little bit more flexibility to be able to carry a little bit larger balance than we had historically. But on a percentage basis relative to the enterprise as a whole, it's quite similar. So we're not taking on that much more variable-rate debt overall in the capital structure. What's good about that, the ability to carry a $400 million, $500 million, $600 million balance on the line that, again, isn't taking that much more risk relative to the enterprise as a whole is it gives you almost a free look at the permanent capital markets where you can wait and time when it's appropriate to issue long-term bonds or perhaps common equity.

There is some level of competition that we're really in a good position to focus on the highest-quality net lease properties, given our significant cost of capital advantage, size, access to capital, balance sheet flexibility. So we remain very selective, and that's been consistent. Going back to probably 2010, we acquired on average about 5% of what we're sourcing. So we're in a position where if we want it, we can generally execute and make the acquisition. So there is competition out there, but seldom are we competing with other public companies for transactions. There's some private capital out there. And certainly on the higher-quality industrial product, we'll be -- run into some money being managed by investment managers familiar with the net lease market. And that could be pension fund, endowment, even sovereign wealth money. Not seeing much out of the private or non-listed REITs today and really only compete with maybe 1 or 2 other public companies on just some assets. And then again, that's just given where we're focused versus where some of our peers are focused on the yield risk curve."

As a general remark, and we've always stated our philosophy for the balance sheet as kind of a roughly 2/3 equity, 1/3 long-term debt, if you will, to kind of help people think about how to model us going forward. When equity has been attractively priced, as it's been over the past 1.5 years, we lean more towards doing that and really exclusively did that for 21, 22 months. And as such, that brought it down to more or less a 20% debt leverage ratio. But ultimately, you want to have the ability to go up more to that 30% to 35% range if you need to and if equity, for some reason, at different points in time is not as attractively priced as it is. But we're very comfortable where we are right now, in that 20% to 25% range.

We're pleased to report another active quarter for acquisitions.

After financing 85% of our capital needs since the start of 2015 with equity, we returned to the bond market this month with a $600 million 10-year senior unsecured bond offering at 3.15%, which represents the lowest all-in yield in our company's history for a 10-year debt transaction.
Our balance sheet remains well capitalized, and access to our sector-leading cost of capital continues to allow us to pursue the highest-quality net lease investments that support our reliable dividend growth.
Now let me hand it over to Paul to provide additional detail on our financial results. Paul?"

I'm going to provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement.
Interest expense decreased in the quarter by $11 million to $53 million and year-to-date by $10 million to $171 million. This decrease is partly due to a lower average outstanding debt balance over the past year as we primarily sold common equity and repaid outstanding bonds and mortgages. However, this decrease was also driven by the recognition of a noncash gain of approximately $2.1 million on interest rate swaps during the quarter, which caused a decrease in that liability and lowered our interest expense. And in the comparative third quarter of 2015, we recognized a noncash loss of approximately $5.2 million that increased our interest expense in that quarter. As a reminder, we do exclude the impact of these noncash gains and losses to calculate our AFFO. 
Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was only 4.6% this quarter as we continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector. Year-to-date, our G&A is only 4.9% of revenues, and we are still projecting approximately 5% for the year. 
Our non-reimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 1.6% this quarter. And we are still projecting approximately 1.5% for the year.
Provisions for impairment were $8.8 million in the third quarter on 11 sold properties, 5 properties held for sale and 2 properties held for investment. $2 million of this impairment recognized in the quarter relates to the pending sale of our former headquarters office building in Escondido, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter.
Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. We raised approximately $500 million of common equity capital thus far this year. And as John mentioned, we successfully returned to the bond market earlier this month with a $600 million 10-year senior unsecured bond offering, with a yield of 3.15%. The offering was well oversubscribed, and we were very pleased with the quality of the fixed income investors in the offering. This offering extended the weighted average maturity of our senior unsecured bonds from 6.2 to 6.8 years and provides us with additional flexibility under our $2 billion revolving credit facility, which following the offering, has a balance of approximately $470 million.
Other than our credit facility, the only variable-rate debt exposure we have is on just $32.4 million of mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape with only $36 million of mortgages coming due the remainder of this year. And our maturity schedule is well laddered thereafter, with only $284 million of maturing debt in all of 2017. Finally, our overall leverage remains low, with our debt-to-EBITDA ratio standing at approximately 5.3x. 
In summary, we have low leverage, excellent liquidity and continued access to attractively priced equity and debt capital, both of which remain well-priced financing options today.
So let me turn the call now back over to John to give you more background."

Occupancy, based on the number of properties, was 98.3%, a 30 basis points increase from last quarter. We continue to make good progress with our re-leasing and sales efforts and expect to end the year at approximately 98% occupancy. 
On the 47 properties we re-leased during the quarter, we recaptured 105% of the expiring rent. While we typically do not pay tenant improvements to re-lease assets, we did incur $2.1 million in TIs and $7 million in committed redevelopment capital to re-lease 3 former Sports Authority properties to a leading national retailer, while generating a recapture rate of 136% on these 3 leases and an incremental yield on invested capital of 18%.
Year-to-date, we have recaptured 104% of expiring rent on 122 lease rollovers, which remains well above our long-term average. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold more than 2,200 properties with leases expiring, recapturing approximately 98% of rent on those properties that were re-leased. This compares favorably to the handful of net lease companies who also report this metric.
Our same-store rent increased 1.1% during the quarter and 1.2% year-to-date. We continue to expect annual same-store rent growth to be approximately 1.3% for 2016. 90% of our leases have contractual rent increases, so we remain pleased with the growth we are able to achieve from our properties.
Approximately 70% of our investment-grade leases have rental rate growth that averages about 1.3%. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and, to a certain extent, property type, all of which contribute to the stability of our cash flow.
At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 247 commercial tenants and 47 different industries located in 49 states and Puerto Rico. 79% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue. There's not much movement in the composition of our top tenants and industries during the third quarter. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 7.3% of rental revenue, and drugstores remain our largest industry at 11% of rental revenue.
As we discuss our top tenants, I'd like to highlight a positive transaction involving Diageo. Earlier this year, Diageo sold its wine-related businesses in order to exclusively focus on spirits and beer. We own 17 vineyards and wineries in Napa Valley that are leased to Diageo. Diageo sold its operations related to our properties to Treasury Wine Estates, the world's largest publicly traded venture. We and Diageo negotiated a buyout of the guarantee of our leases that have approximately 15 years of remaining term. Diageo is paying Realty Income $75 million in cash in 2 equal installments in exchange for being released from the guarantee. We received the initial payment in the third quarter, and we will receive the second payment in January of 2017. At that time, we will fully release Diageo from the guarantee, and Treasury Wine Estates will become our tenant. 
We believe this is a very attractive transaction for our shareholders for many reasons, including, first, the $75 million payment reduces our investment in prime Napa Valley real estate to approximately 50% of current market value. It also increases our yield on our investment to 10.5%. We gain as a top tenant Treasury Wine Estates who is an excellent venture, with an equity market capitalization of approximately $6.5 billion, who has a strong credit profile. While Treasury does not currently have rated public debt, it has a healthy balance sheet, with a debt to EBITDA of 1.5x and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 5.3x. It has a singular focus on wine, with premier labels such as Penfolds and Beringer and added BV and Sterling, among others, through this transaction.
Moving on to tenant credit. We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio, with 45% of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade-rated tenants.
The store-level performance of our retail tenants also remains sound. Our weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties increased from 2.7x to 2.8x on a 4-wall basis, and the median increased from 2.6x to 2.7x in the third quarter. 
Moving on to acquisitions. We completed $410 million in acquisitions during the quarter, and through the first 9 months of the year, we completed approximately $1.1 billion in acquisitions at record-high investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital. We continue to see a strong flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. Year-to-date, we have sourced $23 billion in acquisition opportunities, putting us on pace for another active year in acquisitions. We remain disciplined in our investment strategy, acquiring less than 5% of the amount sourced year-to-date, which is consistent with our average since 2010. As I mentioned, we are increasing our 2016 acquisitions guidance to approximately $1.5 billion, and we continue to acquire the highest-quality net lease properties as we grow our portfolio.
Now let me hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions."

During the third quarter of 2016, we invested $410 million in 93 properties located in 29 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.3% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.4 years. On a revenue basis, 69% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 86% of the revenues are generated from retail, and 14% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 23 different tenants in 13 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are drugstores, discount grocery stores and automotive services. We closed 20 independent transactions in the third quarter, and the average investment per property was approximately $4.4 million.
Year-to-date 2016, we invested $1.1 billion in 236 properties located in 36 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.4% and with a weighted average lease term of 15 years. On a revenue basis, 51% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 81% of the revenues are generated from retail, and 19% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 41 different tenants in 24 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are drugstores, casual-dining restaurants and transportation services. Of the 61 independent transactions closed year-to-date, 2 transactions were above $50 million.
Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced approximately $9 billion in the third quarter. Year-to-date, we sourced approximately $23 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of these opportunities, 51% of the volumes sourced were portfolios, and 49% or approximately $11 billion were one-off assets. Investment-grade opportunities represented 24% for the third quarter. Of the $410 million in acquisitions closed in the third quarter, 33% were one-off transactions.
As to pricing, cap rates remained flat in the third quarter, with investment-grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment-grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. 
Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter, we sold 23 properties for net proceeds of $18.1 million at a net cash cap rate of 9.5% and realized an unlevered IRR of 7.4%. This brings us to 49 properties sold year-to-date for $53.2 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.7% and an unlevered IRR of 8.6%. 
Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy, averaging 271 basis points in the third quarter, which were well above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital.
In conclusion, as John mentioned, we are raising our acquisition guidance for 2016 to approximately $1.5 billion. We are also raising our 2016 disposition target to between $75 million and $100 million.
With that, I'd like to hand it back to John."

As mentioned previously, we returned to the bond market earlier this month with a $600 million 10-year benchmark senior unsecured bond offering at a yield to maturity at 3.15%. This offering allowed us to term out our line balance at attractive pricing while repricing our credit curve and the debt capital markets, which will have ongoing benefits to the company in future debt offerings. Since the start of 2015, we have issued a total of $2.5 billion of capital. $1.7 billion of this capital raise has been equity. So we have continued to finance our capital needs conservatively.
Our leverage remains low, with debt to total market cap of approximately 23% and debt to EBITDA of 5.3x. Additionally, we currently have approximately $1.5 billion of capacity available on our $2 billion line of credit, providing us with excellent liquidity as we grow our company.
Our credit ratings remain Baa1, BBB+ by all 3 rating agencies, with positive outlooks from both Moody's and S&P, providing us with the highest overall credit ratings in the net lease sector.
During the third quarter, we increased the dividend for the 88th time in the company's history. The current annualized dividend represents a 6% increase over the prior year. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of just under 5%. Our year-to-date AFFO payout ratio is 83.5%, which is a level we are quite comfortable with.
To wrap it up, we had another productive quarter across all functions of the organization and remain optimistic about our future. As demonstrated by our sector-leading EBITDA margins of approximately 94%, we continue to realize the efficiencies associated with our size and the economies of scale in the net lease business. Our portfolio is performing well, and we continue to see a healthy volume of acquisition opportunities. 
The net lease acquisition environment remains a very efficient marketplace, and we believe we are best positioned to capitalize on the highest-quality properties given our sector-leading cost of capital, access to capital and balance sheet flexibility.

But historically, our line was a lot smaller, too. So over the past year, with a $2 billion line, it gives us a little bit more flexibility to be able to carry a little bit larger balance than we had historically. But on a percentage basis relative to the enterprise as a whole, it's quite similar. So we're not taking on that much more variable-rate debt overall in the capital structure. What's good about that, the ability to carry a $400 million, $500 million, $600 million balance on the line that, again, isn't taking that much more risk relative to the enterprise as a whole is it gives you almost a free look at the permanent capital markets where you can wait and time when it's appropriate to issue long-term bonds or perhaps common equity. So that's one side benefit of that. Right now, sitting here with a plus or minus $500 million of balance, that kind of gives us that window, but it's not one where we're anxious or feel the need to immediately issue capital anytime soon."

But that really hasn't materialized. We've got 1%-plus GDP growth. Our tenants are doing well, but when we look at their P&Ls, we're not seeing gangbuster growth. We're just seeing moderate, solid sales growth. So we're certainly comfortable, it gets back to the amount of floating-rate debt with the $500 million.

And even though the rent was substantially less, we substantially increased the value of those investments by leasing them to national, high-quality tenants, long-term lease terms with good growth. So we got a much lower cap rate. In one instance, it was done as a ground lease, and we've got a completely new building that would revert to us at the end of the term if this tenant elects to move on. So there's a story behind all of these, if you were to exclude those 3 former Ryan's, the recapture rate would have been 102% versus the way you calculate it at about 93%, 94%. We still think the right number is 105% and -- including the assets that we re-leased without vacancy. We had an excellent return on our invested capital there, and if we can get 18% on an unlevered basis for our shareholders, we'll do that all day long."

So one of the things that we've been talking about now for quite a while is our focus on asset management. And we've had a very focused effort in trying to identify opportunities, not only when it comes to re-leasing assets but even with existing assets, outparcel developments, demising existing assets, having direct conversations with tenants to figure out do they need is for the 100% of the assets or could we better serve them by taking back some of the asset and re-tenanting it. All those discussions have sort of started to finally bear fruition, and that's sort of the reason why you're starting to see 105%, 106%, 110% returns. We currently are looking at 31 different opportunities within our portfolio. And these are just immediate opportunities which should play out over the next 12 months. And some of the returns that John just mentioned is around the ZIP code of what we are expecting on some of these opportunities. And this is going to continue to be a bigger and bigger portion of our business and one of the growth drivers that we are very excited about."
