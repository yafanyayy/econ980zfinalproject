Today, I'll discuss our results for 2015, as well as our outlook for 2016. For 2015, we achieved our financial objectives for the year, reflecting strong double-digit EPS growth when excluding the impact of foreign exchange and almost 9% growth on an absolute basis. Excluding exchange, sales grew over 9%, including strong double-digit growth on emerging markets, and we continue to expand our gross and operating margins.
Overall, we made good progress against our strategic objectives. I'd like to highlight our few key achievements from the past year. In Established Pharmaceuticals, we completed the sale of our developed markets business and successfully integrated CFR Pharmaceuticals in Latin America and Veropharm in Russia. The integration of CFR provide the scale, manufacturing and portfolio breadth to establish Abbott as a top 10 branded generics company in Latin American and actually #1 in many of the markets in Latin America.
And Veropharm had a similar impact in Russia, positioning Abbott among the top branded generics companies in this key market. We also made significant progress improving our commercial execution, expanding our local product portfolios and driving awareness of our Abbott brand with patients, physicians and pharmacists.
In Nutrition, we achieved double-digit growth in share expansion in China with a portfolio pediatric nutrition products that are customized to meet local preferences. In the U.S., we expanded our product offering in the tolerance and updates categories with the portfolio of non-GMO products, providing parents with additional formulary choices.
Our International Adult Nutrition business achieved another year of strong growth, as we continue to build and shape this category globally. And we achieved another year of significant margin expansion. In Medical Devices, MitraClip achieved sales of more than $250 million, and we further solidified our leadership position in the transcatheter mitral valve repair market with the acquisition of 10 dime [ph] and an option agreement to acquire valve technologies.
Along with MitraClip, these technologies position Abbott well to sustain our leadership position in this attractive segment of the market. In Medical Optics, we continue to launch a number of innovative products that are driving growth and share expansion, most notably in the premium lens segments. 
And in Diabetes Care, we introduced our revolutionary flash glucose monitor, Freestyle Libre, in several countries throughout Europe. Consumer response for this product continues to be very positive, and we recently expanded capacity to meet the growing demand. We also made progress during the year to bring the Libre technology to the U.S. with the regulatory submission for approval of Libre Pro, a professional use device June of last year.
Finally, in diagnostics, the combination of commercial execution, high-quality platforms and customer-focused solutions resulted in another year of above-market growth at cross both develop an emerging markets. This business also achieved another year of margin expansion while simultaneously investing in the development of next generation system platforms across all 3 of its segments, including the Core Lab, Molecular Diagnostics and Point of Care Diagnostics.
So we're entering 2016 with good underlying momentum. Our businesses are well aligned with favorable, long-term trends, including the continued expansion of health care and emerging economies. While there's been some softening in these economies on a macro basis, national policies focused on expanding access to care and favorable demographic trends are driving growth in health care that is outpacing overall economic growth in these markets. The fundamentals of the market and geographies where we compete remain strong, and we expect to deliver another year of strong double-digit underlying earnings growth in 2016.
However, a couple of items are impacting our growth outlook on an absolute basis, and you've heard this all week. Most notably, foreign a change. The rapid strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to several emerging market currencies beginning in the third quarter of last year means that foreign change will again be a growth headwind in 2016. We are now entering the fifth year of this dollar bull cycle. While we actively work to mitigate the impact of currency on our results, the impact of exchange on our bottom line will be more pronounced in 2016 due to the mix of currency movements and certain timing effects.
In preparing our 2016 forecast, we were mindful of finding the right balance between managing through these transitory currency dynamics in the near term while concurrently making the right choices and appropriate investments to drive sustainable, long-term growth.
The other notable impact to our 2016 outlook relates to Venezuela, which has been a good market for us for many years. As many of you know, market conditions in Venezuela have become more challenging, including high inflation, increasing price and margin controls, regulations on imports and slowing demand. As a result, our forecast assumes a significantly lower contribution from Venezuela operations in 2016. Brian will provide more specific details on the impacts of currency in Venezuela in a few minutes.
So for 2016, our adjusted diluted share guidance range of $2.10 to $2.20 reflects another year of strong double-digit underlying earnings growth offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange and the lower contrition from Venezuela that I just mentioned. In this environment, we remain focused on what we control, our commercial and operational execution, our innovations and our efforts to expand margins.
In Nutrition, our R&D organization continues to be highly productive and is now developing new products closer to our customers than ever before with the opening of several new R&D centers in Asia over the last several years. We expect continued growth and share expansion in China, Latin America and other priority markets, including another year of strong International Adult Nutrition growth. And while we've made great progress expanding margins in this business, margin improvement remains a key priority, and we continue to see opportunities for steady expansion going forward.
In Established Pharmaceuticals, our execution has improved significantly, and we're focused on strengthening our capabilities in key channels and geographies and building a well-recognized Abbott brand with consumers take a prominent role in making decisions about their health care. Internal development programs and local product acquisitions are driving a steady cadence of new products in our Established Pharma business to strengthen local portfolios. In 2015, our productivity of new product launches increased versus the previous year, and we expect another strong year of new product launch productivity in 2016.
In Medical Devices, we expect continued growth in share expense -- expansion in our cataract business, driven by the ongoing launch and market uptake of our premium intraocular lens products across multiple geographies. In Diabetes Care, we recently expanded capacity, as I mentioned, to meet the strong demand for FreeStyle Libre in Europe, and we expect to bring this technology into a number of new markets in 2016, targeting in the multi-billion global blood glucose monitoring market.
And in Vascular, we'll continue to drive optically MitraClip and expect to bring absorbed to new markets through the year. Finally, in Diagnostics, which remains one of our most consistent growth businesses. We'll continue to execute our commercial strategy to drive above-market growth in both developed and emerging markets. And as we progress through the year, we look forward to providing more specifics regarding our next generation diagnostic system's platforms as we get closer to launch.
Before turning it over to Brian, I'd like to comment briefly on capital allocation. You always asked me about that and you know that we take a very balanced approach here, which for us includes increasing our dividend, share repurchases and M&A activity. 
Last month, we announced an increase to our quarterly dividend, marking the 44th consecutive year we've increased our dividend. Abbott is only one of a handful -- one of only a handful of companies the delivered with such consistency. Share repurchases have and will continue to be part of our capital allocation mix. And lastly, while 2015 was relatively quiet for us on the M&A front, adding to our business with good M&A remains a key priority. We see a hundred opportunities and we'll continue active on this front. As always, we remain disciplined and focused on finding the right balance of strategic fit and measures of return that will benefit the long-term shareholder. I'm sure you're going to have a question for me later on that topic.
But overall, as you can see, cash flows remain strong. Margins remain strong. The underlying growth of our businesses remain strong. In summary, the fundamentals of the markets and geographies in which we compete all remain strong, and we continue to focus on what we can control. 
For 2016, the impact of foreign exchange and the Venezuela dynamics I mentioned earlier are offsetting double-digit underlying earnings growth. These impacts, while significant, are transitory in nature. And therefore, we remain focused on making the right decisions to drive long-term growth to our shareholders.
I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss 2015 results and the 2016 outlook in more detail. Brian?"
247483,321571928,922222,"Abbott Laboratories, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Abbott Laboratories","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Miles. Today, we reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.62, in line with our previous guidance range. Sales for the quarter increased 4.9% on an operational basis, driven by strong performance in",991,"Okay. Thanks, Miles. Today, we reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.62, in line with our previous guidance range. Sales for the quarter increased 4.9% on an operational basis, driven by strong performance in our Branded Generics, Diagnostics and Adult Nutrition businesses. The foreign sales declined 3.1%, including an unfavorable impact of 8% from foreign exchange. The negative impact from exchange was approximately 1.5 percentage points higher than previous expectations due to the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the quarter.
The fourth quarter adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.2% of sales, up 130 basis points over 2014, driven by continuing margin expansion in Diagnostics and Nutrition. In the quarter, adjusted SG&A expense was 29.6% of sales and adjusted R&D investment was 7% of sales, reflecting investments in the moment program across the businesses, including several next-generation diagnostics system platforms.
The fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was somewhat below our previous forecast, due to inclusion of the impact of U.S. tax legislation enacted in December. Overall, as we look at 2016, we achieved our financial objectives for the year despite a difficult environment, and we delivered strong underlying growth while continuing to make significant progress on our margin initiatives.
Turning to our 2016 outlook. Today, we issued guidance for adjusted diluted share of $2.10 to $2.20. While this forecast reflects another year of strong double-digit underlying earnings growth, foreign exchange and the Venezuela dynamics that Miles discussed are impacting our 2016 absolute growth outlook.
Let me take a moment to provide more detail on each of these items. As you know, in the third quarter of 2015, several emerging market currencies weakened rapidly relative to the U.S. dollar and have continued to steadily weakened since that time. Based on the geographic mix of currencies that weakened and the rapid pace at which these currencies decline, foreign exchange will be a greater offset to our underlying earnings growth in 2016 versus 2015. Additionally, in 2015, our hedging program served to mitigate some of the underlying foreign exchange exposure and volatilities. While our prior worm remains in place for 2016 and is anticipated to deliver some offsetting impact to our exposure, the benefit of our hedgings have naturally lessened over time.
So the fall-through from translational point changed, combined with these hedging dynamics, negatively impacts EPS growth in our guidance by a little more than 10% for the full year of 2016.
Lastly, as Miles mentioned, due to challenging market conditions in Venezuela, our 2016 forecast assumed a significantly lower contribution from Venezuelan operations. This impact lowers our 2016 sales growth rate by almost 2%. And excluding this impact, the mid-point of our 2016 guidance range would reflect adjusted diluted share growth in the mid single-digits, even with the more pronounced foreign exchange impact I discussed earlier. As of the year progresses, we'll provide any relevant updates in our business in Venezuela. 
I will now provide more specifics for our 2016 outlook. For the full year 2016, we forecast operational sales growth in the mid single-digits. Based on current exchange rates, wed expect the negative impact of around 4% on our full year reported sales, which would result in reported sales growth in the low single-digits for the full year 2016. Scott will provide more detail on the 2016 outlook by business in a few minutes. 
We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio around 57% of sales, reflecting the negative FX from exchange, partially offset by underlying gross margin improvement initiatives across our businesses. We forecast adjusted R&D investment of somewhat above 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 30.5% of sales for the full year. We forecast net interest expense of around $125 million, up over 2015, primarily due to higher U.S. interest rates and lower forecasted interest income certain countries. We forecast a loss of approximately $25 million on exchange gain loss line of P&L for the full year, and we forecast around $10 million of nonoperating expense for the full year 2016. We forecast adjusted tax rate of somewhat above 18.5% for the full year 2016, similar to 2015 and reflect any effect of the U.S. tax legislation enacted in December.
Before I review our first quarter outlook, I'd like to provide some context for our forecasted pattern of quarterly earnings growth in 2016. We forecast underlying adjusted EPS growth in the double digits for each quarter of 2016. However, in absolute terms, both foreign exchange and the Venezuela dynamics will have a more pronounced impact on our results in the first half of the year. We expect the pace of both sales and adjusted EPS growth to progressively accelerate throughout the year.
So for the first quarter, we forecast adjusted diluted share of $0.38 to $0.40, reflecting double-digit underlying growth, which is more than offset by the impact of foreign exchange and the lower contribution from Venezuela operations. We forecast operation sales growth in the low single-digits. And at current change rate, we expect a negative impact of exchange around 6%, resulting in a reported sales decline in the low single-digits.
The Venezuela dynamics that I discussed lowered our first quarter operational sales growth forecast by around 3 percentage points. We forecast that adjusted gross margin ratio approaching 57% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of somewhat above 7% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 34% of sales in the first quarter. And we forecast net interest expense of around $25 million in the first quarter. 
In summary, we achieved strong growth in 2015 despite the challenging environment. Our business has entered 2016 with good underlying momentum. And we continue to execute well on our margin expansion initiatives. Our underlying earnings growth forecast is to remain strong 2016, very similar to the underlying earnings growth we saw in 2015.
With that, I'll turn it over to Scott to review the business operating highlights and outlook. Scott?"

As I mentioned earlier, my comments will focus on operational sales growth. I'll start with Diagnostics, where sales increased 7% in the quarter. In Core Laboratory Diagnostics, international sales increased nearly 8%, driven by double-digit growth in emerging markets. And in the U.S, we continue to achieve above market performance with growth of more than 6%.
In Molecular Diagnostics, sales grew 3%, led by strong growth in our core focus area of infectious disease testing. As expected, U.S. sales were impacted by the brand scale down of our genetics business. And lastly, Point of Care Diagnostics, where sales increased nearly 9% in the quarter. U.S. and international growth were driven by continued market adoption of i-STAT, our handheld device, which provides critical information at the patient site, helping health care providers just the best treatment in the variety of care settings where minutes matter the most.
In 2016, we'll continue to leverage our best-in-class commercial model and provide customers with a full operating solutions to help them most efficiently operate their businesses while improving care. We expect global diagnostics sales to increase mid single-digits on an operational basis with growth in both the full year and first quarter of 2016. In Nutrition, global sales increased 5.5% in the quarter. Pediatric Nutrition sales increased approximately 4% and were led by continued market uptake of Eleva in China and Similac advanced non-GMO in the U.S.
As expected, International Pediatric Nutrition results were impacted by a difficult comparison versus the prior year, when sales increased more than 20% driven by market uptake of product launches in China and Southeast Asia. In Adult Nutrition, sales were led by 10% international growth, including double-digit operational growth in several Latin American countries. U.S. performance was led by growth of venture in the retail and institutional segments of the market.
In 2016, we'll continue to focus our efforts on cash flow share with locally relevant Pediatric Nutrition product and growing and shipping the Adult Nutrition category globally. For the full year 2016, we expect Global Nutrition sales to increase mid single-digits on an operational basis.
It's important to note that the Venezuela dynamics that Miles and Brian reviewed most significantly impact our forecasts from the Nutrition in Established Pharmaceuticals close. Excluding this impact, we forecast operational sales growth for our Global Nutrition business would be mid- to high single-digits for the full year of 2016.
For the first quarter, we're forecasting Global Nutrition sales to increase low- to mid single-digits on an operational basis. In Medical Devices, as expected, sales were relatively flat for the quarter. MitraClip, our first-in-class device for the treatment of mitral regurgitation, once again grew strong double-digits and Supera, our innovative endovascular stent, continued to perform well. This growth is mitigated by market dynamics in the coronary stent market.
In 2016, we'll continue to drive market uptake in MitraClip and Supera and expect to bring Absorb, our full developing stent to the U.S. market. For both the full year and first quarter of 2016, we expect global [indiscernible] sale to decline low single-digits on an operational basis. In Diabetes Care, sales growth was again driven by strong international sales of Freestyle Libre in Europe. In 2016, with our recently completed capacity expansion, we look forward to bringing this breakthrough technology to more consumers around the world.
For the full year 2016, we expect global diabetes sales to increase double digits on an operational basis. For the first quarter, we're forecasting global diabetes sales to increase mid single-digits on an operational basis.
In Medical Optics, global sales increased 2%, with strong performance in the cataract business, notably in the premium lens segment, was partially offset by dynamics in most proactive markets. In 2016, we'll continue to drive uptake of our innovative premium intraocular lenses, and we expect global Medical Optics sales to increase low- to mid single-digits on an operational basis for both the full year and first quarter of 2016.
And lastly, Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, our sales again increased double digits. Sales growth in the quarter was led by strong performance in several markets, including Russia, India and China. For the full year 2015, we believe sales was double-digit operationally with and without the impact of recent acquisitions. In 2016, we'll continue to broaden our portfolio with locally relevant new products will remain focused on successfully building our presence and scale in key countries of focus. For the full year 2016, we expect EPD sales to increase mid- to high single-digits on an operational basis.
As I mentioned earlier, Venezuela had a significant impact on our forecasted EPD growth rate. Excluding this impact, we would forecast operational sales growth for EPD in the low double-digits for the full year 2016. For the first quarter, we're forecasting EPD sales to increase mid single-digits on an operational basis, reflecting double-digit operational growth excluding the impact of Venezuela. 
In summary, we achieved another year of strong underlying sales and margin growth and are well-positioned to maintain that type of momentum for the full year 2016. We will now open the call for questions."

Coal prices have hiked at the beginning of the year, it declined throughout the year and stock market became more challenging. And we, as Scott talked about and Brian talked about, significantly lower volume as we exited 2015. And as Miles indicated in his remarks, with price controls, very high inflation and this kind of -- when we look at the remainder of 2016 going forward, we see very challenging condition and much lower volumes in the country. So we're focused on supplying market, more focused on medical critical products. Our products are important to the market. But just the profitability of what we would expect for the year from that activity is a very low contribution compared to what we experienced largely in the first half of 2015. So that's kind of the situation. And I think it's basically -- it takes some volatility out of our forecast. But -- reality of the market we're dealing at."

Now the oil-based economy, so these are extremely dependent on oil as Venezuela. Okay, they're a different story. And the volatility and reliability and sustainable in the market there is different than just about anywhere in the world. So okay, there's an outlier. And every year, there's going to be some outliers somewhere. And I think if you're in a broad mix of currencies and a broad mix of countries and geographies with a multinational, somewhere, something is not going to be great. But the fundamentals of the markets, particular us in health care, our good. When you, translating that back to doing that us period, it's unusual. It's frustrating. I mean, none of us have seen this kind of oil price in a couple of decades. We've seen this kind of currency pile on in the wrong time.

Has my expectation of our underlying momentum changed? No. Has my priority changed in terms of M&A activity? I'll tell you one thing about it that's changed a little bit. We've been looking at top of these largely internationally. And I'd say, I'm probably balanced in that old bit back in another way. Now I don't think in the past, have looked pretty hard in a lot of expansion opportunities in branded generic pharmaceuticals. And I think there are opportunities there. But I think as you and others, what we watched those valuations over the last year, when deal heat turn. And I can tell you that there was one particular one that we were involved in an auction for. And the valuation that, that property went, we did not win it. But the valuation of that property [indiscernible] was not economic. I mean, just plain noneconomic. I would challenge the buyer to explain where the economic return was in that particular deal. And they obviously have their reasons and they obviously saw something the rest of us didn't appreciate. I would say is an understatement. But the valuation are in a level, in some cases, that you have to question prudence. And I think at the end of the day, while we've got strategic reasons we want to expand our footprint in different places, those valuations, when we deploy the capital on behalf of our shareholders have to make some sense. And I don't think that we are in a more -- I think we're pretty and. I think we're disciplined. I think we've made good deals in the past. I think -- you know what, I've gone to so much of this we're of that in beta much we didn't pay enough, we got to get deals, et cetera. But I think some of the things I saw last year said I don't think I minded losing that one, I don't think I minded not participating in that one. So I think, right now, first of all, I don't feel a lot that keeping offering up for sale in effect. And the old maximum, everything's for sale at some price. While the price of some of these things will be for sale is being prudent. It's just been prudent. So I think you have to step back and say, ""We're not in that zone. We're not going to be that irrational in some cases."" And that's me. I mean, I hate that I'm going to see some later, but I think that. So look at some of the currencies and some of the weakening of currencies, we would view a lot of those deals in local currency. In fact, almost all of them in local currency. And I'd say, based on where those currency rates are today, you would say it's time. This is the time because there's not as much currency risk in a purchasing that particular market, et cetera. But I think if I look at the mix of geographies and the mix of currencies and so forth that we currently have, I'm not sure our investors would applaud further weighting toward it just now. I mean, I think there's a time issue. I would tell you, having said that, there was a right opportunity and the right place and I believe that it was strategically very important to us or a real opportunity for our investors and that the balance of what we foresaw and the growth of that market, the position, the currency [indiscernible], but all lined up and the valuation. I'd probably do that deal. But that was a stack up of a lot of ifs right now. So let's say, what's changed? I'd say we are on looking and what I'm considering, it doesn't change. It's just shifted in some of its balance. I think that the -- I've got all the same sort of pharmaceutical opportunities on my radar screen, but I'm prioritizing some others now that are maybe more important, I think, in this market, this environment in terms of strengthening our businesses. Now I've heard other CEO say the same thing, I've heard a lot of people say -- actually, most of it I heard bankers say, that it's a very robust, everybody got they're trying to step on from other companies reporting. I do think there's that many things out there for people to consider in our spaces. I don't think there's that many properties, i don't think there's that many assets. I don't think there was that much to consolidate. So I think it's fairly predictable, particularly for an analyst in this space as you are, to predict the kind of people are going to be looking at. There's not a lot of out there to consider. So I think, for us, we know what our strategic priorities are. We know what can help our business. We're aware there's real pluses and opportunities. And the question is, whether or not the other parties, wherever they may be, see the same sort of opportunity, and we can come together on valuation to make something happen. And I know that sounds like textbook product to you, but that's really what it is. There's a lot of people at the dance looking at each other chatter and try to decide whether they want to dance. I don't think there's that many opportunities to be made in everybody the same environment where they think their own valuations are low and the valuations at last year that were kind of high. And I think you're in the zone where people are adjusting for what's my value. So having said all that, am I any less focused on it? No, I'm probably more focused on it, if anything. But I'd say, we're also pretty analytical about what we can do with the businesses and what's the right valuation and what's the right timing and so forth because we don't get stepped-up in deal heat. We're very strategic about it. And I know that a lot of people think that a lot happened last year and we should have been in the mix of it. But I didn't see anything go by that help particularly bad of not being in the mix in one particular one we were in the hunt on and the valuation at the end was so high, I don't mind missing it at all. So I realized that's a long answer for you, Mike, but that probably gives you a fair degree of insight into how I'm thinking about it. We're definitely not inactive, that's for sure."

But we're committed to our 4 major segments that we have in the company. One of the important things about those segments is that they're in relative in balance in terms of size, sales, comparability, et cetera. It got all in a good also are got a lot common. You think that EPD and Nutrition globally, they share a lot of channel dynamics and so forth, devices, diagnostics to them. There's a lot of different things going on. But I'd say first is balance matters and the mix that is the investment Company will company from investor because want to be reliable performance, steadily over time. And as you know, our proprietary Pharma business fabulously grew to a terrific size and based on one product in particular. And so we were out of balance as a company. And so we split in 2 companies. But we've got balance in these businesses. That said, I'd say, from an M&A perspective in the places where we're looking, to be perfectly fair, we're not looking to do anything with regard to M&A in our Nutrition business today. I mean, if something came along opportunistic, we look at anything. But the fact is, that business is -- that's and organic business for us. Our -- all of our performance objectives, and the things he wanted in the Nutrition business globally organically driven and we think one of the position for our likes. The kind of the investment will be making most businesses are more capital plan and, et cetera the right market for the world and managing supply chain and so forth. The other 3 businesses are each of different pale. Diagnostics, I'd say, we got a very strong business here. It's actually I diverse business. It's a lot of business segment to diagnostics. And if the opportunistically could add to it, we would. Obviously, if you look at helped to make sense but that's the business where we don't really have to. But if he had opportunities, we will. EPD, similar. We've got a gem of a business there. And having been done lot of things to shape that business in the last several years, we are in the right growth markets. We're in high growth markets. We're in markets where the profitability and the market developments, the retail facing, all the structural and channel dynamics for a brand of generics are good. We've identified like, let's say, in priority, 15 countries in particular to meet all our criteria. And we've got strong positions in most of those particularly important ones, and we're always looking to enhance our footprint in those markets if we can and expand our brands in those markets. Latin America was a good example of that. And so there's still many geographic opportunities to do so. But I would make the distinction for investors and others that it's really where we can distinctively differentiate branded generic Pharma cycles, which means retail in channel and so forth like India and other like Latin American countries and so forth. And so when we have those opportunities, it's great to add on. But what we've got is core business now is a very strong branded generic international, largely focused on emerging markets business, where there's tremendous tailwind of market growth. So that's another one that's opportunistic. And in devices, I'd say it's some of both. We look at that -- we've always want to strength in that business. We do want to strengthen that business. And a number ways of doing that. Obviously, there's organic in-house and then there's our control organization, where we're building a number of small companies, we're investing a number so forth and building our pipelines for the future. And then, finally, it's opportunistically, there's available opportunity where it fits our market segments and so forth, then there's always M&A. And so we're always mindful of those opportunities. It gives you a sense of how we think about each of those segments. As of said, when you think about something completely unrelated different, probably not. There's too many opportunities to build or strengthening the ones we have. And their needs from a strengthening standpoint, vary. Some have more need to have more breadth of product than others and some are purely opportunistic, Kristen."

First of all, we are committed to the business. And I think there is bigger market conditions there. If we look at the markets around the world, much as the U.S. that literally, every nature country in the world. The markets have stabilized among competitors. Share doesn't move a lot. Like it doesn't move a little. The physicians in this space, they take a new product and they experiment with it a little bit. And that's about it. I mean, the innovation here is at a point where I'd say the incremental value recognized by the health care system is limited. If you think about what drug called stents and so forth have done in the vascular space, we've been a tremendous boom to the treatment of patients. But I think now, what we see is this market is far more driven by cost and prices in either countries or in hospital groups and others try to manage several costs in health care. So I think all of this see the same dynamics where we're increasingly challenged on more value proposition and just innovation. And I think increasingly the payer, whether it's a government or the purchasing people or share, whatever it is, or increasingly more influential here than the preference of physicians. You see it's a little greater dynamic. Well, they're not bad dynamics, either. We have to compete in this business just like we compete in a lot of our other businesses. And I think we and our competitors in this business are all broadening our product lines, are innovating in other surrounding spaces and broadening those offerings in this space. And there's still a lot of room for innovation, but it may not be specifically just on the steps. So that -- who's our [indiscernible] to expand our business? And to some degree or to a large degree, that is M&A. And in our case, it's been a lot of small volume M&A and looking to expand around this business, MitraClip, Absorb, kind of things, committal all MitraClip sickened that way. We look at expanding into structural quarter failure or other categories. And were trying to build our breadth those other -- let's say, surrounding spaces that way. I don't think that's very different in for any of the core base in this business worldwide. I think what's been difficult for any market that have the kind of robust innovation that have been this one did back in the early thousands. It's a different market today. It's a different market that we're in today. So is it a slow growth market? Yes. Is It still a very attractive market? Yes. It's still a very profitable market for our participants. And I tried a lot of different pressure from a cost standpoint from the payers, et cetera. I don't think that's a secret to anybody. So will others look at the performance of the business and say, ""Geez, it's a little below our expectations."" I'm beginning to think its just a robust adjusting our expectations to some of the reality of the value propositions in the market today. So I think the very strong business, it's a very healthy one, these in that respect, we still invest quite substantially in R&D and innovations there and clinical trials and so forth. Got innovations that are in R&D and in the clinical space. And a lot of investments around it. So would it benefit from a much broader footprint? Well, it probably would. The question is, how to get to that broader. And I think in the, you call it, medical device space broadly defined today, there's either a bunch of big companies or a bunch of little companies. There's not much in the middle. In a couple of things in the middle are extremely highly value relative to their current performance. And I think there's a lot of speculation, question about whether or not that kind of value would play out. So I think little time. We've made a lot of investments in smaller companies and segments, as you know, whether it's [indiscernible] or Sepia or others to expand our footprints here. So I think -- I believe in medical device space right now and long-term, but I don't think it'll be the same kind of space. It was 10, 15 years ago."

And a lot of companies dialed back to single digit or whatever and later on exchange and so forth, which was valid. In our case, we said, we think we can navigate through it, and we did. And we had extremely strong underlying growth of -- in our markets, as we still do. And it wasn't just double digits, it's been healthy double-digit all year long. And so in our case, we were able to mitigate an awful lot of that exchange all year long and still deliver what was frankly very differentiated, higher growth than many, many of our peers, even multinational peers not in health care. And what we've got now is another year on top of that, okay, of the same sort of thing. And if you look at these exchange rate grass, who would have thought these change rates good, in a lot of cases, be even bigger, even bigger change rates the call we want to go. And then on top of that, notably printed $25 to $30 oil. Now that's the curveball for the whole world. And so when throw that curveball in there, it dramatically unbalances the mix of your currencies because of the oil-based economies where lower oil prices really affect the underlying performance of the country. So you take a country like Russia or Venezuela or Saudi Arabia, now these are countries that are all strong countries for us. And to different degrees, they're impacted by their own oil revenue and therefore, their own ability to pay for products. Now having said that, is Russia still a strong market for us? It is. Do we have the same kind of difficulties in Russia that we had in Venezuela? We don't. It is a fundamentally good market, strong underlying market, et cetera. The only thing that's not strong is the ruble, which is dramatically weaker versus the dollar than even a year ago. And so there's this disproportionate imbalance in the currency basket, if you will, from a little handful of countries, where they already had currency translation challenges just like the rest of the world, except that they have oil dependence on top of it, which amplifies it even more. And when you start a stack up, all of those things you'd say, okay, could we navigate through this? And the answer is we could. I can cut a lot of expenses. I can delay a lot of investments. There's a lot of things that, frankly, I have discretion to do. We as a company has the discretion to do. And I could then say to you, real leader have 5% earnings growth or high single-digit earnings growth. But in our judgment, this year is so unusual this way with the ongoing depth of currency roles and the unusual circumstance of oil prices and its impact of these economies so that I would be best and say, I don't think its prudent to compromise our ability to delay all these underlying growth for 1 year. In fact, it's more prudent to take out Venezuela out of the assumptions. It's more prudent to take that one out and keep right on going. And I think if you believe in the underlying strength of economies around the world, the ones that are delivering growth, and if you believe in the underlying growth of health care and those economies, and you believe in the underlying growth of all our products and Abbott, and if you believe in Abbott's ability to continue taxes all that growth, then my judgment was, okay, going to roll out my pocket here. Venezuela has the assumptions. I mean, if I didn't taking Venezuela out of the assumptions, I'd be telling you right now that you're going to have mid single-digit growth on the top and bottom line. And something, you think that was terrific in this environment. And if you compare to all of the other multinationals in our praise were factly multinationals you know that's right in everybody else. So in this case, I don't want to artificially compromise our investments. A lot of this businesses, whether it's in addition a investment or R&D or whatever, because of Venezuela. So I think I'm going to take that one out and keep right on going because I believe in the longer-term growth prospects of these economies and these businesses, and I'm not going to compromise of that for a couple of quarters in Venezuela. So at the end of the day, could we manage to it? Yes. And you know this, if you look back at even 10 years in fact, with or without it, we've absolutely been reliable a double-digit bottom line and high single top line unlike almost any other large, diverse multinational out there. Know we've been very reliable perform and that they have very diverse [indiscernible]. So I don't see all that defense than those [indiscernible] a look on the right and say, this is like a total different circumstance than any of us ever seen. That's to make adjustment on how far to push off what we ought to be doing to sort of laid off this oddball storm we're in. And this oddball storm, I don't know -- I think there's a lot of people that project oil prices are going to stay down for a long time. And I mean, everyone -- what is down? And what points of these old driven economy start performing better? $60, $70, $50, there's different thresholds where the performance are going to be changed dramatically for a lot of different businesses in the world not just us. When our case, health care is pretty good momentum what the oil price is. The dynamics of the Venezuela our unique. They're unique. When even in Saudi, they still spin on the health care? Yes, they do. Still a very strong, important market for us and so is Russia and so on plotter know that's a long roundabout way of saying, we're here to deliberate decision it was discretionary. Could I have made a decision to say, I'm going to deliver high single-digit earnings growth no matter what? Yes, probably. But I wouldn't have to compromise the underlying momentum in ways I didn't think is prudent. For exchange, yes, we can manage exchange. But as well, [indiscernible] out of the mix. In terms of what her expectations are. And that's an initial amount. I mean, I challenge to that. In 2015, we look through exchange. Can we look through exchange again? Yes, we can. Yes, we can provide the single biggest difference is our guidance of this year is actually Venezuela. I don't know if that answers your question enough. But that was my judgment. It's not an inability. It's more of a decision. If you look at our spending rates and stuff in our go forward guidance, our spending rates are healthy."

You could be dead right about Venezuela, I don't know. I don't know. But here's the difference for us. We're a health care company. And among our businesses there, our product so that are medically necessary. And we have to pay attention to medically necessary. We don't have to lose money all the time. We're don't have to -- we don't have to be irrational for whatever reason. But we're mindful that we are a health care company. We are mindful that we have medically necessary products, mindful that we have been, in Latin America and in Venezuela for decades. And a lot of times in the past, in decades, foreign companies has exited those countries immediately when the economics turn sour. And the long-term commitment to that continent, the governments of those countries and the health care systems to those countries, they know that and they recognize that. Abbott has never done that in 90 years in Latin America. And we are a fundamentally large health care provider in Latin America. So our judgment was to make these decisions one step at a time as we see how circumstances develop. It's a pretty good decision that we think and just to say, we're going to take the sales and profit expectations out of our expectations for the year so that our investors -- frankly, you're getting  the newest that we're taking it out of our expectations, right? And yet, all on trying to do is be risk your expectation, do you risk your -- whiting the roller coaster volatility here in the particular country because that one's  unique. And so we've just chosen to take it out of the estimates because we know we're going to continue to have medically necessary products there. But that's going to be in our view, at a much lower commercial level than in the past. So right now, I think that's the right, prudent place to be for that change, I suppose, anything's changed. I hope it changes favorably more frankly. I just know that we are in a very tough circumstance as a country. They're volatile. They are predictable, and it's not a very liable market us markets grow. So I think this is the right step. You can see, local certainly just go a lot further. And you could succumb you can say that if you were just, industrial consumer. But would but I don't think the self care company even quite be the same thing because I don't I think we have to be a little bit put in here about the messes that's why we're where we are.

Today, I'll discuss our results for 2015, as well as our outlook for 2016. For 2015, we achieved our financial objectives for the year, reflecting strong double-digit EPS growth when excluding the impact of foreign exchange and almost 9% growth on an absolute basis. Excluding exchange, sales grew over 9%, including strong double-digit growth on emerging markets, and we continue to expand our gross and operating margins.
Overall, we made good progress against our strategic objectives. I'd like to highlight our few key achievements from the past year. In Established Pharmaceuticals, we completed the sale of our developed markets business and successfully integrated CFR Pharmaceuticals in Latin America and Veropharm in Russia. The integration of CFR provide the scale, manufacturing and portfolio breadth to establish Abbott as a top 10 branded generics company in Latin American and actually #1 in many of the markets in Latin America.
And Veropharm had a similar impact in Russia, positioning Abbott among the top branded generics companies in this key market. We also made significant progress improving our commercial execution, expanding our local product portfolios and driving awareness of our Abbott brand with patients, physicians and pharmacists.
In Nutrition, we achieved double-digit growth in share expansion in China with a portfolio pediatric nutrition products that are customized to meet local preferences. In the U.S., we expanded our product offering in the tolerance and updates categories with the portfolio of non-GMO products, providing parents with additional formulary choices.
Our International Adult Nutrition business achieved another year of strong growth, as we continue to build and shape this category globally. And we achieved another year of significant margin expansion. In Medical Devices, MitraClip achieved sales of more than $250 million, and we further solidified our leadership position in the transcatheter mitral valve repair market with the acquisition of 10 dime [ph] and an option agreement to acquire valve technologies.
Along with MitraClip, these technologies position Abbott well to sustain our leadership position in this attractive segment of the market. In Medical Optics, we continue to launch a number of innovative products that are driving growth and share expansion, most notably in the premium lens segments. 
And in Diabetes Care, we introduced our revolutionary flash glucose monitor, Freestyle Libre, in several countries throughout Europe. Consumer response for this product continues to be very positive, and we recently expanded capacity to meet the growing demand. We also made progress during the year to bring the Libre technology to the U.S. with the regulatory submission for approval of Libre Pro, a professional use device June of last year.
Finally, in diagnostics, the combination of commercial execution, high-quality platforms and customer-focused solutions resulted in another year of above-market growth at cross both develop an emerging markets. This business also achieved another year of margin expansion while simultaneously investing in the development of next generation system platforms across all 3 of its segments, including the Core Lab, Molecular Diagnostics and Point of Care Diagnostics.
So we're entering 2016 with good underlying momentum. Our businesses are well aligned with favorable, long-term trends, including the continued expansion of health care and emerging economies. While there's been some softening in these economies on a macro basis, national policies focused on expanding access to care and favorable demographic trends are driving growth in health care that is outpacing overall economic growth in these markets. The fundamentals of the market and geographies where we compete remain strong, and we expect to deliver another year of strong double-digit underlying earnings growth in 2016.
However, a couple of items are impacting our growth outlook on an absolute basis, and you've heard this all week. Most notably, foreign a change. The rapid strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to several emerging market currencies beginning in the third quarter of last year means that foreign change will again be a growth headwind in 2016. We are now entering the fifth year of this dollar bull cycle. While we actively work to mitigate the impact of currency on our results, the impact of exchange on our bottom line will be more pronounced in 2016 due to the mix of currency movements and certain timing effects.
In preparing our 2016 forecast, we were mindful of finding the right balance between managing through these transitory currency dynamics in the near term while concurrently making the right choices and appropriate investments to drive sustainable, long-term growth.
The other notable impact to our 2016 outlook relates to Venezuela, which has been a good market for us for many years. As many of you know, market conditions in Venezuela have become more challenging, including high inflation, increasing price and margin controls, regulations on imports and slowing demand. As a result, our forecast assumes a significantly lower contribution from Venezuela operations in 2016. Brian will provide more specific details on the impacts of currency in Venezuela in a few minutes.
So for 2016, our adjusted diluted share guidance range of $2.10 to $2.20 reflects another year of strong double-digit underlying earnings growth offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange and the lower contrition from Venezuela that I just mentioned. In this environment, we remain focused on what we control, our commercial and operational execution, our innovations and our efforts to expand margins.
In Nutrition, our R&D organization continues to be highly productive and is now developing new products closer to our customers than ever before with the opening of several new R&D centers in Asia over the last several years. We expect continued growth and share expansion in China, Latin America and other priority markets, including another year of strong International Adult Nutrition growth. And while we've made great progress expanding margins in this business, margin improvement remains a key priority, and we continue to see opportunities for steady expansion going forward.
In Established Pharmaceuticals, our execution has improved significantly, and we're focused on strengthening our capabilities in key channels and geographies and building a well-recognized Abbott brand with consumers take a prominent role in making decisions about their health care. Internal development programs and local product acquisitions are driving a steady cadence of new products in our Established Pharma business to strengthen local portfolios. In 2015, our productivity of new product launches increased versus the previous year, and we expect another strong year of new product launch productivity in 2016.
In Medical Devices, we expect continued growth in share expense -- expansion in our cataract business, driven by the ongoing launch and market uptake of our premium intraocular lens products across multiple geographies. In Diabetes Care, we recently expanded capacity, as I mentioned, to meet the strong demand for FreeStyle Libre in Europe, and we expect to bring this technology into a number of new markets in 2016, targeting in the multi-billion global blood glucose monitoring market.
And in Vascular, we'll continue to drive optically MitraClip and expect to bring absorbed to new markets through the year. Finally, in Diagnostics, which remains one of our most consistent growth businesses. We'll continue to execute our commercial strategy to drive above-market growth in both developed and emerging markets. And as we progress through the year, we look forward to providing more specifics regarding our next generation diagnostic system's platforms as we get closer to launch.
Before turning it over to Brian, I'd like to comment briefly on capital allocation. You always asked me about that and you know that we take a very balanced approach here, which for us includes increasing our dividend, share repurchases and M&A activity. 
Last month, we announced an increase to our quarterly dividend, marking the 44th consecutive year we've increased our dividend. Abbott is only one of a handful -- one of only a handful of companies the delivered with such consistency. Share repurchases have and will continue to be part of our capital allocation mix. And lastly, while 2015 was relatively quiet for us on the M&A front, adding to our business with good M&A remains a key priority. We see a hundred opportunities and we'll continue active on this front. As always, we remain disciplined and focused on finding the right balance of strategic fit and measures of return that will benefit the long-term shareholder. I'm sure you're going to have a question for me later on that topic.
But overall, as you can see, cash flows remain strong. Margins remain strong. The underlying growth of our businesses remain strong. In summary, the fundamentals of the markets and geographies in which we compete all remain strong, and we continue to focus on what we can control. 
For 2016, the impact of foreign exchange and the Venezuela dynamics I mentioned earlier are offsetting double-digit underlying earnings growth. These impacts, while significant, are transitory in nature. And therefore, we remain focused on making the right decisions to drive long-term growth to our shareholders.
I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss 2015 results and the 2016 outlook in more detail. Brian?"

Today, we reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.62, in line with our previous guidance range. Sales for the quarter increased 4.9% on an operational basis, driven by strong performance in our Branded Generics, Diagnostics and Adult Nutrition businesses. The foreign sales declined 3.1%, including an unfavorable impact of 8% from foreign exchange. The negative impact from exchange was approximately 1.5 percentage points higher than previous expectations due to the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the quarter.
The fourth quarter adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.2% of sales, up 130 basis points over 2014, driven by continuing margin expansion in Diagnostics and Nutrition. In the quarter, adjusted SG&A expense was 29.6% of sales and adjusted R&D investment was 7% of sales, reflecting investments in the moment program across the businesses, including several next-generation diagnostics system platforms.
The fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was somewhat below our previous forecast, due to inclusion of the impact of U.S. tax legislation enacted in December. Overall, as we look at 2016, we achieved our financial objectives for the year despite a difficult environment, and we delivered strong underlying growth while continuing to make significant progress on our margin initiatives.
Turning to our 2016 outlook. Today, we issued guidance for adjusted diluted share of $2.10 to $2.20. While this forecast reflects another year of strong double-digit underlying earnings growth, foreign exchange and the Venezuela dynamics that Miles discussed are impacting our 2016 absolute growth outlook.
Let me take a moment to provide more detail on each of these items. As you know, in the third quarter of 2015, several emerging market currencies weakened rapidly relative to the U.S. dollar and have continued to steadily weakened since that time. Based on the geographic mix of currencies that weakened and the rapid pace at which these currencies decline, foreign exchange will be a greater offset to our underlying earnings growth in 2016 versus 2015. Additionally, in 2015, our hedging program served to mitigate some of the underlying foreign exchange exposure and volatilities. While our prior worm remains in place for 2016 and is anticipated to deliver some offsetting impact to our exposure, the benefit of our hedgings have naturally lessened over time.
So the fall-through from translational point changed, combined with these hedging dynamics, negatively impacts EPS growth in our guidance by a little more than 10% for the full year of 2016.
Lastly, as Miles mentioned, due to challenging market conditions in Venezuela, our 2016 forecast assumed a significantly lower contribution from Venezuelan operations. This impact lowers our 2016 sales growth rate by almost 2%. And excluding this impact, the mid-point of our 2016 guidance range would reflect adjusted diluted share growth in the mid single-digits, even with the more pronounced foreign exchange impact I discussed earlier. As of the year progresses, we'll provide any relevant updates in our business in Venezuela. 
I will now provide more specifics for our 2016 outlook. For the full year 2016, we forecast operational sales growth in the mid single-digits. Based on current exchange rates, wed expect the negative impact of around 4% on our full year reported sales, which would result in reported sales growth in the low single-digits for the full year 2016. Scott will provide more detail on the 2016 outlook by business in a few minutes. 
We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio around 57% of sales, reflecting the negative FX from exchange, partially offset by underlying gross margin improvement initiatives across our businesses. We forecast adjusted R&D investment of somewhat above 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 30.5% of sales for the full year. We forecast net interest expense of around $125 million, up over 2015, primarily due to higher U.S. interest rates and lower forecasted interest income certain countries. We forecast a loss of approximately $25 million on exchange gain loss line of P&L for the full year, and we forecast around $10 million of nonoperating expense for the full year 2016. We forecast adjusted tax rate of somewhat above 18.5% for the full year 2016, similar to 2015 and reflect any effect of the U.S. tax legislation enacted in December.
Before I review our first quarter outlook, I'd like to provide some context for our forecasted pattern of quarterly earnings growth in 2016. We forecast underlying adjusted EPS growth in the double digits for each quarter of 2016. However, in absolute terms, both foreign exchange and the Venezuela dynamics will have a more pronounced impact on our results in the first half of the year. We expect the pace of both sales and adjusted EPS growth to progressively accelerate throughout the year.
So for the first quarter, we forecast adjusted diluted share of $0.38 to $0.40, reflecting double-digit underlying growth, which is more than offset by the impact of foreign exchange and the lower contribution from Venezuela operations. We forecast operation sales growth in the low single-digits. And at current change rate, we expect a negative impact of exchange around 6%, resulting in a reported sales decline in the low single-digits.
The Venezuela dynamics that I discussed lowered our first quarter operational sales growth forecast by around 3 percentage points. We forecast that adjusted gross margin ratio approaching 57% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of somewhat above 7% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 34% of sales in the first quarter. And we forecast net interest expense of around $25 million in the first quarter. 
In summary, we achieved strong growth in 2015 despite the challenging environment. Our business has entered 2016 with good underlying momentum. And we continue to execute well on our margin expansion initiatives. Our underlying earnings growth forecast is to remain strong 2016, very similar to the underlying earnings growth we saw in 2015.
With that, I'll turn it over to Scott to review the business operating highlights and outlook. Scott?"

As I mentioned earlier, my comments will focus on operational sales growth. I'll start with Diagnostics, where sales increased 7% in the quarter. In Core Laboratory Diagnostics, international sales increased nearly 8%, driven by double-digit growth in emerging markets. And in the U.S, we continue to achieve above market performance with growth of more than 6%.
In Molecular Diagnostics, sales grew 3%, led by strong growth in our core focus area of infectious disease testing. As expected, U.S. sales were impacted by the brand scale down of our genetics business. And lastly, Point of Care Diagnostics, where sales increased nearly 9% in the quarter. U.S. and international growth were driven by continued market adoption of i-STAT, our handheld device, which provides critical information at the patient site, helping health care providers just the best treatment in the variety of care settings where minutes matter the most.
In 2016, we'll continue to leverage our best-in-class commercial model and provide customers with a full operating solutions to help them most efficiently operate their businesses while improving care. We expect global diagnostics sales to increase mid single-digits on an operational basis with growth in both the full year and first quarter of 2016. In Nutrition, global sales increased 5.5% in the quarter. Pediatric Nutrition sales increased approximately 4% and were led by continued market uptake of Eleva in China and Similac advanced non-GMO in the U.S.
As expected, International Pediatric Nutrition results were impacted by a difficult comparison versus the prior year, when sales increased more than 20% driven by market uptake of product launches in China and Southeast Asia. In Adult Nutrition, sales were led by 10% international growth, including double-digit operational growth in several Latin American countries. U.S. performance was led by growth of venture in the retail and institutional segments of the market.
In 2016, we'll continue to focus our efforts on cash flow share with locally relevant Pediatric Nutrition product and growing and shipping the Adult Nutrition category globally. For the full year 2016, we expect Global Nutrition sales to increase mid single-digits on an operational basis.
It's important to note that the Venezuela dynamics that Miles and Brian reviewed most significantly impact our forecasts from the Nutrition in Established Pharmaceuticals close. Excluding this impact, we forecast operational sales growth for our Global Nutrition business would be mid- to high single-digits for the full year of 2016.
For the first quarter, we're forecasting Global Nutrition sales to increase low- to mid single-digits on an operational basis. In Medical Devices, as expected, sales were relatively flat for the quarter. MitraClip, our first-in-class device for the treatment of mitral regurgitation, once again grew strong double-digits and Supera, our innovative endovascular stent, continued to perform well. This growth is mitigated by market dynamics in the coronary stent market.
In 2016, we'll continue to drive market uptake in MitraClip and Supera and expect to bring Absorb, our full developing stent to the U.S. market. For both the full year and first quarter of 2016, we expect global [indiscernible] sale to decline low single-digits on an operational basis. In Diabetes Care, sales growth was again driven by strong international sales of Freestyle Libre in Europe. In 2016, with our recently completed capacity expansion, we look forward to bringing this breakthrough technology to more consumers around the world.
For the full year 2016, we expect global diabetes sales to increase double digits on an operational basis. For the first quarter, we're forecasting global diabetes sales to increase mid single-digits on an operational basis.
In Medical Optics, global sales increased 2%, with strong performance in the cataract business, notably in the premium lens segment, was partially offset by dynamics in most proactive markets. In 2016, we'll continue to drive uptake of our innovative premium intraocular lenses, and we expect global Medical Optics sales to increase low- to mid single-digits on an operational basis for both the full year and first quarter of 2016.
And lastly, Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, our sales again increased double digits. Sales growth in the quarter was led by strong performance in several markets, including Russia, India and China. For the full year 2015, we believe sales was double-digit operationally with and without the impact of recent acquisitions. In 2016, we'll continue to broaden our portfolio with locally relevant new products will remain focused on successfully building our presence and scale in key countries of focus. For the full year 2016, we expect EPD sales to increase mid- to high single-digits on an operational basis.
As I mentioned earlier, Venezuela had a significant impact on our forecasted EPD growth rate. Excluding this impact, we would forecast operational sales growth for EPD in the low double-digits for the full year 2016. For the first quarter, we're forecasting EPD sales to increase mid single-digits on an operational basis, reflecting double-digit operational growth excluding the impact of Venezuela. 
In summary, we achieved another year of strong underlying sales and margin growth and are well-positioned to maintain that type of momentum for the full year 2016. We will now open the call for questions."

But I want to make it very clear that we're not changing our exchange rates assumptions for the country. This is really about what's happening to the markets, to economic activity of those markets and really, demand and ability to pay for products. Coal prices have hiked at the beginning of the year, it declined throughout the year and stock market became more challenging. And we, as Scott talked about and Brian talked about, significantly lower volume as we exited 2015. And as Miles indicated in his remarks, with price controls, very high inflation and this kind of -- when we look at the remainder of 2016 going forward, we see very challenging condition and much lower volumes in the country. So we're focused on supplying market, more focused on medical critical products. Our products are important to the market. But just the profitability of what we would expect for the year from that activity is a very low contribution compared to what we experienced largely in the first half of 2015. So that's kind of the situation. And I think it's basically -- it takes some volatility out of our forecast. But -- reality of the market we're dealing at."

If you go back to fourth quarter 2014, that is a period where we were launching our innovations, particularly Eleva and Juneteenth into the market. And as you know, Eleva has had great success in the portion of the markets that it's playing in. So there is a little bit of a tougher comparison fourth quarter '15 and '14. [ph] If you blend it out in China, though, on the average of initiation business grew over the midteens for the full year. And so that's more reflective of the performance for this business of the year and scale involved. We still have the momentum there. We still have financial for the opportunities at how we compete and how we'd been products to the rationale's. So nothing's changed about the momentum the continued in 2016."

And I as I said, the frustrating thing, and I think it's frustrating for a lot of multinational companies that are U.S -based since the underlying market dynamics remain strong a lot of places. everyone,",1366,"No. why don't we go back and paraphrase it for you. And I as I said, the frustrating thing, and I think it's frustrating for a lot of multinational companies that are U.S -based since the underlying market dynamics remain strong a lot of places. everyone, we get out we see [indiscernible] hands about China. But whether China, 7% or 6% growth, 6% is we're bigger than the rest of the world. It's a fundamentally strong market for us as our practically all of these emerging markets. Now the oil-based economy, so these are extremely dependent on oil as Venezuela. Okay, they're a different story. And the volatility and reliability and sustainable in the market there is different than just about anywhere in the world. So okay, there's an outlier. And every year, there's going to be some outliers somewhere. And I think if you're in a broad mix of currencies and a broad mix of countries and geographies with a multinational, somewhere, something is not going to be great. But the fundamentals of the markets, particular us in health care, our good. When you, translating that back to doing that us period, it's unusual. It's frustrating. I mean, none of us have seen this kind of oil price in a couple of decades. We've seen this kind of currency pile on in the wrong time. So okay, that said, every multinational CEO have said it in the last 2 weeks in earnings call, and we all see it while experiencing it. Now going back to your next question. Has my expectation of our underlying momentum changed? No. Has my priority changed in terms of M&A activity? I'll tell you one thing about it that's changed a little bit. We've been looking at top of these largely internationally. And I'd say, I'm probably balanced in that old bit back in another way. Now I don't think in the past, have looked pretty hard in a lot of expansion opportunities in branded generic pharmaceuticals. And I think there are opportunities there. But I think as you and others, what we watched those valuations over the last year, when deal heat turn. And I can tell you that there was one particular one that we were involved in an auction for. And the valuation that, that property went, we did not win it. But the valuation of that property [indiscernible] was not economic. I mean, just plain noneconomic. I would challenge the buyer to explain where the economic return was in that particular deal. And they obviously have their reasons and they obviously saw something the rest of us didn't appreciate. I would say is an understatement. But the valuation are in a level, in some cases, that you have to question prudence. And I think at the end of the day, while we've got strategic reasons we want to expand our footprint in different places, those valuations, when we deploy the capital on behalf of our shareholders have to make some sense. And I don't think that we are in a more -- I think we're pretty and. I think we're disciplined. I think we've made good deals in the past. I think -- you know what, I've gone to so much of this we're of that in beta much we didn't pay enough, we got to get deals, et cetera. But I think some of the things I saw last year said I don't think I minded losing that one, I don't think I minded not participating in that one. So I think, right now, first of all, I don't feel a lot that keeping offering up for sale in effect. And the old maximum, everything's for sale at some price. While the price of some of these things will be for sale is being prudent. It's just been prudent. So I think you have to step back and say, ""We're not in that zone. We're not going to be that irrational in some cases."" And that's me. I mean, I hate that I'm going to see some later, but I think that. So look at some of the currencies and some of the weakening of currencies, we would view a lot of those deals in local currency. In fact, almost all of them in local currency. And I'd say, based on where those currency rates are today, you would say it's time. This is the time because there's not as much currency risk in a purchasing that particular market, et cetera. But I think if I look at the mix of geographies and the mix of currencies and so forth that we currently have, I'm not sure our investors would applaud further weighting toward it just now. I mean, I think there's a time issue. I would tell you, having said that, there was a right opportunity and the right place and I believe that it was strategically very important to us or a real opportunity for our investors and that the balance of what we foresaw and the growth of that market, the position, the currency [indiscernible], but all lined up and the valuation. I'd probably do that deal. But that was a stack up of a lot of ifs right now. So let's say, what's changed? I'd say we are on looking and what I'm considering, it doesn't change. It's just shifted in some of its balance. I think that the -- I've got all the same sort of pharmaceutical opportunities on my radar screen, but I'm prioritizing some others now that are maybe more important, I think, in this market, this environment in terms of strengthening our businesses. Now I've heard other CEO say the same thing, I've heard a lot of people say -- actually, most of it I heard bankers say, that it's a very robust, everybody got they're trying to step on from other companies reporting. I do think there's that many things out there for people to consider in our spaces. I don't think there's that many properties, i don't think there's that many assets. I don't think there was that much to consolidate. So I think it's fairly predictable, particularly for an analyst in this space as you are, to predict the kind of people are going to be looking at. There's not a lot of out there to consider. So I think, for us, we know what our strategic priorities are. We know what can help our business. We're aware there's real pluses and opportunities. And the question is, whether or not the other parties, wherever they may be, see the same sort of opportunity, and we can come together on valuation to make something happen. And I know that sounds like textbook product to you, but that's really what it is. There's a lot of people at the dance looking at each other chatter and try to decide whether they want to dance. I don't think there's that many opportunities to be made in everybody the same environment where they think their own valuations are low and the valuations at last year that were kind of high. And I think you're in the zone where people are adjusting for what's my value. So having said all that, am I any less focused on it? No, I'm probably more focused on it, if anything. But I'd say, we're also pretty analytical about what we can do with the businesses and what's the right valuation and what's the right timing and so forth because we don't get stepped-up in deal heat. We're very strategic about it. And I know that a lot of people think that a lot happened last year and we should have been in the mix of it. But I didn't see anything go by that help particularly bad of not being in the mix in one particular one we were in the hunt on and the valuation at the end was so high, I don't mind missing it at all. So I realized that's a long answer for you, Mike, but that probably gives you a fair degree of insight into how I'm thinking about it. We're definitely not inactive, that's for sure."

But we're committed to our 4 major segments that we have in the company. One of the important things about those segments is that they're in relative in balance in terms of size, sales, comparability, et cetera. It got all in a good also are got a lot common. You think that EPD and Nutrition globally, they share a lot of channel dynamics and so forth, devices, diagnostics to them. There's a lot of different things going on. But I'd say first is balance matters and the mix that is the investment Company will company from investor because want to be reliable performance, steadily over time. And as you know, our proprietary Pharma business fabulously grew to a terrific size and based on one product in particular. And so we were out of balance as a company. And so we split in 2 companies. But we've got balance in these businesses. That said, I'd say, from an M&A perspective in the places where we're looking, to be perfectly fair, we're not looking to do anything with regard to M&A in our Nutrition business today. I mean, if something came along opportunistic, we look at anything. But the fact is, that business is -- that's and organic business for us. Our -- all of our performance objectives, and the things he wanted in the Nutrition business globally organically driven and we think one of the position for our likes. The kind of the investment will be making most businesses are more capital plan and, et cetera the right market for the world and managing supply chain and so forth. The other 3 businesses are each of different pale. Diagnostics, I'd say, we got a very strong business here. It's actually I diverse business. It's a lot of business segment to diagnostics. And if the opportunistically could add to it, we would. Obviously, if you look at helped to make sense but that's the business where we don't really have to. But if he had opportunities, we will. EPD, similar. We've got a gem of a business there. And having been done lot of things to shape that business in the last several years, we are in the right growth markets. We're in high growth markets. We're in markets where the profitability and the market developments, the retail facing, all the structural and channel dynamics for a brand of generics are good. We've identified like, let's say, in priority, 15 countries in particular to meet all our criteria. And we've got strong positions in most of those particularly important ones, and we're always looking to enhance our footprint in those markets if we can and expand our brands in those markets. Latin America was a good example of that. And so there's still many geographic opportunities to do so. But I would make the distinction for investors and others that it's really where we can distinctively differentiate branded generic Pharma cycles, which means retail in channel and so forth like India and other like Latin American countries and so forth. And so when we have those opportunities, it's great to add on. But what we've got is core business now is a very strong branded generic international, largely focused on emerging markets business, where there's tremendous tailwind of market growth. So that's another one that's opportunistic. And in devices, I'd say it's some of both. We look at that -- we've always want to strength in that business. We do want to strengthen that business. And a number ways of doing that. Obviously, there's organic in-house and then there's our control organization, where we're building a number of small companies, we're investing a number so forth and building our pipelines for the future. And then, finally, it's opportunistically, there's available opportunity where it fits our market segments and so forth, then there's always M&A. And so we're always mindful of those opportunities. It gives you a sense of how we think about each of those segments. As of said, when you think about something completely unrelated different, probably not. There's too many opportunities to build or strengthening the ones we have. And their needs from a strengthening standpoint, vary. Some have more need to have more breadth of product than others and some are purely opportunistic, Kristen."

But we otherwise have no reason to move one way or the other until there's some trigger, like M&A, I would guess. First, we probably beat that as a figure or 2, to be obvious."

Let me ask a specific question on your Vascular business because if you strip out currency, I think over the last 12 months, you've been going forward, most of the businesses are on track, at least performing in line with our expectation. But the Vascular business continues to come, at least relative to our expectations, continues to come in below. And I know you highlighted Absorb, but a lot of our channel checks are not very positive on Absorb. So I guess, my question is, what's the commitment to this Vascular business? Is this a business that you need to build up through M&A? And the reason why we haven't seen a lot of M&A, is it because of the target have still unrealistic valuations?"

First of all, we are committed to the business. And I think there is bigger market conditions there. If we look at the markets around the world, much as the U.S. that literally, every nature country in the world. The markets have stabilized among competitors. Share doesn't move a lot. Like it doesn't move a little. The physicians in this space, they take a new product and they experiment with it a little bit. And that's about it. I mean, the innovation here is at a point where I'd say the incremental value recognized by the health care system is limited. If you think about what drug called stents and so forth have done in the vascular space, we've been a tremendous boom to the treatment of patients. But I think now, what we see is this market is far more driven by cost and prices in either countries or in hospital groups and others try to manage several costs in health care. So I think all of this see the same dynamics where we're increasingly challenged on more value proposition and just innovation. And I think increasingly the payer, whether it's a government or the purchasing people or share, whatever it is, or increasingly more influential here than the preference of physicians. You see it's a little greater dynamic. Well, they're not bad dynamics, either. We have to compete in this business just like we compete in a lot of our other businesses. And I think we and our competitors in this business are all broadening our product lines, are innovating in other surrounding spaces and broadening those offerings in this space. And there's still a lot of room for innovation, but it may not be specifically just on the steps. So that -- who's our [indiscernible] to expand our business? And to some degree or to a large degree, that is M&A. And in our case, it's been a lot of small volume M&A and looking to expand around this business, MitraClip, Absorb, kind of things, committal all MitraClip sickened that way. We look at expanding into structural quarter failure or other categories. And were trying to build our breadth those other -- let's say, surrounding spaces that way. I don't think that's very different in for any of the core base in this business worldwide. I think what's been difficult for any market that have the kind of robust innovation that have been this one did back in the early thousands. It's a different market today. It's a different market that we're in today. So is it a slow growth market? Yes. Is It still a very attractive market? Yes. It's still a very profitable market for our participants. And I tried a lot of different pressure from a cost standpoint from the payers, et cetera. I don't think that's a secret to anybody. So will others look at the performance of the business and say, ""Geez, it's a little below our expectations."" I'm beginning to think its just a robust adjusting our expectations to some of the reality of the value propositions in the market today. So I think the very strong business, it's a very healthy one, these in that respect, we still invest quite substantially in R&D and innovations there and clinical trials and so forth. Got innovations that are in R&D and in the clinical space. And a lot of investments around it. So would it benefit from a much broader footprint? Well, it probably would. The question is, how to get to that broader. And I think in the, you call it, medical device space broadly defined today, there's either a bunch of big companies or a bunch of little companies. There's not much in the middle. In a couple of things in the middle are extremely highly value relative to their current performance. And I think there's a lot of speculation, question about whether or not that kind of value would play out. So I think little time. We've made a lot of investments in smaller companies and segments, as you know, whether it's [indiscernible] or Sepia or others to expand our footprints here. So I think -- I believe in medical device space right now and long-term, but I don't think it'll be the same kind of space. It was 10, 15 years ago."

Last year, exchange was a strong headwind for any U.S -based multinational across the board. And I would recall at this very time last year from December to now, during the call, both oil and exchange kind of sort had a sudden sink except the oil price dropped at that point, was a very high, much higher lever that we are today. But there was a sudden hit. And so of late fourth quarter '14 and then early '15, and everybody scrambled to readjust their EPS guidance for the year to try to deal with what they saw coming as currency that was already happening. And a lot of companies dialed back to single digit or whatever and later on exchange and so forth, which was valid. In our case, we said, we think we can navigate through it, and we did. And we had extremely strong underlying growth of -- in our markets, as we still do. And it wasn't just double digits, it's been healthy double-digit all year long. And so in our case, we were able to mitigate an awful lot of that exchange all year long and still deliver what was frankly very differentiated, higher growth than many, many of our peers, even multinational peers not in health care. And what we've got now is another year on top of that, okay, of the same sort of thing. And if you look at these exchange rate grass, who would have thought these change rates good, in a lot of cases, be even bigger, even bigger change rates the call we want to go. And then on top of that, notably printed $25 to $30 oil. Now that's the curveball for the whole world. And so when throw that curveball in there, it dramatically unbalances the mix of your currencies because of the oil-based economies where lower oil prices really affect the underlying performance of the country. So you take a country like Russia or Venezuela or Saudi Arabia, now these are countries that are all strong countries for us. And to different degrees, they're impacted by their own oil revenue and therefore, their own ability to pay for products. Now having said that, is Russia still a strong market for us? It is. Do we have the same kind of difficulties in Russia that we had in Venezuela? We don't. It is a fundamentally good market, strong underlying market, et cetera. The only thing that's not strong is the ruble, which is dramatically weaker versus the dollar than even a year ago. And so there's this disproportionate imbalance in the currency basket, if you will, from a little handful of countries, where they already had currency translation challenges just like the rest of the world, except that they have oil dependence on top of it, which amplifies it even more. And when you start a stack up, all of those things you'd say, okay, could we navigate through this? And the answer is we could. I can cut a lot of expenses. I can delay a lot of investments. There's a lot of things that, frankly, I have discretion to do. We as a company has the discretion to do. And I could then say to you, real leader have 5% earnings growth or high single-digit earnings growth. But in our judgment, this year is so unusual this way with the ongoing depth of currency roles and the unusual circumstance of oil prices and its impact of these economies so that I would be best and say, I don't think its prudent to compromise our ability to delay all these underlying growth for 1 year. In fact, it's more prudent to take out Venezuela out of the assumptions. It's more prudent to take that one out and keep right on going. And I think if you believe in the underlying strength of economies around the world, the ones that are delivering growth, and if you believe in the underlying growth of health care and those economies, and you believe in the underlying growth of all our products and Abbott, and if you believe in Abbott's ability to continue taxes all that growth, then my judgment was, okay, going to roll out my pocket here. Venezuela has the assumptions. I mean, if I didn't taking Venezuela out of the assumptions, I'd be telling you right now that you're going to have mid single-digit growth on the top and bottom line. And something, you think that was terrific in this environment. And if you compare to all of the other multinationals in our praise were factly multinationals you know that's right in everybody else. So in this case, I don't want to artificially compromise our investments. A lot of this businesses, whether it's in addition a investment or R&D or whatever, because of Venezuela. So I think I'm going to take that one out and keep right on going because I believe in the longer-term growth prospects of these economies and these businesses, and I'm not going to compromise of that for a couple of quarters in Venezuela. So at the end of the day, could we manage to it? Yes. And you know this, if you look back at even 10 years in fact, with or without it, we've absolutely been reliable a double-digit bottom line and high single top line unlike almost any other large, diverse multinational out there. Know we've been very reliable perform and that they have very diverse [indiscernible]. So I don't see all that defense than those [indiscernible] a look on the right and say, this is like a total different circumstance than any of us ever seen. That's to make adjustment on how far to push off what we ought to be doing to sort of laid off this oddball storm we're in. And this oddball storm, I don't know -- I think there's a lot of people that project oil prices are going to stay down for a long time. And I mean, everyone -- what is down? And what points of these old driven economy start performing better? $60, $70, $50, there's different thresholds where the performance are going to be changed dramatically for a lot of different businesses in the world not just us. When our case, health care is pretty good momentum what the oil price is. The dynamics of the Venezuela our unique. They're unique. When even in Saudi, they still spin on the health care? Yes, they do. Still a very strong, important market for us and so is Russia and so on plotter know that's a long roundabout way of saying, we're here to deliberate decision it was discretionary. Could I have made a decision to say, I'm going to deliver high single-digit earnings growth no matter what? Yes, probably. But I wouldn't have to compromise the underlying momentum in ways I didn't think is prudent. For exchange, yes, we can manage exchange. But as well, [indiscernible] out of the mix. In terms of what her expectations are. And that's an initial amount. I mean, I challenge to that. In 2015, we look through exchange. Can we look through exchange again? Yes, we can. Yes, we can provide the single biggest difference is our guidance of this year is actually Venezuela. I don't know if that answers your question enough. But that was my judgment. It's not an inability. It's more of a decision. If you look at our spending rates and stuff in our go forward guidance, our spending rates are healthy."

You could be dead right about Venezuela, I don't know. I don't know. But here's the difference for us. We're a health care company. And among our businesses there, our product so that are medically necessary. And we have to pay attention to medically necessary. We don't have to lose money all the time. We're don't have to -- we don't have to be irrational for whatever reason. But we're mindful that we are a health care company. We are mindful that we have medically necessary products, mindful that we have been, in Latin America and in Venezuela for decades. And a lot of times in the past, in decades, foreign companies has exited those countries immediately when the economics turn sour. And the long-term commitment to that continent, the governments of those countries and the health care systems to those countries, they know that and they recognize that. Abbott has never done that in 90 years in Latin America. And we are a fundamentally large health care provider in Latin America. So our judgment was to make these decisions one step at a time as we see how circumstances develop. It's a pretty good decision that we think and just to say, we're going to take the sales and profit expectations out of our expectations for the year so that our investors -- frankly, you're getting  the newest that we're taking it out of our expectations, right? And yet, all on trying to do is be risk your expectation, do you risk your -- whiting the roller coaster volatility here in the particular country because that one's  unique. And so we've just chosen to take it out of the estimates because we know we're going to continue to have medically necessary products there. But that's going to be in our view, at a much lower commercial level than in the past. So right now, I think that's the right, prudent place to be for that change, I suppose, anything's changed. I hope it changes favorably more frankly. I just know that we are in a very tough circumstance as a country. They're volatile. They are predictable, and it's not a very liable market us markets grow. So I think this is the right step. You can see, local certainly just go a lot further. And you could succumb you can say that if you were just, industrial consumer. But would but I don't think the self care company even quite be the same thing because I don't I think we have to be a little bit put in here about the messes that's why we're where we are.

Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2016. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to the risk and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.
Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2014. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. Please note that fourth quarter financial results and guidance provided on today's call for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only.
On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which will be available on our website at abbott.com. Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange, unless otherwise noted.

In Established Pharmaceuticals, we completed the sale of our developed markets business and successfully integrated CFR Pharmaceuticals in Latin America and Veropharm in Russia. The integration of CFR provides the scale, manufacturing and portfolio breadth to establish Abbott as a top 10 branded generics company in Latin American and actually #1 in many of the markets in Latin America.
And Veropharm had a similar impact in Russia, positioning Abbott among the top branded generics companies in this key market. We also made significant progress improving our commercial execution, expanding our local product portfolios and driving awareness of our Abbott brand with patients, physicians and pharmacists.
In Nutrition, we achieved double-digit growth in share expansion in China with a portfolio of pediatric nutrition products that are customized to meet local preferences. In the U.S., we expanded our product offering in the tolerance and updates categories with the portfolio of non-GMO products, providing parents with additional formula choices.
Our International Adult Nutrition business achieved another year of strong growth, as we continue to build and shape this category globally. And we achieved another year of significant margin expansion. In Medical Devices, MitraClip achieved sales of more than $250 million, and we further solidified our leadership position in the transcatheter mitral valve repair market with the acquisition of Tendyne and an option agreement to acquire Cephea Valve Technologies.
Along with MitraClip, these technologies position Abbott well to sustain our leadership position in this attractive segment of the market. In Medical Optics, we continue to launch a number of innovative products that are driving growth and share expansion, most notably in the premium lens segments.
And in Diabetes Care, we introduced our revolutionary flash glucose monitor, Freestyle Libre, in several countries throughout Europe. Consumer response for this product continues to be very positive, and we recently expanded capacity to meet the growing demand. We also made progress during the year to bring the Libre technology to the U.S. with the regulatory submission for approval of Libre Pro, a professional-use device, in June of last year.
And finally, in diagnostics, the combination of commercial execution, high-quality platforms and customer-focused solutions resulted in another year of above-market growth across both developed and emerging markets. This business also achieved another year of margin expansion while simultaneously investing in the development of next generation system platforms across all 3 of its segments, including the Core Lab, Molecular Diagnostics and Point of Care Diagnostics.
So we're entering 2016 with good underlying momentum. Our businesses are well aligned with favorable, long-term trends, including the continued expansion of health care and emerging economies. While there's been some softening in these economies on a macro basis. National policies focused on expanding access to care and favorable demographic trends are driving growth in health care that is outpacing overall economic growth in these markets. The fundamentals of the market and geographies where we compete remain strong, and we expect to deliver another year of strong double-digit underlying earnings growth in 2016.
However, a couple of items are impacting our growth outlook on an absolute basis, and you've heard this all week; most notably, foreign exchange. The rapid strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to several emerging market currencies beginning in the third quarter of last year means that foreign exchange will again be a growth headwind in 2016. We are now entering the fifth year of this dollar bull cycle. While we actively work to mitigate the impact of currency on our results, the impact of exchange on our bottom line will be more pronounced in 2016 due to the mix of currency movements and certain timing effects.
In preparing our 2016 forecast, we were mindful of finding the right balance between managing through these transitory currency dynamics in the near term, while concurrently making the right choices and appropriate investments, to drive sustainable long-term growth.
The other notable impact to our 2016 outlook relates to Venezuela, which has been a good market for us for many years. As many of you know, market conditions in Venezuela have become more challenging, including high inflation, increasing price and margin controls, regulations on imports and slowing demand. As a result, our forecast assumes a significantly lower contribution from Venezuela operations in 2016. Brian will provide more specific details on the impacts of currency in Venezuela in a few minutes.
So for 2016, our adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $2.10 to $2.20 reflects another year of strong double-digit underlying earnings growth offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange and the lower contribution from Venezuela that I just mentioned. In this environment, we remain focused on what we control, our commercial and operational execution, our innovations and our efforts to expand margins.
In Nutrition, our R&D organization continues to be highly productive and is now developing new products closer to our customers than ever before with the opening of several new R&D centers in Asia over the last several years. We expect continued growth and share expansion in China, Latin America and other priority markets, including another year of strong International Adult Nutrition growth. And while we've made great progress expanding margins in this business, margin improvement remains a key priority, and we continue to see opportunities for steady expansion going forward.
In Established Pharmaceuticals, our execution has improved significantly, and we're focused on strengthening our capabilities in key channels and geographies and building a well-recognized Abbott brand with consumers take a prominent role in making decisions about their health care. Internal development programs and local product acquisitions are driving a steady cadence of new products in our Established Pharma business to strengthen local portfolios. In 2015, our productivity of new product launches increased versus the previous year, and we expect another strong year of new product launch productivity in 2016.
In Medical Devices, we expect continued growth in share expense -- expansion in our cataract business, driven by the ongoing launch and market uptake of our premium intraocular lens products across multiple geographies.
In Diabetes Care, we recently expanded capacity, as I mentioned, to meet the strong demand for FreeStyle Libre in Europe, and we expect to bring this technology into a number of new markets in 2016, targeting in the multi-billion dollar global blood glucose monitoring market.
And in Vascular, we'll continue to drive uptick of MitraClip and expect to bring absorbed to new markets through the year.
Finally, in Diagnostics, which remains one of our most consistent growth businesses. We'll continue to execute our commercial strategy to drive above-market growth in both developed and emerging markets. And as we progress through the year, we look forward to providing more specifics regarding our next generation diagnostic system's platforms as we get closer to launch.
Before turning it over to Brian, I'd like to comment briefly on capital allocation. You always asked me about that and you know that we take a very balanced approach here, which for us includes increasing our dividend, share repurchases and M&A activity.
Last month, we announced an increase to our quarterly dividend, marking the 44th consecutive year we've increased our dividend. Abbott's only one of a handful -- one of only a handful of companies to deliver with such consistency. Share repurchases have and will continue to be part of our capital allocation mix. And lastly, while 2015 was relatively quiet for us on the M&A front, adding to our business with good M&A remains a key priority. We see a hundred opportunities and we'll continue to remain active on this front. As always, we remain disciplined and focused on finding the right balance of strategic fit and measures of return that will benefit the long-term shareholder. I'm sure you're going to have a question for me later on that topic.
But overall, as you can see, cash flows remain strong; margins remain strong; the underlying growth of our businesses remain strong. In summary, the fundamentals of the markets and geographies in which we compete all remain strong, and we continue to focus on what we can control.
For 2016, the impact of foreign exchange and the Venezuela dynamics I mentioned earlier are offsetting double-digit underlying earnings growth. These impacts, while significant, are transitory in nature. And therefore, we remain focused on making the right decisions to drive long-term growth to our shareholders.
I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss 2015 results and the 2016 outlook in more detail. Brian?"
247483,321571928,922641,"Abbott Laboratories, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Abbott Laboratories","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Miles. Today, we reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.62, in line with our previous guidance range. Sales for the quarter increased 4.9% on an operational basis, driven by strong performance in",997,"Okay. Thanks, Miles. Today, we reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.62, in line with our previous guidance range. Sales for the quarter increased 4.9% on an operational basis, driven by strong performance in our branded generics, Diagnostics and Adult Nutrition businesses. Reported sales declined 3.1% in the quarter, including an unfavorable impact of 8% from foreign exchange. The negative impact from exchange was approximately 1.5 percentage points higher than previous expectations, due to the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the quarter.
The fourth quarter adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.2% of sales, up 130 basis points over 2014, driven by continuing margin expansion in Diagnostics and Nutrition. In the quarter, adjusted SG&A expense was 29.6% of sales and adjusted R&D investment was 7% of sales, reflecting investments in development program across the businesses, including several next-generation diagnostic system platforms.
The fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was somewhat below our previous forecast, due to inclusion of the impact of U.S. tax legislation enacted in December. Overall, as we look at 2015, we achieved our financial objectives for the year despite a difficult environment, and we delivered strong underlying growth while continuing to make significant progress on our margin initiatives.
Turning to our 2016 outlook. Today, we issued guidance for adjusted earnings per share of $2.10 to $2.20. While this forecast reflects another year of strong double-digit underlying earnings growth, foreign exchange and the Venezuela dynamics that Miles discussed are impacting our 2016 absolute growth outlook.
Let me take a moment to provide more detail on each of these items. As you know, in the third quarter of 2015, several emerging market currencies weakened rapidly relative to the U.S. dollar and have continued to steadily weaken since that time. Based on the geographic mix of currencies that weakened and the rapid pace at which these currencies decline, foreign exchange will be a greater offset to our underlying earnings growth in 2016 versus 2015. Additionally, in 2015, our hedging program served to mitigate some of the underlying foreign exchange exposure and volatility. While our program remains in place for 2016 and is anticipated to deliver some offsetting impact to our exposure, the benefit of our hedges have naturally lessened over time.
So the fall-through from translational foreign exchange, combined with these hedging dynamics, negatively impacts EPS growth in our guidance by a little more than 10% for the full year 2016.
Lastly, as Miles mentioned, due to challenging market conditions in Venezuela, our 2016 forecast assumed a significantly lower contribution from Venezuelan operations. This impact lowers our 2016 sales growth rate by almost 2%. And excluding this impact, the mid-point of our 2016 guidance range would reflect adjusted diluted share growth in the mid-single digits, even with the more pronounced foreign exchange impact I discussed earlier. As the year progresses, we'll provide any relevant updates on our business in Venezuela.
I will now provide more specifics for our 2016 outlook. For the full year 2016, we forecast operational sales growth in the mid-single digits. Based on current exchange rates, we'd expect a negative impact of around 4% on our full year reported sales, which would result in reported sales growth in the low single digits for the full year 2016. Scott will provide more detail on the 2016 outlook by business in a few minutes.
We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio around 57% of sales, reflecting the negative impact from exchange, but partially offset by underlying gross margin improvement initiatives across our businesses. We forecast adjusted R&D investment of somewhat above 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 30.5% of sales for the full year. We forecast net interest expense of around $125 million, up over 2015, primarily due to higher U.S. interest rates and lower forecasted interest income in certain countries. We forecast a loss of approximately $25 million on exchange gain loss line of P&L for the full year, and we forecast around $10 million of nonoperating expense for the full year 2016. We forecast adjusted tax rate of somewhat above 18.5% for the full year 2016, similar to 2015, and reflect any effect of the U.S. tax legislation enacted in December.
Before I review our first quarter outlook, I'd like to provide some context for our forecasted pattern of quarterly earnings growth in 2016. We forecast underlying adjusted EPS growth in the double digits for each quarter of 2016. However, in absolute terms, both foreign exchange and the Venezuela dynamics will have a more pronounced impact on our results in the first half of the year. We expect the pace of both sales and adjusted EPS growth to progressively accelerate throughout the year.
So for the first quarter, we forecast adjusted earnings per share of $0.38 to $0.40, reflecting double-digit underlying growth, which is more than offset by the impact of foreign exchange and the lower contribution from Venezuela operations. We forecast operation sales growth in the low single digits. And at current exchange rate, we'd expect a negative impact of exchange around 6%, resulting in a reported sales decline in the low single digits.
The Venezuela dynamics that I discussed lowered our first quarter operational sales growth forecast by around 3 percentage points. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio approaching 57% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of somewhat above 7% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 34% of sales in the first quarter. And we forecast net interest expense of around $25 million in the first quarter.
In summary, we achieved strong growth in 2015 despite a challenging environment. Our business has entered 2016 with good underlying momentum. And we continue to execute well on our margin expansion initiatives. Our underlying earnings growth forecast is to remain strong in 2016, very similar to the underlying earnings growth we saw in 2015.
With that, I'll turn it over to Scott to review the business operating highlights and outlook. Scott?"

As I mentioned earlier, my comments will focus on operational sales growth. I'll start with Diagnostics, where sales increased 7% in the quarter. In Core Laboratory Diagnostics, international sales increased nearly 8%, driven by double-digit growth in emerging markets. And in the U.S, we continued to achieve above-market performance with growth of more than 6%.
In Molecular Diagnostics, sales grew 3%, led by strong growth in our core focus area of infectious disease testing. As expected, U.S. sales were impacted by the planned scale down of our genetics business. And lastly, Point of Care Diagnostics, where sales increased nearly 9% in the quarter. U.S. and international growth were driven by continued market adoption of i-STAT, our handheld device, which provides critical information at the patient's side, helping health care providers choose the best treatment in a variety of care settings when minutes matter the most.
In 2016, we'll continue to leverage our best-in-class commercial model and provide customers with a full offering of solutions, to help them most efficiently operate their businesses while improving care. We expect global diagnostics sales to increase mid-single digits on an operational basis with growth in both the full year and first quarter of 2016. In Nutrition, global sales increased 5.5% in the quarter. Pediatric Nutrition sales increased approximately 4% and were led by continued market uptake of Eleva in China and Similac advanced non-GMO in the U.S.
As expected, International Pediatric Nutrition results were impacted by a difficult comparison versus the prior year, when sales increased more than 20% driven by market uptake of product launches in China and Southeast Asia. In Adult Nutrition, sales were led by 10% international growth, including double-digit operational growth in several Latin American countries. U.S. performance was led by growth of venture in the retail and institutional segments of the market.
In 2016, we'll continue to focus our efforts on catering share with locally relevant Pediatric Nutrition product and growing and shaping the Adult Nutrition category, globally. For the full year 2016, we expect Global Nutrition sales to increase mid-single digits on an operational basis.
It's important to note that the Venezuela dynamics that Miles and Brian reviewed most significantly impact our forecasts from Nutrition and Established Pharmaceuticals. Excluding this impact, we forecast operational sales growth for our Global Nutrition business would be mid- to high single digits for the full year 2016.
For the first quarter, we're forecasting Global Nutrition sales to increase low to mid-single digits on an operational basis. In Medical Devices, as expected, Vascular sales were relatively flat for the quarter. MitraClip, our first-in-class device for the treatment of mitral regurgitation, once again grew strong double-digits; and Supera, our innovative endovascular stent, continued to perform well. This growth is mitigated by market dynamics in the coronary stent market.
In 2016, we'll continue to drive market uptake in MitraClip and Supera and expect to bring Absorb, our fully dissolving stent to the U.S. market. For both the full year and first quarter of 2016, we expect global VAT per sale to decline low single digits on an operational basis.
In Diabetes Care, sales growth was again driven by strong international sales of Freestyle Libre in Europe. In 2016, with our recently completed capacity expansion, we look forward to bringing this breakthrough technology to more consumers around the world.
For the full year 2016, we expect global diabetes sales to increase double digits on an operational basis. For the first quarter, we're forecasting global diabetes sales to increase mid-single digit on an operational basis.
In Medical Optics, global sales increased 2%, with strong performance in the cataract business, notably in the premium lens segment, was partially offset by dynamics in most proactive markets. In 2016, we'll continue to drive uptake of our innovative premium intraocular lenses, and we expect global Medical Optics sales to increase low to mid-single digits on an operational basis for both the full year and first quarter of 2016.
And lastly, Established Pharmaceuticals or EPD, where sales again increased double digits. Sales growth in the quarter was led by strong performance in several markets, including Russia, India and China. For the full year 2015, EPD sales was double-digit operationally with and without the impact of recent acquisitions. In 2016, we'll continue to broaden our portfolio with locally relevant new products, we'll remain focused on successfully building our presence and scale in key countries of focus. For the full year 2016, we expect EPD sales to increase mid- to high single digits on an operational basis.
As I mentioned earlier, Venezuela had a significant impact on our forecasted EPD growth rate. Excluding this impact, we would forecast operational sales growth for EPD in the low double-digits for the full year 2016. For the first quarter, we're forecasting EPD sales to increase mid-single digits on an operational basis, reflecting double-digit operational growth excluding the impact of Venezuela.
In summary, we achieved another year of strong underlying sales and margin growth and are well positioned to maintain that type of momentum for the full year 2016. We will now open the call for questions."

The oil prices were highest at the beginning of the year, it declined throughout the year and the stock markets became more challenging. And we'd talk -- as Scott talked about and Brian talked about, significantly lower volume as we exited 2015; and as Miles indicated in his remarks with price controls and very high inflation and this kind of -- when we look at the remainder of 2016 going forward, we see very challenging conditions and much lower volumes in the country. So we're focused on supplying the market, more focused on medically critical products. Our products are important to the market. But just the profitability of what we would expect for the year from that activity is a very low contribution compared to what we experienced largely in the first half of 2015. So that's kind of the situation. And I think it's basically -- it takes some volatility out of our forecast, but there's likes of the reality of the market we're dealing in."

And as you know, Eleva has had great success in the portion of the markets that it's playing in. So there is a little bit of a tougher comparison fourth quarter '15 and '14. If you blend it out in China, though, on the average Nutrition business grew over the mid-teens for the full year. And so that's more reflective of the performance for this business of the year and still ongoing. We still have the momentum there. We still have financial further opportunities of how we compete and how we've been [indiscernible] to the various channels there.

And as I said, the frustrating thing, and I think it's frustrating for a lot of multinational companies that are U.S -based is the underlying market dynamics remain strong in a lot of places. I mean, every morning we get up, we see [indiscernible] about China. But whether China is 7% growth or 6% growth, 6% is way bigger than the rest of the world. It's a fundamentally strong market for us as are profitably all of these emerging markets. Now the oil-based economy, the ones that are extremely dependent on oil, take Venezuela -- okay, they're a different story. And -- the volatility, unreliability and sustainable in the market there is different than just about anywhere in the world. So okay, there's an outlier. And every year, there's going to be some outliers somewhere. And I think if you're in a broad mix of currencies and a broad mix of countries and geographies as a multinational, somewhere, something is not going to be great. But the fundamentals of the markets, particularly for us in health care, are good. And yet translating that back during this period, it's unusual, it's frustrating. I mean, none of us have seen this kind of oil price in a couple of decades and obviously have seen this kind of currency pile on in a wrong time. So -- okay, that said, we are no [indiscernible] Every multinational CEO has said in the last 2 weeks in his earnings call, and we all see it while experiencing it. Now going back to your next question. Has my expectation of our underlying momentum changed? No. Has my priority changed in terms of M&A activity? I'll tell you one thing about it that it's changed a little bit. We've been looking at top of these largely, internationally. And I'd say, I'm probably balancing that a bit back in another way. Now I don't think in the past, I have looked pretty hard in a lot of expansion opportunities in branded generic pharmaceuticals. And I think there are opportunities there. But I think as you and others, what we watched those valuations over the last year, when deal heat turned -- and I can tell you that there was one particular one that we were involved in an auction for, and the valuation that, that property went for, we did not win it. But the valuation of that property went for was noneconomic. I mean, just plain noneconomic. I would challenge the buyer to explain where the economic return was in that particular deal. And they obviously have their reasons and they obviously saw something the rest of us didn't appreciate, I would say as an understatement. But the valuation are at a level in some cases, that you have to question prudence. And I think at the end of the day, while we've got strategic reasons we want to expand our footprint in different places, those valuations when we deploy the capital on behalf of our shareholders have to make some sense. And I don't think that we are anymore -- I think we're prudent. I think we're disciplined. I think we've made good deals in the past. I think -- I've gone through so much of this, where I've heard we are paying too much, we didn't pay enough, we got a good deal, et cetera. But I think some of things I saw last year said, ""Boy, I don't think I minded losing that one. I don't think I minded not participating in that one."" So I think, right now -- first of all, I don't feel a lot that people are offering up for sale in effect. And the old maximum [indiscernible] everything's for sale at some price. While the price that some of these things will be for sale at is imprudent, it's just imprudent. So I think you have to step back and say, ""We're not in that zone. We're not going to be that irrational in some cases."" And that's me. I mean, I hate them, I'm going to see some of this in print later, but I think that. So you look at some of the currencies and some of the weakening of currencies, we would do a lot of those deals in local currency; in fact, almost all of them in local currency. And I'd say, based on where those currency rates are today, you would say it's time. This is the time because there's not as much currency risk purchasing in that particular market, et cetera. But I think if I look at the mix of geographies and the mix of currencies and so forth that we currently have, I'm not sure our investors would applaud further waiting toward it just now. I mean, I think there's a timely issue. I would tell you, having said that, if there was a right opportunity in the right place and I believe that it was strategically very important to us or a real opportunity for our investors and that the balance of what we foresaw in the growth of that market, the position, their currency and so forth, but all lined up and the valuation looked good, I'd probably do that deal. But that was a stack up of a lot of ifs, right now. So let's say, what's changed? I'd say we are onlooking and what I'm considering, it hasn't change. It's just shifted in some of its balance. I think it -- I've got all the same sort of pharmaceutical opportunities on my radar screen, but I'm prioritizing some others now that are maybe more important, I think, in this market, this environment in terms of strengthening our businesses. Now I've heard other CEO say the same thing, I've heard a lot of people say -- actually, mostly I heard bankers say, that it's a very robust, everybody's is out there trying to buy [indiscernible] market and that's what most bankers and from other companies are reporting. I don't think there's that many things out there for people to consider in our spaces. I don't think there's that many properties. I don't think there's that many assets. I don't think there's that much to consolidate. So I think it's fairly predictable, particularly for an analyst in this space, as you are, to predict the kind of things that people are going to be looking at. There's not a lot out there to consider. So I think, for us, we know what our strategic priorities are. We know what can help our business. We're aware there's real pluses and opportunities. And the question is, whether or not the other parties, whoever they may be, see the same sort of opportunity, and we can come together on an overlap of valuation to make something happen. And I know that sounds like textbook product to you, but that's really what it is. There's a lot of people at the dance looking at each other and trying to decide whether they want to dance. But I don't think there's that many opportunities to be made and everybody is in the same environment where they think their own valuations are low and the valuations from last year that were kind of high, and I think you're in a zone where people are adjusting for what's my value. And so having said all that, am I any less focused on it? No, I'm probably more focused on it, if anything. But I'd say, we're also pretty analytical about what we can do with the businesses and what's the right valuation and what's the right timing and so forth, because we don't get stepped-up in deal heat. We're very strategic about it. And I know that a lot of people think that a lot happened last year and we should have been in the mix of it. But I didn't see anything go by that I felt particularly bad about not being in the mix of it. As I mentioned, there's one particular one we were in the hunt on and the valuation at the end was so high, I don't mind missing it at all. So I realize that's a long ramble for you, Mike, but that probably gives you a fair degree of insight into how I'm thinking about it. We're definitely not inactive, that's for sure."

Has the way that you've looked at the mix of Abbott from that perspective changed over the last kind of year or so, really since the spin of AbbVie? And if I look at the growth rates for this year, Medical Devices, the growth operationally was 1.5. If that division were to be separated out, I just look at Abbott, it would be even stronger as a company. And how do you think about that franchise and strengthening it or just kind of the composition of Abbott today and the future?"

But we're committed to all 4 major segments that we have in the company. One of the important things about those segments is that they're in relative balance",752,"Boy, I think if I'd start with, that would be all about strengthening rather than separating out. But we're committed to all 4 major segments that we have in the company. One of the important things about those segments is that they're in relative balance in terms of size, sales, profitability, et cetera. They've all got somewhat different dynamics and they've also got a lot in common. If you take EPD and Nutrition, globally, they share a lot of channel dynamics and so forth, in devices and diagnostics to them. There's a lot of different things going on with these businesses, but I'd say first is balance matters and the mix that is the investment identity in a company for investor. Because you want to be a reliable performer steadily over time. And as you know, our proprietary Pharma business fabulously grew to a terrific size and based on one product in particular. And so we were out of balance as a company and so we split into 2 companies. But we've got balance in these businesses. That said, I'd say, from an M&A perspective in the places where we're looking, to be perfectly fair, we're not looking to do anything with regard to M&A in our Nutrition business today. I mean, if something came along opportunistically, we'd look at anything. But the fact is, that business is -- that's an organic business for us. Our -- all of our performance objectives and the things we want to do in the Nutrition business globally are organically driven and we think one of the position for our likes. The kind of the investments that we make in those businesses are more capital planned, et cetera, in the right markets of the world and managing supply chain and so forth. The other 3 businesses are each of different pail. Diagnostics, I'd say, we got a very strong business here. It's actually a diverse business. It's a lot driven segment to diagnostics. And if we opportunistically could add to it, we would. In order to, obviously, all the criteria if you look at have to make sense, but that's a business where we don't really have to, but if he had opportunities, we will. EPD, similar. We've got a gem of a business there. And having done a lot of things to shape that business in the last several years, we are in the right growth markets. We're in high growth markets. We're in markets where the profitability and the market developments, the retail facing, all the structural and channel dynamics for a brand of generics are good. We've identified like, let's say, in priority, 15 countries in particular to meet all our criteria. And we've got strong positions in most of those, particularly important ones, and we're always looking to enhance our footprint in those markets if we can and expand our brands in those markets. Latin America was a great example of that. And so there's still many geographic opportunities to do so. But I was making the distinction for investors and others that it's really where we can distinctively differentiate branded generic pharmaceuticals, which means retail and channel and so forth, like India and other Latin American countries and so forth. And so when we have those opportunities, it's great to add on. But what we've got is a core business now. It's a very strong branded generic internationally and largely focused emerging market business, where there is tremendous tailwind of market growth. So that's another one that's opportunistic. And then devices. I'd say it's sum of both. We look at that -- we've always want to strength in that business. We do wish to strengthen that business. In a number ways we are doing that. Obviously, there's organic in-house and then there's our venture organization, where we're building a number of small companies. We're investing in other early stage companies and so forth and building our pipelines for the future. And then finally, if opportunistically there's available opportunity where it fits our market segments and so forth, then there's always M&A. And so we're always mindful of those opportunities. It gives you a sense of how we think about each of those segments. While you're thinking about something completely unrelated different, probably not. There's too many opportunities to build or strengthening the ones we have. And their needs from a strengthening standpoint vary. Some have more need to have more breadth of product than others and some are purely opportunistic, Kristen."

First of all, we are committed to the business. And I think there is a bigger market conditions here. If we look at the markets around the world, not just the U.S. that literally, every major country in the world, the markets have stabilized among competitors. Share doesn't move a lot. If it does, it moves a little. The physicians in this space, they take a new product and they experiment with it a little bit and that's about it. I mean, the innovation here is at a point where I'd say the incremental value recognized by the health care system is limited. If you think about what drug-coated stents and so forth have done in the vascular space, we've been a tremendous boom to the treatment of patients. But I think now what we see is this market is far more driven by cost and prices of either countries or hospital groups and others try to manage the overall costs of health care. So I think all of us see the same dynamics where we're increasingly challenged on more value proposition and just innovation. And I think increasingly the payer, whether it's a government or the purchasing people or share, whatever it is are increasingly more influential here than the preference of physicians. You see it's a little greater dynamic. Well, they're not bad dynamics, either. We have to compete in this business just like we compete in a lot of our other businesses. And I think we and our competitors in this business are all broadening our product lines, are innovating in other surrounding spaces and broadening those offerings in this space. And there's still a lot of room for innovation, but it may not be specifically just on the steps. So that -- who [indiscernible] to expand our business? And to some degree or to a large degree, that is M&A. And in our case, it's been a lot of small ball M&A. And looking to expand around this business, MitraClip, Absorb, those kind of things are incremental; although MitraClip is still significant that way. We look at expanding into structural heart failure or other categories. And we're trying to build our breadth in those other -- let's say, surrounding spaces that way. I don't think that's very different for any of the companies in this business worldwide. I think what's been difficult for any market that have the kind of robust innovation driven growth that this one did back in the early thousands, it's a different market today. It's a different market everywhere today. So is it a slower growth market? Yes. It is still a very attractive market? Yes. It's still a very profitable market for our participants. And that's why we get a lot of pressure from a cost standpoint from the payers, et cetera, and I don't think that's a secret to anybody. So while others look at the performance of the business and say, ""Geez, it's a little below our expectations."" I'm beginning to think it's just all of us adjusting our expectations to some of the reality of the value propositions in the market today. And -- so I think it's a very strong business. It's a very healthy one, at least in that respect. We still invest quite substantially in R&D and innovations there and clinical trials and so forth. We got innovations that are in R&D and in the clinical space. And a lot of investments around it. So would it benefit from a much broader footprint? Well, it probably would. The question is, how to get to that broader footprint. And I think it's in the -- you call it, Medical Device space broadly defined today. There's either a bunch of big companies or a bunch of little companies. There's not much in the middle. And the couple of things in the middle are extremely highly value relative to their current performance. And I think there's a lot of speculation of question about whether or not that kind of value will play out. So I think it will just evolve in a little time here. We've made a lot of investments in smaller companies and segments, as you know, whether at Tendyne or Cephea or others to expand our footprints here. And so I think -- I believe in Medical Device space, right now and long-term -- but I don't think it'll be the same kind of space it was 10, 15 years ago."

Last year, exchange was a strong headwind for any U.S.-based multinational across the board. And I would recall at this very time last year from December to now, you'll recall both oil and exchange kind of sort of had a sudden hit, except that the oil price drop at that point was at very high -- much higher level than where we are today. But there was a sudden hit. And so late fourth quarter '14 and then early '15, everybody scrambled to readjust their EPS guidance for the year to try to deal with what they saw coming as currency that was already happening. And a lot of companies dialed back to single digit or whatever and later on exchange and so forth, which was valid. In our case, we said, we think we can navigate through it, and we did. And we had extremely strong underlying growth of -- in our markets as we still do. And it wasn't just double digits, it's been healthy double-digit all year long. And so in our case, we were able to mitigate an awful lot of that exchange all year long and still deliver what was frankly very differentiated, higher growth than many, many of our peers, even multinational peers not in health care. And what we've got now is another year on top of that, okay, of the same sort of thing. And if you look at these exchange rate grass, who would have thought these exchange rates could, in a lot of cases, be even bigger, even bigger exchange rates or how we want to translate it stronger for us as we go on the other side. And then on top of that, nobody predicted $25 to $30 oil. Now that's a curveball for the whole world. And so when you throw that curveball in there, it dramatically unbalances the mix of your currencies because of the oil-based economies where lower oil prices really affect the underlying performance of the country. So you take a country like Russia or Venezuela or Saudi Arabia, now these are countries that are all strong countries for us. And to different degrees, they have been impacted by their own oil revenues and therefore, their own ability to pay for products. Now having said that, is Russia still a strong market for us? It is. Do we have the same kind of difficulties in Russia that we have in Venezuela? We don't. It is a fundamentally good market, strong underlying market, et cetera. The only thing that's not strong is the ruble, which is dramatically weaker versus the dollar than even a year ago. And so there's this disproportionate imbalance in the pressures -- in the currency basket, if you will, from a little handful of countries, where they already had currency translation challenges just like the rest of the world, except that they have oil dependence on top of it, which amplifies it even more. And when you start a stack up, all of those things, you'd say, ""Okay, could we navigate through this?"" And the answer is, we could. I can cut a lot of expenses. I can delay a lot of investments. There's a lot of things that, frankly, I have the discretion to do. We, as a company, have the discretion to do. And I could then say to you, we'll either have 5% earnings growth or high single digit earnings growth. But in our judgment, this year is so unusual this way with the ongoing depth of currency rolls and the unusual circumstance of oil prices and its impact of these economies, that I would bet and say, I don't think it's prudent to compromise our ability to go after all this underlying growth for 1 year. In fact, it's more prudent to take out Venezuela out of the assumptions. It's more prudent to take that one out and keep right on going. And I think if you believe in the underlying strength of economies around the world, the ones that are delivering growth, and if you believe in the underlying growth of health care and those economies, and you believe in the underlying growth of all our products at Abbott, and if you believe in Abbott's ability to continue to access all that growth, then my judgment was, ""Okay, I'm going to roll out my pocket here. Take Venezuela out of the assumptions."" I mean, if I hadn't taken Venezuela out of the assumptions, I'd be telling you right now that you're going to have mid-single digit growth on the top and bottom line. And you know something, you think that was terrific in this environment. And if you compare to all the other multinationals in our space or thankfully other multinationals space, you know that's right as everybody else. So in this case we said, ""Look, I don't want to artificially compromise our investments in lot of these businesses, whether it's an SG&A investment or R&D or whatever, because of Venezuela."" So I think I'm going to take that one out and keep right on going because I believe in the longer-term growth prospects of these economies and these businesses, and I'm not going to compromise that for a couple of quarters in Venezuela. So at the end of the day, could we manage through it? Yes. And you know this, if you look back at even 10 years in fact, with or without it, we've absolutely been reliable at double-digit bottom line and high single digit top line unlike almost any other large, diverse multinational out there. We've been a very reliable performer that way in a very diverse world. So I don't see all that defense, if you will, if I had sound that. I look at the world and say, ""Man, this is like a total different circumstance than any of us has ever seen."" And you have to kind of make a judgment of how far do I go to push off what we ought to be doing to sort of laid off this oddball storm we're in. And this oddball storm, I don't know -- I think there's a lot of people which project oil prices are going to stay down for a long time. And yet, everyone now say, what is down? And at what point do these oil-driven economy start performing better? $60, $70, $50, there's different thresholds where the performance of the oil are going to be changed dramatically for a lot of different businesses in the world not just us. In our case, health care is pretty good momentum what the oil price is. The dynamics of the Venezuela our unique. They're unique. And -- even the Saudis, they still spin on the health care? Yes, they do. It's still a very strong and important market for us and so is Russia and so on. So -- I don't know that's a long roundabout way of saying, ""We made a deliberate decision."" It was discretionary. Could I have made the decision to say, ""I'm going to deliver high single digit earnings growth no matter what?"" Yes, probably. But I wouldn't have to compromise the underlying momentum in ways I didn't think is prudent. For exchange, yes, we can manage exchange. Venezuela, I think it is more prudent to just take Venezuela out of the mix. In terms of what our expectations are. And that's an unusual anomaly. I mean, I challenge back to 2015, we look through exchange. Can we look through exchange again? Yes, we can. Yes, we can. And the single biggest difference in our guidance of this year is actually Venezuela. I don't know if that answers your question enough. That was my judgment. It's not an inability. It's more of a decision. If you look at our spending rates and stuff in our go forward guidance, our spending rates are healthy."

You could be dead right about Venezuela, I don't know. I don't know. But here's the difference for us. We're a he",493,"Yes, let me do with your Venezuela question first and then I'll let Brian wrap up with -- close on what you just said about our growth rates. You could be dead right about Venezuela, I don't know. I don't know. But here's the difference for us. We're a health care company. And among our businesses there, our products are medically necessary. And we have to pay attention to medically necessary. We don't have to lose money all the time. We're don't have to -- we don't have to be irrational for whatever reason. But we're mindful that we are health care company. We are mindful that we have medically necessary products, we are mindful that we have been in Latin America and in Venezuela for decades. And a lot of times in the past, in decades, foreign companies has exited those countries immediately when the economics turn sour. And the long-term commitment to that continent -- the governments of those countries and the health care systems in those countries, they know that and they recognize that. Abbott has never done that in 90 years in Latin America. And we are a fundamentally large health care provider in Latin America. So our judgment was to make these decisions one step at a time as we see how circumstances develop. It's a pretty big decision that we think and just to say, we're going to take the sales and profit expectations out of our expectations for the year so that our investors -- frankly, you're getting the news today that we're taking it out of our expectations, right? And yet, all I'm trying to do here is derisk your expectation, derisk your -- widening the roller coaster volatility here in that particular country because that one's unique. And so we've just chosen to take it out of the estimates because we know we're going to continue to have medically necessary products there. But that's going to be in our view at a much lower commercial level then in the past. So right now, I think that's the right prudent place to be for that change, I suppose. I don't anything has changed. I hope it changes more favorably, frankly. But I'm not listening through the graveyard. I just know that they're in a very tough circumstance as a country. They're volatile. They are unpredictable, and it's not a very liable market as markets go. So I think this is the right step. You could say, ""Shouldn't you just go a lot further."" And I'd say you could save that if we were just in some common industrial consumer or whatever good. But I don't think in a health care company, you can quite do the same thing, so I think we have to be a little prudent here about the medically necessary products. That's why we're where we are. And Brian, you're going to address the final comment there about the underlying growth rate."

Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2016. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to the risk and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.
Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2014. Abbott undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law.

Today, I'll discuss our results for 2015 as well as our outlook for 2016. For 2015, we achieved our financial objectives for the year, reflecting strong double-digit EPS growth, when excluding the impact of foreign exchange and almost 9% growth on an absolute basis. Excluding exchange, sales grew over 9%, including strong double-digit growth in emerging markets, and we continue to expand our gross and operating margins.
Overall, we made good progress against our strategic objectives. I'd like to highlight a few key achievements from the past year. In Established Pharmaceuticals, we completed the sale of our developed markets business and successfully integrated CFR Pharmaceuticals in Latin America and Veropharm in Russia. The integration of CFR provides the scale, manufacturing and portfolio breadth to establish Abbott as a top 10 branded generics company in Latin American and actually #1 in many of the markets in Latin America.
And Veropharm had a similar impact in Russia, positioning Abbott among the top branded generics companies in this key market. We also made significant progress improving our commercial execution, expanding our local product portfolios and driving awareness of our Abbott brand with patients, physicians and pharmacists.
In Nutrition, we achieved double-digit growth in share expansion in China with a portfolio of pediatric nutrition products that are customized to meet local preferences. In the U.S., we expanded our product offering in the tolerance and up age [ph] categories with the portfolio of non-GMO products, providing parents with additional formula choices.
Our International Adult Nutrition business achieved another year of strong growth, as we continue to build and shape this category globally. And we achieved another year of significant margin expansion. In Medical Devices, MitraClip achieved sales of more than $250 million, and we further solidified our leadership position in the transcatheter mitral valve repair market with the acquisition of Tendyne and an option agreement to acquire Cephea Valve Technologies.
Along with MitraClip, these technologies position Abbott well to sustain our leadership position in this attractive segment of the market. In Medical Optics, we continue to launch a number of innovative products that are driving growth and share expansion, most notably in the premium lens segments.
And in Diabetes Care, we introduced our revolutionary flash glucose monitor, Freestyle Libre, in several countries throughout Europe. Consumer response to this product continues to be very positive, and we recently expanded capacity to meet the growing demand. We also made progress during the year to bring the Libre technology to the U.S. with the regulatory submission for approval of Libre Pro, a professional-use device, in June of last year.
And finally, in Diagnostics, the combination of commercial execution, high-quality platforms and customer-focused solutions resulted in another year of above-market growth across both developed and emerging markets. This business also achieved another year of margin expansion while simultaneously investing in the development of next generation system platforms across all 3 of its segments, including the Core Lab, Molecular Diagnostics and Point of Care Diagnostics.
So we're entering 2016 with good underlying momentum. Our businesses are well aligned with favorable, long-term trends, including the continued expansion of health care and emerging economies. While there's been some softening in these economies on a macro basis. National policies focused on expanding access to care and favorable demographic trends are driving growth in health care that is outpacing overall economic growth in these markets. The fundamentals of the market and geographies where we compete remain strong, and we expect to deliver another year of strong double-digit underlying earnings growth in 2016.
However, a couple of items are impacting our growth outlook on an absolute basis, and you've heard this all week; most notably, foreign exchange. The rapid strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to several emerging market currencies beginning in the third quarter of last year means that foreign exchange will again be a growth headwind in 2016. We are now entering the fifth year of this dollar bull cycle. While we actively work to mitigate the impact of currency on our results, the impact of exchange on our bottom line will be more pronounced in 2016 due to the mix of currency movements and certain timing effects.
In preparing our 2016 forecast, we were mindful of finding the right balance between managing through these transitory currency dynamics in the near term, while concurrently making the right choices and appropriate investments, to drive sustainable long-term growth.
The other notable impact to our 2016 outlook relates to Venezuela, which has been a good market for us for many years. As many of you know, market conditions in Venezuela have become more challenging, including high inflation, increasing price and margin controls, regulations on imports and slowing demand. As a result, our forecast assumes a significantly lower contribution from Venezuela operations in 2016. Brian will provide more specific details on the impacts of currency in Venezuela in a few minutes.
So for 2016, our adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $2.10 to $2.20 reflects another year of strong double-digit underlying earnings growth offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange and the lower contribution from Venezuela that I just mentioned. In this environment, we remain focused on what we control: Our commercial and operational execution, our innovations and our efforts to expand margins.
In Nutrition, our R&D organization continues to be highly productive and is now developing new products closer to our customers than ever before with the opening of several new R&D centers in Asia over the last several years. We expect continued growth and share expansion in China, Latin America and other priority markets, including another year of strong International Adult Nutrition growth. And while we've made great progress expanding margins in this business, margin improvement remains a key priority, and we continue to see opportunities for steady expansion going forward.
In Established Pharmaceuticals, our execution has improved significantly, and we're focused on strengthening our capabilities in key channels and geographies and building a well-recognized Abbott brand with consumers who take a prominent role in making decisions about their health care. Internal development programs and local product acquisitions are driving a steady cadence of new products in our Established Pharma business to strengthen local portfolios. In 2015, our productivity of new product launches increased versus the previous year, and we expect another strong year of new product launch productivity in 2016.
In Medical Devices, we expect continued growth in share expansion in our cataract business, driven by the ongoing launch and market uptake of our premium intraocular lens products across multiple geographies.
In Diabetes Care, we recently expanded capacity, as I mentioned, to meet the strong demand for FreeStyle Libre in Europe, and we expect to bring this technology into a number of new markets in 2016, targeting the multi-billion dollar global blood glucose monitoring market.
And in Vascular, we'll continue to drive uptake of MitraClip and expect to bring absorbed to new markets through the year.
Finally, in Diagnostics, which remains one of our most consistent growth businesses. We'll continue to execute our commercial strategy to drive above-market growth in both developed and emerging markets. And as we progress through the year, we look forward to providing more specifics regarding our next generation diagnostic system's platforms as we get closer to launch.
Before turning it over to Brian, I'd like to comment briefly on capital allocation. You always ask me about that and you know that we take a very balanced approach here, which for us includes increasing our dividend, share repurchases and M&A activity.
Last month, we announced an increase to our quarterly dividend, marking the 44th consecutive year we've increased our dividend. Abbott's only one of a handful -- one of only a handful of companies to deliver with such consistency. Share repurchases have and will continue to be part of our capital allocation mix. And lastly, while 2015 was relatively quiet for us on the M&A front, adding to our business with good M&A remains a key priority. We see a number of opportunities and we'll continue to remain active on this front. As always, we remain disciplined and focused on finding the right balance of strategic fit and measures of return that will benefit the long-term shareholder. I'm sure you're going to have a question for me later on that topic.
But overall, as you can see, cash flows remain strong; margins remain strong; the underlying growth of our businesses remain strong. In summary, the fundamentals of the markets and geographies in which we compete all remain strong, and we continue to focus on what we can control.
For 2016, the impact of foreign exchange and the Venezuela dynamics I mentioned earlier are offsetting double-digit underlying earnings growth. These impacts, while significant, are transitory in nature. And therefore, we remain focused on making the right decisions to drive long-term growth to our shareholders.
I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss 2015 results and the 2016 outlook in more detail. Brian?"

Today, we reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.62, in line with our previous guidance range. Sales for the quarter increased 4.9% on an operational basis, driven by strong performance in our branded generics, Diagnostics and Adult Nutrition businesses. Reported sales declined 3.1% in the quarter, including an unfavorable impact of 8% from foreign exchange. The negative impact from exchange was approximately 1.5 percentage points higher than previous expectations, due to the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the quarter.
The fourth quarter adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.2% of sales, up 130 basis points over 2014, driven by continuing margin expansion in Diagnostics and Nutrition. In the quarter, adjusted SG&A expense was 29.6% of sales and adjusted R&D investment was 7% of sales, reflecting investments in development programs across the businesses, including several next-generation diagnostic system platforms.
The fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was somewhat below our previous forecast, due to inclusion of the impact of U.S. tax legislation enacted in December. Overall, as we look at 2015, we achieved our financial objectives for the year despite a difficult environment, and we delivered strong underlying growth while continuing to make significant progress on our margin initiatives.
Turning to our 2016 outlook. Today, we issued guidance for adjusted earnings per share of $2.10 to $2.20. While this forecast reflects another year of strong double-digit underlying earnings growth, foreign exchange and the Venezuela dynamics that Miles discussed are impacting our 2016 absolute growth outlook.
Let me take a moment to provide more detail on each of these items. As you know, in the third quarter of 2015, several emerging market currencies weakened rapidly relative to the U.S. dollar and have continued to steadily weaken since that time. Based on the geographic mix of currencies that weakened and the rapid pace at which these currencies decline, foreign exchange will be a greater offset to our underlying earnings growth in 2016 versus 2015. Additionally, in 2015, our hedging program served to mitigate some of the underlying foreign exchange exposure and volatility. While our program remains in place for 2016 and is anticipated to deliver some offsetting impact to our exposure, the benefit of our hedges have naturally lessened over time.
So the fall-through from translational foreign exchange, combined with these hedging dynamics, negatively impacts EPS growth in our guidance by a little more than 10% for the full year 2016.
Lastly, as Miles mentioned, due to challenging market conditions in Venezuela, our 2016 forecast assumes a significantly lower contribution from Venezuelan operations. This impact lowers our 2016 sales growth rate by almost 2%. And excluding this impact, the mid-point of our 2016 guidance range would reflect adjusted earnings per share growth in the mid-single digits, even with the more pronounced foreign exchange impact I discussed earlier. As the year progresses, we'll provide any relevant updates on our business in Venezuela.
I will now provide more specifics for our 2016 outlook. For the full year 2016, we forecast operational sales growth in the mid-single digits. Based on current exchange rates, we'd expect a negative impact of around 4% on our full year reported sales, which would result in reported sales growth in the low single digits for the full year 2016. Scott will provide more detail on the 2016 outlook by business in a few minutes.
We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio around 57% of sales, reflecting the negative impact from exchange, but partially offset by underlying gross margin improvement initiatives across our businesses. We forecast adjusted R&D investment of somewhat above 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 30.5% of sales for the full year. We forecast net interest expense of around $125 million, up over 2015, primarily due to higher U.S. interest rates and lower forecasted interest income in certain countries. We forecast a loss of approximately $25 million on exchange gain/loss line of the P&L for the full year, and we forecast around $10 million of nonoperating expense for the full year 2016. We forecast adjusted tax rate of somewhat above 18.5% for the full year 2016, similar to 2015, and reflecting the effect of the U.S. tax legislation enacted in December.
Before I review our first quarter outlook, I'd like to provide some context for our forecasted pattern of quarterly earnings growth in 2016. We forecast underlying adjusted EPS growth in the double digits for each quarter of 2016. However, in absolute terms, both foreign exchange and the Venezuela dynamics will have a more pronounced impact on our results in the first half of the year. We expect the pace of both sales and adjusted EPS growth to progressively accelerate throughout the year.
So for the first quarter, we forecast adjusted earnings per share of $0.38 to $0.40, reflecting double-digit underlying growth, which is more than offset by the impact of foreign exchange and the lower contribution from Venezuela operations. We forecast Operational Sales growth in the low single digits. And at current exchange rates, we'd expect a negative impact of exchange around 6%, resulting in a reported sales decline in the low single digits.
The Venezuela dynamics that I discussed lowered our first quarter Operational Sales growth forecast by around 3 percentage points. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio approaching 57% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of somewhat above 7% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 34% of sales in the first quarter. And we forecast net interest expense of around $25 million in the first quarter.
In summary, we achieved strong growth in 2015 despite a challenging environment. Our business has entered 2016 with good underlying momentum. And we continue to execute well on our margin expansion initiatives. Our underlying earnings growth forecast is to remain strong in 2016, very similar to the underlying earnings growth we saw in 2015.
With that, I'll turn it over to Scott to review the business operating highlights and outlook. Scott?"

As I mentioned earlier, my comments will focus on Operational Sales growth. I'll start with Diagnostics, where sales increased 7% in the quarter. In Core Laboratory Diagnostics, international sales increased nearly 8%, driven by double-digit growth in emerging markets. And in the U.S, we continued to achieve above-market performance with growth of more than 6%.
In Molecular Diagnostics, sales grew 3%, led by strong growth in our core focus area of infectious disease testing. As expected, U.S. sales were impacted by the planned scale down of our Genetics business. And lastly, Point of Care Diagnostics, where sales increased nearly 9% in the quarter. U.S. and international growth were driven by continued market adoption of i-STAT, our handheld device, which provides critical information at the patient's side, helping health care providers choose the best treatment in a variety of care settings when minutes matter the most.
In 2016, we'll continue to leverage our best-in-class commercial model and provide customers with a full offering of solutions, to help them most efficiently operate their businesses while improving care. We expect global diagnostics sales to increase mid-single digits on an operational basis with -- for both the full year and first quarter of 2016. 
In Nutrition, global sales increased 5.5% in the quarter. Pediatric Nutrition sales increased approximately 4% and were led by continued market uptake of Eleva in China and Similac Advanced Non-GMO in the U.S.
As expected, International Pediatric Nutrition results were impacted by a difficult comparison versus the prior year, when sales increased more than 20% driven by market uptake of product launches in China and Southeast Asia. In Adult Nutrition, sales were led by 10% international growth, including double-digit operational growth in several Latin American countries. U.S. performance was led by growth of Ensure in the retail and institutional segments of the market.
In 2016, we'll continue to focus our efforts on capturing share with locally relevant Pediatric Nutrition product and growing and shaping the Adult Nutrition category, globally. For the full year 2016, we expect Global Nutrition sales to increase mid-single digits on an operational basis.
It's important to note that the Venezuela dynamics that Miles and Brian reviewed most significantly impact our forecasts from Nutrition and Established Pharmaceuticals. Excluding this impact, we forecast operational sales growth for our Global Nutrition business would be mid- to high single digits for the full year 2016.
For the first quarter, we're forecasting Global Nutrition sales to increase low to mid-single digits on an operational basis. 
In Medical Devices, as expected, Vascular sales were relatively flat for the quarter. MitraClip, our first-in-class device for the treatment of mitral regurgitation, once again grew strong double-digits; and Supera, our innovative endovascular stent, continued to perform well. This growth is mitigated by market dynamics in the coronary stent market.
In 2016, we'll continue to drive market uptake in MitraClip and Supera and expect to bring Absorb, our fully dissolving stent to the U.S. market. For both the full year and first quarter of 2016, we expect global VAT per sale to decline low single digits on an operational basis.
In Diabetes Care, sales growth was again driven by strong international sales of Freestyle Libre in Europe. In 2016, with our recently completed capacity expansion, we look forward to bringing this breakthrough technology to more consumers around the world.
For the full year 2016, we expect global diabetes sales to increase double digits on an operational basis. For the first quarter, we're forecasting global diabetes sales to increase mid-single digit on an operational basis.
In Medical Optics, global sales increased 2%, with strong performance in the cataract business, notably in the premium lens segment, partially offset by dynamics in refractive market. In 2016, we'll continue to drive uptake of our innovative premium intraocular lenses, and we expect global Medical Optics sales to increase low to mid-single digits on an operational basis for both the full year and first quarter of 2016.
And lastly, Established Pharmaceuticals or EPD, where sales again increased double digits. Sales growth in the quarter was led by strong performance in several markets, including Russia, India and China. For the full year 2015, EPD sales grew double-digits operationally, with and without the impact of recent acquisitions. In 2016, we'll continue to broaden our portfolio with locally relevant new products. We'll remain focused on successfully building our presence and scale in key countries of focus. For the full year 2016, we expect EPD sales to increase mid- to high single digits on an operational basis.
As I mentioned earlier, Venezuela has a significant impact on our forecasted EPD growth rate. Excluding this impact, we would forecast operational sales growth for EPD in the low double-digits for the full year 2016. For the first quarter, we're forecasting EPD sales to increase mid-single digits on an operational basis, reflecting double-digit operational growth excluding the impact of Venezuela.
In summary, we achieved another year of strong underlying sales and margin growth and are well positioned to maintain that type of momentum for the full year 2016. We will now open the call for questions."

But I want to make it very clear that we're not changing our exchange rate assumptions for the country. This is really about what's happening to the markets through economic activity of those markets and really, demand and ability to pay for products. Oil prices high at the beginning of the year, it declined throughout the year and the stock markets became more challenging. And we saw -- as Scott talked about and Brian talked about, significantly lower volume as we exited 2015; and as Miles indicated in his remarks with price controls, very high inflation and this kind of -- when we look at the remainder of 2016 going forward, we see very challenging conditions and much lower volumes in the country. So we're focused on supplying the market, more focused on medically critical products. Our products are important to the market. But just the profitability of what we would expect for the year from that activity is a very low contribution compared to what we experienced largely in the first half of 2015. So that's kind of the situation. And I think it's basically -- it takes some volatility out of our forecast, and reflects the reality of the market we're dealing in."

And as you know, Eleva has had great success in the portion of the markets that it's playing in. So there is a little bit of a tougher comparison fourth quarter '15 and '14. If you blend it out in China, though, on the average our Nutrition business grew over the mid-teens for the full year. And so that's more reflective of the performance for this business for the year and it's still ongoing. We still have the momentum there. We still have plans for further opportunities of how we compete and how we bring products to the various channels there. So nothing's changed about the momentum and it will continue in 2016."

And as I said, the frustrating thing, and I think it's frustrating for a lot of multinational companies that are U.S -based is the underlying market dynamics remain strong in a lot of places. I m",1410,"No. Why don't we go back and I can paraphrase that for you. And as I said, the frustrating thing, and I think it's frustrating for a lot of multinational companies that are U.S -based is the underlying market dynamics remain strong in a lot of places. I mean, every morning we get up, we see CNBC, everybody wrings their hands about China. But whether China is 7% growth or 6% growth, 6% is way bigger than the rest of the world. It's a fundamentally strong market for us, as are probably all of these emerging markets. Now the oil-based economy, the ones that are extremely dependent on oil, take Venezuela -- okay, they're a different story. And -- the volatility, unreliability and sustainable in the market there is different than just about anywhere in the world. So okay, there's an outlier. And every year, there's going to be some outliers somewhere. And I think if you're in a broad mix of currencies and a broad mix of countries and geographies as a multinational, somewhere, something is not going to be great. But the fundamentals of the markets, particularly for us in health care, are good. And yet translating that back during this period, it's unusual, it's frustrating. I mean, none of us have seen this kind of oil price in a couple of decades and others have seen this kind of currency pile on in a wrong time. So -- okay, that said, we all know that -- every multinational CEO has said it in the last 2 weeks in his earnings call -- and we all see it while experiencing it. Now going back to your next question. Has my expectation of our underlying momentum changed? No. Has my priority changed in terms of M&A activity? I'll tell you one thing about it that's changed a little bit. We've been looking at properties -- largely, internationally -- and I'd say, I'm probably balancing that a little bit back another way. I don't think in the past, I have looked pretty hard in a lot of expansion opportunities in branded generic pharmaceuticals. And I think there are opportunities there. But I think as you and others,  and we watched those valuations over the last year, when deal heat turned -- and I can tell you that there was one particular one that we were involved in an auction for, and the valuation that property went for -- we did not win it -- but the valuation of that property went for was noneconomic. I mean, just plain noneconomic. I would challenge the buyer to explain where the economic return was in that particular deal. And they obviously have their reasons and they obviously saw something the rest of us didn't appreciate -- I would say as an understatement. But the valuation are at a level in some cases, that you have to question prudence. And I think at the end of the day, while we've got strategic reasons we want to expand our footprint in different places, those valuations, when we deploy the capital on behalf of our shareholders have to make some sense. And I don't think that we are anymore -- I think we're prudent. I think we're disciplined. I think we've made good deals in the past. I think -- I've gone through so much of this, where I've heard, ""We paid too much, we didn't pay enough, we got a good deal,"" et cetera. But I think some of things I saw last year said, ""Boy, I don't think I minded losing that one. I don't think I minded not participating in that one."" So I think, right now -- first of all, I don't see a lot that people are offering up for sale in effect. And the old maxim everything's for sale at some price; well the price that some of these things will be for sale at is imprudent, it's just imprudent. So I think you have to step back and say, ""We're not in that zone. We're not going to be that irrational,"" in some cases; and that's me. I mean, I hate them, I'm going to see some of this in print later, but I think that. So you look at some of the currencies and some of the weakening of currencies; we would do a lot of those deals in local currency; in fact, almost all of them in local currency. And I'd say, based on where those currency rates are today, you would say it's time. This is the time because there's not as much currency risk in a purchase in that particular market, et cetera. But I think if I look at the mix of geographies and the mix of currencies and so forth that we currently have, I'm not sure our investors would applaud further wading toward it just now. I mean, I think there's a timely issue. I would tell you, having said that, if there was a right opportunity in the right place and I believe that it was strategically very important to us or a real opportunity for our investors and that the balance of what we foresaw in the growth of that market, the position, their currency and so forth, all lined up and the valuation looked good, I'd probably do that deal. But that was a stack up of a lot of ifs, right now. So you'd say, what's changed? I'd say where I'm looking and what I'm considering, hasn't change. It's just shifted in some of its balance. I think it -- I've got all the same sort of pharmaceutical opportunities on my radar screen, but I'm prioritizing some others now that are maybe more important, I think, in this market, this environment in terms of strengthening our businesses. Now I've heard other CEO say the same thing, I've heard a lot of people say -- actually, mostly I heard bankers say, that it's a very robust everybody's-is-out-there-trying-to-buy-stuff market -- I've heard it more from bankers than from other companies reporting. I don't think there's that many things out there for people to consider in our spaces. I don't think there's that many properties. I don't think there's that many assets. I don't think there's that much to consolidate. So I think it's fairly predictable, particularly for an analyst in this space -- as you are -- to predict the kind of things that people are going to be looking at. There's not a lot out there to consider. So I think, for us, we know what our strategic priorities are. We know what can help our business. We're aware there's real pluses and opportunities. And the question is, whether or not the other parties, whoever they may be, see the same sort of opportunity, and we can come together on an overlap of valuation to make something happen. And I know that sounds like textbook product to you, but that's really what it is. There's a lot of people at the dance looking at each other and trying to decide whether they want to dance. But I don't think there's that many opportunities to be made and everybody is in the same environment where they think their own valuations are low and they look at the valuations from last year that were kind of high, and I think you're in a zone where people are adjusting to, ""What's my value?"" And so having said all that, am I any less focused on it? No, I'm probably more focused on it, if anything. But I'd say, we're also pretty analytical about what we can do with the businesses and what's the right valuation and what's the right timing and so forth, because we don't get swept-up in deal heat. We're fairly strategic about it. And I know that a lot of people think that a lot happened last year and we should have been in the mix of it. But I didn't see anything go by that I felt particularly bad about not being in the mix of, as I mentioned, there's one particular one we were in the hunt on and the valuation at the end was so high, I don't mind missing it at all. So I realize that's a long ramble for you, Mike, but that probably gives you a fair degree of insight into how I'm thinking about it. We're definitely not inactive, that's for sure."

But we're committed to all 4 major segments that we have in the company. One of the important things about those segments is that they're in relative balance in terms of size, sales, profitability, et cetera. They've all got somewhat different dynamics and they've also got a lot in common. If you take EPD and Nutrition, globally, they share a lot of channel dynamics and so forth, Devices and Diagnostics do. There's a lot of different things going on with these businesses, but I'd say first is, balance matters in the mix that is the investment identity in a company for investor. Because you want to be a reliable performer steadily over time. And as you know, our proprietary Pharma business fabulously grew to a terrific size and based on one product in particular. And so we were out of balance as a company and so we split into 2 companies. But we've got balance in these businesses. That said, I'd say, from an M&A perspective in the places where we're looking, to be perfectly fair, we're not looking to do anything with regard to M&A in our Nutrition business today. I mean, if something came along opportunistically, we'd look at anything. But the fact is, that business is -- that's an organic business for us. Our -- all of our performance objectives and the things we want to do in the Nutrition business globally are organically driven and we think we're in a good position for all that. So the kind of the investments that we'd make in those businesses are more capital, plant, et cetera, in the right markets of the world and managing supply chain and so forth. The other 3 businesses are each of a different pail. Diagnostics, I'd say, we got a very strong business here. It's actually a diverse business. There's a lot different segments to diagnostics. And if we opportunistically could add to it, we would. Obviously, all the criteria you'd look at have to make sense, but that's a business where we don't really have to, but if we had opportunities, we look. EPD, similar. We've got a gem of a business there. And having done a lot of things to shape that business in the last several years, we are in the right growth markets. We're in high growth markets. We're in markets where the profitability and the market development, the retail facing, all the structural and channel dynamics for a brand of generics are good. We've identified like, let's say, in priority, 15 countries in particular to meet all our criteria. And we've got strong positions in most of those, particularly important ones, and we're always looking to enhance our footprint in those markets if we can and expand our brands in those markets. Latin America was a great example of that. And so there's still many geographic opportunities to do so. But I always make the distinction for investors and others that it's really where we can distinctively differentiate branded generic pharmaceuticals, which means retail and channel and so forth, like India and other Latin American countries and so forth. And so when we have those opportunities, it's great to add on. But what we've got as a core business now is a very strong branded generic international, largely focused emerging market business, where there is tremendous tailwind of market growth. So that's another one that's opportunistic. And then devices. I'd say it's sum of both. We look at that -- we'd always want to strengthen that business -- we do wish to strengthen that business. In a number ways we are doing that. Obviously, there's organic in-house and then there's our venture organization, where we're building a number of small companies. We're investing in other early stage companies and so forth and building our pipelines for the future. And then finally, if opportunistically there's available opportunities where it fits our market segments and so forth, then there's always M&A. And so we're always mindful of those opportunities. It gives you a sense of how we think about each of those segments. Well if you said, ""Would you think about something completely unrelated different?"" Probably not. There's too many opportunities to build or strengthen the ones we have. And their needs from a strengthening standpoint vary. Some have more need to have more breadth of product than others and some are purely opportunistic, Kristen."

It wasn't so in Europe. And I would say no more about that. But I'm in a hurry because we know the value of the product. We know the reception of the product. We know what the physician community reception of the product is. We know all of that. And the value proposition of this product on top of the medical proposition is just fabulous.

But the Vascular business continues to come, at least relative to our expectations, continues to come in below. And I know you highlighted Absorb, but a lot of our channel checks are not very positive on Absorb. So I guess, my question is, what's the commitment to this Vascular business? Is this a business that you need to build up through M&A? And the reason why we haven't seen a lot of M&A, is it because the targets have still unrealistic valuations?"

First of all, we are committed to the business. And I think there is a bigger market condition here. If you look at the markets around the world, not just the U.S. but literally, every major country in the world, the markets have stabilized among competitors. Share doesn't move a lot. If it does, it moves a little. The physicians in this space, they take a new product and they experiment with it a little bit and that's about it. I mean, the innovation here is at a point where I'd say the incremental value recognized by the health care system is limited. If you think about what drug-coated stents and so forth have done in the vascular space, they've been a tremendous boom to the treatment of patients. But I think now what we see is this market is far more driven by cost and prices, as either countries or hospital groups and others try to manage the overall costs of health care. So I think all of us see the same dynamics; where we're increasingly challenged on more value proposition than just innovation. And I think increasingly the payer, whether it's a government or the purchasing people or insurer, whatever it is are increasingly more influential here than the preference of physicians. You see it's a little not very good dynamic. Well, they're not bad dynamics, either. We have to compete in this business just like we compete in a lot of our other businesses. And I think we and our competitors in this business are all broadening our product lines, are innovating in other surrounding spaces and broadening those offerings in this space. And there's still a lot of room for innovation, but it may not be specifically just on the stent. So that -- and what behooves us to expand our business? And to some degree or to a large degree, that is M&A. And in our case, it's been a lot of small-ball M&A. And looking to expand around this business, MitraClip, Absorb, those kind of things are incremental; although MitraClip is still significant that way. We look at expanding into structural heart failure or other categories. And we're trying to build our breadth in those other -- let's say, surrounding spaces that way. I don't think that's very different for any of the companies in this business, worldwide. I think what's been difficult for any market that have the kind of robust innovation driven growth that this one did back in the early thousands, it's a different market today. It's a different market everywhere today. So is it a slower growth market? Yes. It is still a very attractive market? Yes. It's still a very profitable market for all participants. And that's why we get a lot of pressure from a cost standpoint from the payers, et cetera, and I don't think that's a secret to anybody. So while others look at the performance of the business and say, ""Geez, it's a little below our expectations."" I'm beginning to think it's just all of us adjusting our expectations to sort of the reality of the value propositions in the market today. And -- so I think it's a very strong business. It's a very healthy one, at least in that respect. We still invest quite substantially in R&D and innovations there and clinical trials and so forth. We got innovations that are in R&D and in the clinical space. And a lot of investments around it. So would it benefit from a much broader footprint? Well, it probably would. The question is, how to get to that broader footprint. And I think in the -- call it, Medical Device space broadly defined today. There's either a bunch of big companies or a bunch of little companies. There's not much in the middle. And the couple of things in the middle are extremely highly valued relative to their current performance. And I think there's a lot of speculation or question about whether or not that kind of value will play out. So I think it will just evolve with a little time here. We've made a lot of investments in smaller companies and segments, as you know, whether at Tendyne or Cephea or others to expand our footprints here. And so I think -- I believe in Medical Device space, right now and long-term -- but I don't think it'll be the same kind of space it was 10, 15 years ago."

Last year, exchange was a strong headwind for any U.S.-based multinational across the board. And recall at this very time last year from December to now, you'll recall both oil and exchange kind of sort of had a sudden hit, except that the oil price drop at that point was at very high -- much higher level than where we are today. But there was a sudden hit in sort of late fourth quarter '14 and then early '15, everybody scrambled to readjust their EPS guidance for the year to try to deal with what they saw coming as currency that was already happening. And a lot of companies dialed back to single digit or whatever and laid it on exchange and so forth, which was valid. In our case, we said, we think we can navigate through it, and we did. And we had extremely strong underlying growth of -- in our markets as we still do. And it wasn't just double digits, it's been healthy double-digit all year long. And so in our case, we were able to mitigate an awful lot of that exchange all year long and still deliver what was frankly very differentiated, higher growth than many, many of our peers, even multinational peers not in health care. And what we've got now is another year on top of that, okay, of the same sort of thing. And if you look at these exchange rate grass, who would have thought these exchange rates could, in a lot of cases, be even bigger, even bigger exchange rates or how we want to translate it stronger for us or weaker on the other side. And then on top of that, nobody predicted $25 to $30 oil. Now that's a curveball for the whole world. And so when you throw that curveball in there, it dramatically unbalances the mix of your currencies because of the oil-based economies where lower oil prices really affect the underlying performance of the country. So you take a country like Russia or Venezuela or Saudi Arabia, now these are countries that are all strong countries for us. And to different degrees, they have been impacted by their own oil revenues and therefore, their own ability to pay for products. Now having said that, is Russia still a strong market for us? It is. Do we have the same kind of difficulties in Russia that we have in Venezuela? We don't. It is a fundamentally good market, strong underlying market, et cetera. The only thing that's not strong is the ruble, which is dramatically weaker versus the dollar than even a year ago. And so there's this disproportionate imbalance in the pressures -- in the currency basket, if you will, from a little handful of countries, where they already had currency translation challenges just like the rest of the world, except that they have oil dependence on top of it, which amplifies it even more. And when you start a stack up, all of those things, you'd say, ""Okay, could we navigate through this?"" And the answer is, we could. I can cut a lot of expenses. I can delay a lot of investments. There's a lot of things that, frankly, I have the discretion to do. We, as a company, have the discretion to do. And I could then say to you, we'll either have 5% earnings growth or high single digit earnings growth. But in our judgment, this year is so unusual this way with the ongoing depth of currency rolls and the unusual circumstance of oil prices and its impact on these economies, that I look at it and say, I don't think it's prudent to compromise our ability to go after all this underlying growth for 1 year. In fact, it's more prudent to take out Venezuela out of the assumptions. It's more prudent to take that one out and keep right on going. And I think if you believe in the underlying strength of economies around the world, the ones that are delivering growth, and if you believe in the underlying growth of health care on those economies, and you believe in the underlying growth of all our products at Abbott, and if you believe in Abbott's ability to continue to access all that growth, then my judgment was, ""Okay, I'm going to roll out my pocket here. Take Venezuela out of the assumptions."" I mean, if I hadn't taken Venezuela out of the assumptions, I'd be telling you right now that you're going to have mid-single digit growth on the top and bottom line. And you know something, you'd think that was terrific in this environment. And if you compared it to all the other multinationals in our space or frankly other multinationals space, you know that's right in there with everybody else. So in this case we said, ""Well if I don't want to artificially compromise our investments in lot of these businesses, whether it's an SG&A investment or R&D or whatever, because of Venezuela."" So I think I'm going to take that one out and keep right on going, because I believe in the longer-term growth prospects of these economies and these businesses, and I'm not going to compromise that for a couple of quarters in Venezuela. So at the end of the day, could we manage through it? Yes. And you know this. If you look back at even 10 years in fact, at Abbot, we've absolutely been reliable at double-digit bottom line and high single digit top line unlike almost any other large, diverse multinational out there. We've been a very reliable performer that way in a very diverse world. So I don't see all that defensively, even though it might sound that. I look at the world and say, ""Man, this is like a total different circumstance than any of us has ever seen."" And you have to kind of make a judgment of how far do I go to push off what we ought to be doing to sort of wait out this oddball storm we're in. And this oddball storm, I don't know -- I think there's a lot of people which project oil prices are going to stay down for a long time. And yet, everyone says, what is down? And at what point do these oil-driven economy start performing better? $60, $70, $50, there's different thresholds where the performance of those economies change dramatically, for a lot of different businesses in the world not just us. In our case, health care is pretty good no matter what the oil price is. The dynamics of the Venezuela our unique. They're unique. And -- even the Saudis, they still spend on health care? Yes, they do. It's still a very strong and important market for us and so is Russia and so on. So -- I don't know that's a long roundabout way of saying, ""We made a deliberate decision."" It was discretionary. Could I have made the decision to say, ""I'm going to deliver high single digit earnings growth no matter what?"" Yes, probably. But I wouldn't have to compromise the underlying momentum in ways I didn't think was prudent. For exchange, yes, we can manage exchange. Venezuela, I think it is more prudent to just take Venezuela out of the mix, in terms of what our expectations are. And that's an unusual anomaly. I mean, I challenge you back to 2015, we lived through exchange. Can we live through exchange again? Yes, we can. Yes, we can. And the single biggest difference in our guidance of this year is actually Venezuela. I don't know if that answers your question or not. That was my judgment. It's not an inability. It's more of a decision. If you look at our spending rates and stuff in our go forward guidance, our spending rates are healthy."

You could be dead right about Venezuela, I don't know. I don't know. But here's the difference for us. We're a health care company. And among our businesses there, are products are medically necessary. And we have to pay attention to medically necessary. We don't have to lose money all the time. We're don't have to -- we don't have to be irrational for whatever reason. But we're mindful that we are a health care company. We are mindful that we have medically necessary products, we are mindful that we have been in Latin America and in Venezuela for decades. And a lot of times in the past, in decades, foreign companies have exited those countries immediately when the economics turned sour. And the long-term commitment to that continent -- the governments of those countries and the health care systems in those countries, they know that and they recognize that. Abbott has never done that in 90 years in Latin America. And we are a fundamentally large health care provider in Latin America. So our judgment was to make these decisions one step at a time, as we see how circumstances develop. It's a pretty big decision that we've taken just to say, we're going to take the sales and profit expectations out of our expectations for the year so that our investors -- frankly, you're getting the news today that we're taking it out of our expectations, right? And yet, all I'm trying to do here is derisk your expectation, derisk your -- riding the roller coaster volatility here in that particular country because that one's unique. And so we've just chosen to take it out of the estimates, because we know we're going to continue to have medically necessary products there. But that's going to be in our view at a much lower commercial level then in the past. So right now, Rick, I think that's the prudent place to be for that change, I suppose. I don't anything has changed. I hope it changes more favorably, frankly. But I'm not listening through the graveyard. I just know that they're in a very tough circumstance as a country. They're volatile. They are unpredictable, and it's not a very reliable market as markets go. So I think this is the right step. You could say, ""Shouldn't you just go a lot further."" And I'd say you could say that if we were just in some common industrial, consumer or whatever good. But I don't think in a health care company, you can quite do the same thing, so I think we have to be a little prudent here about the medically necessary products. That's why we're where we are. And Brian, you're going to address Ricks final comment there about underlying growth rate."

Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2016. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to the risk and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.
Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2014. Abbott undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. Please note that fourth quarter financial results and guidance provided on today's call for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only.
On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which will be available on our website at abbott.com. Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange, unless otherwise noted.

Today, I'll discuss our results for 2015 as well as our outlook for 2016. For 2015, we achieved our financial objectives for the year, reflecting strong double-digit EPS growth, when excluding the impact of foreign exchange and almost 9% growth on an absolute basis. Excluding exchange, sales grew over 9%, including strong double-digit growth in emerging markets, and we continue to expand our gross and operating margins.
Overall, we made good progress against our strategic objectives. I'd like to highlight a few key achievements from the past year. In Established Pharmaceuticals, we completed the sale of our developed markets business and successfully integrated CFR Pharmaceuticals in Latin America and Veropharm in Russia. The integration of CFR provides the scale, manufacturing and portfolio breadth to establish Abbott as a top 10 branded generics company in Latin American and actually #1 in many of the markets in Latin America.
And Veropharm had a similar impact in Russia, positioning Abbott among the top branded generics companies in this key market. We also made significant progress improving our commercial execution, expanding our local product portfolios and driving awareness of our Abbott brand with patients, physicians and pharmacists.
In Nutrition, we achieved double-digit growth in share expansion in China with a portfolio of pediatric nutrition products that are customized to meet local preferences. In the U.S., we expanded our product offering in the tolerance and up age [ph] categories with the portfolio of non-GMO products, providing parents with additional formula choices.
Our International Adult Nutrition business achieved another year of strong growth, as we continue to build and shape this category globally. And we achieved another year of significant margin expansion. In Medical Devices, MitraClip achieved sales of more than $250 million, and we further solidified our leadership position in the transcatheter mitral valve repair market with the acquisition of Tendyne and an option agreement to acquire Cephea Valve Technologies.
Along with MitraClip, these technologies position Abbott well to sustain our leadership position in this attractive segment of the market. In Medical Optics, we continue to launch a number of innovative products that are driving growth and share expansion, most notably in the premium lens segments.
And in Diabetes Care, we introduced our revolutionary flash glucose monitor, Freestyle Libre, in several countries throughout Europe. Consumer response to this product continues to be very positive, and we recently expanded capacity to meet the growing demand. We also made progress during the year to bring the Libre technology to the U.S. with the regulatory submission for approval of Libre Pro, a professional-use device, in June of last year.
And finally, in Diagnostics, the combination of commercial execution, high-quality platforms and customer-focused solutions resulted in another year of above-market growth across both developed and emerging markets. This business also achieved another year of margin expansion while simultaneously investing in the development of next generation system platforms across all 3 of its segments, including the Core Lab, Molecular Diagnostics and Point of Care Diagnostics.
So we're entering 2016 with good underlying momentum. Our businesses are well aligned with favorable, long-term trends, including the continued expansion of health care and emerging economies. While there's been some softening in these economies on a macro basis. National policies focused on expanding access to care and favorable demographic trends are driving growth in health care that is outpacing overall economic growth in these markets. The fundamentals of the market and geographies where we compete remain strong, and we expect to deliver another year of strong double-digit underlying earnings growth in 2016.
However, a couple of items are impacting our growth outlook on an absolute basis, and you've heard this all week; most notably, foreign exchange. The rapid strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to several emerging market currencies beginning in the third quarter of last year means that foreign exchange will again be a growth headwind in 2016. We are now entering the fifth year of this dollar bull cycle. While we actively work to mitigate the impact of currency on our results, the impact of exchange on our bottom line will be more pronounced in 2016 due to the mix of currency movements and certain timing effects.
In preparing our 2016 forecast, we were mindful of finding the right balance between managing through these transitory currency dynamics in the near term, while concurrently making the right choices and appropriate investments, to drive sustainable long-term growth.
The other notable impact to our 2016 outlook relates to Venezuela, which has been a good market for us for many years. As many of you know, market conditions in Venezuela have become more challenging, including high inflation, increasing price and margin controls, regulations on imports and slowing demand. As a result, our forecast assumes a significantly lower contribution from Venezuela operations in 2016. Brian will provide more specific details on the impacts of currency in Venezuela in a few minutes.
So for 2016, our adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $2.10 to $2.20 reflects another year of strong double-digit underlying earnings growth offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange and the lower contribution from Venezuela that I just mentioned. In this environment, we remain focused on what we control: Our commercial and operational execution, our innovations and our efforts to expand margins.
In Nutrition, our R&D organization continues to be highly productive and is now developing new products closer to our customers than ever before with the opening of several new R&D centers in Asia over the last several years. We expect continued growth and share expansion in China, Latin America and other priority markets, including another year of strong International Adult Nutrition growth. And while we've made great progress expanding margins in this business, margin improvement remains a key priority, and we continue to see opportunities for steady expansion going forward.
In Established Pharmaceuticals, our execution has improved significantly, and we're focused on strengthening our capabilities in key channels and geographies and building a well-recognized Abbott brand with consumers who take a prominent role in making decisions about their health care. Internal development programs and local product acquisitions are driving a steady cadence of new products in our Established Pharma business to strengthen local portfolios. In 2015, our productivity of new product launches increased versus the previous year, and we expect another strong year of new product launch productivity in 2016.
In Medical Devices, we expect continued growth in share expansion in our cataract business, driven by the ongoing launch and market uptake of our premium intraocular lens products across multiple geographies.
In Diabetes Care, we recently expanded capacity, as I mentioned, to meet the strong demand for FreeStyle Libre in Europe, and we expect to bring this technology into a number of new markets in 2016, targeting the multi-billion dollar global blood glucose monitoring market.
And in Vascular, we'll continue to drive uptake of MitraClip and expect to bring absorbed to new markets through the year.
Finally, in Diagnostics, which remains one of our most consistent growth businesses. We'll continue to execute our commercial strategy to drive above-market growth in both developed and emerging markets. And as we progress through the year, we look forward to providing more specifics regarding our next-generation diagnostic systems platforms as we get closer to launch.
Before turning it over to Brian, I'd like to comment briefly on capital allocation. You always ask me about that and you know that we take a very balanced approach here, which for us includes increasing our dividend, share repurchases and M&A activity.
Last month, we announced an increase to our quarterly dividend, marking the 44th consecutive year we've increased our dividend. Abbott's only one of a handful -- one of only a handful of companies to deliver with such consistency. Share repurchases have and will continue to be part of our capital allocation mix. And lastly, while 2015 was relatively quiet for us on the M&A front, adding to our business with good M&A remains a key priority. We see a number of opportunities and we'll continue to remain active on this front. As always, we remain disciplined and focused on finding the right balance of strategic fit and measures of return that will benefit the long-term shareholder. I'm sure you're going to have a question for me later on that topic.
But overall, as you can see, cash flows remain strong; margins remain strong; the underlying growth of our businesses remain strong. In summary, the fundamentals of the markets and geographies in which we compete all remain strong, and we continue to focus on what we can control.
For 2016, the impact of foreign exchange and the Venezuela dynamics I mentioned earlier are offsetting double-digit underlying earnings growth. These impacts, while significant, are transitory in nature. And therefore, we remain focused on making the right decisions to drive long-term growth to our shareholders.
I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss 2015 results and the 2016 outlook in more detail. Brian?"
247483,321571928,923351,"Abbott Laboratories, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Abbott Laboratories","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Miles. Today, we reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.62, in line with our previous guidance range. Sales for the quarter increased 4.9% on an operational basis, driven by strong performance in",998,"Okay. Thanks, Miles. Today, we reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.62, in line with our previous guidance range. Sales for the quarter increased 4.9% on an operational basis, driven by strong performance in our branded generics, Diagnostics and Adult Nutrition businesses. Reported sales declined 3.1% in the quarter, including an unfavorable impact of 8% from foreign exchange. The negative impact from exchange was approximately 1.5 percentage points higher than previous expectations, due to the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the quarter.
The fourth quarter adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.2% of sales, up 130 basis points over 2014, driven by continuing margin expansion in Diagnostics and Nutrition. In the quarter, adjusted SG&A expense was 29.6% of sales and adjusted R&D investment was 7% of sales, reflecting investments in development programs across the businesses, including several next-generation diagnostic system platforms.
The fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was somewhat below our previous forecast, due to inclusion of the impact of U.S. tax legislation enacted in December. Overall, as we look at 2015, we achieved our financial objectives for the year despite a difficult environment, and we delivered strong underlying growth while continuing to make significant progress on our margin initiatives.
Turning to our 2016 outlook. Today, we issued guidance for adjusted earnings per share of $2.10 to $2.20. While this forecast reflects another year of strong double-digit underlying earnings growth, foreign exchange and the Venezuela dynamics that Miles discussed are impacting our 2016 absolute growth outlook.
Let me take a moment to provide more detail on each of these items. As you know, in the third quarter of 2015, several emerging market currencies weakened rapidly relative to the U.S. dollar and have continued to steadily weaken since that time. Based on the geographic mix of currencies that weakened and the rapid pace at which these currencies decline, foreign exchange will be a greater offset to our underlying earnings growth in 2016 versus 2015. Additionally, in 2015, our hedging program served to mitigate some of the underlying foreign exchange exposure and volatility. While our program remains in place for 2016 and is anticipated to deliver some offsetting impact to our exposure, the benefit of our hedges have naturally lessened over time.
So the fall-through from translational foreign exchange, combined with these hedging dynamics, negatively impacts EPS growth in our guidance by a little more than 10% for the full year 2016.
Lastly, as Miles mentioned, due to challenging market conditions in Venezuela, our 2016 forecast assumes a significantly lower contribution from Venezuelan operations. This impact lowers our 2016 sales growth rate by almost 2%. And excluding this impact, the mid-point of our 2016 guidance range would reflect adjusted earnings per share growth in the mid-single digits, even with the more pronounced foreign exchange impact I discussed earlier. As the year progresses, we'll provide any relevant updates on our business in Venezuela.
I will now provide more specifics for our 2016 outlook. For the full year 2016, we forecast operational sales growth in the mid-single digits. Based on current exchange rates, we'd expect a negative impact of around 4% on our full year reported sales, which would result in reported sales growth in the low single digits for the full year 2016. Scott will provide more detail on the 2016 outlook by business in a few minutes.
We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio around 57% of sales, reflecting the negative impact from exchange, but partially offset by underlying gross margin improvement initiatives across our businesses. We forecast adjusted R&D investment of somewhat above 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 30.5% of sales for the full year. We forecast net interest expense of around $125 million, up over 2015, primarily due to higher U.S. interest rates and lower forecasted interest income in certain countries. We forecast a loss of approximately $25 million on exchange gain/loss line of the P&L for the full year, and we forecast around $10 million of nonoperating expense for the full year 2016. We forecast adjusted tax rate of somewhat above 18.5% for the full year 2016, similar to 2015, and reflecting the effect of the U.S. tax legislation enacted in December.
Before I review our first quarter outlook, I'd like to provide some context for our forecasted pattern of quarterly earnings growth in 2016. We forecast underlying adjusted EPS growth in the double digits for each quarter of 2016. However, in absolute terms, both foreign exchange and the Venezuela dynamics will have a more pronounced impact on our results in the first half of the year. We expect the pace of both sales and adjusted EPS growth to progressively accelerate throughout the year.
So for the first quarter, we forecast adjusted earnings per share of $0.38 to $0.40, reflecting double-digit underlying growth, which is more than offset by the impact of foreign exchange and the lower contribution from Venezuela operations. We forecast Operational Sales growth in the low single digits. And at current exchange rates, we'd expect a negative impact of exchange around 6%, resulting in a reported sales decline in the low single digits.
The Venezuela dynamics that I discussed lowered our first quarter Operational Sales growth forecast by around 3 percentage points. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio approaching 57% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of somewhat above 7% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 34% of sales in the first quarter. And we forecast net interest expense of around $25 million in the first quarter.
In summary, we achieved strong growth in 2015 despite a challenging environment. Our business has entered 2016 with good underlying momentum. And we continue to execute well on our margin expansion initiatives. Our underlying earnings growth forecast is to remain strong in 2016, very similar to the underlying earnings growth we saw in 2015.
With that, I'll turn it over to Scott to review the business operating highlights and outlook. Scott?"

As I mentioned earlier, my comments will focus on Operational Sales growth. I'll start with Diagnostics, where sales increased 7% in the quarter. In Core Laboratory Diagnostics, international sales increased nearly 8%, driven by double-digit growth in emerging markets. And in the U.S, we continued to achieve above-market performance with growth of more than 6%.
In Molecular Diagnostics, sales grew 3%, led by strong growth in our core focus area of infectious disease testing. As expected, U.S. sales were impacted by the planned scale down of our Genetics business. And lastly, Point of Care Diagnostics, where sales increased nearly 9% in the quarter. U.S. and international growth were driven by continued market adoption of i-STAT, our handheld device, which provides critical information at the patient's side, helping health care providers choose the best treatment in a variety of care settings when minutes matter the most.
In 2016, we'll continue to leverage our best-in-class commercial model and provide customers with a full offering of solutions, to help them most efficiently operate their businesses while improving care. We expect global diagnostics sales to increase mid-single digits on an operational basis with -- for both the full year and first quarter of 2016. 
In Nutrition, global sales increased 5.5% in the quarter. Pediatric Nutrition sales increased approximately 4% and were led by continued market uptake of Eleva in China and Similac Advanced Non-GMO in the U.S.
As expected, International Pediatric Nutrition results were impacted by a difficult comparison versus the prior year, when sales increased more than 20% driven by market uptake of product launches in China and Southeast Asia. In Adult Nutrition, sales were led by 10% international growth, including double-digit operational growth in several Latin American countries. U.S. performance was led by growth of Ensure in the retail and institutional segments of the market.
In 2016, we'll continue to focus our efforts on capturing share with locally relevant Pediatric Nutrition product and growing and shaping the Adult Nutrition category, globally. For the full year 2016, we expect Global Nutrition sales to increase mid-single digits on an operational basis.
It's important to note that the Venezuela dynamics that Miles and Brian reviewed most significantly impact our forecasts from Nutrition and Established Pharmaceuticals. Excluding this impact, we forecast operational sales growth for our Global Nutrition business would be mid- to high single digits for the full year 2016.
For the first quarter, we're forecasting Global Nutrition sales to increase low to mid-single digits on an operational basis. 
In Medical Devices, as expected, Vascular sales were relatively flat for the quarter. MitraClip, our first-in-class device for the treatment of mitral regurgitation, once again grew strong double-digits; and Supera, our innovative endovascular stent, continued to perform well. This growth is mitigated by market dynamics in the coronary stent market.
In 2016, we'll continue to drive market uptake in MitraClip and Supera and expect to bring Absorb, our fully dissolving stent to the U.S. market. For both the full year and first quarter of 2016, we expect global VAT per sale to decline low single digits on an operational basis.
In Diabetes Care, sales growth was again driven by strong international sales of Freestyle Libre in Europe. In 2016, with our recently completed capacity expansion, we look forward to bringing this breakthrough technology to more consumers around the world.
For the full year 2016, we expect global diabetes sales to increase double digits on an operational basis. For the first quarter, we're forecasting global diabetes sales to increase mid-single digit on an operational basis.
In Medical Optics, global sales increased 2%, with strong performance in the cataract business, notably in the premium lens segment, partially offset by dynamics in refractive market. In 2016, we'll continue to drive uptake of our innovative premium intraocular lenses, and we expect global Medical Optics sales to increase low to mid-single digits on an operational basis for both the full year and first quarter of 2016.
And lastly, Established Pharmaceuticals or EPD, where sales again increased double digits. Sales growth in the quarter was led by strong performance in several markets, including Russia, India and China. For the full year 2015, EPD sales grew double-digits operationally, with and without the impact of recent acquisitions. In 2016, we'll continue to broaden our portfolio with locally relevant new products. We'll remain focused on successfully building our presence and scale in key countries of focus. For the full year 2016, we expect EPD sales to increase mid- to high single digits on an operational basis.
As I mentioned earlier, Venezuela has a significant impact on our forecasted EPD growth rate. Excluding this impact, we would forecast operational sales growth for EPD in the low double-digits for the full year 2016. For the first quarter, we're forecasting EPD sales to increase mid-single digits on an operational basis, reflecting double-digit operational growth excluding the impact of Venezuela.
In summary, we achieved another year of strong underlying sales and margin growth and are well positioned to maintain that type of momentum for the full year 2016. We will now open the call for questions."

This is really about what's happening to the markets through economic activity of those markets and really, demand and ability to pay for products. Oil prices high at the beginning of the year, it declined throughout the year and the stock markets became more challenging. And we saw -- as Scott talked about and Brian talked about, significantly lower volume as we exited 2015; and as Miles indicated in his remarks with price controls, very high inflation and this kind of -- when we look at the remainder of 2016 going forward, we see very challenging conditions and much lower volumes in the country. So we're focused on supplying the market, more focused on medically critical products. Our products are important to the market. But just the profitability of what we would expect for the year from that activity is a very low contribution compared to what we experienced largely in the first half of 2015. So that's kind of the situation. And I think it's basically -- it takes some volatility out of our forecast, and reflects the reality of the market we're dealing in."

And as you know, Eleva has had great success in the portion of the markets that it's playing in. So there is a little bit of a tougher comparison fourth quarter '15 and '14. If you blend it out in China, though, on the average our Nutrition business grew over the mid-teens for the full year. And so that's more reflective of the performance for this business for the year and it's still ongoing. We still have the momentum there. We still have plans for further opportunities of how we compete and how we bring products to the various channels there. So nothing's changed about the momentum and it will continue in 2016."

I m",1410,"No. Why don't we go back and I can paraphrase that for you. And as I said, the frustrating thing, and I think it's frustrating for a lot of multinational companies that are U.S -based is the underlying market dynamics remain strong in a lot of places. I mean, every morning we get up, we see CNBC, everybody wrings their hands about China. But whether China is 7% growth or 6% growth, 6% is way bigger than the rest of the world. It's a fundamentally strong market for us, as are probably all of these emerging markets. Now the oil-based economy, the ones that are extremely dependent on oil, take Venezuela -- okay, they're a different story. And -- the volatility, unreliability and sustainable in the market there is different than just about anywhere in the world. So okay, there's an outlier. And every year, there's going to be some outliers somewhere. And I think if you're in a broad mix of currencies and a broad mix of countries and geographies as a multinational, somewhere, something is not going to be great. But the fundamentals of the markets, particularly for us in health care, are good. And yet translating that back during this period, it's unusual, it's frustrating. I mean, none of us have seen this kind of oil price in a couple of decades and others have seen this kind of currency pile on in a wrong time. So -- okay, that said, we all know that -- every multinational CEO has said it in the last 2 weeks in his earnings call -- and we all see it while experiencing it. Now going back to your next question. Has my expectation of our underlying momentum changed? No. Has my priority changed in terms of M&A activity? I'll tell you one thing about it that's changed a little bit. We've been looking at properties -- largely, internationally -- and I'd say, I'm probably balancing that a little bit back another way. I don't think in the past, I have looked pretty hard in a lot of expansion opportunities in branded generic pharmaceuticals. And I think there are opportunities there. But I think as you and others,  and we watched those valuations over the last year, when deal heat turned -- and I can tell you that there was one particular one that we were involved in an auction for, and the valuation that property went for -- we did not win it -- but the valuation of that property went for was noneconomic. I mean, just plain noneconomic. I would challenge the buyer to explain where the economic return was in that particular deal. And they obviously have their reasons and they obviously saw something the rest of us didn't appreciate -- I would say as an understatement. But the valuation are at a level in some cases, that you have to question prudence. And I think at the end of the day, while we've got strategic reasons we want to expand our footprint in different places, those valuations, when we deploy the capital on behalf of our shareholders have to make some sense. And I don't think that we are anymore -- I think we're prudent. I think we're disciplined. I think we've made good deals in the past. I think -- I've gone through so much of this, where I've heard, ""We paid too much, we didn't pay enough, we got a good deal,"" et cetera. But I think some of things I saw last year said, ""Boy, I don't think I minded losing that one. I don't think I minded not participating in that one."" So I think, right now -- first of all, I don't see a lot that people are offering up for sale in effect. And the old maxim everything's for sale at some price; well the price that some of these things will be for sale at is imprudent, it's just imprudent. So I think you have to step back and say, ""We're not in that zone. We're not going to be that irrational,"" in some cases; and that's me. I mean, I hate them, I'm going to see some of this in print later, but I think that. So you look at some of the currencies and some of the weakening of currencies; we would do a lot of those deals in local currency; in fact, almost all of them in local currency. And I'd say, based on where those currency rates are today, you would say it's time. This is the time because there's not as much currency risk in a purchase in that particular market, et cetera. But I think if I look at the mix of geographies and the mix of currencies and so forth that we currently have, I'm not sure our investors would applaud further wading toward it just now. I mean, I think there's a timely issue. I would tell you, having said that, if there was a right opportunity in the right place and I believe that it was strategically very important to us or a real opportunity for our investors and that the balance of what we foresaw in the growth of that market, the position, their currency and so forth, all lined up and the valuation looked good, I'd probably do that deal. But that was a stack up of a lot of ifs, right now. So you'd say, what's changed? I'd say where I'm looking and what I'm considering, hasn't change. It's just shifted in some of its balance. I think it -- I've got all the same sort of pharmaceutical opportunities on my radar screen, but I'm prioritizing some others now that are maybe more important, I think, in this market, this environment in terms of strengthening our businesses. Now I've heard other CEO say the same thing, I've heard a lot of people say -- actually, mostly I heard bankers say, that it's a very robust everybody's-is-out-there-trying-to-buy-stuff market -- I've heard it more from bankers than from other companies reporting. I don't think there's that many things out there for people to consider in our spaces. I don't think there's that many properties. I don't think there's that many assets. I don't think there's that much to consolidate. So I think it's fairly predictable, particularly for an analyst in this space -- as you are -- to predict the kind of things that people are going to be looking at. There's not a lot out there to consider. So I think, for us, we know what our strategic priorities are. We know what can help our business. We're aware there's real pluses and opportunities. And the question is, whether or not the other parties, whoever they may be, see the same sort of opportunity, and we can come together on an overlap of valuation to make something happen. And I know that sounds like textbook product to you, but that's really what it is. There's a lot of people at the dance looking at each other and trying to decide whether they want to dance. But I don't think there's that many opportunities to be made and everybody is in the same environment where they think their own valuations are low and they look at the valuations from last year that were kind of high, and I think you're in a zone where people are adjusting to, ""What's my value?"" And so having said all that, am I any less focused on it? No, I'm probably more focused on it, if anything. But I'd say, we're also pretty analytical about what we can do with the businesses and what's the right valuation and what's the right timing and so forth, because we don't get swept-up in deal heat. We're fairly strategic about it. And I know that a lot of people think that a lot happened last year and we should have been in the mix of it. But I didn't see anything go by that I felt particularly bad about not being in the mix of, as I mentioned, there's one particular one we were in the hunt on and the valuation at the end was so high, I don't mind missing it at all. So I realize that's a long ramble for you, Mike, but that probably gives you a fair degree of insight into how I'm thinking about it. We're definitely not inactive, that's for sure."

Has the way that you've looked at the mix of Abbott from that perspective changed over the last kind of year or so, really since the spin of AbbVie? And if I look at the growth rates for this year -- Medical Devices -- the growth operationally was 1.5. If that division were to be separated out, I just look at Abbott, it would be even stronger as a company. And how do you think about that franchise and strengthening it or just kind of the composition of Abbott today and the future?"

But we're committed to all 4 major segments that we have in the company. One of the important things about those segments is that they're in relative balance in terms of size, sales, profitability, et cetera. They've all got somewhat different dynamics and they've also got a lot in common. If you take EPD and Nutrition, globally, they share a lot of channel dynamics and so forth, Devices and Diagnostics do. There's a lot of different things going on with these businesses, but I'd say first is, balance matters in the mix that is the investment identity in a company for investor. Because you want to be a reliable performer steadily over time. And as you know, our proprietary Pharma business fabulously grew to a terrific size and based on one product in particular. And so we were out of balance as a company and so we split into 2 companies. But we've got balance in these businesses. That said, I'd say, from an M&A perspective in the places where we're looking, to be perfectly fair, we're not looking to do anything with regard to M&A in our Nutrition business today. I mean, if something came along opportunistically, we'd look at anything. But the fact is, that business is -- that's an organic business for us. Our -- all of our performance objectives and the things we want to do in the Nutrition business globally are organically driven and we think we're in a good position for all that. So the kind of the investments that we'd make in those businesses are more capital, plant, et cetera, in the right markets of the world and managing supply chain and so forth. The other 3 businesses are each of a different pail. Diagnostics, I'd say, we got a very strong business here. It's actually a diverse business. There's a lot different segments to diagnostics. And if we opportunistically could add to it, we would. Obviously, all the criteria you'd look at have to make sense, but that's a business where we don't really have to, but if we had opportunities, we look. EPD, similar. We've got a gem of a business there. And having done a lot of things to shape that business in the last several years, we are in the right growth markets. We're in high growth markets. We're in markets where the profitability and the market development, the retail facing, all the structural and channel dynamics for a brand of generics are good. We've identified like, let's say, in priority, 15 countries in particular to meet all our criteria. And we've got strong positions in most of those, particularly important ones, and we're always looking to enhance our footprint in those markets if we can and expand our brands in those markets. Latin America was a great example of that. And so there's still many geographic opportunities to do so. But I always make the distinction for investors and others that it's really where we can distinctively differentiate branded generic pharmaceuticals, which means retail and channel and so forth, like India and other Latin American countries and so forth. And so when we have those opportunities, it's great to add on. But what we've got as a core business now is a very strong branded generic international, largely focused emerging market business, where there is tremendous tailwind of market growth. So that's another one that's opportunistic. And then devices. I'd say it's sum of both. We look at that -- we'd always want to strengthen that business -- we do wish to strengthen that business. In a number ways we are doing that. Obviously, there's organic in-house and then there's our venture organization, where we're building a number of small companies. We're investing in other early stage companies and so forth and building our pipelines for the future. And then finally, if opportunistically there's available opportunities where it fits our market segments and so forth, then there's always M&A. And so we're always mindful of those opportunities. It gives you a sense of how we think about each of those segments. Well if you said, ""Would you think about something completely unrelated different?"" Probably not. There's too many opportunities to build or strengthen the ones we have. And their needs from a strengthening standpoint vary. Some have more need to have more breadth of product than others and some are purely opportunistic, Kristen."

It wasn't so in Europe. And I would say no more about that. But I'm in a hurry because we know the value of the product. We know the reception of the product.

First of all, we are committed to the business. And I think there is a bigger market condition here. If you look at the markets around the world, not just the U.S. but literally, every major country in the world, the markets have stabilized among competitors. Share doesn't move a lot. If it does, it moves a little. The physicians in this space, they take a new product and they experiment with it a little bit and that's about it. I mean, the innovation here is at a point where I'd say the incremental value recognized by the health care system is limited. If you think about what drug-coated stents and so forth have done in the vascular space, they've been a tremendous boom to the treatment of patients. But I think now what we see is this market is far more driven by cost and prices, as either countries or hospital groups and others try to manage the overall costs of health care. So I think all of us see the same dynamics; where we're increasingly challenged on more value proposition than just innovation. And I think increasingly the payer, whether it's a government or the purchasing people or insurer, whatever it is, are increasingly more influential here than the preference of physicians. You see it's a little not very good dynamic. Well, they're not bad dynamics, either. We have to compete in this business just like we compete in a lot of our other businesses. And I think we and our competitors in this business are all broadening our product lines, are innovating in other surrounding spaces and broadening those offerings in this space. And there's still a lot of room for innovation, but it may not be specifically just on the stent. So that -- and what behooves us to expand our business? And to some degree or to a large degree, that is M&A. And in our case, it's been a lot of small-ball M&A. And looking to expand around this business, MitraClip, Absorb, those kind of things are incremental; although MitraClip is still significant that way. We look at expanding into structural heart failure or other categories. And we're trying to build our breadth in those other -- let's say, surrounding spaces that way. I don't think that's very different for any of the companies in this business, worldwide. I think what's been difficult for any market that have the kind of robust innovation driven growth that this one did back in the early thousands, it's a different market today. It's a different market everywhere today. So is it a slower growth market? Yes. It is still a very attractive market? Yes. It's still a very profitable market for all participants. And that's why we get a lot of pressure from a cost standpoint from the payers, et cetera, and I don't think that's a secret to anybody. So while others look at the performance of the business and say, ""Geez, it's a little below our expectations."" I'm beginning to think it's just all of us adjusting our expectations to sort of the reality of the value propositions in the market today. And -- so I think it's a very strong business. It's a very healthy one, at least in that respect. We still invest quite substantially in R&D and innovations there and clinical trials and so forth. We got innovations that are in R&D and in the clinical space. And a lot of investments around it. So would it benefit from a much broader footprint? Well, it probably would. The question is, how to get to that broader footprint. And I think in the -- call it, Medical Device space broadly defined today. There's either a bunch of big companies or a bunch of little companies. There's not much in the middle. And the couple of things in the middle are extremely highly valued relative to their current performance. And I think there's a lot of speculation or question about whether or not that kind of value will play out. So I think it will just evolve with a little time here. We've made a lot of investments in smaller companies and segments, as you know, whether at Tendyne or Cephea or others to expand our footprints here. And so I think -- I believe in Medical Device space, right now and long-term -- but I don't think it'll be the same kind of space it was 10, 15 years ago."

Last year, exchange was a strong headwind for any U.S.-based multinational across the board. And recall at this very time last year from December to now, you'll recall both oil and exchange kind of sort of had a sudden hit, except that the oil price drop at that point was at very high -- much higher level than where we are today. But there was a sudden hit in sort of late fourth quarter '14 and then early '15, everybody scrambled to readjust their EPS guidance for the year to try to deal with what they saw coming as currency that was already happening. And a lot of companies dialed back to single digit or whatever and laid it on exchange and so forth, which was valid. In our case, we said, we think we can navigate through it, and we did. And we had extremely strong underlying growth of -- in our markets as we still do. And it wasn't just double digits, it's been healthy double-digit all year long. And so in our case, we were able to mitigate an awful lot of that exchange all year long and still deliver what was frankly very differentiated, higher growth than many, many of our peers, even multinational peers not in health care. And what we've got now is another year on top of that, okay, of the same sort of thing. And if you look at these exchange rate grass, who would have thought these exchange rates could, in a lot of cases, be even bigger, even bigger exchange rates or how we want to translate it stronger for us or weaker on the other side. And then on top of that, nobody predicted $25 to $30 oil. Now that's a curveball for the whole world. And so when you throw that curveball in there, it dramatically unbalances the mix of your currencies because of the oil-based economies where lower oil prices really affect the underlying performance of the country. So you take a country like Russia or Venezuela or Saudi Arabia, now these are countries that are all strong countries for us. And to different degrees, they have been impacted by their own oil revenues and therefore, their own ability to pay for products. Now having said that, is Russia still a strong market for us? It is. Do we have the same kind of difficulties in Russia that we have in Venezuela? We don't. It is a fundamentally good market, strong underlying market, et cetera. The only thing that's not strong is the ruble, which is dramatically weaker versus the dollar than even a year ago. And so there's this disproportionate imbalance in the pressures -- in the currency basket, if you will, from a little handful of countries, where they already had currency translation challenges just like the rest of the world, except that they have oil dependence on top of it, which amplifies it even more. And when you start a stack up, all of those things, you'd say, ""Okay, could we navigate through this?"" And the answer is, we could. I can cut a lot of expenses. I can delay a lot of investments. There's a lot of things that, frankly, I have the discretion to do. We, as a company, have the discretion to do. And I could then say to you, we'll either have 5% earnings growth or high single digit earnings growth. But in our judgment, this year is so unusual this way with the ongoing depth of currency rolls and the unusual circumstance of oil prices and its impact on these economies, that I look at it and say, I don't think it's prudent to compromise our ability to go after all this underlying growth for 1 year. In fact, it's more prudent to take out Venezuela out of the assumptions. It's more prudent to take that one out and keep right on going. And I think if you believe in the underlying strength of economies around the world, the ones that are delivering growth, and if you believe in the underlying growth of health care on those economies, and you believe in the underlying growth of all our products at Abbott, and if you believe in Abbott's ability to continue to access all that growth, then my judgment was, ""Okay, I'm going to roll out my pocket here. Take Venezuela out of the assumptions."" I mean, if I hadn't taken Venezuela out of the assumptions, I'd be telling you right now that you're going to have mid-single digit growth on the top and bottom line. And you know something, you'd think that was terrific in this environment. And if you compared it to all the other multinationals in our space or frankly other multinationals space, you know that's right in there with everybody else. So in this case we said, ""Well if I don't want to artificially compromise our investments in lot of these businesses, whether it's an SG&A investment or R&D or whatever, because of Venezuela."" So I think I'm going to take that one out and keep right on going, because I believe in the longer-term growth prospects of these economies and these businesses, and I'm not going to compromise that for a couple of quarters in Venezuela. So at the end of the day, could we manage through it? Yes. And you know this. If you look back at even 10 years in fact, at Abbot, we've absolutely been reliable at double-digit bottom line and high single digit top line unlike almost any other large, diverse multinational out there. We've been a very reliable performer that way in a very diverse world. So I don't see all that defensively, even though it might sound that. I look at the world and say, ""Man, this is like a total different circumstance than any of us has ever seen."" And you have to kind of make a judgment of how far do I go to push off what we ought to be doing to sort of wait out this oddball storm we're in. And this oddball storm, I don't know -- I think there's a lot of people which project oil prices are going to stay down for a long time. And yet, everyone says, what is down? And at what point do these oil-driven economy start performing better? $60, $70, $50, there's different thresholds where the performance of those economies change dramatically, for a lot of different businesses in the world not just us. In our case, health care is pretty good no matter what the oil price is. The dynamics of the Venezuela our unique. They're unique. And -- even the Saudis, they still spend on health care? Yes, they do. It's still a very strong and important market for us and so is Russia and so on. So -- I don't know that's a long roundabout way of saying, ""We made a deliberate decision."" It was discretionary. Could I have made the decision to say, ""I'm going to deliver high single digit earnings growth no matter what?"" Yes, probably. But I wouldn't have to compromise the underlying momentum in ways I didn't think was prudent. For exchange, yes, we can manage exchange. Venezuela, I think it is more prudent to just take Venezuela out of the mix, in terms of what our expectations are. And that's an unusual anomaly. I mean, I challenge you back to 2015, we lived through exchange. Can we live through exchange again? Yes, we can. Yes, we can. And the single biggest difference in our guidance of this year is actually Venezuela. I don't know if that answers your question or not. That was my judgment. It's not an inability. It's more of a decision. If you look at our spending rates and stuff in our go forward guidance, our spending rates are healthy."

You could be dead right about Venezuela, I don't know. I don't know. But here's the difference for us. We're a health care company. And among our businesses there, are products are medically necessary. And we have to pay attention to medically necessary. We don't have to lose money all the time. We're don't have to -- we don't have to be irrational for whatever reason. But we're mindful that we are a health care company. We are mindful that we have medically necessary products, we are mindful that we have been in Latin America and in Venezuela for decades. And a lot of times in the past, in decades, foreign companies have exited those countries immediately when the economics turned sour. And the long-term commitment to that continent -- the governments of those countries and the health care systems in those countries, they know that and they recognize that. Abbott has never done that in 90 years in Latin America. And we are a fundamentally large health care provider in Latin America. So our judgment was to make these decisions one step at a time, as we see how circumstances develop. It's a pretty big decision that we've taken just to say, we're going to take the sales and profit expectations out of our expectations for the year so that our investors -- frankly, you're getting the news today that we're taking it out of our expectations, right? And yet, all I'm trying to do here is derisk your expectation, derisk your -- riding the roller coaster volatility here in that particular country because that one's unique. And so we've just chosen to take it out of the estimates, because we know we're going to continue to have medically necessary products there. But that's going to be in our view at a much lower commercial level then in the past. So right now, Rick, I think that's the prudent place to be for that change, I suppose. I don't anything has changed. I hope it changes more favorably, frankly. But I'm not listening through the graveyard. I just know that they're in a very tough circumstance as a country. They're volatile. They are unpredictable, and it's not a very reliable market as markets go. So I think this is the right step. You could say, ""Shouldn't you just go a lot further."" And I'd say you could say that if we were just in some common industrial, consumer or whatever good. But I don't think in a health care company, you can quite do the same thing, so I think we have to be a little prudent here about the medically necessary products. That's why we're where we are. And Brian, you're going to address Rick's final comment there about underlying growth rate."

Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2016. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments except as required by law. Please note that fourth quarter financial results and guidance provided on today's call for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only.
On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which will be available on our website at abbott.com. Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange unless otherwise noted.

Today, I'll discuss our results for 2015 as well as our outlook for 2016. For 2015, we achieved our financial objectives for the year, reflecting strong double-digit EPS growth when excluding the impact of foreign exchange and almost 9% growth on an absolute basis. Excluding exchange, sales grew over 9%, including strong double-digit growth in emerging markets and we continue to expand our gross and operating margins. Overall, we made good progress against our strategic objectives. 
I'd like to highlight a few key achievements from the past year. In Established Pharmaceuticals, we completed the sale of our developed markets business and successfully integrated CFR Pharmaceuticals in Latin America and Veropharm in Russia. The integration of CFR provides the scale, manufacturing and portfolio breadth to establish Abbott as a top 10 branded generics company in Latin America and actually #1 in many of the markets in Latin America. And Veropharm had a similar impact in Russia, positioning Abbott among the top branded generics companies in this key market. We also made significant progress improving our commercial execution, expanding our local product portfolios and driving awareness of our Abbott brand with patients, physicians and pharmacists.
In Nutrition, we achieved double-digit growth and share expansion in China with a portfolio of Pediatric Nutrition products that are customized to meet local preferences. In the U.S., we expanded our product offering in the tolerance and up age categories with a portfolio of non-GMO products providing parents with additional formula choices. Our International Adult Nutrition business achieved another year of strong growth as we continue to build and shape this category globally, and we achieved another year of significant margin expansion. 
In Medical Devices, MitraClip achieved sales of more than $250 million, and we further solidified our leadership position in the transcatheter mitral valve repair market with the acquisition of Tendyne and an option agreement to acquire Cephea Valve Technologies. Along with MitraClip, these technologies position Abbott well to sustain our leadership position in this attractive segment of the market. In Medical Optics, we continue to launch a number of innovative products that are driving growth and share expansion, most notably in the premium lens segment. And in Diabetes Care, we introduced our revolutionary flash glucose monitor, FreeStyle Libre, in several countries throughout Europe. Consumer response to this product continues to be very positive, and we recently expanded capacity to meet the growing demand. We also made progress during the year to bring the Libre technology to the U.S. with the regulatory submission for approval of Libre Pro, a professional use device in June of last year.
And finally, in Diagnostics, the combination of commercial execution, high-quality platforms and customer-focused solutions resulted in another year of above-market growth across both developed and emerging markets. This business also achieved another year of margin expansion while simultaneously investing in the development of next-generation system platforms across all 3 of its segments, including the Core Lab, Molecular Diagnostics and Point of Care Diagnostics.
So we're entering 2016 with good underlying momentum. Our businesses are well aligned with favorable long-term trends, including the continued expansion of health care in emerging economies. While there's been some softening in these economies on a macro basis, national policies focused on expanding access to care and favorable demographic trends are driving growth in health care that is outpacing overall economic growth in these markets. The fundamentals of the markets on geographies where we compete remain strong, and we expect to deliver another year of strong double-digit underlying earnings growth in 2016.
However, a couple of items are impacting our growth outlook on an absolute basis and you've heard this all week. Most notably, foreign exchange. The rapid strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to several emerging market currencies beginning in the third quarter of last year means that foreign exchange will again be a growth headwind in 2016. We're now entering the fifth year of this dollar bull cycle. While we actively work to mitigate the impact of currency on our results, the impact of exchange on our bottom line will be more pronounced in 2016 due to the mix of currency movements and certain timing effects.
In comparing our 2016 forecast, we were mindful of finding the right balance between managing through these transitory currency dynamics in the near term while concurrently making the right choices and appropriate investments to drive sustainable long-term growth. The other notable impact to our 2016 outlook relates to Venezuela, which has been a good market for us for many years. As many of you know, market conditions in Venezuela have become more challenging, including high inflation, increasing price and margin controls, regulations on imports and slowing demand. As a result, our forecast assumes a significantly lower contribution from Venezuela operations in 2016. Brian will provide more specific details on the impacts of currency in Venezuela in a few minutes.
So for 2016, our adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $2.10 to $2.20 reflects another year of strong double-digit underlying earnings growth offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange and the lower contribution from Venezuela that I just mentioned. In this environment, we remain focused on what we control, our commercial and operational execution, our innovations and our efforts to expand margins.
In Nutrition, our R&D organization continues to be highly productive and is now developing new products closer to our customers than ever before with the opening of several new R&D centers in Asia over the last several years. We expect continued growth and share expansion in China, Latin America and other priority markets, including another year of strong International Adult Nutrition growth. And while we've made great progress expanding margins in this business, margin improvement remains a key priority, and we continue to see opportunities for steady expansion going forward.
In Established Pharmaceuticals, our execution has improved significantly, and we're focused on strengthening our capabilities in key channels and geographies and building a well-recognized Abbott brand with consumers to take a prominent role in making decisions about their health care. Internal development programs and local product acquisitions are driving a steady cadence of new products in our Established Pharma business to strengthen local portfolios. In 2015, our productivity of new product launches increased versus the previous year, and we expect another strong year of new product launch productivity in 2016.
In Medical Devices, we expect continued growth and share expansion in our cataract business, driven by the ongoing launch and market uptake of our premium intraocular lens products across multiple geographies. In Diabetes Care, we recently expanded capacity, as I mentioned, to meet the strong demand for FreeStyle Libre in Europe, and we expect to bring this technology into a number of new markets in 2016, targeting the multi-billion dollar global blood glucose monitoring market. And in Vascular, we'll continue to drive uptake of MitraClip and expect to bring Absorb to new markets through the year.
Finally, in Diagnostics, which remains one of our most consistent growth businesses, we'll continue to execute our commercial strategy to drive above-market growth in both developed and emerging markets. And as we progress through the year, we look forward to providing more specifics regarding our next-generation diagnostic systems platforms as we get closer to launch.
Before turning it over to Brian, I'd like to comment briefly on capital allocation. You always ask me about that and you know that we take a very balanced approach here, which for us includes increasing our dividend, share repurchases and M&A activity. Last month, we announced an increase to our quarterly dividend, marking the 44th consecutive year we've increased our dividend. Abbott's only one of a handful -- one of only a handful of companies to deliver with such consistency. Share repurchases have and will continue to be part of our capital allocation mix. And lastly, while 2015 was relatively quiet for us on the M&A front, adding to our business with good M&A remains a key priority. We see a number of opportunities and we'll continue to remain active on this front. As always, we remain disciplined and focused on finding the right balance of strategic fit and measures of return that will benefit the long-term shareholder. I'm sure you're going to have a question for me later on that topic.
But overall, you can see, cash flows remain strong, margins remain strong, the underlying growth of our businesses remains strong. In summary, the fundamentals of the markets in geographies in which we compete all remain strong, and we continue to focus on what we can control. In 2016, the impact of foreign exchange and the Venezuela dynamics I mentioned earlier are offsetting double-digit underlying earnings growth. These impacts, while significant, are transitory in nature and therefore, we remain focused on making the right decisions to drive long-term growth for our shareholders.
I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss 2015 results and the 2016 outlook in more detail. Brian?"
247483,321571928,949661,"Abbott Laboratories, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Abbott Laboratories","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Miles.

Today, we reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.62, in line with our previous guidance range. Sales for the quarter increased 4.9% on an operational basis, driven by strong performance in our branded generics, Diagnostics and Adult Nutrition businesses. Reported sales declined 3.1% in the quarter, including an unfavorable impact of 8% from foreign exchange. The negative impact from exchange was approximately 1.5 percentage points higher than previous expectations, due to the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the quarter.
The fourth quarter adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.2% of sales, up 130 basis points over 2014, driven by continued margin expansion in Diagnostics and Nutrition. In the quarter, adjusted SG&A expense was 29.6% of sales and adjusted R&D investment was 7% of sales, reflecting investments in development programs across the businesses, including several next-generation diagnostic system platforms. The fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was somewhat below our previous forecast, due to inclusion of the impact of U.S. tax legislation enacted in December. Overall, as we look at 2015, we achieved our financial objectives for the year despite a difficult environment, and we delivered strong underlying growth while continuing to make significant progress on our margin initiatives.
Turning to our 2016 outlook. Today, we issued guidance for adjusted earnings per share of $2.10 to $2.20. While this forecast reflects another year of strong double-digit underlying earnings growth, foreign exchange and the Venezuela dynamics that Miles discussed are impacting our 2016 absolute growth outlook.
Let me take a moment to provide more detail on each of these items. As you know, in the third quarter of 2015, several emerging market currencies weakened rapidly relative to the U.S. dollar and have continued to steadily weaken since that time. Based on the geographic mix of currencies that weakened and the rapid pace at which these currencies declined, foreign exchange will be a greater offset to our underlying earnings growth in 2016 versus 2015. 
Additionally, in 2015, our hedging program served to mitigate some of the underlying foreign exchange exposure and volatility. While our program remains in place for 2016 and is anticipated to deliver some offsetting impact to our exposure, the benefit of our hedges have naturally lessened over time. So the fall-through from translational foreign exchange, combined with these hedging dynamics, negatively impacts EPS growth in our guidance by a little more than 10% for the full year 2016.
Lastly, as Miles mentioned, due to challenging market conditions in Venezuela, our 2016 forecast assumes a significantly lower contribution from Venezuelan operations. This impact lowers our 2016 sales growth rate by almost 2% and excluding this impact, the midpoint of our 2016 guidance range would reflect adjusted earnings per share growth in the mid-single digits even with the more pronounced foreign exchange impact I discussed earlier. As the year progresses, we'll provide any relevant updates on our business in Venezuela.
I will now provide more specifics for our 2016 outlook. For the full year 2016, we forecast operational sales growth in the mid-single digits. Based on current exchange rates, we'd expect a negative impact of around 4% on our full year reported sales, which would result in reported sales growth in the low single digits for the full year 2016. Scott will provide more detail on the 2016 outlook by business in a few minutes.
We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio around 57% of sales, reflecting the negative impact from exchange, but partially offset by underlying gross margin improvement initiatives across our businesses. We forecast adjusted R&D investment of somewhat above 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 30.5% of sales for the full year. We forecast net interest expense of around $125 million, up over 2015, primarily due to higher U.S. interest rates and lower forecasted interest income in certain countries. We forecast a loss of approximately $25 million on the exchange gain loss line of the P&L for the full year, and we forecast around $10 million of nonoperating expense for the full year 2016. We forecast adjusted tax rate of somewhat above 18.5% for the full year 2016, similar to 2015 and reflecting the effect of the U.S. tax legislation enacted in December.
Before I review our first quarter outlook, I'd like to provide some context for our forecasted pattern of quarterly earnings growth in 2016. We forecast underlying adjusted EPS growth in the double digits for each quarter of 2016. However, in absolute terms, both foreign exchange and the Venezuela dynamics will have a more pronounced impact on our results in the first half of the year. We expect the pace of both sales and adjusted EPS growth to progressively accelerate throughout the year.
So for the first quarter, we forecast adjusted earnings per share of $0.38 to $0.40, reflecting double-digit underlying growth, which is more than offset by the impact of foreign exchange and a lower contribution from Venezuela operations. We forecast operational sales growth in the low single digits. And at current exchange rates, we'd expect a negative impact of exchange around 6%, resulting in a reported sales decline in the low single digits.
The Venezuela dynamics that I discussed lowered our first quarter operational sales growth forecast by around 3 percentage points. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio approaching 57% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of somewhat above 7% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 34% of sales in the first quarter. And we forecast net interest expense of around $25 million in the first quarter.
In summary, we achieved strong growth in 2015 despite a challenging environment. Our businesses entered 2016 with good underlying momentum and we continue to execute well on our margin expansion initiatives. Our underlying earnings growth forecast is forecasted to remain strong in 2016, very similar to the underlying earnings growth we saw in 2015.
With that, I'll turn it over to Scott to review the business operating highlights and outlook. Scott?"

As I mentioned earlier, my comments will focus on operational sales growth. 
I'll start with Diagnostics where sales increased 7% in the quarter. In Core Laboratory Diagnostics, international sales increased nearly 8%, driven by double-digit growth in emerging markets. And in the U.S, we continued to achieve above-market performance with growth of more than 6%. In Molecular Diagnostics, sales grew 3%, led by strong growth in our core focus area of infectious disease testing. As expected, U.S. sales were impacted by the planned scale down of our genetics business. And lastly, Point of Care Diagnostics, where sales increased nearly 9% in the quarter. U.S. and international growth were driven by continued market adoption of i-STAT, our handheld device, which provides critical information at the patient's side, helping health care providers choose the best treatment in a variety of care settings when minutes matter the most. In 2016, we'll continue to leverage our best-in-class commercial model and provide customers with a full offering of solutions to help them most efficiently operate their businesses while improving care. We expect global diagnostics sales to increase mid-single digits on an operational basis for both the full year and first quarter of 2016. 
In Nutrition, global sales increased 5.5% in the quarter. Pediatric Nutrition sales increased approximately 4% and were led by continued market uptake of Eleva in China and Similac Advanced Non-GMO in the U.S. As expected, international Pediatric Nutrition results were impacted by a difficult comparison versus the prior year and sales increased more than 20% driven by market uptake for product launches in China and Southeast Asia. In Adult Nutrition, sales were led by 10% international growth, including double-digit operational growth in several Latin American countries. U.S. performance was led by growth of Ensure in the retail and institutional segments of the market. In 2016, we'll continue to focus our efforts on capturing share with locally relevant Pediatric Nutrition product and growing and shaping the Adult Nutrition category globally. For the full year 2016, we expect Global Nutrition sales to increase mid-single digits on an operational basis.
It's important to note that the Venezuela dynamics that Miles and Brian reviewed most significantly impact our forecast for Nutrition and Established Pharmaceuticals. Excluding this impact, we forecast operational sales growth for our Global Nutrition business will be mid- to high single digits for the full year 2016. For the first quarter, we're forecasting Global Nutrition sales to increase low to mid-single digits on an operational basis. 
In Medical Devices, as expected, Vascular sales were relatively flat for the quarter. MitraClip, our first-in-class device for the treatment of mitral regurgitation, once again grew strong double digits; and Supera, our innovative endovascular stent, continued to perform well. This growth was mitigated by market dynamics in the coronary stent market. In 2016, we'll continue to drive market uptake of MitraClip and Supera and expect to bring Absorb, our fully dissolving stent to the U.S. market. For both the full year and first quarter of 2016, we expect global Vascular sales to decline low single digits on an operational basis.
In Diabetes Care, sales growth was again driven by strong international sales of FreeStyle Libre in Europe. In 2016, with our recently completed capacity expansion, we look forward to bringing this breakthrough technology to more consumers around the world. For the full year 2016, we expect global diabetes sales to increase double digits on an operational basis. For the first quarter, we're forecasting global diabetes sales to increase mid-single digits on an operational basis.
In Medical Optics, global sales increased 2% as strong performance in the cataract business, notably in the premium lens segment, was partially offset by dynamics in the refractive market. In 2016, we'll continue to drive uptake of our innovative premium intraocular lenses, and we expect global Medical Optics sales to increase low to mid-single digits on an operational basis for both the full year and first quarter of 2016.
And lastly, Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, where sales again increased double digits. Sales growth in the quarter was led by strong performance from several markets, including Russia, India and China. For the full year 2015, EPD sales grew double-digits operationally with and without the impact of recent acquisitions. In 2016, we'll continue to broaden our portfolio with locally [ph] relevant new products and remain focused on successfully building our presence and scale in key countries of focus. For the full year 2016, we expect EPD sales to increase mid- to high single digits on an operational basis.
As I mentioned earlier, Venezuela has a significant impact on our forecasted EPD growth rates. Excluding this impact, we would forecast operational sales growth for EPD in the low double digits for the full year 2016. For the first quarter, we're forecasting EPD sales to increase mid-single digits on an operational basis, reflecting double-digit operational growth excluding the impact of Venezuela. In summary, we achieved another year of strong underlying sales and margin growth and are well positioned to maintain that type of momentum for the full year 2016. 
We'll now open the call for questions."

This is really about what's happening to the markets, to economic activity of those markets and really demand and ability to pay for products. Oil price was high at the beginning of the year. It declined throughout the year and our markets became more challenging. And we saw -- as Scott talked about and Brian talked about, significantly lower volume as we exited 2015. And as Miles indicated in his remarks with price controls, very high inflation and this kind of -- when we look at the remainder of 2016 going forward, we see very challenging conditions and much lower volumes in the country. So we're focused on supplying the market, more focused on medically critical products. Our products are important to the market, but just the profitability of what we would expect for the year from that activity is a very low contribution compared to what we experienced largely in the first half of 2015. So that's kind of the situation and I think it's basically -- takes some volatility out of our forecast and reflects the reality of the market we're dealing in."

If you go back to fourth quarter 2014, that was the period where we were launching our innovations, particularly Eleva and QINTI into the market. And as you know, Eleva has had great success in the portion of the market that it's playing in. So there is a little bit of a tougher comparison fourth quarter '15 over '14. If you blend it out in China though, on the average, our Nutrition business grew over the mid-teens for the full year and so that's more reflective of the performance for this business for the year and it's still ongoing. We still have the momentum there. We still have plans for further opportunities of how we compete and how we bring products to the various channels there. So nothing's changed about the momentum and it continues into 2016."

The underlying -- the frustrating thing, and I think it's frustrating for a lot of multinational companies that are U.S.-based is, the underlying market dynamics remain strong in a lot of places. I me",1411,"No. Let me go back, Mike, and paraphrase that for you. The underlying -- the frustrating thing, and I think it's frustrating for a lot of multinational companies that are U.S.-based is, the underlying market dynamics remain strong in a lot of places. I mean, every morning, we get up, we see CNBC, everybody wrings their hands about China. But whether China is 7% growth or 6% growth, 6% is way bigger than the rest of the world. It's a fundamentally strong market for us as are probably all of these emerging markets. Now the oil-based economy, the ones that are extremely dependent on oil, take Venezuela -- okay, they're a different story. And the volatility, unreliability of sustainable market there is different than just about anywhere in the world. So okay, there's an outlier. And every year, there's going to be some outlier somewhere. And I think if you're in a broad mix of currencies and a broad mix of countries and geographies as a multinational, somewhere something is not going to be great. But the fundamentals of the markets, particularly for us in health care, are good. And yet translating that back during this period, it's unusual, it's frustrating. I mean, none of us have seen this kind of oil price in a couple of decades. None of us have seen this kind of currency pile on in a long time. So okay, that said, we all know that. Every multinational CEO has said it in the last 2 weeks in his earnings calls and we all see it, we're all experiencing it. Now going back to your next question. Has my expectation of our underlying momentum changed? No. Has my priority changed in terms of M&A activity? I'll tell you one thing about it that's changed a little bit. We've been looking at properties largely internationally. And I'd say, I'm probably balancing that a little bit back another way. I don't think -- in the past, I've looked pretty hard at a lot of expansion opportunities in branded generic pharmaceuticals and I think there are opportunities there. But I think as you and others what we've watched those valuations over the last year when deal heat churn and I can tell you that there was one particular one where we were involved in an auction for and the valuation that, that property went for -- we did not win it -- but the valuation that property went for was noneconomic. I mean, just plain noneconomic, right. I would challenge the buyer to explain where the economic return was in that particular deal. And they obviously have their reasons and they obviously saw something the rest of us didn't appreciate, I would say as an understatement. But the valuation are at a level in some cases that you have to question prudence. And I think at the end of the day, while we've got strategic reasons we want to expand our footprint in different places, those valuations when we deploy the capital on behalf of our shareholders have to make some sense. And I don't think that we are anymore -- I think we're prudent. I think we're disciplined. I think we've made good deals in the past. I think -- I've gone through so much of this where I've heard we paid too much, we didn't pay enough, we got a good deal, et cetera. But I think some of the things I saw last year said, boy, I don't think I minded losing that one. I don't think I minded not participating in that one. So I think right now -- first of all, I don't see a lot that people are offering up for sale in effect. And the old maximum -- maxim, everything is for sale at some price, well, the price that some of these things would be for sale at is imprudent. It's just imprudent. So I think you have to step back and say, we're not in that zone. We're not going to be that irrational in some cases and that's me. I mean, I hate that I'm going to see some of this in print later, but I think that. So you look at some of the currencies and some of the weakening of currencies, we would do a lot of those deals in local currency. In fact, almost all of them in local currency. And I'd say, based on where those currency rates are today, you can say it's time. This is the time because there's not as much currency risk in a purchase in that particular market, et cetera. But I think if I look at the mix of geographies and the mix of currencies and so forth that we currently have, I'm not sure our investors would applaud further wading toward it just now. And I think there's a timing issue here. I mean I would tell you, having said that, if there was the right opportunity and the right place and I believe that was strategically very important to us or a real opportunity for our investors and that the balance of what we foresaw in the growth of that market, the position, the currency and so forth was all lined up and the valuation looked good, I'd probably do that deal. But that was a stack up of a lot of ifs right now. So you'd say, what's changed? I'd say where I'm looking and what I'm considering, it hasn't changed. It's just shifted in some of its balance. I think it -- I've got all the same sort of pharmaceutical opportunities on my radar screen, but I'm prioritizing some others now that are maybe more important, I think, in this market, this environment in terms of strengthening our businesses. Now I've heard other CEO say the same thing. I've heard a lot of people say -- actually, I've mostly heard bankers say that it's a very robust. Everybody is out there trying to buy stuff market. I've heard it more from bankers than from other companies reporting. I don't think there's that many things out there for people to consider in our spaces. I don't think there's that many properties. I don't think there's that many assets. I don't think there's that much to consolidate. So I think it's fairly predictable, particularly for an analyst in this space, as you are, to predict the kinds of things that people are going to be looking at. There's not a lot out there to consider. So I think for us, we know what our strategic priorities are. We know what can help our business. We know where there's real pluses and opportunities and the question is whether or not the other parties, whoever they may be, see the same sort of opportunity and we can come together on an overlap of valuation and make something happen. And I know that sounds like textbook platitude, but that's really what it is. There's a lot of people at the dance looking at each other and trying to decide whether they want to dance. But I don't think there's that many opportunities to be made and everybody is in the same environment where they think their own valuations are low and they look at the valuations from last year that look kind of high, and I think you're in a zone where people are adjusting to what's my value. And so having said all that, am I any less focused on it? No, I'm probably more focused on it, if anything. But I'd say, we're also pretty analytical about what we can do with the businesses and what's the right valuation and what's the right timing and so forth because we don't get swept up in deal heat. We're fairly strategic about it. And I know that a lot of people think that a lot happened last year and we should have been in the mix of it, but I didn't see anything go by that I felt particularly bad about not being in the mix of. As I mentioned, there was one particular one we were in the hunt on and the valuation at the end was so high I don't mind missing it at all. So I realize that's a long ramble for you, Mike, but that probably gives you a fair degree of insight into how I'm thinking about it. We're definitely not inactive. That's for sure."

But we're committed to all 4 major segments that we have in the company. One of the important things about those segments is that they're in relative balance in terms of size, sales, profitability, et cetera. They've all got somewhat different dynamics and they've also got a lot in common. If you take EPD and Nutrition globally, they share a lot of channel dynamics and so forth, Devices, Diagnostics too. I mean there's a lot of different things going on with these businesses, but I'd say first is balance matters in the mix that is -- the investment identity of a company for an investor because you want to be a reliable performer steadily over time. And as you know, our proprietary pharma business fabulously grew to a terrific size and based on one product in particular, and so we were out of balance as a company and so we split into 2 companies. But we've got balance in these businesses. That said, I'd say from an M&A perspective in the places where we're looking, to be perfectly fair, we're not looking to do anything with regard to M&A in our Nutrition business today. I mean, if something came along opportunistically, we'd look at anything. But the fact is, that business is -- that's an organic business for us. Our -- all of our performance objectives and the things we want to do in the Nutrition business globally are organically driven and we think we're in a good position for all of that. So the kind of investments we'd be making in those businesses are more capital, plant, et cetera, in the right markets of the world and managing supply chain and so forth. The other 3 businesses are each a different tale. Diagnostics, I'd say, we got a very strong business here. It's actually a diverse business. There's a lot of segment to Diagnostics and if we opportunistically could add to it, we would. Obviously, all the criteria you'd look at have to make sense, but that's a business where we don't really have to but if we had opportunities, we look. EPD, similar. We've got a gem of a business there. And having done a lot of things to shape that business in the last several years, we are in the right growth markets. We're in high growth markets. We're in markets where the profitability and the market development, the retail facing, all the structural and channel dynamics for a brand of generics are good. We've identified, let's say, in priority, 15 countries in particular that meet all our criteria. And we've got strong positions in most of those, particularly important ones, and we're always looking to enhance our footprint in those markets if we can and expand our brands in those markets. Latin America was a great example of that. And so there's still many geographic opportunities to do so, but I always make the distinction for investors and others that it's really where we can distinctively differentiate branded generic pharmaceuticals, which means retail and channel and so forth like India and other Latin American countries and so forth. And so when we have those opportunities, it's great to add on, but what we've got as a core business now is a very strong branded generic international, largely focused in emerging market business where there's tremendous tailwind of market growth. So that's another one that's opportunistic. And then devices, I'd say it's some of both. We look at that. We'd always want to strengthen that business. We do wish to strengthen that business. There are a number of ways of doing that. Obviously, there's organic in-house and then there's our venture organization where we're building a number of small companies. We're investing in other early stage companies and so forth in building our pipelines for the future. And then finally, if opportunistically there's available opportunities where it fits our market segments and so forth, then there's always M&A. And so we're always mindful of those opportunities too, But that gives you a sense of how we think about each of those segments. If you said, well, would you think about something completely unrelated different? Probably not. There's too many opportunities to build or strengthen the ones we have and their needs from a strengthening standpoint vary. Some have more need to have more breadth of product than others and some are purely opportunistic, Kristen."

If you look at the markets around the world, not just the U.S., but literally every major country of the world, the markets have stabilized among competitors. Share doesn't move a lot. If it does, it moves a little. You know that the physicians in this space, they take a new product and they experiment with it a little bit and that's about it. I mean, the innovation here is at a point where I'd say the incremental value recognized by the health care system is limited. If you think about what drug-coated stents and so forth have done in the Vascular space, it's been a tremendous boon for the treatment of patients. But I think now what we see is this market is far more driven by costs than prices as either countries or hospital groups and others try to manage the overall cost of health care. So I think all of us see the same dynamics where we're increasingly challenged on more value proposition than just innovation. And I think increasingly the payer, whether it's a government or the purchasing people or insurer, whatever it is, are increasingly more influential here than the preference of physicians. You say, well, those aren't very good dynamics. Well, they're not bad dynamics either. We have to compete in this business just like we compete in a lot of other businesses. And I think we and our competitors in this business are all broadening our product lines or innovating in other surrounding spaces and broadening those offerings in this space and there's still a lot of room for innovation, but it may not be specifically just on the stent. So that -- and what behooves us is to expand our business and to some degree or to a large degree, that is M&A. And in our case, it's been a lot of small ball M&A and looking to expand around this businesses. MitraClip, Absorb, those kind of things are incremental, although MitraClip is very significant that way. We look at expanding into structural heart failure or heart failure or other categories and we're trying to build our breadth in those other -- let's say, surrounding spaces that way. I don't think that's very different for any of the companies in this business worldwide. I mean I think what's been difficult for any market that have the kind of robust innovation driven growth that this one did back in the early thousands, it's a different market today. It's a different market everywhere today. So is it a slower growth market? Yes. Is it still a very attractive market? Yes. It's still a very profitable market for all participants and it's why it gets a lot of pressure from a cost standpoint from the payers, et cetera. And I don't think that's a secret to anybody. So while others look at the performance of the business and say, gee, it's a little below our expectations. I'm beginning to think it's just all of us adjusting our expectations to sort of the reality of the value propositions in the market today. And so I think it's a very strong business. It's a very healthy one at least in that respect. We still invest quite substantially in R&D and innovations there and clinical trials and so forth. We've got innovations that are in R&D and in the clinical space and a lot of investments around it. So would it benefit from a much broader footprint? Well, it probably would. The question is, how to get to that broader footprint. And I think that in the, call it, Medical Device space broadly defined today, there's either a bunch of big companies or a bunch of little companies. There's not much in the middle and the couple of things in the middle are extremely highly valued relative to their current performance. And I think there's a lot of speculation or question about whether or not that kind of value will play out. So I think it will develop over time here. We've made a lot of investments in smaller companies and segments, as you know, whether at Tendyne or Cephea or others to expand our footprints here. And so I think -- I believe in the Medical Device space, right now and long term, but I don't think it'll be the same kind of space it was 10, 15 years ago."

And I recall at this very",1338,"Well, I think that's a good question. And I'd say what -- we always do everything we can to mitigate. Here's what's different this time. Last year, exchange was a strong headwind for any U.S.-based multinational across-the-board. And I recall at this very time last year from December to now, you'll recall both oil and exchange kind of sort of had a sudden hit except that the oil price drop at that point was at very high -- much higher level than where we are today. But there was this sudden hit in sort of late fourth quarter '14 and in early '15 and everybody scrambled to readjust their EPS guidance for the year to try to deal with what they saw coming as currency or was already happening. And a lot of companies dialed back to single digit or whatever and laid it on exchange and so forth, which was valid. In our case, we said we think we can navigate through it and we did. And we had extremely strong underlying growth of -- in our markets as we still do and it wasn't just double digits, it's been healthy double digit all year long. And so in our case, we were able to mitigate an awful lot of that exchange all year long and still deliver what was frankly very differentiated, higher growth than many, many of our peers, even multinational peers not in health care. And what we've got now is another year on top of that, okay, of the same sort of thing and if you look at the exchange rate graphs, who would have thought these exchange rates could, in a lot of cases, be even bigger, even bigger exchange rates or how we want to translate, stronger for us, weaker on the other side. And then on top of that nobody predicted $25 to $30 oil. Now that's a curveball for the whole world. And so when you throw that curveball in there, it dramatically unbalances the mix of your currencies because of the oil-based economies where lower oil prices really affect the underlying performance of the country. So you take a country like Russia or Venezuela or Saudi Arabia, now these are countries that are all strong countries for us. And to different degrees, they've been impacted by their own oil revenues and therefore their own ability to pay for products. Now having said that, is Russia still a strong market for us? It is. Do we have the same kind of difficulties in Russia that we have in Venezuela? We don't. It is a fundamentally good market, strong underlying market, et cetera. The only thing that's not strong is the ruble, which is dramatically weaker versus the dollar than even a year ago. And so there's this disproportionate imbalance in the pressures -- in the currency basket, if you will, from a little handful of countries where they already had currency and translation challenges just like the rest of the world, except that they have oil dependence on top of it, which amplifies it even more. And when you start to staff up all of those things, you'd say, okay, could we navigate through this? And the answer is, we could. I can cut a lot of expenses. I can delay a lot of investments. There's a lot of things that frankly I have the discretion to do, we as a company have the discretion to do. And I could then say to you, we'll either have 5% earnings growth or high single-digit earnings growth. But in our judgment, this year is so unusual this way with the ongoing depth of currency rolls and the unusual circumstance of oil prices and its impact on these economies that I would look at and say, I don't think it's prudent to compromise our ability to go after all this underlying growth for 1 year. In fact, it's more prudent to take out Venezuela out of the assumptions. It's more prudent to take that one out and keep right on going. And I think if you believe in the underlying strength of economies around the world, the ones that are delivering growth, and if you believe in the underlying growth of health care and those economies and you believe in the underlying growth of all our products at Abbott, and if you believe in Abbott's ability to continue to access all that growth, then my judgment was, okay, I'm going to roll out of pocket here, take Venezuela out of the assumption. I mean, if I hadn't taken Venezuela out of the assumptions, I'd be telling you right now that you're going to have mid-single-digit growth on the top and bottom line. And you know something, you'd think that was terrific in this environment. And if you compared it to all the other multinationals in our space or frankly other multinational space, you'd say that's right in there with everybody else. So in this case, we said, if I don't want to artificially compromise our investments in a lot of these businesses, whether it's an SG&A investment or R&D or whatever because of Venezuela. So I think I'm going to take that one out and keep right on going because I believe in the longer-term growth prospects of these economies and these businesses, and I'm not going to compromise that for a couple of quarters in Venezuela. So at the end of the day, could we manage through it? Yes and you know this. If you look back at even 10 years of track record at Abbott, we've absolutely been reliable at double-digit bottom line and high single digit top line unlike almost any other large diverse multinational out there. We've been a very reliable performer that way in a very diverse world. So I don't say all that defensively, even though it might sound that. I look at the world and say, man, this is like a total different circumstance than any of us have ever seen. And you have to kind of make a judgment of how far do I go to push off what we ought to be doing to sort of wait out this oddball storm we're in. And this oddball storm, I don't know -- I think there's a lot of people that would project oil prices are going to stay down for a long time. And yet everyone says, yes, but what is down? And at what point do these oil-driven economy start performing better? $60, $70, $50, there's different thresholds where the performance of those economy change dramatically for a lot of different businesses in the world, not just us. In our case, health care is pretty good no matter what the oil price is. The dynamics of a Venezuela are unique. They're unique. And even the Saudis, do they still spend on health care? Yes, they do. It's still a very strong important market for us and so is Russia and so on. So I don't know, that's a long roundabout way of saying, we made a deliberate decision. It was discretionary. Could I have made the decision to say, I'm going to deliver high single digit earnings growth no matter what? Yes, probably. But I would have had to compromise the underlying momentum in ways I didn't think was prudent. For exchange, yes, we can manage exchange. Venezuela? I think it's more prudent to just take Venezuela out of the mix in terms of what our expectations are and that's an unusual anomaly. I mean, I challenge you back to 2015, we lived through exchange. Can we live through exchange again? Yes, we can. Yes, we can. And the single biggest difference in our guidance for this year is actually Venezuela. I don't know if that answers your question or not, but that was my judgment. It's not an inability. It's more of a decision. If you look at our spending rates and stuff in our go-forward guidance, our spending rates are healthy."

You could be dead right about Venezuela, I don't know. I don't know, but here's the difference for us. We're a health care company and among our businesses, there are products that are medically necessary. And we have to pay attention to medically necessary. We don't have to lose money all the time. We're don't have to -- we don't have to be irrational for whatever reason, but we are mindful that we're a health care company. We are mindful that we have medically necessary products, we are mindful that we have been in Latin America and in Venezuela for decades. And a lot of times in the past in decades, foreign companies have exited those countries immediately when the economics turned sour. And the long-term commitment to that continent -- the governments of those countries and the health care systems in those countries, they know that and they recognize that. Abbott's never done that in 90 years in Latin America and we are a fundamentally large health care provider in Latin America. So our judgment was we'll make these decisions one step at a time as we see how circumstances develop. It's a pretty big decision that we've taken just to say we're going to take the sales and profit expectations out of our expectations for the year so that our investors -- frankly, you're getting -- the news today that we're taking it out of our expectations, right? And yet all I'm trying to do here is derisk your expectations, derisk your -- riding the roller coaster of volatility here in that particular country because that one's unique. And so we've just chosen to take it out of the estimates because we know we're going to continue to have medically necessary products there. But that's going to be in our view at a much lower commercial level than in the past. So for right now, Rick, I think that's the right prudent place to be. Could that change? I suppose. Anything could change. I mean I hope it changes more favorably, frankly, but I'm not whistling through the graveyard. I just know that they're in a very tough circumstance as a country and they're volatile. They are unpredictable and it's not a very reliable market as markets go. So I think this is the right step. You can say, well, shouldn't you just go a lot further? And I'd say, you could say that if you were just in some common industrial consumer or whatever good. But I don't think as a health care company you can quite do the same thing, so I think we have to be a little prudent here about the medically necessary part. That's why we're where we are. And Brian, you can address Rick's final comment there about underlying growth rate."

Today, we reported ongoing earnings per share of $0.41, exceeding our previous guidance range. Sales increased 5% in the quarter, led by strong performance in Diagnostics and Established Pharmaceuticals. As you know, we've been taking important strategic steps to expand our footprint in the world's fastest-growing geographies and have been investing in R&D that has resulted in numerous new product launches across our businesses. These actions and investments are driving our strong first quarter performance, which I'll briefly review by business. 
I'll start with Diagnostics where we achieved sales growth of 7% in the quarter, driven by continued above market performance in Core Laboratory and Point of Care Diagnostics. We continue to capture share and win new accounts with our customer-focused solutions, which we further enhanced with an unprecedented series of new instrument launches over the next few years. 
We continue to make great progress on a next generation Diagnostic Systems and Point of Care, immunoassay testing, clinical chemistry, hematology and blood screen. These new systems are being designed with the customer in mind, incorporating the features they deem most important, including increased automation, higher throughput and an enhanced user interface. We will provide more details and our launch plan to the systems in the coming quarters. 
In Nutrition, both pediatric and adult nutrition grew roughly 4.5% in the quarter, above market performance. And U.S. Pediatric Nutrition was led by strong performance of recently launched non-GMO products for infants and toddlers. Internationally, Pediatric Nutrition growth was led by continued share expansion of Eleva in the premium segment of the Chinese market, as well as continued strong growth in Russia and across several countries in Latin America. 
In Adult Nutrition, where Abbott is the global leader, sales growth was led by Ensure in the retail and institutional segments of the U.S. market, as well as double-digit growth in several Latin American countries, as we continue to expand the adult nutrition category globally. 
In Medical Devices, sales growth was led by 5.5% growth in Medical Optics, where we continue to capture share and drive growth in our portfolio of recently launched premium cataract lens products. Earlier this month, we opened a new manufacturing facility in Malaysia that is capable of producing over 4 million lenses a year to meet the growing demand for our products. 
In Diabetes Care, international sales growth of 11% was driven by continued consumer uptake of FreeStyle Libre in Europe. During the quarter, FreeStyle Libre received European approval for use in children and teens who can now manage their diabetes without the need for routine finger sticks. We expect growth in our diabetes business to accelerate in the coming quarters as we meet increasing demand for Libre from consumers and health care professionals. And we also look forward to bringing Libre to new markets including the U.S. 
In Vascular, modest growth in the quarter was led by double-digit growth of MitraClip, our market leading device for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation and strong performance in our Endovascular business, driven by vessel closure products and Supera, our unique peripheral stent for the treatment of blockages in the superficial femoral artery. 
And in Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, sales growth of 11%, was led by continued double-digit growth in India, which comprises more than 20% of EPD sales, including strong growth in the therapeutic areas of women's health, gastroenterology and cardio metabolics.  We Also achieve above market growth in China and several countries in Latin America as we continue to expand our presence and portfolios in these important geographies. 
Finally, given our performance in the first quarter, coupled with an improving exchange outlook, we are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance range to $2.14 to $2.24. 
So in summary, we're off to a good start this year with each of our 4 businesses having met or exceeded growth expectations for the quarter and with good progress on our new product initiatives. So I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian?"

Sales for the quarter increased 5.1% on an operational basis. Exchange had an unfavorable impact of 5.3% on sales, resulting in relatively flat reported sales in the quarter. Regarding other aspects of the P&L in the quarter, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 56.8% of sales. Adjusted R&D investment was nearly 7% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was nearly 34% of sales. 
Turning to the details of our full year 2016 outlook. We continue to forecast operational sales growth in the mid single-digits. Based on current exchange rates, we now expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 2% on our full year reported sales. This would result in reported sales growth in the low single-digits for the full year 2016.
We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 57% of sales for the full year, which includes underlying gross margin improvement initiatives across our business. We forecast adjusted R&D investment of around 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 30.5% of sales for the full year. This would result in full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $2.14 to $2.24 from continuing operations. 
For the second quarter, today, we are issuing ongoing earnings per share guidance of $0.52 to $0.54, reflecting double-digit underlying growth, offset by the impact of foreign exchange on our operating results. We forecast operational sales growth of mid single-digits in the second quarter. At current exchange rates, we'd expect a negative impact from exchange of around 3%, resulting in reported sales in the low single-digits. I'll now provide a quick overview of our second quarter operational sales growth outlook by business.
In Diagnostics, we forecast mid single-digit sales growth. In Nutrition, we forecast sales increase mid- to high single-digits. In Vascular, we forecast relatively flat sales growth. In Diabetes Care, we forecast mid single-digit sales growth. In Medical Optics, we forecast mid single-digit sales growth. And lastly, in Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast mid single-digit sales growth in the second quarter.
Turning back to the other aspects of the P&L. For the second quarter, we forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat above 57%, adjusted R&D investment somewhat above 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 31.5% of sales. And finally, for the second quarter, we project specified items of $0.14. 
Now with that, we'll open the call for questions."

First of all, you know that the exchange impact for us lags on the bottom line relative to the top line because it's got to pass through inventory, et cetera. So we do have that lag. And that's always like a little difficult for us to precisely call, and we get very close, but it;s always a little difficult for core depending on the currency of the world and depending on inventories and so forth and sales and sales mix in that given geography. And as you know, because we've got such a broad market basket of currencies, that's a little more difficult to call precisely and it does lag, as you already acknowledged. So while I'd say, look, I like what I'm starting to see as the easing in exchange. But given the last few years, I'm a superstitious person and I got to think the minute I think this is starting to go well, for some reason, we're going to get smacked down with some change in the market. For the last 2 years in the third and fourth quarter, we've seen some events, some economic events of some kind, alter the world's view of economies and then a change in exchange. And more recently last fall, it was a $30 oil. So if there is some caution in the raise, and I'd say if things don't -- if we get no curveballs, you're probably right. You call it the curveball discount there. I'm just waiting to see another quarter. And right now, I'd say all indicators are looking favorable for improvement as the year goes on. I actually want to see some of that improvement sustained. Meaning, economic conditions and exchange. And plus, I'm mindful of the fact that we made adjustments to our estimates here in the fourth quarter call 3 months ago that, that clearly, some of that has changed with exchange, but it can change in as little as a quarter. So with current circumstances of the world and what everybody is talking about in terms of real negative interest rates and so forth, that actually favors weaknesses in the dollar for us right now. And I hope that continues for some time here. But I just want to see some of it before I go further. Brian, do you want to weigh in on that?"

I'm asking because in the 10-K, earlier you guys disclose the contribution of your price businesses.

First of all, I think all your facts and all the stuff that you just quoted absolutely right. And I said there's a couple of things there. One, you know that in the last, call it, 2 years, certain countries, China, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, have taken unilateral government actions to pound down price of the multinationals in particular in those countries in reaction to price increases taken by multinational competitors in those countries over the prior few years. And our ability to be commercially successful around the world depends on healthy, happy markets and happy governments, in some cases. So I'd say to the extent that, that influences the degree to which companies are able to take price, I think that has some influence. I also think that there's the overall balance of consumer demand, consumer absorption, et cetera. And what I've been pushing with our team is that's compete on product and volume and share gain. The prices in the market for now, they're healthy. And to be truly competitively healthy, I think we have to be able to win share, with the shelf space, with the consumer, with the physician, with their recommendation, et cetera. And that's where we put a lot of our emphasis. So to the extent that we have not put further emphasis on price in the last couple of years, it's primarily to sharpen our own competitiveness and compete I'd say at a pretty effective level on all other dimensions. I think from a business fundamental standpoint, that's important. I want real growth, not just masked growth because we took price. But I think at the same time, the opportunity for us here is pretty good. I mean, these are healthy products. This is a robust segment business in all these countries. Profit is not challenged. And I think we're just drawing, call it, a little different balance in terms of how we want to be competitive versus relying on price alone or start too significantly in the mix. So I'd say have the dynamics intimidated price, I'd say dynamics have pushed price to a more appropriately balanced level. And in our case, I want the emphasis on real share gain and product growth and market segment growth. And to the extent that at some point, there's opportunity for price, we certainly know that. But I think price is easy and sometimes, too easy."

The only thing I'm cautious about, Bob, that I'd say is different, while I think there are opportunities, as I've said before in the pharmaceutical arena. And remember, we're only in the branded pharmaceutical -- branded generic pharmaceutical business in emerging markets. We're not in the U.S. or Europe in Pharmaceuticals. But in those markets, I have noted from time to time a lot of opportunities to add to our platform. We have, in that business, really strong positions in the markets we focused on and great depth and breadth. And I think we've chosen our countries well. I think we've chosen our breadth and depth well. So we've got an EPD that now, post shaping of the Europe business and so forth, is a pretty good jump. And there are other properties out there that will expand that footprint and add to it. However, in the last couple of years in particular, currency or exchange in those markets has been pretty heavy headwind. So -- and the expectations of value by potential properties or assets in those markets has been 25 to 30x EBITDA, which to be honest, is way out there and according to any kind of historic norm. So if you have to go pay that kind of a multiple and then translate back the dollars with a strong currency headwind, you really can't earn the return for your shareholders against that headwind that you need to if you're going to pay that kind of a multiple. So we have sidelined that to a degree. I think we can be selective about given markets. But we sidelined that while we pour emphasis and focus on other areas of Abbott's business in terms of what we're looking at or what we're interested in. It doesn't mean that we don't think there's wonderful properties in the pharma business. But we're much more selective about geography, what we think we can see as currency headwind, growth of market, et cetera, going forward here because I think we want to be prudent that we earn the return. To a high degree, we're always talking about the underlying growth of the business. Investors got to be able to spend the underlying growth. And we've got to be able to bring that underlying growth to the real bottom line. So while we do navigate a market basket of currencies in a volatile world economically ad we're diverse across all countries and we're emerging markets for their growth, I think we have to be prudent about where we invest and how we invest in those markets that we can bring back the returned that cause us to invest in those markets. So we've got of put that one, I'd say, partly on the back burner, but it depends on the country. And then, as you say, yes, it's a high priority for us, and we continue to look at opportunities in Devices and in Diagnostics, and those remain of interest to us. But I know it's a long-winded answer, but that's really how we're thinking about it."

The world rings a about slowing growth rates in China, and China went, what, 6.5%. And I think if any other country the world was growing 6.5%, we'll all be doing cartwheels and investing heavily. We wring our hands when a country as large as China slows to 6.5%. Even if China were at 5%, I think, it was pretty attractive. So I'd say, I think the growth rates, relatively speaking, are strong. I think you have to take into account here that historically, if one area of the world was struggling, other areas of the world were pretty strong. It's actually not the case right now. Everything has slowed some and for all the reasons we know. I think there's a lot of uncertainties around the world right now. And I could run through them, but we'll just be in a bad mood afterwards. And I think everybody's kind of waiting to see how some things turn out and whether exchange stays on certain frak, whether some countries kind of recover. I think people wait and see what happens with oil, and they're going to wait a while to see that. They're going to wait to see what happens with interest rates. There's a lot of handling, as I said, over negative interest rates. So there's going to be a lot of things that kind of hang on the world. And so how does that directly affects your business. Well, in health care, a lot of health care is funded by governments. And they need to ensure their populations and so forth and the health of their economies. But as you know, almost half our business is consumer direct in a fashion, so -- or consumer pay. So the health of those economies matter. I still believe and continue to believe China, India, Russia, these are all strong markets, notwithstanding the currency speed bumps that we have here the last couple of years. But these are strong markets. I think there's solid growth there. Countries like Venezuela, Brazil and some others are obviously of great concern for their own economic circumstances and volatility. I think Venezuela, as we've talked about plenty here, has been a real outlier that way. But I think the emerging markets represent real strong growth. I don't see that slowing. I think the kind of growth rate we see there drives pretty healthy expansion and investment by companies like us and Europeans and others as well. I mean, I think all those markets represent terrific growth, better than developed markets. But I also think, if you're innovative and you have new products and you have products that bring value to the health care system, I think the U.S. and Europe are also worthy markets for us and remain a focus. These are some of our most important markets. So because we're geographically diverse and we are multinational, I think they're all pretty healthy. And I think that's reflective right now in our top line, which is pretty strong relative to all the concerns that could express about the world's economies and economic growth. I mean, one of the best things about health care is even in poor economic times, people need health care at one level or another. So I'm pretty bullish about the opportunities for us. I think we've all adjusted. Industry-wide or even investor-wideWhite, to lower growth rates. Today, we talked about 5%. That's a pretty high growth rate. I have to say it feels pretty good and 11% feels really good on the top line and those kinds of things. And I can remember when that didn't feel so good because we were used to much higher growth rates. But frankly, in this global economy right now, those are pretty healthy returns. And we're conscious of the returns. So I'm still pretty positive about all this."

Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements.
Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Today, we reported ongoing earnings per share of $0.41, exceeding our previous guidance range. Sales increased 5% in the quarter, led by strong performance in Diagnostics and Established Pharmaceuticals. As you know, we've been taking important strategic steps to expand our footprint in the world's fastest-growing geographies and have been investing in R&D that has resulted in numerous new product launches across our businesses. These actions and investments are driving our strong first quarter performance, which I'll briefly review by business.
I'll start with Diagnostics, where we achieved sales growth of 7% in the quarter, driven by continued above-market performance in Core Laboratory and Point of Care Diagnostics. We continue to capture share and win new accounts with our customer-focused solutions, which we further enhanced with an unprecedented series of new instrument launches over the next few years.
We continue to make great progress on a next-generation diagnostic systems and Point of Care, immunoassay testing, clinical chemistry, hematology and blood screen. These new systems are being designed with the customer in mind, incorporating the features they deem most important, including increased automation, higher throughput and enhanced user interface. We will provide more details on our launch plan to these systems in the coming quarters.
In Nutrition, both pediatric and adult nutrition grew roughly 4.5% in the quarter, above-market performance. And U.S. Pediatric Nutrition was led by strong performance of recently launched non-GMO products for infants and toddlers. Internationally, Pediatric Nutrition growth was led by continued share expansion of Eleva in the premium segment of the Chinese market as well as continued strong growth in Russia and across several countries in Latin America.
In Adult Nutrition, where Abbott is the global leader, sales growth was led by Ensure in the retail and institutional segments of the U.S. market as well as double-digit growth in several Latin American countries as we continued to expand the Adult Nutrition category globally.
In Medical Devices, sales growth was led by 5.5% growth in Medical Optics, where we continue to capture share and drive growth in our portfolio of recently launched premium cataract lens products. Earlier this month, we opened a new manufacturing facility in Malaysia that is capable of producing over 4 million lenses a year to meet the growing demand for our products.
In Diabetes Care, international sales growth of 11% was driven by continued consumer uptake of FreeStyle Libre in Europe. During the quarter, FreeStyle Libre received European approval for use in children and teens who can now manage their diabetes without the need for routine finger sticks. We expect growth in our Diabetes business to accelerate in the coming quarters as we meet increasing demand for Libre from consumers and health care professionals, and we also look forward to bringing Libre to new markets including the U.S.
In Vascular, modest growth in the quarter was led by double-digit growth of MitraClip, our market-leading device for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation; and strong performance in our Endovascular business, driven by vessel closure products; and Supera, our unique peripheral stent for the treatment of blockages in the superficial femoral artery.
And in Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, sales growth of 11% was led by continued double-digit growth in India, which comprises more than 20% of EPD sales, including strong growth in the therapeutic areas of women's health, gastroenterology and cardiometabolics.  We also achieved above-market growth in China and several countries in Latin America as we continue to expand our presence and portfolios in these important geographies.
Finally, given our performance in the first quarter, coupled with an improving exchange outlook, we are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance range to $2.14 to $2.24.
So in summary, we're off to a good start this year with each of our 4 businesses having met or exceeded growth expectations for the quarter and with good progress on our new product initiatives. 
So I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian?"

Sales for the quarter increased 5.1% on an operational basis. Exchange had an unfavorable impact of 5.3% on sales, resulted in relatively flat reported sales in the quarter. Regarding other aspects of the P&L in the quarter, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 56.8% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was nearly 7% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was nearly 34% of sales.
Turning to the details of our full year 2016 outlook. We continue to forecast operational sales growth in the mid-single digits. Based on current exchange rates, we now expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 2% on our full year reported sales. This would result in reported sales growth in the low single digits for the full year 2016.
We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 57% of sales for the full year, which includes underlying gross margin improvement initiatives across our business. We forecast adjusted R&D investment of around 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 30.5% of sales for the full year. This would result in full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $2.14 to $2.24 from continuing operations.
For the second quarter, today, we are issuing ongoing earnings per share guidance of $0.52 to $0.54, reflecting double-digit underlying growth, offset by the impact of foreign exchange on our operating results. We forecast operational sales growth of mid-single digits in the second quarter. At current exchange rates, we'd expect a negative impact from exchange of around 3%, resulting in reported sales in the low single digits. 
I'll now provide a quick overview of our second quarter operational sales growth outlook by business.
In Diagnostics, we forecast mid-single-digit sales growth. In Nutrition, we forecast sales to increase mid- to high single digits. In Vascular, we forecast relatively flat sales growth. In Diabetes Care, we forecast mid-single-digit sales growth. In Medical Optics, we forecast mid-single-digit sales growth. And lastly, in Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast mid-single-digit sales growth in the second quarter.
Turning back to the other aspects of the P&L. For the second quarter, we forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat above 57%, adjusted R&D investment somewhat above 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 31.5% of sales.

First of all, you know that the exchange impact for us lags on the bottom line relative to the top line because it's got to pass through inventory, et cetera. So we do have that lag. And that's always a little difficult for us to precisely call, and we get very close. But it's always little difficult to precisely call depending on the currency of the world and depending on inventories and so forth and sales and sales mix in that given geography. And as you know, because we've got such a broad market basket of currencies, that's a little more difficult to call precisely and it does lag, as you've  already acknowledged. So while I'd say, look, I like what I'm starting to see as the easing in exchange. But given the last few years, and I'm a superstitious person and I think the minute I think this is starting to go well, for some reason, we're going to get smacked down with some change in the market. For the last 2 years in the third and fourth quarter, we've seen some events -- some economic events of some kind alter the world's view of economies and then a change in exchange. And more recently, last fall, it was $30 oil. So if there is some caution in the raise, and I'd say if things don't -- if we get no curveballs, you're probably right. You call it the curveball discount there. I'm just waiting to see another quarter. And right now, I'd say all indicators are looking favorable for improvement as the year goes on. I actually want to see some of that improvement sustained, meaning, economic conditions and exchange. And plus, I'm mindful of the fact that we made adjustments to our estimates here in the fourth quarter call 3 months ago that, that -- clearly, some of that has changed with exchange, but it can change in as little as a quarter. So with current circumstances of the world and what everybody is talking about in terms of real negative interest rates and so forth, that actually favors weakness of the dollar for us right now. And I hope that continues for some time here, but I just want to see some of it before I go further."

First of all, I think all your facts and all the stuff that you just quoted, absolutely right. And I say there's a couple of things there. One, you know that in the last, call it, 2 years, certain countries, China, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, have taken unilateral government actions to pound down price of the multinationals in particular in those countries in reaction to price increases taken by multinational competitors in those countries over the prior few years. And our ability to be commercially successful around the world depends on healthy, happy markets and happy governments, in some cases. So I'd say, to the extent that, that influences the degree to which companies are able to take price, I think that has some influence. I also think that there's the overall balance of consumer demand, consumer absorption, et cetera. And what I've been pushing with our team is let's compete on product and volume and share gain. The prices in the market for now, they're healthy. And to be truly competitively healthy, I think we have to be able to win share, with the shelf space, with the consumer, with the physician, with the recommendation, et cetera. And that's where we put a lot of our emphasis. So to the extent that we have not put further emphasis on price in the last couple of years, it's primarily to sharpen our own competitiveness and compete, I'd say, at a pretty effective level on all other dimensions. I think from a business fundamental standpoint, that's important. I want real growth, not just masked growth because we took price. But I think at the same time, the opportunity for us here is pretty good. I mean, these are healthy products. This is a robust segment of business in all these countries. Profit is not challenged. And I think we're just drawing, call it a little different balance in terms of how we want to be competitive versus relying on price alone or start too significantly in the mix. So I'd say we have the dynamics intimidated price, I'd say dynamics have pushed price to a more appropriately balanced level. And in our case, I want the emphasis on real share gain and product growth and market segment growth. And to the extent that at some point, there's opportunity for price. We certainly know that, but I think price is easy and sometimes too easy."

The only thing I'm cautious about, Bob, that I'd say, is different, while I think there are opportunities, as I've said before in the pharmaceutical arena. And remember, we're only in the branded pharmaceutical -- branded generic pharmaceutical business in emerging markets. We're not in the U.S. or Europe in pharmaceuticals. But in those markets, I have noted, from time to time, a lot of opportunities to add to our platform. We have, in that business, really strong positions in the markets we focused on and great depth and breadth. And I think we've chosen our countries well. I think we've chosen our breadth and depth well. So we've got an EPD that now, post shaping of the Europe business and so forth, is a pretty good jump. And there are other properties out there that would expand that footprint and add to it. However, in the last couple of years in particular, currency or exchange in those markets has been pretty heavy headwind. So -- and the expectations of value by potential properties or assets in those markets has been 25x to 30x EBITDA, which to be honest, is way out there according to any kind of historic norm. So if you have to go pay that kind of a multiple and then translate back the dollars with a strong currency headwind, you really can't earn the return for your shareholders against that headwind that you need to, if you're going to pay that kind of a multiple. So we have sidelined that to a degree. I think we can be selective about given markets. We sidelined that while we put our emphasis and focus on other areas of Abbott's business in terms of what we're looking at or what we're interested in. It doesn't mean that we don't think there's wonderful properties in the pharma business. But we're much more selective about geography, what we think we can see as currency headwind, growth of market, et cetera, going forward here because I think we want to be prudent that we earn the return. To a high degree, we're always talking about the underlying growth of the business. Investors got to be able to spend the underlying growth, and we got to be able to bring that underlying growth to the real bottom line. So while we do navigate a market basket of currencies in a volatile world economically and we're diverse across all countries and we're in emerging markets for their growth, I think we have to be prudent about when we invest and how we invest in those markets that we can bring back the return that it causes to invest in those markets. So we've got of put that one, I'd say, partly on the back burner, but it depends on the country. And then, as you say, yes, it's a high priority for us, and we continue to look at opportunities in Devices and in Diagnostics and those remain of interest to us. But I know it's a long-winded answer, but that's really how we're thinking about it."

The world wrings its hands about slowing growth rates in China, and China was 6.5%. And I think if any other country in the world was growing at 6.5%, we'd all be doing cartwheels and investing heavily. We wring our hands when a country as large as China slows to 6.5%. Even if China were at 5%, I think it was pretty attractive. So I'd say, I think the growth rates, relatively speaking, are strong. I think you have to take into account here that historically, if one area of the world was struggling, other areas of the world were pretty strong. It's actually not the case right now. Everything has slowed some and for all the reasons we know. I think there's a lot of uncertainties around the world right now, and I could run through them, but we'll just be in a bad mood afterwards. And I think everybody's kind of waiting to see how some things turn out and whether exchange stays on certain frak, whether some countries kind of recover. I think people are waiting to see what happens with oil, and they're going to wait a while to see that. They're going to wait to see what happens with interest rates. There's a lot of hindering, as I said, over negative interest rates. So there's going to be a lot of things that kind of hang on the world. So how does that directly affects your business? Well, in healthcare, a lot of healthcare is funded by governments. And they are the insurer of their populations and so forth and the health of their economies. And as you know, almost half our business is consumer-direct in the fashion. So -- or consumer pay. So the health of those economies matter. I still believe and continue to believe China, India, Russia, these are all strong markets, notwithstanding the currency speed bumps that we've had here in the last couple of years. But these are strong markets. I think there's solid growth there. Countries like Venezuela, Brazil and some others are obviously of great concern for their own economic circumstances and volatility. I think Venezuela, as we talked about plenty here, has been a real outlier that way, but I think the emerging markets represent real strong growth. I don't see that slowing. I think the kind of growth rate we see there drives pretty healthy expansion and investment by companies like us and Europeans and others as well. I mean, I think all those markets represent terrific growth better than developed markets. But I also think, if you're innovative and you have new products and you have products that bring value to the healthcare system, I think the U.S. and Europe are also worthy markets for us and remain a focus. These are some of our most important markets. So because we're geographically diverse and we are multinational, I think they're all pretty healthy. And I think that's reflected right now in our top line, which is pretty strong relative to all the concerns that could express about the world's economies and economic growth. And one of the best things about healthcare is even in poor economic times, people need healthcare at one level or another. So I'm pretty bullish about the opportunities for us. I think we all adjusted, industry-wide or even investor-wide to lower growth rates. And today, we talk about 5%, I guess, a pretty high growth rate. And I have to say it feels pretty good, and 11% feels really good on the top line and those kinds of things. And I can remember when that didn't feel so good because we were used to much higher growth rates. But frankly, in this global economy right now, those are pretty healthy returns, and we're conscious of the returns. So I'm still pretty positive about all this."

So as you know, we've been growing 100, 200 operating basis points per year on an underlying business, and we continue to see that performance in 2016. Clearly, as you said, we've made great progress in Nutrition as well as Diagnostics as where they stand today. But that's not to say if there is an additional opportunity, it may not come through at the same pace that you are accustomed to seeing it, but there's still, as we believe, remaining opportunity in these businesses to continuously improve our margins. Over the longer term, we have some businesses, like established Pharma. Clearly, there's opportunity there in the coming years. So we see that, that could be a driver as part of our contribution. And don't forget to -- we are still working through the phases of what we're doing from a G&A, taking out the unproductive spend around the world when it comes to how we operate and support our businesses, what's the right shape and what's the right size. So I think taken all these things into consideration, David, we're still targeting around the same range that you have been seeing on an underlying business. Now FX, as you know, is muting at this year, but the underlying is still there."

And we do have -- we're going to have to lap Venezuela because that was a pretty significant piece for EPD, given CFR there and so forth. And I'm trying to think where else. I mean, the currency, I guess, is an issue in a number of countries, particularly Russia. And I'm just cycling through all the ups and downs. There are quarter-to-quarter variances depending on GE.

Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2016. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements.
Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. Please note that first quarter financial results and guidance provided on the call today for sales, EPS, and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only.
On today's call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filing from today, which will be available on our website at Abbott.com. Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange unless otherwise noted.

Today, we reported ongoing earnings per share of $0.41, exceeding our previous guidance range. Sales increased 5% in the quarter, led by strong performance in Diagnostics and Established Pharmaceuticals. As you know, we've been taking important strategic steps to expand our footprint in the world's fastest-growing geographies and have been investing in R&D that has resulted in numerous new product launches across our businesses. These actions and investments are driving our strong first quarter performance, which I'll briefly review by business.
I'll start with Diagnostics, where we achieved sales growth of 7% in the quarter, driven by continued above-market performance in Core Laboratory and Point of Care Diagnostics. We continue to capture share and win new accounts with our customer-focused solutions, which we further enhanced with an unprecedented series of new instrument launches over the next few years.
We continue to make great progress on a next-generation diagnostic systems and Point of Care, immunoassay testing, clinical chemistry, hematology and blood screen. These new systems are being designed with the customer in mind, incorporating the features they deem most important, including increased automation, higher throughput and enhanced user interface. We'll provide more details on our launch plan to these systems in the coming quarters.
In Nutrition, both pediatric and adult nutrition grew roughly 4.5% in the quarter, above-market performance. And U.S. Pediatric Nutrition was led by strong performance of recently launched non-GMO products for infants and toddlers. Internationally, Pediatric Nutrition growth was led by continued share expansion of Eleva in the premium segment of the Chinese market as well as continued strong growth in Russia and across several countries in Latin America.
In Adult Nutrition, where Abbott is the global leader, sales growth was led by Ensure in the retail and institutional segments of the U.S. market as well as double-digit growth in several Latin American countries as we continue to expand the Adult Nutrition category globally.
In Medical Devices, sales growth was led by 5.5% growth in Medical Optics, where we continue to capture share and drive growth in our portfolio of recently launched premium cataract lens products. Earlier this month, we opened a new manufacturing facility in Malaysia that is capable of producing over 4 million lenses a year to meet the growing demand for our products.
In Diabetes Care, international sales growth of 11% was driven by continued consumer uptake of FreeStyle Libre in Europe. During the quarter, FreeStyle Libre received European approval for use in children and teens who can now manage their diabetes without the need for routine finger sticks. We expect growth in our Diabetes business to accelerate in the coming quarters as we meet increasing demand for Libre from consumers and health care professionals, and we also look forward to bringing Libre to new markets including the U.S.
In Vascular, modest growth in the quarter was led by double-digit growth of MitraClip, our market-leading device for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation; and strong performance in our Endovascular business, driven by vessel closure products; and Supera, our unique peripheral stent for the treatment of blockages in the superficial femoral artery.
And in Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, sales growth of 11% was led by continued double-digit growth in India, which comprises more than 20% of EPD sales, including strong growth in the therapeutic areas of women's health, gastroenterology and cardiometabolics. We also achieved above-market growth in China and several countries in Latin America as we continue to expand our presence and portfolios in these important geographies.
Finally, given our performance in the first quarter, coupled with an improving exchange outlook, we are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance range to $2.14 to $2.24.
So in summary, we're off to a good start this year with each of our 4 businesses having met or exceeded growth expectations for the quarter and with good progress on our new product initiatives. 
So I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian?"

Sales for the quarter increased 5.1% on an operational basis. Exchange had an unfavorable impact of 5.3% on sales, resulting in relatively flat reported sales in the quarter. Regarding other aspects of the P&L in the quarter, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 56.8% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was nearly 7% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was nearly 34% of sales.
Turning to the details of our full year 2016 outlook. We continue to forecast operational sales growth in the mid-single digits. Based on current exchange rates, we now expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 2% on our full year reported sales. This would result in reported sales growth in the low single digits for the full year 2016.
We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 57% of sales for the full year, which includes underlying gross margin improvement initiatives across our business. We forecast adjusted R&D investment of around 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 30.5% of sales for the full year. This would result in full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $2.14 to $2.24 from continuing operations.
For the second quarter, today, we are issuing ongoing earnings per share guidance of $0.52 to $0.54, reflecting double-digit underlying growth, offset by the impact of foreign exchange on our operating results. We forecast operational sales growth of mid-single digits in the second quarter. At current exchange rates, we'd expect a negative impact from exchange of around 3%, resulting in reported sales in the low single digits. 
I'll now provide a quick overview of our second quarter operational sales growth outlook by business.
In Diagnostics, we forecast mid-single-digit sales growth. In Nutrition, we forecast sales to increase mid- to high single digits. In Vascular, we forecast relatively flat sales growth. In Diabetes Care, we forecast mid-single-digit sales growth. In Medical Optics, we forecast mid-single-digit sales growth. And lastly, in Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast mid-single-digit sales growth in the second quarter.
Turning back to the other aspects of the P&L. For the second quarter, we forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat above 57%, adjusted R&D investment somewhat above 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 31.5% of sales. 
And finally, for the second quarter, we project specified items of $0.14.
And now with that, we'll open the call for questions."

First of all, you know that the exchange impact for us lags on the bottom line relative to the top line because it's got to pass through inventory, et cetera. So we do have that lag. And that's always a little difficult for us to precisely call, and we get very close. But it's always little difficult to precisely call depending on the currency of the world and depending on inventories and so forth and sales and sales mix in that given geography. And as you know, because we've got such a broad market basket of currencies, that's a little more difficult to call precisely and it does lag, as you've already acknowledged. So while I'd say, look, I like what I'm starting to see as the easing in exchange. But given the last few years, I'm a superstitious person and I think the minute I think this is starting to go well, for some reason, we're going to get smacked down with some change in the market. For the last 2 years in the third and fourth quarter, we've seen some events -- some economic events of some kind alter the world's view of economies and then a change in exchange. And more recently, last fall, it was $30 oil. So if there is some caution in the raise, and I'd say if things don't -- if we get no curveballs, you're probably right. You call it the curveball discount there. I'm just waiting to see another quarter. And right now, I'd say all indicators are looking favorable for improvement as the year goes on. I actually want to see some of that improvement sustained, meaning, economic conditions and exchange. And plus, I'm mindful of the fact that we made adjustments to our estimates here in the fourth quarter call 3 months ago that, that -- clearly, some of that has changed with exchange, but it can change in as little as a quarter. So with current circumstances of the world and what everybody is talking about in terms of real negative interest rates and so forth, that actually favors weakness of the dollar for us right now. And I hope that continues for some time here, but I just want to see some of it before I go further."

And I think back in 2012, it was a 4.5% contributor to the top line growth of the business; 2013 was 3.2%; and 2014, it was basically 1%; last year, it was 0%. So the contribution from prices has, obviously, eroded over time. And we hear the Mead Johnson calls, we hear the Danone calls talking about pricing pressure in China and other markets.

First of all, I think all your facts and all the stuff that you just quoted, absolutely right. And I say there's a couple of things there. One, you know that in the last, call it, 2 years, certain countries, China, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, have taken unilateral government actions to pound down price of the multinationals in particular in those countries in reaction to price increases taken by multinational competitors in those countries over the prior few years. And our ability to be commercially successful around the world depends on healthy, happy markets and happy governments, in some cases. So I'd say, to the extent that, that influences the degree to which companies are able to take price, I think that has some influence. I also think that there's the overall balance of consumer demand, consumer absorption, et cetera. And what I've been pushing with our team is let's compete on product and volume and share gain. The prices in the market for now, they're healthy. And to be truly competitively healthy, I think we have to be able to win share, with the shelf space, with the consumer, with the physician, with the recommendation, et cetera. And that's where we put a lot of our emphasis. So to the extent that we have not put further emphasis on price in the last couple of years, it's primarily to sharpen our own competitiveness and compete, I'd say, at a pretty effective level on all other dimensions. I think from a business fundamental standpoint, that's important. I want real growth, not just masked growth because we took price. But I think at the same time, the opportunity for us here is pretty good. I mean, these are healthy products. This is a robust segment of business in all these countries. Profit is not challenged. And I think we're just drawing, call it a little different balance in terms of how we want to be competitive versus relying on price alone or start too significantly in the mix. So I'd say, have the dynamics intimidated price? I'd say dynamics have pushed price to a more appropriately balanced level. And in our case, I want the emphasis on real share gain and product growth and market segment growth. And to the extent that at some point, there's opportunity for price, we certainly know that, but I think price is easy and sometimes too easy."

The only thing I'm cautious about, Bob, that I'd say, is different, while I think there are opportunities, as I've said before in the pharmaceutical arena. And remember, we're only in the branded pharmaceutical -- branded generic pharmaceutical business in emerging markets. We're not in the U.S. or Europe in pharmaceuticals. But in those markets, I have noted, from time to time, a lot of opportunities to add to our platform. We have, in that business, really strong positions in the markets we focused on and great depth and breadth. And I think we've chosen our countries well. I think we've chosen our breadth and depth well. So we've got an EPD that now, post shaping of the Europe business and so forth, is a pretty good jump. And there are other properties out there that would expand that footprint and add to it. However, in the last couple of years in particular, currency or exchange in those markets has been pretty heavy headwind. So -- and the expectations of value by potential properties or assets in those markets has been 25 to 30x EBITDA, which to be honest, is way out there according to any kind of historic norm. So if you have to go pay that kind of a multiple and then translate back the dollars with a strong currency headwind, you really can't earn the return for your shareholders against that headwind that you need to, if you're going to pay that kind of a multiple. So we have sidelined that to a degree. I think we can be selective about given markets. We sidelined that while we put our emphasis and focus on other areas of Abbott's business in terms of what we're looking at or what we're interested in. It doesn't mean that we don't think there's wonderful properties in the pharma business. But we're much more selective about geography, what we think we can see as currency headwind, growth of market, et cetera, going forward here because I think we want to be prudent that we earn the return. To a high degree, we're always talking about the underlying growth of the business. Investors got to be able to spend the underlying growth, and we got to be able to bring that underlying growth to the real bottom line. So while we do navigate a market basket of currencies in a volatile world economically and we're diverse across all countries and we're in emerging markets for their growth, I think we have to be prudent about when we invest and how we invest in those markets that we can bring back the return that it costs us to invest in those markets. So we've got of put that one, I'd say, partly on the back burner, but it depends on the country. And then, as you say, yes, it's a high priority for us, and we continue to look at opportunities in Devices and in Diagnostics and those remain of interest to us. But I know it's a long-winded answer, but that's really how we're thinking about it."

The world wrings its hands about slowing growth rates in China, and China was 6.5%. And I think if any other country in the world was growing at 6.5%, we'd all be doing cartwheels and investing heavily. We wring our hands when a country as large as China slows to 6.5%. Even if China were at 5%, I think it was pretty attractive. So I'd say, I think the growth rates, relatively speaking, are strong. I think you have to take into account here that historically, if one area of the world was struggling, other areas of the world were pretty strong. It's actually not the case right now. Everything has slowed some and for all the reasons we know. I think there's a lot of uncertainties around the world right now, and I could run through them, but we'd just be in a bad mood afterwards. And I think everybody's kind of waiting to see how some things turn out and whether exchange stays on certain track, whether some countries kind of recover. I think people are waiting to see what happens with oil, and they're going to wait a while to see that. They're going to wait to see what happens with interest rates. There's a lot of hammering, as I said, over negative interest rates. So there's going to be a lot of things that kind of hang on the world. You say, well how does that directly affects your business? Well, in health care, a lot of health care is funded by governments. And they are the insurer of their populations and so forth and the health of their economies. And as you know, almost half our business is consumer-direct in the fashion. So -- or consumer pay. So the health of those economies matter. I still believe and continue to believe China, India, Russia, these are all strong markets, notwithstanding the currency speed bumps that we've had here in the last couple of years. But these are strong markets. I think there's solid growth there. Countries like Venezuela, Brazil and some others are obviously of great concern for their own economic circumstances and volatility. I think Venezuela, as we talked about plenty here, has been a real outlier that way, but I think the emerging markets represent real strong growth. I don't see that slowing. I think the kind of growth rate we see there drives pretty healthy expansion and investment by companies like us and Europeans and others as well. I mean, I think all those markets represent terrific growth better than developed markets. But I also think, if you're innovative and you have new products and you have products that bring value to the health care system, I think the U.S. and Europe are also worthy markets for us and remain a focus. These are some of our most important markets. So because we're geographically diverse and we are multinational, I think they're all pretty healthy. And I think that's reflected right now in our top line, which is pretty strong relative to all the concerns that have been expressed about the world's economies and economic growth. I mean one of the best things about health care is even in poor economic times, people need health care at one level or another. So I'm pretty bullish about the opportunities for us. I think we've all adjusted, industry-wide or even investor-wide to lower growth rates. And today, we talk about 5%, I guess, a pretty high growth rate. And I have to say it feels pretty good, and 11% feels really good on the top line and those kinds of things. And I can remember when that didn't feel so good because we were used to much higher growth rates. But frankly, in this global economy right now, those are pretty healthy returns, and we're conscious of the returns. So I'm still pretty positive about all this."

It's just bumpy. Now overall, it's all up, and it's all good. We like that, but any given quarter can have a curveball in it or a comparison last year. So I'd say the underlying fundamentals are all strong here. And we do have -- we're going to have to lap Venezuela because that was a pretty significant piece for EPD, given CFR there and so forth. And I'm trying to think where else. I mean, the currency, I guess, is an issue in a number of countries, particularly Russia. And I'm just cycling through all the ups and downs. There are quarter-to-quarter variances depending on GE. The tender didn't happen in March, it happened in April, that kind of thing. So I think underlying, there is pretty solid strong growth."

Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2016. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements.
Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. Please note that second quarter financial results and guidance provided on the call today for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only.
On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filing from today, which will be available on our website at abbott.com. Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange unless otherwise noted.
As you recall, Abbott issued a press release on April 28, 2016 announcing the transaction of St. Jude Medical. Please prefer to that release for additional important information about Abbott, St. Jude and related matters. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles."

Today, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.55 above our guidance range. Sales increased 6.5% in the quarter, led by strong performance in Established Pharmaceuticals, Medical Devices and Diagnostics. As you know, earlier in the quarter, we took an important strategic step with our announcement to acquire St. Jude Medical. Abbott and St. Jude combined were the highly competitive medical device portfolio, including an industry-leading new product pipeline across cardiovascular, neuromodulation, diabetes and Vision Care. 
This strategic action builds upon the steps we've taken to achieve critical mass and leadership positions across each of our 4 businesses. In Diagnostics and Nutrition, where we hold market-leading positions today, we've been investing in R&D and infrastructure in high-growth geographies that have strengthened our global scale and competitiveness. And in the Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, we've taken a number of strategic steps over the last couple of years to position our business for long-term growth. EPD now operates entirely in emerging geographies and hold the leading positions in many of the largest and fastest growing pharmaceutical markets for branded generics in the world, including India, Russia and Latin America. All 4 of our businesses will now hold leading positions in large and growing markets that are aligned with health care and demographic plans, providing a strong foundation to deliver top tier growth over the long term. 
I'll now briefly review our second quarter results and I'll start with Diagnostics, where we achieved sales growth of 6% in the quarter, driven by continued above-market performance in Core Laboratory and Point of Care Diagnostics. 
Our Diagnostics business has been a solid and continuos outperformer in the company and in its industry over the past several years. There's an opportunity here to further maintain, if not include upon this growth trajectory, as we prepare to bring multiple next generation systems to market across every area of diagnostics where we participate. We'll provide more details on these systems in our launch plans during the second half of the year. 
In Nutrition, sales grew around 4.5% in the quarter or more than 6%, excluding the impact of Venezuela. Growth in the quarter was led by U.S. pediatric and international adult nutrition. In the U.S, above-market performance in Pediatric Nutrition was driven by continued growth of recently launched products, including non-GMO products for infants and toddlers. In Adult Nutrition, double-digit international growth were led by Ensure and continued expansion of the adult nutrition market where Abbott is a global leader. 
In Medical Devices, sales growth in our Vascular business was led by share gains in our core stent business and double-digit growth of MitraClip, our market-leading device for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation. Our Endovascular business also contributed another quarter of strong growth, driven by vessel closure products and Supera, our unique peripheral stent for the treatment of blockages and the like. And earlier this month, we received FDA approval for Absorb, the only fully dissolving vascular stent. This first of its kind product is an important addition to our market-leading drug-eluting stent portfolio in the U.S.
In Medical Optics, sales growth of 5.5% was led by double-digit growth in our cataract products business, where we continue to capture share and drive growth with our portfolio of premium cataract lens products. 
Last week, we further strengthened our portfolio in the U.S. with the FDA approval for our tech the Symfony lenses, the first and only lenses that provide a full range of continuous, high-quality vision following cataract surgery. 
In Diabetes Care, international sales growth of more than 15% was driven by continued consumer uptake of our new and innovative FreeStyle Libre device in Europe. We continue to see strong demand as consumers and health care professionals become increasingly aware of the many benefits of this innovative device. There are now more than 125,000 patients utilizing FreeStyle Libre in Europe, and we're working to bring this novel technology to new markets, including the United States.
And in Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, our strategy of targeting key geographies with a broad portfolio across select therapeutic areas continues to deliver strong results. Sales growth of 9.5% or 14%, excluding the impact of Venezuela, was led by balanced growth across several markets, including India, China and several countries in Latin America. The acquisitions and subsequent integrations of both CFR Pharmaceuticals and Veropharm have exceeded our expectations and are contributing to strong growth overall. 
So in summary, it was a good quarter, and we're particularly please with a steady cadence of new product approvals on recent launches that are contributing to growth, including FreeStyle Libre, MitraClip, Absorb and Symfony. And we took another important step to strengthen our strategic position and long-term growth potential with our announced acquisition of St. Jude Medical. 
I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian?"

Sales for the quarter increased 6.4% on an operational basis, that is excluding an unfavorable impact of 3.3% [ph] in foreign exchange. The negative impact from exchange was somewhat higher than previous expectations due to modest strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in the quarter. Reported sales increased 3.2% in the quarter. 
Regarding other aspects of the P&L in the quarter, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 57.6% of sales, somewhat above our previous guidance. Adjusted R&D investment was 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 31.6% of sales, each in line with previously issued guidance.
Turning to our outlook for the full year 2016. Our adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $2.14 to $2.24 from continuing operations remains unchanged and reflects double-digit underlying growth, offset by the impact of foreign exchange on our operating results. We continue to forecast operational sales growth in the mid single-digits for the full year. Based on current exchange rates, we expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 2.5% on our full year reported sales, somewhat higher than previous expectations of negative 2%. This would result in recorded sales growth in the low single-digits for the full year 2016.
We continue to forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 57% of sales for the full year, which includes underlying gross margin improvement initiatives across our businesses. We forecast adjusted R&D investment of around 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of approaching 31% of sales for the full year. We now forecast net interest expense of around $100 million, reflecting changes in interest rate assumptions on both our borrowing rates for debt and the income we earn on some of our investments, and around $35 million of nonoperating expense.
Turning to our outlook for the third quarter. We forecast adjusted earnings per share of $0.57 to $0.59. Again, reflecting double-digit underlying growth, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange on our results. We forecast operational sales growth of mid single-digits in the third quarter. In our current change rates, we expect the negative impact from exchange of around 1.5%.
Turning to other aspects of the P&L. For the third quarter, we forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio somewhat above 57%, adjusted R&D investment around 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 30% of sales. 
Finally, we project specified items of $0.19 in the third quarter, reflecting the same items as we identified for the full year in our earnings release. Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide a quick overview of our third quarter and full year operational sales growth outlook by business.
For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast high single-digit sales growth for both the third quarter and full year. In Nutrition, we forecast low- to mid single-digit sales growth for both the third quarter and full year. In Diagnostics, we forecast mid single-digit sales growth for both the third quarter and full year. And lastly, in our Medical Devices businesses, we now forecast low single-digit sales growth for both the third quarter and the full year. In Diabetes, we forecast high single-digit growth for the third quarter and mid single-digit sales growth for the full year. And in Medical Optics, we forecast low to mid single-digit for the third quarter and mid single-digit sales growth for the full year.
With that, we will now open the call for questions."

Let me deal with the transactions first and I'll go right into the one that you targeted, Alere. From our perspective, there's been no change. They still haven't filed a 10-K. Our access to information has been limited. And they did put out a press release with an update that I think was at least, from my perspective, over enthusiastically embraced from one of their analysts. But to that extent, they put out, basically provided no particular information and was a requirement they had with their bondholders for the extensions they got on the requirements in their agreements. And the information they put out was characterized as preliminary, unaudited, similarly, only, et cetera. So I think, from our perspective, no change other than the passage of time. And that's about all I can say about it at this point. So I mean, I'm not an odds predictor here. So I have no particular prediction to make other than the information that's here and there's no more really to say about it since the last time you asked me the question. 
So moving to St. Jude. I'd say everything is tracking well. We've got a second request from the FTC, which will certainly respond to you. I'd say there's not much in a way of surprises there. All of our planning going forward is going according to plan. There's no surprises, no negatives. Their performance appears to be tracking according to our forecast, our expectations and for their forecast. In fact, I'd say there are report this morning looks to me like their best quarter in about the last 6 anyway. And they're trending in the right directions as we predicted and forecasted and saw in our due diligence. So I'd say with regard to St. Jude, everything is tracking well. We still hope to close that by before year-end. I think that will be close call just as we work our way through the administrative of the FTC's request and so forth and whatever we may have to do there. But I'd say there's no big surprises at all. We're just going to try and complete the work that we've already indicated, and everything there is tracking according to plan. 
With regard to the mix of business, I'd say you can see in our numbers, it's a strong quarter across the board, across the world in all of our businesses but one. And the nutrition business is weaker. And the weakness is primarily focused on China pediatric, really nowhere else. And what's been not only forecasted by some of our global competitors, but also our own experience, has been a slowing of growth in the China pediatric market. 
Last year, at this time, think that market was probably 13%, 14% growth estimated. And this year, it's probably just under half that, it would be our estimate. And I think that's probably consistent with what some of our competitors have seen or expressed as well. But we're seeing about half the growth rate as a market rate that we've seen in the past. And that's clearly softening the sales growth rate. And we've seen that, and we are seeing that. We have not yet seen in any data that there's any share change that's impacting us, but our growth rate is clearly slower. So I'm a little cautious on the second half. I don't expect that to change on this particular business. I don't expect that growth rates or that, let's just it softness. It's not softness in terms of decline, it's slower growth. It's still a pretty healthy growth rate compared to anywhere else in the word. And its good growth rate. It's just not the double-digit growth rate it was last year or the year before. And as you know, that market has been a pretty high grower from a growth rate standpoint for quite some time. So that's an adjustment to -- for all of us to adjust to. I don't know whether that's a long-term change in the market. I know that there's an increasing breast-feeding rate in China. But in terms of other fundamentals, we see channel shifts and so forth. But channel shifts shouldn't impact the overall market over time here. So other than the dynamics of just slower growth or slowing demand, I'd say that's about the best way I can characterize it. The -- as I said, the market growth is 6% is still a healthy rate. It's just not the one that we've been used to and enjoyed for the past several years."

And we're starting to see those roll out now and we will see over the next, let's say, 2, 3 years. First of all, we just launched AlinIQ, which is an informatics program that is designed to help labs with productivity and their own cost management and so forth, which we think is going to be exceptionally well received. That's launched. Following that, we've got 5 systems coming. There's a next-generation system in our point of care business that will begin to launch in Europe in the second half of this year, probably in the fourth quarter, then in the U.S. in 2017. Then the core lab systems and clinical chemistry testing will begin to roll out as well. We expect European launch before the end of the year and the U.S. in '18, early in '18. Blood screening, same thing, late in the year in Europe, late this year in Europe, brand-new system. Beyond that, hematology the following year, '17, early '17 in Europe, and then all of these early on in 2018 in the U.S. and then, finally, in our molecular business in the second half of '17, we begin to roll out a new system in Europe. So that's a lot and that's unprecedented. No company in our business has ever put that many new systems out there. They're not just refreshments. They're not just software updates or upgrades or incremental improvements on existing systems. They are all complete new refresh systems or redone and some new advantages and so forth. So we're pretty excited about the entire product line. Diagnostics has been doing really well with the mature products in its line. And when you think about the complete line of new products coming over the next couple of years to that business, I think that's just really a great shot in our armed there for our businesses been outperforming as it is anyway. Customers will start to see those systems at the ACC conference in Philadelphia in later this month. At a number of the industry trade shows in U.S. and Europe, we'll clearly be some macro systems to customers, so they got a preview in advance. So I think the future for diagnostics looks pretty good."

A lot of the pushback that I get in talking about the acquisitions that St. Jude, Alere, it seems to revolve around a few points that both are challenged, even troubled assets that you're taking on too much integration, challenged once, the uncertainty around and equity raise, the lack of certainty around how Abbott will add value improve or better run, particularly St. Jude. And maybe a little lack of clarity about the Abbott's senior management team, how that's going to change, who's going to lead the effort and again, particularly on the device side. while I personally don't agree with these thoughts. I'd be curious just looking at the big picture here again, given your long track record of successful opportunistic M&A, how is St. Jude, Alere set up better or worse than some of the past challenges you faced? Why are these the right deals after a few months of thinking about it? What needs to be done to Ensure that these are the right moves today for Abbott shareholders?"

And I understand the sentiments of investors in general. I mean, I think that, first of all, I'd say there's, if not a skeptical cautious attitude on the part of investors, just about everything, not particular to Abbott",1922,"Well, I'd say a couple of things. And I understand the sentiments of investors in general. I mean, I think that, first of all, I'd say there's, if not a skeptical cautious attitude on the part of investors, just about everything, not particular to Abbott or specific to Abbott, but I think this just a lot of caution out there. All that fluffy, robust enthusiasm of 1.5 year ago is definitely not there now and yet the market is in a near high. But in our business, that businesses, that enthusiasm or at least that attitude, doesn't seem to be that lit up. So we take -- we put this in the context of all that. I think what I find in the feedback from investors is they just want a lot more clarity and a lot more visibility so that they can forecast our model or know where all this system go. Because I can put a historic -- I can lean on historical track record and say, ""Hey, look, AML wasn't a great performing business when we bought it. But right now, it is doing exceptionally well."" The assets we assembled as EPD were not at the time, great asset. At SASE CFR was a pretty great asset. But a lot of the assets that we put together weren't necessarily sort of performing assets. And right now, I'd say we've got one of the gems in the branded generic business globally because of the markets and the things we're in. I think the track record of how we integrate or how we manage our businesses is proven. We're not intimidated at all by the integration. Frankly, that part I think we've shown we're really good at We've got an experienced team in place. I'm not worried about that at all. And frankly, in the case of St. Jude, the organizations are so well aligned, and I think that one went well extremely well and it's extremely smoothly. I don't consider St. Jude to be a particularly challenged organization. I think that they've got a great pipeline of products. I think they've got a lot of good products. They went through a very significant organization structural change over the last 2 years that I think proved to be somewhat disruptive to the operation of the organization. We're well aware of that. We're well aware of what it meant, how it works, et cetera. But understanding that, I think we've got a pretty good idea of how to integrate St. Jude and run it going forward. With regard to the management team, the management team that will be running our device businesses will be a mix, probably a fairly balanced mix of Abbott and St. Jude people, where we believe that there's a clear benefit to Abbott management, talent, et cetera or experience that we can bring to the party, we certainly intend to do so point. We're pretty well wind out what we think that is and we will also have the benefit of some of the most experienced and best managers and so forth at St. Jude. I think St. Jude has been probably more maligned in the last year than it's deserved because they missed earnings in the third and fourth quarter and they had some delays in product approvals. But to be honest, if they had an MRI compatible CRM product, I don't think we'd be curing nearly as much criticism of St. Jude. And it's amazing how one thing or maybe, if they were achieving the reimbursement of cardio MEMS faster, that's about it. Beyond that, their businesses are moving. All their other businesses are doing super well. And they've already shown that they can recover share when they get a CRM approval by their performance in Japan. So I think it's been overblown, Rick. And I understand when investors are disappointed. Take some while to recover from that and then they're skeptical. And they may look at Abbott and say, well, you can do it better. And my answer to that is I think we can do it better and I think St. Jude can do it better and so is St. Jude. And I think that the 2 of us together both believe that, first of all, they resolved their MRI compatibility issue and continue to run the business well, which they are. This business is going to do not only how analyst expect and we expect, which is growth of 1.5, 5% ph] or more, but frankly, maybe even better than that. As I've indicated on other calls, St. Jude estimates on how they're going to do or even higher than that. Our deal was done based on estimating frankly same kind of growth rate channels estimate, which put them at, call it, 4.5% to 5% going forward. And right now, they're tracking toward that with their performance in all their businesses. We're just waiting for an approval of an MRI compatible CRM, and I think this changes. As I look forward, I think the breadth of the business and the combination with Abbott and the improved performance on our own vascular business is nothing but up. And while right now, you've got this period where there's uncertainty, uncertainty about when it will close and you haven't forecasted what it will do it and so forth. I think it's -- I think a lot of our nurses are just more cautious. But I look at it and we look down the road in our own projections and what we believe we're going to do, and I think, okay, the stock is whatever it is today, $42 or whatever. I don't think investors are ever going to see another point to buy in at this level. That's what I think. I actually believe that. And I think our track record has just proven we know how to integrate it, we know how to manage it, we know how to do well with it, we know how to add value to it, we know what the breadth of offering is, we know the quality of the pipeline and the quality of their people. You don't just buy it for the portfolio and leave it alone. You buy it and you put the trust management you can in place and your run it the best you can. We've got to really excellent management in our medical device business, and I think there have excellent people, too. So despite of the fact that they disappointed investors, I think investors got to get over last year and look forward here because I don't think we bought some challenge property here. Alere, yes, it had challenges. They acknowledge they have challenges, too. And frankly, they've had challenges for a number of years. And the management team, it's there right now, has been they're just a little more than 2 years. They have dealt well with a lot of the challenges Alere has. Now they clearly have more, right? To be honest, we're kind of teeth grinding and gnashing we go through with them here or they're going through, et cetera. One thing I'm certain of, it's that they're trying to do everything they can their way to address the challenges in the company. I don't think otherwise. So whether it all works out the way originally planned or not, don't know, can't predict. As I've said many times, we like the products. And to us, it's an opportunistic opportunity to expand our Diagnostics business. Our Diagnostics business is one of the most consistent, top performing businesses in our country and in its industry. And they know how to manage cost. They know to manage product. They know how to manage the commercial operation. They know how to grow. They know how to compete. This business is one of our best, most reliable businesses in the company. And to extend that footprint with more products is just an opportunistic plus. If for some reason, it didn't work out, we still have one of the top-performing companies in the industry. But if we can add to it, well, then, even better. So I think to address further investors, having 2 deals in the upper at the same time is a lot of moving parts for investors. It needs some things uncertain. It means the issues you said, the equity issuance, uncertain. Obviously, for some reason, both of these didn't happen. There wouldn't be a need or a desire to do that because we're trying to balance our overall debt and equity balance sheet. So we'll see. We just don't know at this point. And I think there's other ways that we can consider addressing that issue around the equity issue. I've had the feedback from investors that they are concerned at least they don't like it because it's diluted. And I'm aware of that. But I don't think we're anywhere close to where we have to make a decision on the equity issuance at this point. We're planning for it. But we're only going to do it if it's in our interest to do it, if that's our balance sheet. So full transparency. We're planning to do it, but there's other ways that may well be addressed and we nowhere close to our resolution to that. I think that the uncertainty of that for investors just has some cautious, concerns and so on. And I think it's almost people's by January, this is all going to be clear, and it's going to be resolved one way or another. And we'll know whether we're going to do something like that or not. I think the same thing is true. We got asked a lot about the Mylan shares and what are we going to do? Are they going to be play a role? The answer is to be determined, unclear. If -- my sense is I don't have to sell those shares, I'm not going to. So I think that there's enough moving parts here. Actually like moving parts even though investors while we'll clarity. I don't want to make any of these decisions until I actually have to. And I think there's probably a number of months that are going to go by before we have to. And it's unfortunately, at least a little bit of uncertainty, not only for Abbott shareholders, but for Mylan's, too, to some degree. But if we don't have a need to sell those shares, I don't intend to sell, at least not anytime soon, let me put it that way. So I think those are all the moving parts. And I think there are some frustrations out there. I think people want to be their stock. I think they want to be in the stock. I think they want the ride that we think we have ahead of us here for the coming years. They just don't know whether there's going to be some surprise that they can't anticipate. Right now, I think all the possible outcomes are pretty evident. And I don't see anything that's going to take us backwards. But I certainly see a lot of things that are going to take us forward. And I'm pretty optimistic about it. I just think that we investors have to write through about, call it, 6 months of left certainty on some of the choices here, and so it starts to resolve. And that's not going to be next month. It's going to be a while."

And it's always a constant balance of being sufficiently enthusiastic and pushing the organization hard enough on how you want to take those products to market. And then there's always the speed bumps, something slows you down somewhere. Whether its reimbursement or the timing of an approval or whatever. And in all my years in the industry, I have never seen on a particularly consistent basis any company, including my own, deliver its new products on time, on-time, on schedule without some kind of delay. Even with Libre, our ambitions, we're in terms of our own internal goals, we're probably a couple of months behind where we wanted to be. Months, okay? A couple months. And yet we a have pretty stiff goal in our own minds about what we're trying to do here. But if you look at the product, the screaming north that have a rocket like pace, which is a good thing. And all it takes this as a minister somewhere to slow down its decision a few weeks and you're off by a couple of weeks. So how I look forward to St. Jude and I look at the 10%, is it potentially possible. Yes, it's potentially possible. But there's a lot of green lights puts a lot of relates without many speedboats. And the reality like this so there's a lot of speedboats. So I would have judged it back all of it in terms of just caution. And I think they're aspirational about the pace of those new products come. I don't think there's any disagreement are not IDEV to them about how good the product's are, how well-received there will be, or what, that the responsible been so forth. I also think that they're going to benefit from some great market growth rate beyond on all of these products. They don't have to go tear it away from somebody else in competition, hand-to-hand combat. The CRM business is hand-to-hand combat but a lot of the other businesses frankly, just playing innovative, new and relying on growth and training physicians and usage and so forth. So I think that while they would -- their estimates really were sort of in that 9% enough range. I think we're just being naturally cautious of the unknown. And I think analyst are, too. We look across the consensus of analysts for St. Jude, the consensus was around 4.5% to 5% both going forward here for the next 5 years. And what's ironic about that is I've spoken to a lot of these analyst because we know them covering us as well. And they'll say, yes, I know that's what my model says. I'm just not sure they're really going to do that. And just because their growth rate was more flat over the last 5 years. Because the growth rate over the last 5 years because they didn't have some other products for tech were some of the other businesses them caught now. And right now, they've got a heck of a lot more in the pipeline and a heck of a lot more that they've added to the company since St. Jude 4 years ago. So I don't think the last 5 year's growth rates are relevant as a comparison. I think what they've got and what they've done is, and I think right now, the growth rate is only suppressed because they've got difficulty with not having an MRI compatible claim on their CRM and CRT products. And you take that away, this business is already an and those projections, and analyst projections have been more robust than the past history. So I think St. Jude is one of those stories where once you disappoint some investors in a couple of quarters, the investor doesn't believe the projection of the future as much as he believes the rear view mirror. So I think they've got to put the points on the board and earn back a little credibility that what they project is actually going to happen and I think the sentiment will change on St. Jude. I'm not investing in sentiment, I'm investing in real products and real company and real business. And I think that what they're tracking at right now is giving the evidence that what they projected is a valid. These businesses, if you look at the segments of the business, they're really doing great. The one soft spot in the company, CRM, and they do you have to get better reimbursement status for cardio MEMS. Okay, that's 2 things. And they're all over that, and we're comfortable with how they're all over that. And the rest of the company's doing gangbusters. So I think they just got to show the evidence here over time. Rick, I've already forgotten the second half of your question that was."

Now having said that, the company said that some experience that way for some time already because we've had a joint marketing agreements with St. Jude for a number of years between our stent business and our -- there's CRM business. So we're already well familiar with each other. Of course, the dynamics chance when you're part of the same company, and that's a positive. It gets better. So I think that the nature of the kind of commercial synergy we would look for in the  broader portfolio of products that we offer, how we approach our accounts, how we can service our accounts, et cetera, I'd say that planning is well underway, If not starting to be in practice in a number of cases. And between Mike Tercel, the CEO of St. Jude; and Robert Ford, our EVP and that organization, or these 2 organizations, I think the 2 of them and their people had planned and cooperated exceptionally well. Going forward here, so I think we a ground running. It's the 2 countries have been together for a long time. I don't really foresee a lot of hiccups or bumps here."

Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2016. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.  Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. Please note that second quarter financial results and guidance provided on the call today for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only.
On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filing from today, which will be available on our website at abbott.com. Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange unless otherwise noted.
As you recall, Abbott issued a press release on April 28, 2016, announcing the transaction with St. Jude Medical. Please prefer to that release for additional important information about Abbott, St. Jude and related matters.

247483,367554489,1008568,"Abbott Laboratories, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2016",2016-07-20,"Earnings Calls","Abbott Laboratories","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Scott. Good morning. Today, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.55, above our guidance range. Sales increased 6.5% in the quarter, led by strong performance in Established Pharmaceuticals, Medical Devices and Diagnostics. As you",809,"Okay. Thanks, Scott. Good morning. 
Today, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.55, above our guidance range. Sales increased 6.5% in the quarter, led by strong performance in Established Pharmaceuticals, Medical Devices and Diagnostics. As you know, earlier in the quarter, we took an important strategic step with our announcement to acquire St. Jude Medical. Abbott and St. Jude combined will have a highly competitive medical device portfolio, including an industry-leading new product pipeline across cardiovascular, neuromodulation, diabetes and Vision Care. This strategic action builds upon the steps we've taken to achieve critical mass and leadership positions across each of our 4 businesses. 
In Diagnostics and Nutrition, where we hold market-leading positions today, we've been investing in R&D and infrastructure in high-growth geographies that have strengthened our global scale and competitiveness. And in Established Pharmaceuticals or EPD, we've taken a number of strategic steps over the last couple of years to position our business for long-term growth. EPD now operates entirely in emerging geographies and hold the leading positions in many of the largest and fastest-growing pharmaceutical markets for branded generics in the world, including India, Russia and Latin America. All 4 of our businesses will now hold leading positions in large and growing markets that are aligned with health care and demographic trends, providing a strong foundation to deliver top-tier growth over the long term. 
I'll now briefly review our second quarter results, and I'll start with Diagnostics, where we achieved sales growth of 6% in the quarter, driven by continued above-market performance in Core Laboratory and Point of Care Diagnostics. Our Diagnostics business has been a solid and continuous outperformer in the company and in its industry over the past several years. There's an opportunity here to further maintain, if not improve upon, this growth trajectory as we prepare to bring multiple next-generation systems to market across every area of diagnostics where we participate. We'll provide more details on these systems in our launch plans during the second half of the year. 
In Nutrition, sales grew around 4.5% in the quarter or more than 6% excluding the impact of Venezuela. Growth in the quarter was led by U.S. pediatric and International Adult Nutrition. In the U.S, above-market performance in Pediatric Nutrition was driven by continued growth of recently launched products, including non-GMO products for infants and toddlers. In Adult Nutrition, double-digit international growth was led by Ensure and continued expansion of the adult nutrition market where Abbott is global leader. 
In Medical Devices, sales growth in our Vascular business was led by share gains in our core stent business and double-digit growth of MitraClip, our market-leading device for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation. Our Endovascular business also contributed another quarter of strong growth, driven by vessel closure products and Supera, our unique peripheral stent for the treatment of blockages in the leg. And earlier this month, we received FDA approval for Absorb, the only fully dissolving vascular stent. This first-of-its-kind product is an important addition to our market-leading drug-eluting stent portfolio in the U.S.
In Medical Optics, sales growth of 5.5% was led by double-digit growth in our cataract products business, where we continue to capture share and drive growth with our portfolio of premium cataract lens products. Last week, we further strengthened our portfolio in the U.S. with the FDA approval for our TECNIS Symfony lenses, the first and only lenses that provide a full range of continuous, high-quality vision following cataract surgery. 
In Diabetes Care, international sales growth of more than 15% was driven by continued consumer uptake of our new and innovative FreeStyle Libre device in Europe. We continue to see strong demand as consumers and health care professionals become increasingly aware of the many benefits of this innovative device. There are now more than 125,000 patients utilizing FreeStyle Libre in Europe, and we're working to bring this novel technology to new markets, including the United States.
And in Established Pharmaceuticals or EPD, our strategy of targeting key geographies with a broad portfolio across select therapeutic areas continues to deliver strong results. Sales growth of 9.5% or 14% excluding the impact of Venezuela was led by balanced growth across several markets, including India, China and several countries in Latin America. The acquisitions and subsequent integrations of both CFR Pharmaceuticals and Veropharm have exceeded our expectations and are contributing to strong growth overall. 
So in summary, it was a good quarter, and we're particularly pleased with the steady cadence of new product approvals and recent launches that are contributing to growth, including FreeStyle Libre, MitraClip, Absorb and Symfony. And we took another important step to strengthen our strategic position and long-term growth potential with our announced acquisition of St. Jude Medical. 
I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian?"

Sales for the quarter increased 6.4% on an operational basis, that is excluding an unfavorable impact of 3.2% from foreign exchange. The negative impact from exchange was somewhat higher than previous expectations due to modest strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in the quarter. Reported sales increased 3.2% in the quarter. 
Regarding other aspects of the P&L in the quarter, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 57.6% of sales, somewhat above our previous guidance. Adjusted R&D investment was 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 31.6% of sales, each in line with previously issued guidance.
Turning to our outlook for the full year 2016. Our adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $2.14 to $2.24 from continuing operations remains unchanged and reflects double-digit underlying growth, offset by the impact of foreign exchange on our operating results. We continue to forecast operational sales growth in the mid-single digits for the full year. 
Based on current exchange rates, we expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 2.5% on our full year reported sales, somewhat higher than previous expectations of negative 2%. This would result in reported sales growth in the low single digits for the full year 2016.
We continue to forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 57% of sales for the full year, which includes underlying gross margin improvement initiatives across our businesses. We forecast adjusted R&D investment of around 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of approaching 31% of sales for the full year. We now forecast net interest expense of around $100 million, reflecting changes in interest rate assumptions on both our borrowing rates for debt and the income we earn on some of our investments and around $35 million of nonoperating expense.
Turning to our outlook for the third quarter. We forecast adjusted earnings per share of $0.57 to $0.59, again reflecting double-digit underlying growth, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange on our results. We forecast operational sales growth of mid-single digits in the third quarter. In the current exchange rates, we'd expect a negative impact from exchange of around 1.5%. 
Turning to other aspects of the P&L. For the third quarter, we forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio somewhat above 57%, adjusted R&D investment around 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 30% of sales. Finally, we project specified items of $0.19 in the third quarter, reflecting the same items as we identified for the full year in our earnings release. 
Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide a quick overview of our third quarter and full year operational sales growth outlook by business. For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast high single-digit sales growth for both the third quarter and full year. In Nutrition, we forecast low to mid-single-digit sales growth for both the third quarter and full year. In Diagnostics, we forecast mid-single-digit sales growth for both the third quarter and full year. 
And lastly, in our Medical Devices businesses, for Vascular, we now forecast low single-digit sales growth for both the third quarter and full year. In Diabetes, we forecast high single-digit growth for the third quarter and mid-single-digit sales growth for the full year. And in Medical Optics, we forecast low to mid-single digit for the third quarter and mid-single-digit sales growth for the full year.
With that, we will now open the call for questions."

Let me deal with the transactions first, and I'll go right to the one that you targeted, Alere. From our perspective, there's been no change. They still haven't fired -- filed a 10-K. Our access to information has been limited. And they did put out a press release with an update that I think was, at least from my perspective, overenthusiastically embraced from one of their analysts. But to that extent, the update they put out basically provided no particular new information and was a requirement they had with their bondholders for the extensions they got on the requirements in their agreements, and the information they put out was characterized as preliminary, unaudited, summary only, et cetera. So I think, from our perspective, no change other than the passage of time, and that's about all I can say about it at this point. So I mean I'm not an odds predictor here so I have no particular prediction to make other than the information that's here. And there's no more really to say about it since the last time you asked me the question. 
So moving to St. Jude. I'd say everything is tracking well. We've got a second request from the FTC, which we'll certainly respond to. I'd say there's not much in a way of surprises there. All of our planning going forward is going according to plan. There's no surprises, no negatives. Their performance appears to be tracking according to our forecasts, our expectations and to their forecast. In fact, I'd say their report this morning looks to me like their best quarter in about the last 6 anyway, and they're trending in the right directions as we predicted and forecasted and saw in our due diligence. So I'd say with regard to St. Jude, everything is tracking well. We still hope to close that by -- before year-end. I think that will be close call just as we work our way through the administrivia of the FTC's request and so forth and whatever we may have to do there. But I'd say there's no big surprises at all. We're just going to try and complete the work that we've already indicated, and everything there is tracking according to plan. 
With regard to the mix of business, I'd say, as you can see in our numbers, it's a strong quarter across the board, across the world in all of our businesses but one. And the Nutrition business is weaker, and the weakness is primarily focused on China pediatric, really nowhere else. And what's been not only forecasted by some of our global competitors, but also our own experience has been a slowing of growth in the China pediatric market. Last year at this time, I think that market was probably 13%, 14% growth estimated, and this year, it's probably just under half that would be our estimate. And I think that's probably consistent with what some of our competitors have seen or expressed as well. But we're seeing about half the growth rate as a market rate that we've seen in the past, and that's clearly softening the sales growth rate. And we've seen that, and we are seeing that. We have not yet seen any data that there's any share change that's impacting us, but our growth rate's clearly slower. So I'm a little cautious on the second half. I don't expect that to change on this particular business. I don't expect that growth rate or that, let's just call it, softness -- it's not softness in terms of decline, it's slower growth. It's still a pretty healthy growth rate compared to anywhere else in the word, and its good growth rate. It's just not the double-digit growth rate it was last year or the year before. And as you know, that market has been a pretty high grower from a growth rate standpoint for quite some time. So that's an adjustment to -- for all of us to adjust to. I don't know whether that's a long-term change in the market. I know that there's an increasing breastfeeding rate in China. But in terms of other fundamentals, we see channel shifts and so forth. But channel shifts shouldn't impact the overall market over time here. So other than the dynamics of just lower growth or slowing demand, I'd say that's about the best way I can characterize it. The -- as I said, the market growth at 6% is still a healthy rate. It's just not the one that we've been used to and enjoyed for the past several years."

With regard to guidance, I mean I will just preempt Brian a little bit here. You recall we did raise guidance after the first quarter. And I think -- I want to be careful as I state this because all of our businesses are running really strong here, but I'm a little cautious on the second half. Part of it's FX. But part of it is just watching underlying market growth. I'm particularly keeping an eye on China. It doesn't really mean I'm negative on China at all, I'm not.

So I'm pretty pleased with the progress there and the performance of the team. The royalty situation itself, there is a catch-up in there which inflates the number -- the growth number for this quarter because it's catch-up of the past. But it's also in this -- we're going to have that royalty going forward here so that will be something we will clearly have in the future, which is not in there for the past few quarters.

The -- we've got a number of new systems coming here, all of which have been under development for a few years in our Diagnostics business. And we're starting to see those roll out now, and we will see over the next, let's say, 2, 3 years. First of all, we just launched AlinIQ, which is an informatics program that is designed to help labs with productivity and their own cost management and so forth, which we think is going to be exceptionally well received. That's launched. Following that, we've got 5 systems coming. There's a next-generation system in our Point of Care business that will begin to launch in Europe in the second half of this year, probably in the fourth quarter, then in the U.S. in 2017. Then the Core Lab systems for both immunoassay and clinical chemistry testing will begin to roll out as well. We expect a European launch before the end of the year and the U.S. in '18, early in '18. Blood screening, same thing, late in the year in Europe -- late this year in Europe, a brand-new system. Beyond that, hematology, the following year, '17, early '17 in Europe. And then all of these early on in 2018 in the U.S. And then, finally, in our molecular business, in the second half of '17, we begin to roll out a new system in Europe. So that's a lot, and that's unprecedented. No company in our business has ever put that many new systems out. They're not just refreshments. They're not just software updates or upgrades or incremental improvements on existing systems. They are all complete, new, fresh systems or redone and with some new advantages and so forth. So we're pretty excited about the entire product line. Diagnostics has been doing really well with the mature products in its line. And when you think about the complete line of new products coming over the next couple of years to that business, I think that's just really a great shot in the arm there for a business that's been outperforming as it is anyway. Customers will start to see those systems at the AACC conference in Philadelphia in -- later this month. At a number of industry trade shows in U.S. and Europe, we'll clearly be interested to be showing [ph] those systems to customers so they get a preview in advance. So I think the future for Diagnostics looks pretty good."

A lot of the pushback that I get in talking about the acquisitions that -- St. Jude, Alere seems to revolve around a few points: that both are challenged, even troubled, assets; that you're taking on too much integration challenge at once; the uncertainty around an equity raise; the lack of certainty around how Abbott will add value, improve or better run particularly St. Jude; and maybe a little lack of clarity about the Abbott senior management team, how that's going to change, who's going to lead the effort, again, particularly on the device side. While I personally don't agree with these thoughts, I'd be curious just looking at the big picture here again. Given your long track record of successful opportunistic M&A, how is St. Jude, Alere set up better or worse than some of the past challenges you faced? Why are these the right deals after another few months of thinking about it? What needs to be done to ensure that these are the right moves today for Abbott shareholders?"

And I understand the sentiments of investors in general. I mean, I think that -- first of all, I'd say there's -- you got a skeptical, cautious attitude on the part of investors with just about everything, not particular to Abbott or specific to Abbott, but I think there's just a lot of caution out there. All that fluffy, robust enthusiasm of 1.5 years ago is definitely not there now, and yet the market is at a near high. But in our business, that -- businesses, that enthusiasm or at least that attitude doesn't seem to be that lit up. So we take -- we put this in the context of all that. I think what I find in the feedback from investors is they just want a lot more clarity and a lot more visibility so that they can forecast our model or know where all this is going to go. Because I can put a historic -- I can lean on historical track record and say, ""Hey, look, AMO wasn't a great performing business when we bought it. But right now, it is doing exceptionally well."" The assets we assembled as EPD were not, at the time, great assets. I'd say CFR was a pretty great asset, but a lot of the assets that we put together weren't necessarily super performing assets. And right now, I'd say we've got one of the gems in the branded generic business globally because of the markets and the things we're in. And I think the track record of how we integrate or how we manage our businesses is proven. We're not intimidated at all by the integration. Frankly, that part, I think, we've shown we're really good at. We've got an experienced team in place. I'm not worried about that at all. And frankly, in the case of St. Jude, the organizations are so well aligned. I think that one will go extremely well and extremely smoothly. I don't consider St. Jude to be a particularly challenged organization. I think that they've got a great pipeline of products. I think they've got a lot of good products. They went through a fairly significant organizational structural change over the last 2 years that I think proved to be somewhat disruptive to the operation of the organization. We're well aware of that. We're well aware of what it meant, how it works, et cetera. But understanding that, I think we've got a pretty good idea of how to integrate St. Jude and run it going forward. With regard to the management team, the management team that will be running our device businesses will be a mix, probably a fairly balanced mix of Abbott and St. Jude people. Where we believe that there's a clear benefit to Abbott management, talent, et cetera, or experience that we can bring to the party, we certainly intend to do so. And we pretty well wind out what we think that is, and we will also have the benefit of some of the most experienced and best managers and so forth at St. Jude. I think St. Jude has been probably more maligned in the last year than it has deserved because they missed earnings in the third and fourth quarter and they've had some delays in product approvals. But to be honest, if they had an MRI-compatible CRM product, I don't think we'd be hearing nearly as much criticism of St. Jude. And it's amazing how one thing -- or maybe if they were achieving the reimbursement of CardioMEMS faster, that's about it. Beyond that, their businesses are booming. They're -- all their other businesses are doing super well, and they've already shown that they can recover share when they get a CRM approval by their performance in Japan. So I think it's been overblown, Rick. And I understand when investors are disappointed. It takes some while to recover from that. And then they're skeptical. And they may look at Abbott and say, ""Well, why do you think you can do it better?"" And my answer to that is I think we can do it better and I think St. Jude can do it better and so does St. Jude. And I think that the 2 of us together both believe that, first of all, if they resolve their MRI compatibility issue and continue to run the business well, which they are, this business is going to do not only how analysts expect and we expect, which is growth of 4.5%, 5% or more, but, frankly, maybe even better than that. As I've indicated on other calls, St. Jude's own estimates on how they're going to do are even higher than that. Our deal was done based on estimating, frankly, the same kind of growth rates analysts estimate, which put them at, call it, 4.5% to 5% going forward. And right now, they're tracking toward that with their performance in all their businesses. We're just waiting for an approval of an MRI-compatible CRM, and I think this changes. As I look forward, I think the breadth of the business and the combination with Abbott and the improved performance on our own Vascular business, there's nothing but up. And while, right now, you've got this period where there's uncertainty, uncertainty about ""When will it close? And you haven't forecasted what it will do"" and so forth, I think it's -- I think a lot of our investors are just more cautious. But I look at it and we look down the road at our own projections and what we believe we're going to do and I think, okay, the stock is whatever it is today, $42 or whatever. I don't think investors are ever going to see another point to buy in at this level. That's what I think. I actually believe that. And I think our track record has just proven we know how to integrate it, we know how to manage it, we know how to do well with it, we know how to add value to it, we know what the breadth of offering is, we know the quality of their pipeline and the quality of their people. You don't just buy it for -- a portfolio and leave it alone. You buy it and you put the best management you can in place and you run it the best you can. We've got really excellent management in our Medical Device business, and I think they've got excellent people, too. So in spite of the fact that they disappointed investors, I think investors got to get over last year and look forward here because I don't think we bought some challenged property here. 
Alere, yes, it has challenges. They acknowledge they have challenges, too. And frankly, they've had challenges for a number of years, and the management team that's there right now has been there just a little more than 2 years. They have dealt well with a lot of the challenges Alere has. Now they clearly have more, right? And to be honest, no matter what kind of teeth grinding and gnashing we go through with them here or they're going through, et cetera, one thing I'm certain of is that they're trying to do everything they can in their way to address the challenges in the company. I don't think otherwise. So whether it all works out the way originally planned or not, don't know, can't predict. As I've said many times, we like the products, and to us, it's an opportunistic opportunity to expand our Diagnostics business. Our Diagnostics business is one of the most consistent, top performing businesses in our country and in its industry. And they've proven they know how to manage cost, they know to manage product, they know how to manage the commercial operations, they know how to grow, they know how to compete. This business is one of our best, most reliable businesses in the company. And to expand that footprint with more products is just an opportunistic plus. If, for some reason, it didn't work out, we still have one of the top performing companies in the industry. But if we can add to it, well, then, even better. 
So I think to address further investors, having 2 deals in the hopper at the same time is a lot of moving parts for investors. It leaves some things uncertain. It leaves issues you said, the equity issuance, uncertain. Obviously, if, for some reason, both of these didn't happen, there wouldn't be a need or a desire to do that because we're trying to balance our overall debt and equity balance sheet. So we'll see. We just don't know at this point. And I think there's other ways that we can consider addressing that issue around the equity issuance. I've had the feedback from investors that they are concerned, at least they don't like it because it's dilutive. And I'm aware of that. But I don't think we're anywhere close to where we have to make a decision on the equity issuance at this point. We're planning for it, but we're only going to do it if it's in our interest to do it to balance our balance sheet. So full transparency. We're planning to do it, but there's other ways it may well be addressed. And we're nowhere close to a resolution of that. I think that the uncertainty of that for investors just adds some cautious concerns and so on. And I think what I tell most people is, look,  by January, this is all going to be pretty clear, and it's going to be resolved one way or another. And we'll know whether we're going to do something like that or not. I think the same thing is true with -- we get asked a lot about the Mylan shares and what are we going to do. Are they going to be play a role? The answer is to be determined, unclear. If -- right now, my sense is if I don't have to sell those shares, I'm not going to. So I think that there's enough moving parts here. I actually like the moving parts. Even though investors want real clarity, I don't want to make any of these decisions until I actually have to, and there's probably a number of months that are going to go by before we have to. And it's unfortunate it leads to a little bit of uncertainty not only for Abbott shareholders but for Mylan's, too, to some degree. But if we don't have a need to sell those shares, I don't intend to sell, at least not anytime soon. Let me put it that way. So I think those are all the moving parts. And I think there are some frustration out there. I think people want to buy the stock. I think they want to be in the stock. I think they want the ride that we think we have ahead of us here for the coming years. They just don't know whether there's going to be some surprise they can't anticipate. And right now, I think all the possible outcomes are pretty evident. And I don't see anything that's going to take us backwards, but I certainly see a lot of things that are going to take us forward. And I'm pretty optimistic about it. I just think that we and investors have to ride through about, call it, 6 months of less certainty on some of the choices here until it starts to resolve, and that's not going to be next month. It's going to be a while."

There's a number of steps that are going to happen here in the interim. In the meanwhile, I think it's doing exceptionally well in its rollout in Europe. We've had a really good reception from the states and countries with regard to reimbursement, which I think is unusual. This has been -- thus far, Libre's success has been driven by consumer pay and direct consumer pay. And we are achieving our goals of getting key countries, key places to agree to reimburse the product, which should, frankly, make a big difference in the performance in the market, and it's already trending north at a pretty good clip.

First, before I phone a friend next to me here for some of the details underlying specific products, I would tell you that, first of all, if you've got a robust portfolio of new products coming, that's always a good thing. And we",887,"Okay. A couple of things. First, before I phone a friend next to me here for some of the details underlying specific products, I would tell you that, first of all, if you've got a robust portfolio of new products coming, that's always a good thing. And we're naturally always optimistic about the uptick of products, the penetration of products, the introduction of products and so forth. And it's always a constant balance of being sufficiently enthusiastic and pushing the organization hard enough on how you want to take those products to market. And then there's always the speed bumps. Something slows you down somewhere, whether its reimbursement or the timing of an approval or whatever. And in all my years in the industry, I have never seen, on a particularly consistent basis, any company, including my own, deliver its new products on time, on plan, on schedule without some kind of delay. Even with Libre, our ambitions -- we're -- in terms of our own internal goals, we're probably a couple of months behind where we wanted to be. Months, okay? A couple of months. And yet, we have a pretty stiff goal in our own minds about what we're trying to do here. And if you look at the product, the screaming north that had a rocket-like pace, which is a good thing and all it takes is some minister somewhere to slow down its decision a few weeks and you're off by a couple of weeks. So when I look forward at St. Jude and I look at the 10%, is it potentially possible? Yes, it's potentially possible, but it's a lot of greenlights. It's a lot of greenlights without many speed bumps. And the reality of life is there's a lot of speed bumps. So I would have judged it back a little bit in terms of just caution. I think they're aspirational about the pace that those new products come. I don't think there's any disagreement on our part with them about how good the products are, how well received  they'll be or what competitive response will be and so forth. I also think they're going to benefit from some great market growth rate behind a lot of these products. They don't have to go tear it away from somebody else in competition, hand-to-hand combat. The CRM business is hand-to-hand combat, but the -- a lot of the other businesses here, frankly, is just plain innovative, new and relying on growth and training physicians and usage and so forth. So I think that while they would -- their estimates really were sort of in that 9%-and-up range . I think we're just being naturally cautious of the unknown, of the unknown. And I think analyst are, too. When we looked across the consensus of analysts for St. Jude, the consensus was around 4.5% to 5% growth going forward here for the next 5 years. And what's ironic about that is -- I've spoken to a lot of these analysts because we know them covering us as well. And they'll say, ""Yes, I know that's what my model says, but I'm just not sure they're really going to do that."" And that's because their growth rate was more flat over the last 5 years. But the growth rate was flat over the last 5 years is because they didn't have some of these products or tech or some of the other businesses they've got now. And right now, they've got a heck of a lot more in the pipeline and a heck of a lot more that they've added to the company since St. Jude 4 years ago. So I don't think the last 5 year's growth rates are relevant as a comparison, I think what they've got and what they've done is. And I think, right now, the growth rate is only suppressed because they've got difficulty with not having an MRI-compatible claim on their CRM and CRT products. And when you take that away, this business is already at analysts' projections, and analyst projections have been more robust than the past history. So I think St. Jude is one of those stories where once you disappoint some investors in a couple of quarters, the investor doesn't believe the projection of the future as much as he believes the rearview mirror. So I think they've got to put the points on the board and earn back a little credibility that what they project is actually going to happen, and I think the sentiment will change on St. Jude. I'm not investing in sentiment. I'm investing in real products and real company and real business. And I think that what they're tracking at right now is giving the evidence that what they projected is a valid. These businesses -- if you look at all the segments of businesses, they're really doing great. The one soft spot in the company is CRM, and they do have to get better reimbursement status for CardioMEMS. Okay, that's 2 things. And they're all over that, and we're comfortable with how they're all over that. The rest of the company is doing gangbusters. So I think they just got to show the evidence here over time.

I think the commercial synergies and -- first of all, it depends on the integration of your sales forces, the integration of your sales management structures, your commercial management structures. I think it depends on how we construct our -- well, there's integration and cooperation across boundaries with multiple businesses. That will -- and how customers embrace that, particularly in the U.S., will determine how rapidly that goes. Now having said that, the companies have had some experience that way for some time already because we've had a joint marketing agreement with St. Jude for a number of years between our stent business and our -- and their CRM business. So we're already well familiar with each other. Of course, the dynamics change when you're part of the same company, and that's a positive. It gets better. So I think that the nature of the kind of commercial synergy we would look for in the  broader portfolio of products that we offer, how we approach our accounts, how we can service our accounts, et cetera, I'd say that planning is well underway, if not starting to be in practice in a number of cases. And between Mike Rousseau, the CEO of St. Jude; and Robert Ford, our EVP, and that organization -- or these 2 organizations, I think the 2 of them and their people have planned and cooperated exceptionally well going forward here. So I think we hit the ground running as if the 2 companies have been together for a long time. I don't really foresee a lot of hiccups or bumps here."

Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.  Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. Please note that second quarter financial results and guidance provided on the call today for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only.
On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filing from today, which will be available on our website at abbott.com. Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange unless otherwise noted.
As you recall, Abbott issued a press release on April 28, 2016, announcing the transaction with St. Jude Medical. Please prefer to that release for additional important information about Abbott, St. Jude and related matters.

Today, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.55, above our guidance range. Sales increased 6.5% in the quarter, led by strong performance in Established Pharmaceuticals, Medical Devices and Diagnostics. As you",809,"Okay. Thanks, Scott. Good morning. 
Today, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.55, above our guidance range. Sales increased 6.5% in the quarter, led by strong performance in Established Pharmaceuticals, Medical Devices and Diagnostics. As you know, earlier in the quarter, we took an important strategic step with our announcement to acquire St. Jude Medical. Abbott and St. Jude combined will have a highly competitive medical device portfolio, including an industry-leading new product pipeline across cardiovascular, neuromodulation, diabetes and Vision Care. This strategic action builds upon the steps we've taken to achieve critical mass and leadership positions across each of our 4 businesses. 
In Diagnostics and Nutrition, where we hold market-leading positions today, we've been investing in R&D and infrastructure in high-growth geographies that have strengthened our global scale and competitiveness. And in Established Pharmaceuticals or EPD, we've taken a number of strategic steps over the last couple of years to position our business for long-term growth. EPD now operates entirely in emerging geographies and holds leading positions in many of the largest and fastest-growing pharmaceutical markets for branded generics in the world, including India, Russia and Latin America. All 4 of our businesses will now hold leading positions in large and growing markets that are aligned with health care and demographic trends, providing a strong foundation to deliver top-tier growth over the long term. 
I'll now briefly review our second quarter results, and I'll start with Diagnostics, where we achieved sales growth of 6% in the quarter, driven by continued above-market performance in Core Laboratory and Point of Care Diagnostics. Our Diagnostics business has been a solid and continuous outperformer in the company and in its industry over the past several years. There's an opportunity here to further maintain, if not improve upon, this growth trajectory as we prepare to bring multiple next-generation systems to market across every area of diagnostics where we participate. We'll provide more details on these systems and our launch plans during the second half of the year. 
In Nutrition, sales grew around 4.5% in the quarter or more than 6% excluding the impact of Venezuela. Growth in the quarter was led by U.S. Pediatric and International Adult Nutrition. In the U.S, above-market performance in Pediatric Nutrition was driven by continued growth of recently launched products, including non-GMO products for infants and toddlers. In Adult Nutrition, double-digit international growth was led by Ensure and continued expansion of the adult nutrition market where Abbott is the global leader. 
In Medical Devices, sales growth in our Vascular business was led by share gains in our core stent business and double-digit growth of MitraClip, our market-leading device for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation. Our Endovascular business also contributed another quarter of strong growth, driven by vessel closure products and Supera, our unique peripheral stent for the treatment of blockages in the leg. And earlier this month, we received FDA approval for Absorb, the only fully dissolving vascular stent. This first-of-its-kind product is an important addition to our market-leading drug-eluting stent portfolio in the U.S.
In Medical Optics, sales growth of 5.5% was led by double-digit growth in our cataract products business, where we continue to capture share and drive growth with our portfolio of premium cataract lens products. Last week, we further strengthened our portfolio in the U.S. with the FDA approval for our TECNIS Symfony lenses, the first and only lenses that provide a full range of continuous, high-quality vision following cataract surgery. 
In Diabetes Care, international sales growth of more than 15% was driven by continued consumer uptake of our new and innovative FreeStyle Libre device in Europe. We continue to see strong demand as consumers and health care professionals become increasingly aware of the many benefits of this innovative device. There are now more than 125,000 patients utilizing FreeStyle Libre in Europe, and we're working to bring this novel technology to new markets, including the United States.
And in Established Pharmaceuticals or EPD, our strategy of targeting key geographies with a broad portfolio across select therapeutic areas continues to deliver strong results. Sales growth of 9.5% or 14% excluding the impact of Venezuela was led by balanced growth across several markets, including India, China and several countries in Latin America. The acquisitions and subsequent integrations of both CFR Pharmaceuticals and Veropharm have exceeded our expectations and are contributing to strong growth overall. 
So in summary, it was a good quarter, and we're particularly pleased with the steady cadence of new product approvals and recent launches that are contributing to growth, including FreeStyle Libre, MitraClip, Absorb and Symfony. And we took another important step to strengthen our strategic position and long-term growth potential with our announced acquisition of St. Jude Medical.

Sales for the quarter increased 6.4% on an operational basis, that is excluding an unfavorable impact of 3.2% from foreign exchange. The negative impact from exchange was somewhat higher than previous expectations due to modest strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in the quarter. Reported sales increased 3.2% in the quarter. 
Regarding other aspects of the P&L in the quarter, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 57.6% of sales, somewhat above our previous guidance. Adjusted R&D investment was 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 31.6% of sales, each in line with previously issued guidance.
Turning to our outlook for the full year 2016. Our adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $2.14 to $2.24 from continuing operations remains unchanged and reflects double-digit underlying growth, offset by the impact of foreign exchange on our operating results. We continue to forecast operational sales growth in the mid-single digits for the full year. 
Based on current exchange rates, we expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 2.5% on our full year reported sales, somewhat higher than previous expectations of negative 2%. This would result in reported sales growth in the low single digits for the full year 2016.
We continue to forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 57% of sales for the full year, which includes underlying gross margin improvement initiatives across our businesses. We forecast adjusted R&D investment of around 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of approaching 31% of sales for the full year. We now forecast net interest expense of around $100 million, reflecting changes in interest rate assumptions on both our borrowing rates for debt and the income we earn on some of our investments, and around $35 million of nonoperating expense.
Turning to our outlook for the third quarter. We forecast adjusted earnings per share of $0.57 to $0.59, again reflecting double-digit underlying growth, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange on our results. We forecast operational sales growth of mid-single digits in the third quarter. And at current exchange rates, we'd expect a negative impact from exchange of around 1.5%. 
Turning to other aspects of the P&L. For the third quarter, we forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio somewhat above 57%, adjusted R&D investment around 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 30% of sales. Finally, we project specified items of $0.19 in the third quarter, reflecting the same items as we identified for the full year in our earnings release. 
Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide a quick overview of our third quarter and full year operational sales growth outlook by business. For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast high single-digit sales growth for both the third quarter and full year. In Nutrition, we forecast low to mid-single-digit sales growth for both the third quarter and full year. In Diagnostics, we forecast mid-single-digit sales growth for both the third quarter and full year. 
And lastly, in our Medical Devices businesses, for Vascular, we now forecast low single-digit sales growth for both the third quarter and full year. In Diabetes, we forecast high single-digit growth for the third quarter and mid-single-digit sales growth for the full year. And in Medical Optics, we forecast low to mid-single digit for the third quarter and mid-single-digit sales growth for the full year.
With that, we will now open the call for questions."

Let me deal with the transactions first, and I'll go right to the one that you targeted, Alere. From our perspective, there's been no change. They still haven't fired -- filed a 10-K. Our access to information has been limited. And they did put out a press release with an update that I think was, at least from my perspective, overenthusiastically embraced from one of their analysts. But to that extent, the update they put out basically provided no particular new information and was a requirement they had with their bondholders for the extensions they got on the requirements in their agreements, and the information they put out was characterized as preliminary, unaudited, summary only, et cetera. So I think, from our perspective, no change other than the passage of time, and that's about all I can say about it at this point. So I mean I'm not an odds predictor here so I have no particular prediction to make other than the information that's here. And there's no more really to say about it since the last time you asked me the question. 
So moving to St. Jude. I'd say everything is tracking well. We've got a second request from the FTC, which we'll certainly respond to. I'd say there's not much in a way of surprises there. All of our planning going forward is going according to plan. There's no surprises, no negatives. Their performance appears to be tracking according to our forecasts, our expectations and to their forecast. In fact, I'd say their report this morning looks to me like their best quarter in about the last 6 anyway, and they're trending in the right directions as we predicted and forecasted and saw in our due diligence. So I'd say with regard to St. Jude, everything is tracking well. We still hope to close that by -- before year-end. I think that will be close call just as we work our way through the administrivia of the FTC's request and so forth and whatever we may have to do there. But I'd say there's no big surprises at all. We're just going to try and complete the work that we've already indicated, and everything there is tracking according to plan. 
With regard to the mix of business, I'd say, as you can see in our numbers, it's a strong quarter across the board, across the world in all of our businesses but one. And the Nutrition business is weaker, and the weakness is primarily focused on China pediatric, really nowhere else. And what's been not only forecasted by some of our global competitors, but also our own experience, has been a slowing of growth in the China pediatric market. Last year at this time, I think that market was probably 13%, 14% growth estimated, and this year, it's probably just under half that would be our estimate. And I think that's probably consistent with what some of our competitors have seen or expressed as well. But we're seeing about half the growth rate as a market rate that we've seen in the past, and that's clearly softening the sales growth rate. And we've seen that, and we are seeing that. We have not yet seen any data that there's any share change that's impacting us, but our growth rate's clearly slower. So I'm a little cautious on the second half. I don't expect that to change on this particular business. I don't expect that growth rate or that, let's just call it, softness -- it's not softness in terms of decline, it's slower growth. It's still a pretty healthy growth rate compared to anywhere else in the word, and it's a good growth rate. It's just not the double-digit growth rate it was last year or the year before. And as you know, that market has been a pretty high grower from a growth rate standpoint for quite some time. So that's an adjustment to -- for all of us to adjust to. I don't know whether that's a long-term change in the market. I know that there's an increasing breastfeeding rate in China. But in terms of other fundamentals, we see channel shifts and so forth. But channel shifts shouldn't impact the overall market over time here. So other than the dynamics of just lower growth or slowing demand, I'd say that's about the best way I can characterize it. The -- as I said, the market growth at 6% is still a healthy rate. It's just not the one that we've been used to and enjoyed for the past several years."

But I think we're just in a waiting situation here. 
With regard to guidance, I mean I will just preempt Brian a little bit here. You recall we did raise guidance after the first quarter. And I think -- I want to be careful as I state this because all of our businesses are running really strong here, but I'm a little cautious on the second half. Part of it's FX. But part of it is just watching underlying market growth. I'm particularly keeping an eye on China. It doesn't mean I'm negative on China at all, I'm not.

So I'm pretty pleased with the progress there and the performance of the team. The royalty situation itself, there is a catch-up in there which inflates the number -- the growth number for this quarter because it's catch-up of the past. But it's also in this -- we're going to have that royalty going forward here so that will be something we will clearly have in the future, which is not in there for the past few quarters.

The -- we've got a number of new systems coming here, all of which have been under development for a few years in our Diagnostics business. And we're starting to see those roll out now, and we will see over the next, let's say, 2, 3 years. First of all, we just launched AlinIQ, which is an informatics program that is designed to help labs with productivity and their own cost management and so forth, which we think is going to be exceptionally well received. That's launched. Following that, we've got 5 systems coming. There's a next-generation system in our Point of Care business that will begin to launch in Europe in the second half of this year, probably in the fourth quarter, then in the U.S. in 2017. Then the Core Lab systems for both immunoassay and clinical chemistry testing will begin to roll out as well. We expect a European launch before the end of the year and the U.S. in '18, early in '18. Blood screening, same thing, late in the year in Europe -- late this year in Europe, a brand-new system. Beyond that, hematology, the following year, '17, early '17 in Europe. And then all of these early on in 2018 in the U.S. And then, finally, in our Molecular business, in the second half of '17, we begin to roll out a new system in Europe. So that's a lot, and that's unprecedented. No company in our business has ever put that many new systems out. They're not just refreshments. They're not just software updates or upgrades or incremental improvements on existing systems. They are all complete, new, fresh systems or redone and with some new advantages and so forth. So we're pretty excited about the entire product line. Diagnostics has been doing really well with the mature products in its line. And when you think about the complete line of new products coming over the next couple of years to that business, I think that's just really a great shot in the arm there for a business that's been outperforming as it is anyway. Customers will start to see those systems at the AACC conference in Philadelphia in -- later this month. At a number of industry trade shows in U.S. and Europe, we'll clearly be introducing those systems to customers so they get a preview in advance. So I think the future for Diagnostics looks pretty good."

A lot of the pushback that I get in talking about the acquisitions that -- St. Jude, Alere, it seems to revolve around a few points: that both are challenged, even troubled, assets; that you're taking on too much integration challenge at once; the uncertainty around an equity raise; the lack of certainty around how Abbott will add value, improve or better run particularly St. Jude; and maybe a little lack of clarity about the Abbott senior management team, how that's going to change, who's going to lead the effort, again, particularly on the device side. While I personally don't agree with these thoughts, I'd be curious just looking at the big picture here again. Given your long track record of successful opportunistic M&A, how is St. Jude, Alere set up better or worse than some of the past challenges you faced? Why are these the right deals after another few months of thinking about it? What needs to be done to ensure that these are the right moves today for Abbott shareholders?"

And I understand the sentiments of investors in general. I mean, I think that -- first of all, I'd say there's -- you got a skeptical, cautious attitude on the part of investors with just about everything, not particular to Abbott or specific to Abbott, but I think there's just a lot of caution out there. All that frothy, robust enthusiasm of 1.5 years ago is definitely not there now, and yet the market is at a near high. But in our business, that -- businesses, that enthusiasm or at least that attitude doesn't seem to be that lit up. So we take -- we put this in the context of all that. I think what I find in the feedback from investors is they just want a lot more clarity and a lot more visibility so that they can forecast or model or know where all this is going to go. Because I can put a historic -- I can lean on historical track record and say, ""Hey, look, AMO wasn't a great-performing business when we bought it. But right now, it is doing exceptionally well."" The assets we assembled as EPD were not, at the time, great assets. I'd say CFR was a pretty great asset, but a lot of the assets that we put together weren't necessarily super performing assets. And right now, I'd say we've got one of the gems in the branded generic business globally because of the markets and the things we're in. And I think the track record of how we integrate or how we manage our businesses is proven. We're not intimidated at all by the integration. Frankly, that part, I think, we've shown we're really good at. We've got an experienced team in place. I'm not worried about that at all. And frankly, in the case of St. Jude, the organizations are so well aligned, I think that one will go extremely well and extremely smoothly. I don't consider St. Jude to be a particularly challenged organization. I think that they've got a great pipeline of products. I think they've got a lot of good products. They went through a fairly significant organizational structural change over the last 2 years that I think proved to be somewhat disruptive to the operation of the organization. We're well aware of that. We're well aware of what it meant, how it works, et cetera. But understanding that, I think we've got a pretty good idea of how to integrate St. Jude and run it going forward. With regard to the management team, the management team that will be running our device businesses will be a mix, probably a fairly balanced mix of Abbott and St. Jude people. Where we believe that there's a clear benefit to Abbott management, talent, et cetera, or experience that we can bring to the party, we certainly intend to do so. And we've pretty well lined out what we think that is, and we will also have the benefit of some of the most experienced and best managers and so forth at St. Jude. I think St. Jude has been probably more maligned in the last year than it has deserved because they missed earnings in the third and fourth quarter and they've had some delays in product approvals. But to be honest, if they had an MRI-compatible CRM product, I don't think we'd be hearing nearly as much criticism of St. Jude. And it's amazing how one thing -- or maybe if they were achieving the reimbursement of CardioMEMS faster, that's about it. Beyond that, their businesses are booming. They're -- all their other businesses are doing super well, and they've already shown that they can recover share when they get a CRM approval by their performance in Japan. So I think it's been overblown, Rick. And I understand when investors are disappointed. It takes them a while to recover from that, and then they're skeptical. And they may look at Abbott and say, ""Well, why do you think you can do it better?"" And my answer to that is I think we can do it better and I think St. Jude can do it better and so does St. Jude. And I think that the 2 of us together both believe that, first of all, if they resolve their MRI compatibility issue and continue to run the business well, which they are, this business is going to do not only how analysts expect and we expect, which is growth of 4.5%, 5% or more, but, frankly, maybe even better than that. As I've indicated on other calls, St. Jude's own estimates on how they're going to do are even higher than that. Our deal was done based on estimating, frankly, the same kind of growth rates analysts estimate, which put them at, call it, 4.5% to 5% going forward. And right now, they're tracking toward that with their performance in all their businesses. We're just waiting for an approval of an MRI-compatible CRM, and I think this changes. As I look forward, I think the breadth of the business and the combination with Abbott and the improved performance on our own Vascular business is nothing but up. And while, right now, you've got this period where there's uncertainty, uncertainty about, ""When will it close? And you haven't forecasted what it will do,"" and so forth, I think it's -- I think a lot of our investors are just more cautious. But I look at it and we look down the road at our own projections and what we believe we're going to do and I think, okay, the stock is whatever it is today, $42 or whatever. I don't think investors are ever going to see another point to buy in at this level. That's what I think. I actually believe that. And I think our track record has just proven we know how to integrate it, we know how to manage it, we know how to do well with it, we know how to add value to it, we know what the breadth of offering is, we know the quality of their pipeline and the quality of their people. You don't just buy it, put up a portfolio and leave it alone. You buy it and you put the best management you can in place and you run it the best you can. We've got really excellent management in our Medical Device business, and I think they've got excellent people, too. So in spite of the fact that they disappointed investors, I think investors got to get over last year and look forward here because I don't think we bought some challenged property here. 
Alere, yes, it has challenges. They acknowledge they have challenges, too. And frankly, they've had challenges for a number of years, and the management team that's there right now has been there just a little more than 2 years. They have dealt well with a lot of the challenges Alere has. Now they clearly have more, right? And to be honest, no matter what kind of teeth grinding and gnashing we go through with them here or they're going through, et cetera, one thing I'm certain of is that they're trying to do everything they can in their way to address the challenges in the company. I don't think otherwise. So whether it all works out the way originally planned or not, don't know, can't predict. As I've said many times, we like the products, and to us, it's an opportunistic opportunity to expand our Diagnostics business. Our Diagnostics business is one of the most consistent, top-performing businesses in our country and in its industry. And they've proven they know how to manage cost, they know to manage product, they know how to manage the commercial operations, they know how to grow, they know how to compete. This business is one of our best, most reliable businesses in the company. And to expand that footprint with more products is just an opportunistic plus. If, for some reason, it didn't work out, we still have one of the top-performing companies in the industry. But if we can add to it, well, then, even better. 
So I think to address further investors, having 2 deals in the hopper at the same time is a lot of moving parts for investors. It leaves some things uncertain. It leaves the issues you said, the equity issuance, uncertain. Obviously, if, for some reason, both of these didn't happen, there wouldn't be a need or a desire to do that because we're trying to balance our overall debt and equity balance sheet. So we'll see. We just don't know at this point. And I think there's other ways that we can consider addressing that issue around the equity issuance. I've had the feedback from investors that they are concerned, at least they don't like it because it's dilutive. And I'm aware of that. But I don't think we're anywhere close to where we have to make a decision on the equity issuance at this point. We're planning for it, but we're only going to do it if it's in our interest to do it to balance our balance sheet. So full transparency. We're planning to do it, but there's other ways it may well be addressed. And we're nowhere close to a resolution of that. I think that the uncertainty of that for investors just adds some cautious concerns and so on. And I think what I tell most people is, look, by January, this is all going to be pretty clear, and it's going to be resolved one way or another. And we'll know whether we're going to do something like that or not. I think the same thing is true with -- we get asked a lot about the Mylan shares and what are we going to do. Are they going to be play a role? The answer is to be determined, unclear. If -- right now, my sense is if I don't have to sell those shares, I'm not going to. So I think that there's enough moving parts here. I actually like the moving parts. Even though investors want real clarity, I don't want to make any of these decisions until I actually have to, and there's probably a number of months that are going to go by before we have to. And it's unfortunate it leads to a little bit of uncertainty not only for Abbott shareholders but for Mylan's, too, to some degree. But if we don't have a need to sell those shares, I don't intend to sell, at least not anytime soon. Let me put it that way. So I think those are all the moving parts. And I think there are some frustration out there. I think people want to buy the stock. I think they want to be in the stock. I think they want the ride that we think we have ahead of us here for the coming years. They just don't know whether there's going to be some surprise they can't anticipate. And right now, I think all the possible outcomes are pretty evident. And I don't see anything that's going to take us backwards, but I certainly see a lot of things that are going to take us forward. And I'm pretty optimistic about it. I just think that we and investors have to ride through about, call it, 6 months of less certainty on some of the choices here until it starts to resolve, and that's not going to be next month. It's going to be a while."

And I would estimate it is approved in the U.S., this is my estimate, my guesstimate, in the first quarter. That's what I would guess. And there's 2 stages to this. There's a Libre Pro and then a Libre consumer. So I think that our ambition will be to get this approved probably within the next 6 to 8 months, something like that. But we'll see. There's a number of steps that are going to happen here in the interim. In the meanwhile, I think it's doing exceptionally well in its rollout in Europe. We've had a really good reception from the states and countries with regard to reimbursement, which I think is unusual. This has been -- thus far, Libre's success has been driven by consumer pay and direct consumer pay. And we are achieving our goals of getting key countries, key places to agree to reimburse the product, which should, frankly, make a big difference in the performance in the market, and it's already trending north at a pretty good clip. So I'm pretty enthusiastic about Libre. And of course, when you've got a product that's as good as that is and trending like it is, you're in a big hurry to get it approved in the U.S. yesterday. So that's where we are. Brian, do you want to add anything to that? Or Scott?"

And we",883,"Okay. A couple of things. First, before I phone a friend next to me here for some of the details underlying specific products, I would tell you that, first of all, if you've got a robust portfolio of new products coming, that's always a good thing. And we're naturally always optimistic about the uptake of products, the penetration of products, the introduction of products and so forth. And it's always a constant balance of being sufficiently enthusiastic and pushing the organization hard enough on how you want to take those products to market. And then there's always the speed bumps. Something slows you down somewhere, whether its reimbursement or the timing of an approval or whatever. And in all my years in the industry, I have never seen, on a particularly consistent basis, any company, including my own, deliver its new products on time, on plan, on schedule without some kind of delay. Even with Libre, our ambitions -- we're -- in terms of our own internal goals, we're probably a couple of months behind where we wanted to be. Months, okay? A couple of months. And yet, we have a pretty stiff goal in our own minds about what we're trying to do here. And if you look at the product, it's screaming north at a rocket-like pace, which is a good thing. And all it takes is some minister somewhere to slow down its decision a few weeks and you're off by a couple of weeks. So when I look forward at St. Jude and I look at the 10%, is it potentially possible? Yes, it's potentially possible, but it's a lot of greenlights. It's a lot of greenlights without many speed bumps. And the reality of life is there's a lot of speed bumps. So I would have judged it back a little bit in terms of just caution. I think they're aspirational about the pace that those new products come. I don't think there's any disagreement on our part with them about how good the products are, how well received they'll be or what competitive response will be and so forth. I also think they're going to benefit from some great market growth rate behind a lot of these products. They don't have to go tear it away from somebody else in competition, hand-to-hand combat. The CRM business is hand-to-hand combat, but the -- a lot of the other businesses here, frankly, is just plain innovative, new and relying on growth and training physicians and usage and so forth. So I think that while they would -- their estimates really were sort of in that 9%-and-up range, I think we're just being naturally cautious of the unknown, of the unknown. And I think analysts are, too. When we looked across the consensus of analysts for St. Jude, the consensus was around 4.5% to 5% growth going forward here for the next 5 years. And what's ironic about that is, I've spoken to a lot of these analysts because we know them covering us as well, and they'll say, ""Yes, I know that's what my model says, but I'm just not sure they're really going to do that."" And that's because their growth rate was more flat over the last 5 years. But the growth rate was flat over the last 5 years because they didn't have some of these products or Thoratec or some of the other businesses they've got now. And right now, they've got a heck of a lot more in the pipeline and a heck of a lot more that they've added to the company since, say, 3, 4 years ago. So I don't think the last 5 year's growth rates are relevant as a comparison. I think what they've got and what they've done is. And I think, right now, the growth rate is only suppressed because they've got difficulty with not having an MRI-compatible claim on their CRM and CRT products. And when you take that away, this business is already at analysts' projections, and analyst projections have been more robust than the past history. So I think St. Jude is one of those stories where once you disappoint some investors in a couple of quarters, the investor doesn't believe the projection of the future as much as he believes the rearview mirror. So I think they've got to put the points on the board and earn back a little credibility that what they project is actually going to happen, and I think the sentiment will change on St. Jude. I'm not investing in sentiment. I'm investing in real products and real company and real business. And I think that what they're tracking at right now is giving the evidence that what they projected is a valid. These businesses, if you look at all the segments of businesses, they're really doing great. The one soft spot in the company is CRM, and they do have to get better reimbursement status for CardioMEMS. Okay, that's 2 things. And they're all over that, and we're comfortable with how they're all over that. The rest of the company is doing gangbusters. So I think they just got to show the evidence here over time.

I think it depends on how we construct our -- whether it's integration or cooperation across boundaries with multiple businesses, that will -- and how customers embrace that, particularly in the U.S., will determine how rapidly that goes. Now having said that, the companies have had some experience that way for some time already because we've had a joint marketing agreement with St. Jude for a number of years between our stent business and our -- and their CRM business. So we're already well familiar with each other. Of course, the dynamics change when you're part of the same company, and that's a positive. It gets better. So I think that the nature of the kind of commercial synergy we would look for in the broader portfolio of products that we offer, how we approach our accounts, how we can service our accounts, et cetera, I'd say that planning is well underway, if not starting to be in practice in a number of cases. And between Mike Rousseau, the CEO of St. Jude; and Robert Ford, our EVP, and that organization -- or these 2 organizations, I think the 2 of them and their people have planned and cooperated exceptionally well going forward here. So I think we hit the ground running as if the 2 companies have been together for a long time. I don't really foresee a lot of hiccups or bumps here."

Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2016. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. Please note that second quarter financial results and guidance provided on the call today for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only.
On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filing from today, which will be available on our website at abbott.com. Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange unless otherwise noted.
As you recall, Abbott issued a press release on April 28, 2016, announcing the transaction with St. Jude Medical. Please prefer to that release for additional important information about Abbott, St. Jude and related matters.

Today, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.55, above our guidance range. Sales increased 6.5% in the quarter, led by strong performance in Established Pharmaceuticals, Medical Devices and Diagnostics. As you",810,"Okay. Thanks, Scott. Good morning. 
Today, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.55, above our guidance range. Sales increased 6.5% in the quarter, led by strong performance in Established Pharmaceuticals, Medical Devices and Diagnostics. As you know, earlier in the quarter, we took an important strategic step with our announcement to acquire St. Jude Medical. Abbott and St. Jude combined will have a highly competitive medical device portfolio, including an industry-leading new product pipeline across cardiovascular, neuromodulation, diabetes and Vision Care. This strategic action builds upon the steps we've taken to achieve critical mass and leadership positions across each of our 4 businesses. 
In Diagnostics and Nutrition, where we hold market-leading positions today, we've been investing in R&D and infrastructure in high-growth geographies that have strengthened our global scale and competitiveness. And in Established Pharmaceuticals or EPD, we've taken a number of strategic steps over the last couple of years to position our business for long-term growth. EPD now operates entirely in emerging geographies and holds leading positions in many of the largest and fastest-growing pharmaceutical markets for branded generics in the world, including India, Russia and Latin America. All 4 of our businesses will now hold leading positions in large and growing markets that are aligned with health care and demographic trends, providing a strong foundation to deliver top tier growth over the long term. 
I'll now briefly review our second quarter results, and I'll start with Diagnostics, where we achieved sales growth of 6% in the quarter, driven by continued above-market performance in Core Laboratory and Point of Care Diagnostics. Our Diagnostics business has been a solid and continuous outperformer in the company and in its industry over the past several years. There's an opportunity here to further maintain, if not improve upon, this growth trajectory as we prepare to bring multiple next-generation systems to market across every area of diagnostics where we participate. We'll provide more details on these systems and our launch plans during the second half of the year. 
In Nutrition, sales grew around 4.5% in the quarter or more than 6% excluding the impact of Venezuela. Growth in the quarter was led by U.S. Pediatric and International Adult Nutrition. In the U.S, above-market performance in Pediatric Nutrition was driven by continued growth of recently launched products, including non-GMO products for infants and toddlers. In Adult Nutrition, double-digit international growth was led by Ensure and continued expansion of the adult nutrition market where Abbott is the global leader. 
In Medical Devices, sales growth in our Vascular business was led by share gains in our core stent business and double-digit growth of MitraClip, our market-leading device for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation. Our Endovascular business also contributed another quarter of strong growth, driven by vessel closure products and Supera, our unique peripheral stent for the treatment of blockages in the leg. And earlier this month, we received FDA approval for Absorb, the only fully dissolving vascular stent. This first-of-its-kind product is an important addition to our market-leading drug-eluting stent portfolio in the U.S.
In Medical Optics, sales growth of 5.5% was led by double-digit growth in our cataract products business, where we continue to capture share and drive growth with our portfolio of premium cataract lens products. Last week, we further strengthened our portfolio in the U.S. with the FDA approval for our TECNIS Symfony lenses, the first and only lenses that provide a full range of continuous, high-quality vision following cataract surgery. 
In Diabetes Care, international sales growth of more than 15% was driven by continued consumer uptake of our new and innovative FreeStyle Libre device in Europe. We continue to see strong demand as consumers and health care professionals become increasingly aware of the many benefits of this innovative device. There are now more than 125,000 patients utilizing FreeStyle Libre in Europe, and we're working to bring this novel technology to new markets, including the United States.
And in Established Pharmaceuticals or EPD, our strategy of targeting key geographies with a broad portfolio across select therapeutic areas continues to deliver strong results. Sales growth of 9.5% or 14% excluding the impact of Venezuela was led by balanced growth across several markets, including India, China and several countries in Latin America. The acquisitions and subsequent integrations of both CFR Pharmaceuticals and Veropharm have exceeded our expectations and are contributing to strong growth overall. 
So in summary, it was a good quarter, and we're particularly pleased with the steady cadence of new product approvals and recent launches that are contributing to growth, including FreeStyle Libre, MitraClip, Absorb and Symfony. And we took another important step to strengthen our strategic position and long-term growth potential with our announced acquisition of St. Jude Medical. 
I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian?"

Sales for the quarter increased 6.4% on an operational basis, that is excluding an unfavorable impact of 3.2% from foreign exchange.

Sales for the quarter increased 6.4% on an operational basis, that is excluding an unfavorable impact of 3.2% from foreign exchange. The negative impact from exchange was somewhat higher than previous expectations due to modest strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in the quarter. Reported sales increased 3.2% in the quarter. 
Regarding other aspects of the P&L in the quarter, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 57.6% of sales, somewhat above our previous guidance. Adjusted R&D investment was 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 31.6% of sales, each in line with previously issued guidance.
Turning to our outlook for the full year 2016. Our adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $2.14 to $2.24 from continuing operations remains unchanged and reflects double-digit underlying growth, offset by the impact of foreign exchange on our operating results. We continue to forecast operational sales growth in the mid-single digits for the full year. 
Based on current exchange rates, we expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 2.5% on our full year reported sales, somewhat higher than previous expectations of negative 2%. This would result in reported sales growth in the low single digits for the full year 2016.
We continue to forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 57% of sales for the full year, which includes underlying gross margin improvement initiatives across our businesses. We forecast adjusted R&D investment of around 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of approaching 31% of sales for the full year. We now forecast net interest expense of around $100 million, reflecting changes in interest rate assumptions on both our borrowing rates for debt and the income we earn on some of our investments, and around $35 million of nonoperating expense.
Turning to our outlook for the third quarter. We forecast adjusted earnings per share of $0.57 to $0.59, again reflecting double-digit underlying growth, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange on our results. We forecast operational sales growth of mid-single digits in the third quarter. And at current exchange rates, we'd expect a negative impact from exchange of around 1.5%. 
Turning to other aspects of the P&L. For the third quarter, we forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio somewhat above 57%, adjusted R&D investment around 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 30% of sales. Finally, we project specified items of $0.19 in the third quarter, reflecting the same items as we identified for the full year in our earnings release. 
Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide a quick overview of our third quarter and full year operational sales growth outlook by business. For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast high single-digit sales growth for both the third quarter and full year. In Nutrition, we forecast low to mid-single-digit sales growth for both the third quarter and full year. In Diagnostics, we forecast mid-single-digit sales growth for both the third quarter and full year. 
And lastly, in our Medical Devices businesses, for Vascular, we now forecast low single-digit sales growth for both the third quarter and full year. In Diabetes, we forecast high single-digit growth for the third quarter and mid-single-digit sales growth for the full year. And in Medical Optics, we forecast low to mid-single digit for the third quarter and mid-single-digit sales growth for the full year.
With that, we will now open the call for questions."

Let me deal with the transactions first, and I'll go right to the one that you targeted, Alere. From our perspective, there's been no change. They still haven't fired -- filed a 10-K. Our access to information has been limited. And they did put out a press release with an update that I think was, at least from my perspective, overenthusiastically embraced from one of their analysts. But to that extent, the update they put out basically provided no particular new information and was a requirement they had with their bondholders for the extensions they got on the requirements in their agreements, and the information they put out was characterized as preliminary, unaudited, summary only, et cetera. So I think, from our perspective, no change other than the passage of time, and that's about all I can say about it at this point. So I mean I'm not an odds predictor here so I have no particular prediction to make other than the information that's here. And there's no more really to say about it since the last time you asked me the question. So moving to St. Jude. I'd say everything is tracking well. We've got a second request from the FTC, which we'll certainly respond to. I'd say there's not much in a way of surprises there. All of our planning going forward is going according to plan. There's no surprises, no negatives. Their performance appears to be tracking according to our forecasts, our expectations and to their forecast. In fact, I'd say their report this morning looks to me like their best quarter in about the last 6 anyway, and they're trending in the right directions as we predicted and forecasted and saw in our due diligence. So I'd say with regard to St. Jude, everything is tracking well. We still hope to close that by -- before year-end. I think that will be close call just as we work our way through the administrivia of the FTC's request and so forth and whatever we may have to do there. But I'd say there's no big surprises at all. We're just going to try and complete the work that we've already indicated, and everything there is tracking according to plan. With regard to the mix of business, I'd say, as you can see in our numbers, it's a strong quarter across the board, across the world in all of our businesses but one. And the Nutrition business is weaker, and the weakness is primarily focused on China pediatric, really nowhere else. And what's been not only forecasted by some of our global competitors, but also our own experience, has been a slowing of growth in the China pediatric market. Last year at this time, I think that market was probably 13%, 14% growth estimated, and this year, it's probably just under half that would be our estimate. And I think that's probably consistent with what some of our competitors have seen or expressed as well. But we're seeing about half the growth rate as a market rate that we've seen in the past, and that's clearly softening the sales growth rate. And we've seen that, and we are seeing that. We have not yet seen any data that there's any share change that's impacting us, but our growth rate's clearly slower. So I'm a little cautious on the second half. I don't expect that to change on this particular business. I don't expect that growth rate or that, let's just call it, softness -- it's not softness in terms of decline, it's slower growth. It's still a pretty healthy growth rate compared to anywhere else in the word, and it's a good growth rate. It's just not the double-digit growth rate it was last year or the year before. And as you know, that market has been a pretty high grower from a growth rate standpoint for quite some time. So that's an adjustment to -- for all of us to adjust to. I don't know whether that's a long-term change in the market. I know that there's an increasing breastfeeding rate in China. But in terms of other fundamentals, we see channel shifts and so forth. But channel shifts shouldn't impact the overall market over time here. So other than the dynamics of just lower growth or slowing demand, I'd say that's about the best way I can characterize it. The -- as I said, the market growth at 6% is still a healthy rate. It's just not the one that we've been used to and enjoyed for the past several years."

But I think we're just in a waiting situation here. With regard to guidance, I mean I will just preempt Brian a little bit here. You recall we did raise guidance after the first quarter. And I think -- I want to be careful as I state this because all of our businesses are running really strong here, but I'm a little cautious on the second half. Part of it's FX. But part of it is just watching underlying market growth. I'm particularly keeping an eye on China. It doesn't mean I'm negative on China at all, I'm not. But I think it's premature to forecast a raise in guidance on the second half of the year. So I think we'll just keep our powder dry there."

So I'm pretty pleased with the progress there and the performance of the team. The royalty situation itself, there is a catch-up in there which inflates the number -- the growth number for this quarter because it's catch-up of the past. But it's also in this -- we're going to have that royalty going forward here so that will be something we will clearly have in the future, which is not in there for the past few quarters.

The -- we've got a number of new systems coming here, all of which have been under development for a few years in our Diagnostics business. And we're starting to see those roll out now, and we will see over the next, let's say, 2, 3 years. First of all, we just launched AlinIQ, which is an informatics program that is designed to help labs with productivity and their own cost management and so forth, which we think is going to be exceptionally well received. That's launched. Following that, we've got 5 systems coming. There's a next-generation system in our Point of Care business that will begin to launch in Europe in the second half of this year, probably in the fourth quarter, then in the U.S. in 2017. Then the Core Lab systems for both immunoassay and clinical chemistry testing will begin to roll out as well. We expect a European launch before the end of the year and the U.S. in '18, early in '18. Blood screening, same thing, late in the year in Europe -- late this year in Europe, a brand-new system. Beyond that, hematology, the following year, '17, early '17 in Europe. And then all of these early on in 2018 in the U.S. And then, finally, in our Molecular business, in the second half of '17, we begin to roll out a new system in Europe. So that's a lot, and that's unprecedented. No company in our business has ever put that many new systems out. They're not just refreshments. They're not just software updates or upgrades or incremental improvements on existing systems. They are all complete, new, fresh systems or redone and with some new advantages and so forth. So we're pretty excited about the entire product line. Diagnostics has been doing really well with the mature products in its line. And when you think about the complete line of new products coming over the next couple of years to that business, I think that's just really a great shot in the arm there for a business that's been outperforming as it is anyway. Customers will start to see those systems at the AACC conference in Philadelphia in -- later this month. At a number of industry trade shows in U.S. and Europe, we'll clearly be introducing those systems to customers so they get a preview in advance. So I think the future for Diagnostics looks pretty good."

A lot of the pushback that I get in talking about the acquisitions that -- St. Jude, Alere, it seems to revolve around a few points: that both are challenged, even troubled, assets; that you're taking on too much integration challenge at once; the uncertainty around an equity raise; the lack of certainty around how Abbott will add value, improve or better run particularly St. Jude; and maybe a little lack of clarity about the Abbott senior management team, how that's going to change, who's going to lead the effort, again, particularly on the device side. While I personally don't agree with these thoughts, I'd be curious just looking at the big picture here again. Given your long track record of successful opportunistic M&A, how is St. Jude, Alere set up better or worse than some of the past challenges you faced? Why are these the right deals after another few months of thinking about it? What needs to be done to ensure that these are the right moves today for Abbott shareholders?"

And I understand the sentiments of investors in general. I mean, I think that -- first of all, I'd say there's -- you got a skeptical, cautious attitude on the part of investors with just about everything, not particular to Abbott or specific to Abbott, but I think there's just a lot of caution out there. All that frothy, robust enthusiasm of 1.5 years ago is definitely not there now, and yet the market is at a near high. But in our business, that -- businesses, that enthusiasm or at least that attitude doesn't seem to be that lit up. So we take -- we put this in the context of all that. I think what I find in the feedback from investors is they just want a lot more clarity and a lot more visibility so that they can forecast or model or know where all this is going to go. Because I can put a historic -- I can lean on historical track record and say, ""Hey, look, AMO wasn't a great performing business when we bought it. But right now, it is doing exceptionally well."" The assets we assembled as EPD were not, at the time, great assets. I'd say CFR was a pretty great asset, but a lot of the assets that we put together weren't necessarily super performing assets. And right now, I'd say we've got one of the gems in the branded generic business globally because of the markets and the things we're in. And I think the track record of how we integrate or how we manage our businesses is proven. We're not intimidated at all by the integration. Frankly, that part, I think, we've shown we're really good at. We've got an experienced team in place. I'm not worried about that at all. And frankly, in the case of St. Jude, the organizations are so well aligned, I think that one will go extremely well and extremely smoothly. I don't consider St. Jude to be a particularly challenged organization. I think that they've got a great pipeline of products. I think they've got a lot of good products. They went through a fairly significant organizational structural change over the last 2 years that I think proved to be somewhat disruptive to the operation of the organization. We're well aware of that. We're well aware of what it meant, how it works, et cetera. But understanding that, I think we've got a pretty good idea of how to integrate St. Jude and run it going forward. With regard to the management team, the management team that will be running our device businesses will be a mix, probably a fairly balanced mix of Abbott and St. Jude people. Where we believe that there's a clear benefit to Abbott management, talent, et cetera, or experience that we can bring to the party, we certainly intend to do so. And we've pretty well lined out what we think that is, and we will also have the benefit of some of the most experienced and best managers and so forth at St. Jude. I think St. Jude has been probably more maligned in the last year than it has deserved because they missed earnings in the third and fourth quarter and they've had some delays in product approvals. But to be honest, if they had an MRI-compatible CRM product, I don't think we'd be hearing nearly as much criticism of St. Jude. And it's amazing how one thing -- or maybe if they were achieving the reimbursement of CardioMEMS faster, that's about it. Beyond that, their businesses are booming. They're -- all their other businesses are doing super well, and they've already shown that they can recover share when they get a CRM approval by their performance in Japan. So I think it's been overblown, Rick. And I understand when investors are disappointed. It takes them a while to recover from that, and then they're skeptical. And they may look at Abbott and say, ""Well, why do you think you can do it better?"" And my answer to that is I think we can do it better and I think St. Jude can do it better and so does St. Jude. And I think that the 2 of us together both believe that, first of all, if they resolve their MRI compatibility issue and continue to run the business well, which they are, this business is going to do not only how analysts expect and we expect, which is growth of 4.5%, 5% or more, but, frankly, maybe even better than that. As I've indicated on other calls, St. Jude's own estimates on how they're going to do are even higher than that. Our deal was done based on estimating, frankly, the same kind of growth rates analysts estimate, which put them at, call it, 4.5% to 5% going forward. And right now, they're tracking toward that with their performance in all their businesses. We're just waiting for an approval of an MRI-compatible CRM, and I think this changes. As I look forward, I think the breadth of the business and the combination with Abbott and the improved performance on our own Vascular business is nothing but up. And while, right now, you've got this period where there's uncertainty, uncertainty about, ""When will it close? And you haven't forecasted what it will do,"" and so forth, I think it's -- I think a lot of our investors are just more cautious. But I look at it and we look down the road at our own projections and what we believe we're going to do and I think, okay, the stock is whatever it is today, $42 or whatever. I don't think investors are ever going to see another point to buy in at this level. That's what I think. I actually believe that. And I think our track record has just proven we know how to integrate it, we know how to manage it, we know how to do well with it, we know how to add value to it, we know what the breadth of offering is, we know the quality of their pipeline and the quality of their people. You don't just buy it, put up a portfolio and leave it alone. You buy it and you put the best management you can in place and you run it the best you can. We've got really excellent management in our Medical Device business, and I think they've got excellent people, too. So in spite of the fact that they disappointed investors, I think investors got to get over last year and look forward here because I don't think we bought some challenged property here. Alere, yes, it has challenges. They acknowledge they have challenges, too. And frankly, they've had challenges for a number of years, and the management team that's there right now has been there just a little more than 2 years. They have dealt well with a lot of the challenges Alere has. Now they clearly have more, right? And to be honest, no matter what kind of teeth grinding and gnashing we go through with them here or they're going through, et cetera, one thing I'm certain of is that they're trying to do everything they can in their way to address the challenges in the company. I don't think otherwise. So whether it all works out the way originally planned or not, don't know, can't predict. As I've said many times, we like the products, and to us, it's an opportunistic opportunity to expand our Diagnostics business. Our Diagnostics business is one of the most consistent, top performing businesses in our country and in its industry. And they've proven they know how to manage cost, they know to manage product, they know how to manage the commercial operations, they know how to grow, they know how to compete. This business is one of our best, most reliable businesses in the company. And to expand that footprint with more products is just an opportunistic plus. If, for some reason, it didn't work out, we still have one of the top performing companies in the industry. But if we can add to it, well, then, even better. So I think to address further investors, having 2 deals in the hopper at the same time is a lot of moving parts for investors. It leaves some things uncertain. It leaves the issues you said, the equity issuance, uncertain. Obviously, if, for some reason, both of these didn't happen, there wouldn't be a need or a desire to do that because we're trying to balance our overall debt and equity balance sheet. So we'll see. We just don't know at this point. And I think there's other ways that we can consider addressing that issue around the equity issuance. I've had the feedback from investors that they are concerned, at least they don't like it because it's dilutive. And I'm aware of that. But I don't think we're anywhere close to where we have to make a decision on the equity issuance at this point. We're planning for it, but we're only going to do it if it's in our interest to do it to balance our balance sheet. So full transparency. We're planning to do it, but there's other ways it may well be addressed. And we're nowhere close to a resolution of that. I think that the uncertainty of that for investors just adds some cautious concerns and so on. And I think what I tell most people is, look, by January, this is all going to be pretty clear, and it's going to be resolved one way or another. And we'll know whether we're going to do something like that or not. I think the same thing is true with -- we get asked a lot about the Mylan shares and what are we going to do. Are they going to be play a role? The answer is to be determined, unclear. If -- right now, my sense is if I don't have to sell those shares, I'm not going to. So I think that there's enough moving parts here. I actually like the moving parts. Even though investors want real clarity, I don't want to make any of these decisions until I actually have to, and there's probably a number of months that are going to go by before we have to. And it's unfortunate it leads to a little bit of uncertainty not only for Abbott shareholders but for Mylan's, too, to some degree. But if we don't have a need to sell those shares, I don't intend to sell, at least not anytime soon. Let me put it that way. So I think those are all the moving parts. And I think there are some frustration out there. I think people want to buy the stock. I think they want to be in the stock. I think they want the ride that we think we have ahead of us here for the coming years. They just don't know whether there's going to be some surprise they can't anticipate. And right now, I think all the possible outcomes are pretty evident. And I don't see anything that's going to take us backwards, but I certainly see a lot of things that are going to take us forward. And I'm pretty optimistic about it. I just think that we and investors have to ride through about, call it, 6 months of less certainty on some of the choices here until it starts to resolve, and that's not going to be next month. It's going to be a while."

There's a Libre Pro and then a Libre consumer. So I think that our ambition will be to get this approved probably within the next 6 to 8 months, something like that. But we'll see. There's a number of steps that are going to happen here in the interim. In the meanwhile, I think it's doing exceptionally well in its rollout in Europe. We've had a really good reception from the states and countries with regard to reimbursement, which I think is unusual. This has been -- thus far, Libre's success has been driven by consumer pay and direct consumer pay. And we are achieving our goals of getting key countries, key places to agree to reimburse the product, which should, frankly, make a big difference in the performance in the market, and it's already trending north at a pretty good clip. So I'm pretty enthusiastic about Libre. And of course, when you've got a product that's as good as that is and trending like it is, you're in a big hurry to get it approved in the U.S. yesterday. So that's where we are. Brian, do you want to add anything to that? Or Scott?"

And we",880,"Okay. A couple of things. First, before I phone a friend next to me here for some of the details underlying specific products, I would tell you that, first of all, if you've got a robust portfolio of new products coming, that's always a good thing. And we're naturally always optimistic about the uptake of products, the penetration of products, the introduction of products and so forth. And it's always a constant balance of being sufficiently enthusiastic and pushing the organization hard enough on how you want to take those products to market. And then there's always the speed bumps. Something slows you down somewhere, whether its reimbursement or the timing of an approval or whatever. And in all my years in the industry, I have never seen, on a particularly consistent basis, any company, including my own, deliver its new products on time, on plan, on schedule without some kind of delay. Even with Libre, our ambitions -- we're -- in terms of our own internal goals, we're probably a couple of months behind where we wanted to be. Months, okay? A couple of months. And yet, we have a pretty stiff goal in our own minds about what we're trying to do here. And if you look at the product, it's screaming north at a rocket-like pace, which is a good thing. And all it takes is some minister somewhere to slow down its decision a few weeks and you're off by a couple of weeks. So when I look forward at St. Jude and I look at the 10%, is it potentially possible? Yes, it's potentially possible, but it's a lot of greenlights. It's a lot of greenlights without many speed bumps. And the reality of life is there's a lot of speed bumps. So I would have judged it back a little bit in terms of just caution. I think they're aspirational about the pace that those new products come. I don't think there's any disagreement on our part with them about how good the products are, how well received they'll be or what competitive response will be and so forth. I also think they're going to benefit from some great market growth rate behind a lot of these products. They don't have to go tear it away from somebody else in competition, hand-to-hand combat. The CRM business is hand-to-hand combat, but the -- a lot of the other businesses here, frankly, is just plain innovative, new and relying on growth and training physicians and usage and so forth. So I think that while they would -- their estimates really were sort of in that 9%-and-up range, I think we're just being naturally cautious of the unknown, of the unknown. And I think analysts are, too. When we looked across the consensus of analysts for St. Jude, the consensus was around 4.5% to 5% growth going forward here for the next 5 years. And what's ironic about that is, I've spoken to a lot of these analysts because we know them covering us as well, and they'll say, ""Yes, I know that's what my model says, but I'm just not sure they're really going to do that."" And that's because their growth rate was more flat over the last 5 years. But the growth rate was flat over the last 5 years because they didn't have some of these products or Thoratec or some of the other businesses they've got now. And right now, they've got a heck of a lot more in the pipeline and a heck of a lot more that they've added to the company since, say, 3, 4 years ago. So I don't think the last 5 year's growth rates are relevant as a comparison. I think what they've got and what they've done is. And I think, right now, the growth rate is only suppressed because they've got difficulty with not having an MRI-compatible claim on their CRM and CRT products. And when you take that away, this business is already at analysts' projections, and analyst projections have been more robust than the past history. So I think St. Jude is one of those stories where once you disappoint some investors in a couple of quarters, the investor doesn't believe the projection of the future as much as he believes the rearview mirror. So I think they've got to put the points on the board and earn back a little credibility that what they project is actually going to happen, and I think the sentiment will change on St. Jude. I'm not investing in sentiment. I'm investing in real products and real company and real business. And I think that what they're tracking at right now is giving the evidence that what they projected is a valid. These businesses, if you look at all the segments of businesses, they're really doing great. The one soft spot in the company is CRM, and they do have to get better reimbursement status for CardioMEMS. Okay, that's 2 things. And they're all over that, and we're comfortable with how they're all over that. The rest of the company is doing gangbusters. So I think they just got to show the evidence here over time. Rick, I've already forgotten the second half of your question."

Now having said that, the companies have had some experience that way for some time already because we've had a joint marketing agreement with St. Jude for a number of years between our stent business and our -- and their CRM business. So we're already well familiar with each other. Of course, the dynamics change when you're part of the same company, and that's a positive. It gets better. So I think that the nature of the kind of commercial synergy we would look for in the broader portfolio of products that we offer, how we approach our accounts, how we can service our accounts, et cetera, I'd say that planning is well underway, if not starting to be in practice in a number of cases. And between Mike Rousseau, the CEO of St. Jude; and Robert Ford, our EVP, and that organization -- or these 2 organizations, I think the 2 of them and their people have planned and cooperated exceptionally well going forward here. So I think we hit the ground running as if the 2 companies have been together for a long time. I don't really foresee a lot of hiccups or bumps here."

Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2016. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A risk factors to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2016.  
Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events and developments, except as required by law. Please note that third quarter financial results and guidance provided on the call today for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be used for continuing operations only. 
On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which will be available on our website at abbott.com. Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange, unless otherwise noted.
As you recall, Abbott issued a press release on April 28, 2016, announcing the transaction with St. Jude Medical and a related press release on October 18, 2016. Please refer to those releases for additional important information about Abbott, St. Jude and related matters. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles."

We also raised the midpoint of our 2016 adjusted earnings per share guidance and narrowed the range to $2.19 to $2.21, exceed",774,"Okay. Thanks, Scott. Good morning. Today, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.59 at the high end of our guidance range. We also raised the midpoint of our 2016 adjusted earnings per share guidance and narrowed the range to $2.19 to $2.21, exceeding the initial guidance we set at the beginning of the year. 
Sales increased 4% in the quarter or more than 5.5%, excluding the impact of Venezuela. Growth was led by strong performance in Established Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices. We achieved our expectations overall and our pipeline continued to deliver a steady cadence of new product approvals and launches that are contributing to growth. 
At the same time, we continue to actively and strategically shape our portfolio. In September, we took the next logical step in shaping our Medical Device business with the announcement that we will sell our Medical Optics business to J&J. This action is in line with our strategic decision to sharpen our focus on building leadership in cardiovascular devices. 
I'll now briefly review our third quarter results and I'll start with Diagnostics, where we achieved sales growth of 5.5% in the quarter, driven by continued above-market performance in Core Laboratory and Point of Care Diagnostics. In August, at the American Association for Clinical Chemistry conference, we unveiled our next-generation suite of instruments called Alinity. The Alinity suite includes new instruments for every segment of the diagnostics market in which we compete. Over the next few months, we'll launch new systems for point of care, immunoassay testing, clinical chemistry and blood screening in Europe. Over time, we'll introduce additional systems and launch the full Alinity suite into additional geographies, providing a highly differentiated platform for sustainable, long-term growth. 
In Nutrition, sales declined 1% in the quarter, below our expectations due to soft performance in China Pediatric Nutrition. As you may recall, I expressed caution on the near-term outlook in China in our last earnings call. Over the last few months, market conditions have remained challenging there, including rapid channel shifts and new safety regulations that are driving an oversupply of product in the market and aggressive levels of discounting. Although conditions are expected to remain challenging in the near term, the long-term fundamentals of the market remain attractive. We have the right portfolio of products for the various channels and the best-in-class global supply network. We've also continued to focus on strengthening our competitiveness in order to deliver growth over the long term. Outside of China, we continue to perform well in Southeast Asia and Latin America and again achieved above-market growth in U.S. Pediatric Nutrition.
In Medical Devices, sales growth in our Vascular business was led by double-digit growth of MitraClip, our market-leading device for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation, and high single-digit growth in Endovascular products, driven by vessel closure products and Supera, our unique stent for the treatment of blockages in the leg. During the quarter, we received FDA approval for Absorb, the only fully dissolving vascular stent and an important addition to our drug-eluting stent portfolio.
In Diabetes Care, international sales growth of more than 20% was driven by continued consumer uptake of our revolutionary FreeStyle Libre system in Europe. In September, we received FDA approval for our FreeStyle Libre Pro system in the United States. Libre Pro will help health care professionals make better customized treatment decisions for their patients and at a significantly lower cost than other professional continuous glucose monitoring systems. We also submitted the consumer version of the FreeStyle Libre system for FDA review during the quarter. This system is designed to eliminate the need for routine finger sticks and provides glucose data in a simple format that allows people with diabetes to achieve better health outcomes. 
And in Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, sales grew 9% in the quarter. Double-digit growth in Key Emerging Markets was led by strong growth in India, China and Latin America. EPD continues to execute at a very high level and remains well aligned with the fundamentals of driving long-term growth in emerging markets, a rising middle class, improving access to health care and consumers that are seeking and willing to pay for high-quality brands. 
So in summary, we achieved our financial expectations for the quarter and our diverse business model continues to deliver reliable growth. We continued to advance our leadership and competitive position through several new product approvals and launches across our businesses. And we continued to take strategic steps to shape our portfolio, building leadership positions for long-term growth. 
I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian?"

Sales for the quarter increased 4% on an operational basis, that is excluding an unfavorable impact of 1.1% from foreign exchange. Reported sales increased 2.9% in the quarter. 
Regarding other aspects of the P&L. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 57.3% of sales. Adjusted R&D investment was 6.2% of sales. And adjusted SG&A expense was 29.7% of sales, in line with our prior guidance.
Turning to our outlook for the full year 2016. We narrowed our adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $2.19 to $2.21. The midpoint of our guidance range reflects double-digit underlying growth, offset by the impact of foreign exchange on our operating results. We continue to forecast operational sales growth in the mid-single digits for the full year 2016.
Based on current exchange rates, we expect exchange to have a negative impact somewhat above 2% on our full year reported sales. This would result in reported sales growth in the low single digits for the full year 2016. We continue to forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 57% of sales for the full year, which includes underlying gross margin improvement initiatives across our businesses. We also continue to forecast adjusted R&D investment of around 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of approaching 31% of sales for the full year.
Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2016. We forecast adjusted earnings per share of $0.64 to $0.66, again reflecting double-digit underlying growth. We forecast operational sales growth of mid-single digits in the fourth quarter. We have now annualized the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar that began late in the second quarter of last year. And at current exchange rates, we expect a favorable impact to sales from exchange of somewhat more than 50 basis points in the fourth quarter.
Turning to other aspects of the P&L for the fourth quarter. We forecast adjusted gross margin ratio somewhat above 57%, adjusted R&D investments somewhat above 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 28% of sales. And finally, we project specified items of $0.25 in the fourth quarter.
Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide a quick summary of our fourth quarter operational sales growth outlook by business. For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast high single-digit sales growth. In Nutrition, we forecast sales growth similar to the third quarter. In Diagnostics, we forecast mid-single-digit growth. And lastly, in our Medical Devices business, for Vascular, we forecast mid-single-digit sales growth. In Diabetes Care, we forecast double-digit sales growth. And in Medical Optics, we forecast low to mid-single-digit sales growth. 
With that, we will now open the call for your questions."

And it depends on who you are and what channels you're in and so forth, depending how it affects you. We expected thi",583,"I'll try to. I'd say the market in China has been in a bit of a transition for a number of months, it would appear maybe other even more. And it depends on who you are and what channels you're in and so forth, depending how it affects you. We expected this year to see 7% to 8% growth in China, slightly above the GDP growth, et cetera. And what we're seeing now is flat to low single digits. And I think some of our competitors have reported the same. So we've gotten some triangulation on just underlying market growth rate. But beyond that, a number of dynamics are at work there. There's some pretty rapid channel shift from traditional channels, like modern trade to various e-commerce channels and so forth. And I don't think that surprised anybody in terms of just overall trends. But the speed and magnitude of it, I think, has hit China differently than what you'd see in the U.S. or other countries. And so that's been a pretty big chunk. In the process of that, what's happened is some inventories have piled up in, let's say, traditional channels while the market's needs have been satisfied by e-commerce channels. And so the market has got to burn through that, I guess, to some degree. So we've seen growth slow. And in our case, there's been a loss of about 0.5 share point, we estimate. We're also seeing a fair amount of market and competitor reaction to the anticipated new food safety laws, which will become effective in a little over a year, in January of '18. Those new laws will limit the number of brands per manufacturing plant for a competitor, et cetera. All products have to be reregistered and so on. And the government has got a number of goals for that. But I think what's at work here is we're seeing a lot of competitors oversupply this market. And under those scenarios, you see a lot of discounting. So we're seeing that. We're seeing the discounting. We're seeing the channel shift. We're seeing slower growth there. I do think it's transitional. I do think it's transient. But I don't think it's going to be a quick adjustment. I'm cautious for 2017 because I think that it's a little hard to predict the reaction of the many competitors and many brands in the market to these new food safety laws. So I think what we're seeing here could be with us for a while. But I think the long-term attractiveness of the market is definitely there because there aren't fewer moms, there aren't fewer babies, et cetera. But we're in kind of an odd transition period that I don't think was anticipated by the government's intent with its new food safety laws or frankly even the channel shift. So I know that's kind of a long-winded answer, but there's a lot of things kind of stacked up here happening at the same time. We've watched the results of some of our competitors and see that it hit all of us but all of us kind of differently depending on what channels we might be more prominent in. And taking that apart and trying to understand all the dynamics there, I'd say, has been a key focus over the last couple of quarters here. And I think we've got a pretty good handle on what's happening. But I think it's going to be this way for several quarters."

And Miles, I know you're not going to give '17 guidance, but I just want to think about the framework for it. When we had the call to announce the St. Jude acquisition, and then on the call that you and I had back in June, you talked about the goal of the company historically of delivering double-digit underlying EPS growth. Let's just say that's 10% and that the goal for '17 would be to try and deliver that. Then on top of it, you get the accretion from the transactions. Obviously, we don't know yet what's going to happen with Alere, but looks like St. Jude is on track to close. If we think about the base business piece of that, given that nutritionals is obviously looking weaker than it was 6 months ago, the device business was looking better, so there's some pluses and minuses, is the underlying business on track to deliver 10% next year? And is the right way to think about '17, the underlying 10% plus the accretion? Or should we back off of the underlying expectations?"

But I would say, look, the underlying growth does continue to be strong in our businesses. Fortunately, we are very diverse, many companies, many businesses, many products, many geographies. And we are not that overindexed in China in any particular case. So I can't say that I think the China pediatric business is going to be great growth next year. But I don't think it's going to impact in a fashion the overall strength of the growth of the company globally. So I'd tell you that I see the underlying growth continuing to be strong. Clearly, that will have some impact on us. But at this point, I think we're seeing great growth in our pharmaceutical business. We're in the midst of preparing to launch a number of new systems in Diagnostics. FreeStyle Libre, I'd say, is going gangbusters in Europe. And we're looking forward to having that in the U.S. shortly. There's a lot of new product launch and approval happening. So there's a lot of drivers of growth here. And frankly, I think there's a lot of growth to be seen in St. Jude as well. So I remain kind of in the same position. I know we've got a slower situation in China. But I don't see us as so overindex in China that, that is somehow going to knock us back in a way that I can forecast for you right now that this is going to have a huge impact on the company next year. I mean, frankly, it was going to have a huge impact in a fashion, you would've seen it this quarter, and we did. I mean, we've seen it in our China numbers. But look at how the company performed. We exceeded our expectations yet again. And owing to the strength and the diversity of the company and the strength in pharmaceuticals, the strength in Medical Devices, I can remember a couple of years ago, we were talking about Medical Devices as the weakness, not so much the strength. So I'd say the good news is we've got a lot of parts of the business that are performing well, if not better, in the midst of new product cycles and launches. And frankly, the other parts of Nutrition are doing reasonably well. If you look at the U.S., which I think everybody has become accustomed to sort of ignoring in the numbers, the U.S. is having a better year than planned, better year than in a long time and it's better than solid. So I think there's a lot of thing happening that offset China, to some degree. So I'd caution this way. I'd say, look, we always start the year looking for double-digit earnings growth. And yes, we will have the addition of St. Jude on top of that. And as you said, Alere remains to be seen. But in any case, I'm not in a position yet where I can say, ""No, I've got different expectations for '17."" I actually think the underlying growth continues to be strong and everything tracking according to expectations on strategic moves otherwise."

I'd have to say, they definitely put patient safety and patient credibility and physician credibility and the product performance and so forth first, and that's right. And I think that they've done all the right things. They've been in great communication with us. And based on everything that we know, I don't see this impacting the close of the deal or the business long term. I've seen a lot of speculation in the press. And every time there's a product issue or a hiccup or whatever it may be, everybody wants to run to the headlines and speculate about the deal. I'd say based on everything I see, the deal is going to close. And determined by the timing of regulatory approvals, it's probably going to close by year-end. And I haven't seen anything to date that would suggest otherwise. Regarding the performance of the company after that, I'd say honestly, what I'm most anxious for is for their MRI-compatible claim to be approved by the FDA in the U.S. And frankly, if you look at the rest of their businesses, they're all growing at a pretty healthy rate and particularly overseas. And I think their success overseas has demonstrated that when we do get their MRI-compatible claim in the U.S., that their recovery of share, recovery of growth rate, et cetera, there should be pretty strong. So I haven't changed my expectations about the performance of St. Jude going forward. And I could probably someday give you my opinion about the current circumstances with the cybersecurity claims and so forth, but I'll keep my thoughts to myself right now, and we'll wait until the deal is closed."

The -- I think the Diagnostics business has done a lot of consistent, reliable star performers of the company. It's been good mid to higher single-digit performing overall. I mean, it does have a fair number of moving parts. The core laboratory business, that just performed exceptionally well, continues to, I think, the point of care business has. We're going through the exit of an agreements in our molecular business that we will lap in a number of months. But in any case, I think all of those businesses are performing commercially well. What I'm more impressed with, with this team than anything is that over the last 4 to 5 years, they have had an unprecedented number of systems, new diagnostic systems in development in R&D that are all beginning to launch now. And I don't think ever in the history of this industry or this business has any company attempted to develop and launch multiple new systems simultaneously across every category of its business. And our Diagnostics business is, both in immunoassay, in clinical chemistry, in hematology, in blood screening, in Point of Care and then will be followed in Molecular Diagnostics. And that's an unprecedented pipeline move. We will see that roll out over years. I mean, the beginning of the launch in Europe. We've got approvals to go. So we're in an unprecedented launch phase that I think sustains the growth of the Diagnostics business across the board for years to come. And no other competitor is in a position to say that. And I think that the value proposition, the performance proposition, the economic proposition of those systems was well thought out, well designed. They where unveiled and shown at the recent AECC meeting in United States to great reception. So I have nothing but high and positive expectations. Now having said that, customers will slowly, they tend to be long-term contractors. They tend to be 5, 7, sometimes 10 years in contracts and in tenders and so forth. So I don't expect it to be a vertical line in terms of sale. But I think, if you think about the gradual rolling of a customer base and taking of share as tenders come due and so forth, I do expect that our Diagnostics business has a long, positive trajectory ahead of it and no one else does. So I'm pretty excited about that. I think they are in a uniquely strong position as we look forward and we're all pretty happy about that. I mean, it's a challenge to launch that many systems. But we'll review them all closely, look at them all closely. While you all have the natural hiccups at the end of the project that should do to cost you weak there, begin the grand schemes of things as much. So I'm pretty pleased with how that's going. With regard to Medical Devices, also pleased. I can start at the top. And let me mention, in Medical Optics, where I think the cadence of new products and the performance of our R&D team has been exceptional. And particularly, even recently with the launch of the Symfony intraocular lenses. And while we have made a deal to sell that business to J&J, we sell it in great shape with great products, great technology. They're gaining share in the cataract and intraocular lens business. I'm really pleased with what the team has been able to do there. And I think that the business will be in a strategically great home at J&J. We think we got fair value for the business and we're working on the integration trends transition of that to J&J. But I think they've been innovative. They've had a great cadence of new product development over time. I realized that that's mostly to the benefit now of J&J shareholders. But the point is across our businesses, we're seeing productivity out of our R&D and new product development like we've never seen before. If I move to Diabetes Care, our FreeStyle Libre launch in Europe has gone well. We have over 200,000 patients now. That's a lot. And that's a really good success rate so far. We had very ambitious plans for this product. And to be honest, we're behind our plan by 1 month or 2, but it's a fairly vertical ramp. It's a pretty high ramp. And that ramp is occurring at trajectory we projected, but about 1 month or 2 behind what we projected, and it will probably stay that way. So we are going to have a terrific performance, as you can already see in the numbers for this year, and even that was behind what we had hoped. But it's not because it's not on that trajectory, it just started slower than we had planned. But now it's pretty on track. And we're anxious to launch the consumer version in the United States and enjoy the same sort of success here. I think it owes to the capability of the product, the unique medical proposition of the product and frankly, the economic proposition of the product. A lot of payers and a lot of government that pay it today don't bring the new technology, bring me something more cost-effective that impacts my ability to spread my budget further and treat patients better. Well, Libre has got that in the equation in a big way. So we're looking forward to the launch of that. Our medical device business will certainly be enhanced by the addition of St. Jude. But at the same time, I think there's a lot of good things happening in our Vascular business, like [indiscernible] going well, Sapir is going well. We continue to do well in our stent business and what is otherwise not a growth business. We still remain the world leader in that category. And Absorb has been licensed to be launched in the United States. So I think across in the board in Diagnostics and Devices, without exception, even including, all these businesses have shown in the last few years real progress, real progress, tangible progress in R&D, in innovation, in developments, in meeting our timelines in a disciplined fashion, bringing new products to market, and we're seeing all that roll out now and over the next couple of years. And frankly, think it'll be sustained after that. Now having said that, I expect the same out of our St. Jude piece. And I think there's nothing but good there. So we're pretty bullish about it."

Nevertheless, it's an important business. It's a big business. It's a business we pay a lot of attention to. Frankly, China is an important country for us for a lot of our businesses. But it is true that in the grand scheme of Abbott, is China pediatric in the company isn't necessarily going to be driven by just that. So we think all of our businesses, particularly large ones, and that the large one are important, but the diversity of the company and the size of the company, Obviously, Absorb shocked when it happens in other parts of the company. So to your question about are we hands on mitigating and dealing with what we think we can do with the challenges? Yes, we are. The EVP in that business is spending a lot of time in China. We have made some management and leadership changes in China in a proactive way to enhance our management, our experience, our knowledge, our skill, et cetera there. I think hope always springs eternal when you make changes in your leadership team, et cetera. But that's -- it's getting a lot of focused attention by the senior leadership team on down and in the right ways. The CFO, the Controller, everybody who's got any kind of way to have a stake in this has weighed in. We do in the team look at our spending allocations, our capital allocations, how we're spending, where we're spending, where the bang for the buck is, et cetera. So I think we've looked at just about everything we can, not only to specifically focus on improving the situation and the performance in China, but also how to mitigate it if it doesn't improve enough or fast enough. And so yes, it's getting a fair amount of attention that way across the company. With regard to Latin America and South East Asia, I'm pleased with the progress in both places and I'm pleased with the performance of the business. Frankly, the performance of the business in Europe and other places, too. But I'm going to be careful not to project what I think can happen in any given country because of the year can side with certain set of expectations and then has some surprise you didn't anticipate, which is one of the reasons I always tap the diverse model because somewhere something is going to go awry or different from your expectations and no matter how tight you manage everything. In our case, I'm pleased with our management teams in the various geographies you mentioned. I think they're all doing well. We've got a lot of talent in the organization. We've made some changes where we needed to. In this particular case, our challenge in China wasn't talent based as much as market driven and a lot of dynamics that change rapidly there that we had to react to and deal with. So I think there are a number of other countries picking up slack here. U.S, surprisingly one of them in the nutrition business. You can see the numbers in the earnings report. Vietnam, doing well, strong for us. A lot of other smaller countries doing well. Vietnam, as you know, the big business for us in the Nutrition business. And we've got a terrific manager there. Happy to have for a long time, and that's doing well. So there is some places that are picking up some of the slack there. Frankly, so our our other business of Abbott, like the pharmaceutical business and so forth having a great year in China and other countries and good, sustained, high-growth performance. So again, yes, it's proactive. We are mitigating. It's why we're not giving any guidance or anything at this point. I do -- as I answered Mike Weinstein earlier, the underlying fundamentals of the overall growth rates in our markets are good, but one place that sticks out right now as a challenge is the pediatric business in China, which is about 3% of the company sales."

And we believe that the notion and the opportunity was such that we just plain had a different game plan than everybody else and that it was worth us making that core and pursuing it, and we have.

So at some point, we would hope that Libre would grow so significantly that it would overtake the other. So I don't expect, obviously, that kind of growth out of the base. But I think we're going to keep experiencing pretty heavy double-digit growth out of Libre for the foreseeable future. So yes, I think it drives a lot of growth. But we're in process.

You can see it in the bottom line of the company. You can see it in those margin of the company. So we expanded those efforts across the company in a number of places. And I think what we've obviously learned from that is there's always opportunity to improve your business model, improve your cost structure, improve your gross margin, et cetera. It's not -- and it hasn't been done with price. It's been done with the fundamental inputs in cost and the way we do business, the way we manufacture, the way we do a lot of things. So I think there's always opportunity and we approach the business and the businesses every year with that in mind. And it's fortunate that we have because we've had some great success there in a couple of businesses particularly, which has offset the effects of exchange over the last, say, 3 to 4 years, which has been pretty heavy. And without that, the company would have obviously been a lot more profit growth pressure. So for us, it's become a routine. We look for more gross margin improvement opportunity every year. And if I look across the businesses, there are still many opportunities for us as we benchmark competitors or other models the business models we see out there to improve the cost structure of our business in ways that are meaningful for the corporation. That included in that is even the clause of new things launch, the cause of our new diagnostic analyzers will be a tremendous improvement over the clause of our current diagnostic analyzers. And one of the ways you can affect gross margin over the long term is design it in your products, and we are. So I think there's a lot of initiatives internally at the company and the cross businesses now that make this part of routine daily life to keep improving gross margin. I can't forecast to you right know how that had impact us. But I think in a world where you denominated in dollars and every year, exchange tries to erose some of your top and bottom line, it becomes routine part of your business to always be looking at ways to improve your margin.

Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2016. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A risk factors to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2016.  
Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events and developments, except as required by law. Please note that third quarter financial results and guidance provided on the call today for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be used for continuing operations only. 
On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which will be available on our website at abbott.com. Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange, unless otherwise noted.
As you recall, Abbott issued a press release on April 28, 2016, announcing the transaction with St. Jude Medical and a related press release on October 18, 2016. Please refer to those releases for additional important information about Abbott, St. Jude and related matters.

Today, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.59 at the high end of our guidance range. We also raised the midpoint of our 2016 adjusted earnings per share guidance and narrowed the range to $2.19 to $2.21, exceed",774,"Okay. Thanks, Scott. Good morning. Today, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.59 at the high end of our guidance range. We also raised the midpoint of our 2016 adjusted earnings per share guidance and narrowed the range to $2.19 to $2.21, exceeding the initial guidance we set at the beginning of the year. 
Sales increased 4% in the quarter or more than 5.5%, excluding the impact of Venezuela. Growth was led by strong performance in Established Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices. We achieved our expectations overall and our pipeline continued to deliver a steady cadence of new product approvals and launches that are contributing to growth. 
At the same time, we continue to actively and strategically shape our portfolio. In September, we took the next logical step in shaping our Medical Device business with the announcement that we will sell our Medical Optics business to J&J. This action is in line with our strategic decision to sharpen our focus on building leadership in cardiovascular devices. 
I'll now briefly review our third quarter results and I'll start with Diagnostics, where we achieved sales growth of 5.5% in the quarter, driven by continued above-market performance in Core Laboratory and Point of Care Diagnostics. In August, at the American Association for Clinical Chemistry conference, we unveiled our next-generation suite of instruments called Alinity. The Alinity suite includes new instruments for every segment of the diagnostics market in which we compete. Over the next few months, we'll launch new systems for Point of Care, immunoassay testing, clinical chemistry and blood screening in Europe. Over time, we'll introduce additional systems and launch the full Alinity suite into additional geographies, providing a highly differentiated platform for sustainable, long-term growth. 
In Nutrition, sales declined 1% in the quarter, below our expectations due to soft performance in China Pediatric Nutrition. As you may recall, I expressed caution on the near-term outlook in China in our last earnings call. Over the last few months, market conditions have remained challenging there, including rapid channel shifts and new safety regulations that are driving an oversupply of product in the market and aggressive levels of discounting. Although conditions are expected to remain challenging in the near term, the long-term fundamentals of the market remain attractive. We have the right portfolio of products for the various channels and the best-in-class global supply network. We've also continued to focus on strengthening our competitiveness in order to deliver growth over the long term. Outside of China, we continue to perform well in Southeast Asia and Latin America and again achieved above-market growth in U.S. Pediatric Nutrition.
In Medical Devices, sales growth in our Vascular business was led by double-digit growth of MitraClip, our market-leading device for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation, and high single-digit growth in Endovascular products, driven by vessel closure products and Supera, our unique stent for the treatment of blockages in the leg. During the quarter, we received FDA approval for Absorb, the only fully dissolving vascular stent and an important addition to our drug-eluting stent portfolio.
In Diabetes Care, international sales growth of more than 20% was driven by continued consumer uptake of our revolutionary FreeStyle Libre system in Europe. In September, we received FDA approval for our FreeStyle Libre Pro system in the United States. Libre Pro will help health care professionals make better customized treatment decisions for their patients and at a significantly lower cost than other professional continuous glucose monitoring systems. We also submitted the consumer version of the FreeStyle Libre system for FDA review during the quarter. This system is designed to eliminate the need for routine finger sticks and provides glucose data in a simple format that allows people with diabetes to achieve better health outcomes. 
And in Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, sales grew 9% in the quarter. Double-digit growth in Key Emerging Markets was led by strong growth in India, China and Latin America. EPD continues to execute at a very high level and remains well aligned with the fundamentals of driving long-term growth in emerging markets, a rising middle class, improving access to health care and consumers that are seeking and willing to pay for high-quality brands. 
So in summary, we achieved our financial expectations for the quarter and our diverse business model continues to deliver reliable growth. We continued to advance our leadership and competitive position through several new product approvals and launches across our businesses. And we continued to take strategic steps to shape our portfolio, building leadership positions for long-term growth. 
I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian?"

Sales for the quarter increased 4% on an operational basis, that is excluding an unfavorable impact of 1.1% from foreign exchange. Reported sales increased 2.9% in the quarter. 
Regarding other aspects of the P&L. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 57.3% of sales. Adjusted R&D investment was 6.2% of sales. And adjusted SG&A expense was 29.7% of sales, in line with our prior guidance.
Turning to our outlook for the full year 2016. We narrowed our adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $2.19 to $2.21. The midpoint of our guidance range reflects double-digit underlying growth, offset by the impact of foreign exchange on our operating results. We continue to forecast operational sales growth in the mid-single digits for the full year 2016.
Based on current exchange rates, we expect exchange to have a negative impact somewhat above 2% on our full year reported sales. This would result in reported sales growth in the low single digits for the full year 2016. We continue to forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 57% of sales for the full year, which includes underlying gross margin improvement initiatives across our businesses. We also continue to forecast adjusted R&D investment of around 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of approaching 31% of sales for the full year.
Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2016. We forecast adjusted earnings per share of $0.64 to $0.66, again reflecting double-digit underlying growth. We forecast operational sales growth of mid-single digits in the fourth quarter. We have now annualized the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar that began late in the second quarter of last year. And at current exchange rates, we expect a favorable impact to sales from exchange of somewhat more than 50 basis points in the fourth quarter.
Turning to other aspects of the P&L for the fourth quarter. We forecast adjusted gross margin ratio somewhat above 57%, adjusted R&D investments somewhat above 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 28% of sales. And finally, we project specified items of $0.25 in the fourth quarter.
Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide a quick summary of our fourth quarter operational sales growth outlook by business. For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast high single-digit sales growth. In Nutrition, we forecast sales growth similar to the third quarter. In Diagnostics, we forecast mid-single-digit growth. And lastly, in our Medical Devices business, for Vascular, we forecast mid-single-digit sales growth. In Diabetes Care, we forecast double-digit sales growth. And in Medical Optics, we forecast low to mid-single-digit sales growth. 
With that, we will now open the call for your questions."

I'd say the market in China has been in a bit of a transition for a number of months, it would appear maybe other even more. And it depends on who you are and what channels you're in and so forth, depending how it affects you. We expected this year to see 7% to 8% growth in China, slightly above the GDP growth, et cetera. And what we're seeing now is flat to low single digits. And I think some of our competitors have reported the same. So we've gotten some triangulation on just underlying market growth rate. But beyond that, a number of dynamics are at work there. There's some pretty rapid channel shift from traditional channels, like modern trade to various e-commerce channels and so forth. And I don't think that surprised anybody in terms of just overall trends. But the speed and magnitude of it, I think, has hit China differently than what you'd see in the U.S. or other countries. And so that's been a pretty big chunk. In the process of that, what's happened is some inventories have piled up in, let's say, traditional channels while the market's needs have been satisfied by e-commerce channels. And so the market has got to burn through that, I guess, to some degree. So we've seen growth slow. And in our case, there's been a loss of about 0.5 share point, we estimate. We're also seeing a fair amount of market and competitor reaction to the anticipated new food safety laws, which will become effective in a little over a year, in January of '18. Those new laws will limit the number of brands per manufacturing plant for a competitor, et cetera. All products have to be reregistered and so on. And the government has got a number of goals for that. But I think what's at work here is we're seeing a lot of competitors oversupply this market. And under those scenarios, you see a lot of discounting. So we're seeing that. We're seeing the discounting. We're seeing the channel shift. We're seeing slower growth there. I do think it's transitional. I do think it's transient. But I don't think it's going to be a quick adjustment. I'm cautious for 2017 because I think that it's a little hard to predict the reaction of the many competitors and many brands in the market to these new food safety laws. So I think what we're seeing here could be with us for a while. But I think the long-term attractiveness of the market is definitely there because there aren't fewer moms, there aren't fewer babies, et cetera. But we're in kind of an odd transition period that I don't think was anticipated by the government's intent with its new food safety laws or frankly even the channel shift. So I know that's kind of a long-winded answer, but there's a lot of things kind of stacked up here happening at the same time. We've watched the results of some of our competitors and see that it hit all of us but all of us kind of differently depending on what channels we might be more prominent in. And taking that apart and trying to understand all the dynamics there, I'd say, has been a key focus over the last couple of quarters here. And I think we've got a pretty good handle on what's happening. But I think it's going to be this way for several quarters."

When we had the call to announce the St. Jude acquisition, and then on the call that you and I had back in June, you talked about the goal of the company historically of delivering double-digit underlying EPS growth. Let's just say that's 10% and that the goal for '17 would be to try and deliver that. Then on top of it, you get the accretion from the transactions. Obviously, we don't know yet what's going to happen with Alere, but looks like St. Jude is on track to close. If we think about the base business piece of that, given that nutritionals is obviously looking weaker than it was 6 months ago, the device business was looking better, so there's some pluses and minuses, is the underlying business on track to deliver 10% next year? And is the right way to think about '17, the underlying 10% plus the accretion? Or should we back off of the underlying expectations?"

But I would say, look, the underlying growth does continue to be strong in our businesses. Fortunately, we are very diverse, many companies, many businesses, many products, many geographies. And we are not that overindexed in China in any particular case. So I can't say that I think the China pediatric business is going to be great growth next year. But I don't think it's going to impact in a fashion the overall strength of the growth of the company globally. So I'd tell you that I see the underlying growth continuing to be strong. Clearly, that will have some impact on us. But at this point, I think we're seeing great growth in our pharmaceutical business. We're in the midst of preparing to launch a number of new systems in Diagnostics. FreeStyle Libre, I'd say, is going gangbusters in Europe. And we're looking forward to having that in the U.S. shortly. There's a lot of new product launch and approval happening. So there's a lot of drivers of growth here. And frankly, I think there's a lot of growth to be seen in St. Jude as well. So I remain kind of in the same position. I know we've got a slower situation in China. But I don't see us as so overindex in China that, that is somehow going to knock us back in a way that I can forecast for you right now that this is going to have a huge impact on the company next year. I mean, frankly, it was going to have a huge impact in a fashion, you would've seen it this quarter, and we did. I mean, we've seen it in our China numbers. But look at how the company performed. We exceeded our expectations yet again. And owing to the strength and the diversity of the company and the strength in pharmaceuticals, the strength in Medical Devices, I can remember a couple of years ago, we were talking about Medical Devices as the weakness, not so much the strength. So I'd say the good news is we've got a lot of parts of the business that are performing well, if not better, in the midst of new product cycles and launches. And frankly, the other parts of Nutrition are doing reasonably well. If you look at the U.S., which I think everybody has become accustomed to sort of ignoring in the numbers, the U.S. is having a better year than planned, better year than in a long time and it's better than solid. So I think there's a lot of thing happening that offset China, to some degree. So I'd caution this way. I'd say, look, we always start the year looking for double-digit earnings growth. And yes, we will have the addition of St. Jude on top of that. And as you said, Alere remains to be seen. But in any case, I'm not in a position yet where I can say, ""No, I've got different expectations for '17."" I actually think the underlying growth continues to be strong and everything tracking according to expectations on strategic moves otherwise."

I'd have to say, they definitely put patient safety and patient credibility and physician credibility and the product performance and so forth first, and that's right. And I think that they've done all the right things. They've been in great communication with us. And based on everything that we know, I don't see this impacting the close of the deal or the business long term. I've seen a lot of speculation in the press. And every time there's a product issue or a hiccup or whatever it may be, everybody wants to run to the headlines and speculate about the deal. I'd say based on everything I see, the deal is going to close. And determined by the timing of regulatory approvals, it's probably going to close by year-end. And I haven't seen anything to date that would suggest otherwise. Regarding the performance of the company after that, I'd say honestly, what I'm most anxious for is for their MRI-compatible claim to be approved by the FDA in the U.S. And frankly, if you look at the rest of their businesses, they're all growing at a pretty healthy rate and particularly overseas. And I think their success overseas has demonstrated that when we do get their MRI-compatible claim in the U.S., that their recovery of share, recovery of growth rate, et cetera, there should be pretty strong. So I haven't changed my expectations about the performance of St. Jude going forward. And I could probably someday give you my opinion about the current circumstances with the cybersecurity claims and so forth, but I'll keep my thoughts to myself right now, and we'll wait until the deal is closed."

The -- I think the Diagnostics business has been one of the consistent, reliable star performers of the company. It's been a good mid- to higher single-digit performing overall. I mean, it does have a fair number of moving parts. The Core Laboratory business, that just performed exceptionally well, continues to. I think the Point of Care business has. We're going through the exit of an agreement in our Molecular business that we will lap in a number of months. But in any case, I think all of those businesses are performing commercially well. What I'm more impressed with, with this team than anything is that over the last 4 to 5 years, they have had an unprecedented number of systems, new diagnostic systems in development in R&D that are all beginning to launch now. And I don't think ever in the history of this industry or this business has any company attempted to develop and launch multiple new systems simultaneously across every category of its business. And our Diagnostics business is both in immunoassay, in clinical chemistry, in hematology, in blood screening, in Point of Care, and then to be followed in Molecular Diagnostics. And that's an unprecedented pipeline move. We will see that roll out over years now. I mean, they're beginning to launch in Europe. We've gotten approvals to go. So we're in an unprecedented launch phase that I think sustains the growth of the Diagnostics business across the board for years to come. And no other competitor is in a position to say that. And I think that the value proposition, the performance proposition, the economic proposition of those systems was well-thought-out, well-designed. They were unveiled and shown at the recent AACC meeting in the United States to a great reception. So I have nothing but high and positive expectations. Now having said that, customers will slowly -- they tend to be long-term contractors. They tend to be 5, 7, sometimes 10 years in contracts and in tenders and so forth. So I don't expect it to be a vertical line in terms of sales. But I think if you think about the gradual rolling of a customer base and taking of share as tenders come due and so forth, I do expect that our Diagnostics business has a long positive trajectory ahead of it and no one else does. So I'm pretty excited about that. I think they're in a uniquely strong position as we look forward. And we're all pretty happy about that. And it's a challenge to launch that many systems. But we'll review them all closely, look at them all closely. And while you all have the natural hiccups at the end of a project that you do that would cost you a week here and a week there, a week in the grand schemes of things is much. So I'm pretty pleased with how that's going. With regard to Medical Devices, also pleased. And I can start at the top. And let me mention in Medical Optics, where I think the cadence of new products and the performance of that R&D team has been exceptional, and particularly even recently with the launch of the Symfony intraocular lenses. And while we have made a deal to sell that business to J&J, we sell it in great shape with great products, great technology. They're gaining share in the cataract and intraocular lens business. I'm really pleased with what the team has been able to do there. And I think that the business will be in a strategically great home at J&J. We think we've got a fair value for the business and we're working on the integration transition of that to J&J. But I think they've been innovative. They've had a great cadence of new product development over time. I realized that, that's mostly to the benefit now of J&J shareholders. But the point is across our businesses, we're seeing productivity out of our R&D and new product development like we've never seen before. If I move to Diabetes Care, our FreeStyle Libre launch in Europe has gone well. We have over 200,000 patients now. That's a lot. And that's a really good success rate so far. We had very ambitious plans for this product. And to be honest, we're behind our plans by a month or 2, but it's a fairly vertical ramp, it's a pretty high ramp. And that ramp is occurring at the trajectory we projected but about a month or 2 behind what we projected. And it will probably stay that way. So we're going to have a terrific performance as you can already see in the numbers for this year. And even that was behind what we had hoped. But it's not because it's not on that trajectory, it just started slower than we had planned, but now it's pretty on track. And we're anxious to launch the consumer version in the United States and enjoy the same sort of success here. And I think it owes to the capability of the product, the unique medical proposition of the product and frankly the economic proposition of the product. A lot of payers and a lot of governments will say today, ""Don't bring me new technology, bring me something more cost-effective that impacts my ability to spread my budget further and treat patients better."" Well, Libre has got that in the equation in a big way. So we're looking forward to the launch of that. Our Medical Device business will certainly be enhanced by the addition of St. Jude. But at the same time, I think there's a lot of good things happening in our Vascular business, MitraClip is going well, Supera is going well. We continue to do well in our stent business in what is otherwise not a growth business. We still remain the world leader in that category. And Absorb has been licensed and launched in the United States. So I think across in the board in Diagnostics and devices, without exception, even including AMO, all these businesses have shown in the last few years real progress, tangible progress in R&D, in innovation, in development, in meeting their time lines in a disciplined fashion, bringing new products to market. And we're seeing all that roll out now and over the next couple of years. And frankly, I think it will be sustained after that. Now having said that, I expect the same out of our St. Jude piece. And I think there's nothing but good there. So we're pretty bullish about it."

But it is true that in the grand scheme of Abbott, as China pediatric goes, the company isn't necessarily going to be driven by just that. So we think all of our businesses, particularly large ones, and that's a large one, are important. But the diversity of the company and the size of the company, obviously, absorb-shock when it happens in other parts of the company. So to your question about are we hands-on mitigating and dealing with what we think we can do with the challenges? Yes, we are. The EVP of that business is spending a lot of time in China. We have made some management and leadership changes in China in a proactive way to enhance our management, our experience, our knowledge, our skill, et cetera, there. I think hope always springs eternal when you make changes in your leadership team, et cetera, but that's -- it's getting a lot of focused attention by the senior leadership team on down and in the right ways. The CFO, the Controller, everybody who's got any kind of way to have a stake in this has weighed in. We do as a team look at our spending allocations, our capital allocations, how we're spending, where we're spending, where the bang for the buck is, et cetera. So I think we've looked at just about everything we can, not only to specifically focus on improving the situation and the performance in China but also how to mitigate it if it doesn't improve enough or fast enough. And so yes, it's getting a fair amount of attention that way across the company. With regard to Latin America and Southeast Asia, I'm pleased with the progress in both places and I'm pleased with the performance of the business -- frankly including the performance of the business in Europe and other places, too. But I'm going to be careful not to project what I think can happen in any given country because the year always starts with a certain set of expectations, and then has some surprise you didn't anticipate, which is one of the reasons I always tout the diverse model because somewhere, something is going to go awry or different from your expectations and no matter how tightly you manage everything. In our case, I'm pleased with our management teams in the various geographies you mentioned. I think they're all doing well. We've got a lot of talent in our organization. We've made some changes where we needed to. In this particular case, our challenge in China wasn't talent-based as much as market-driven and a lot of dynamics that change rapidly there that we had to react to and deal with. So I think there are a number of other countries picking up slack here, the U.S., surprisingly one of them in the Nutrition business. I think you can see that in the numbers in the earnings report. Vietnam, doing well, strong for us, a lot of other smaller countries doing well. Vietnam, as you know, is a big business for us in the Nutrition business. And we've got a terrific manager there and have had for a long time, and that's doing well. So there's some places that are picking up some of the slack there, and frankly so are other businesses of Abbott, like the pharmaceutical business and so forth, having a great year in China and other countries and good, sustained, high-growth performance. So again, yes, it's proactive. We are mitigating. It's why we're not giving any guidance or anything at this point. I do -- as I answered to Mike Weinstein earlier, the underlying fundamentals of the overall growth rates in our market are good. But one place that sticks out right now as a challenge is the pediatric business in China, which is about 3% of the company sales."

And we believe that the notion and the opportunity was such that we just plainly had a different game plan than everybody else and that it was worth us making that core and pursuing it, and we have. And we're seeing the benefit of that now with the rollout of Libre in Europe and soon rollout in the United States. And there's a lot of opportunity for Libre beyond that, I think, on how we develop it and how we take it. So it is strategically core to us.

So at some point, we would hope that Libre would grow so significantly that it would overtake the other. So I don't expect obviously that kind of growth out of the base. But I think we're going to keep experiencing pretty heavy double-digit growth out of Libre for the foreseeable future. So yes, I think it drives a lot of growth.

You could see it in the bottom line of those businesses. You could see it in the bottom line of the company. You could see it in the gross margin of the company. So we expanded those efforts across the company in a number of places. And I think what we've obviously learned from that is there's always opportunity to improve your business model, improve your cost structure, improve your gross margin, et cetera. It's not -- and it hasn't been done with price. It's been done with the fundamental inputs in cost and the way we do business, the way we manufacture, the way we do a lot of things. So I think there's always opportunity. And we approach the business and the businesses every year with that in mind. And it's fortunate that we have because we've had some great success there in a couple of businesses particularly, which has offset the effects of exchange over the last, say, 3, 4 years, which as you know has been pretty heavy. And without that, the company would have obviously been under a lot more profit growth pressure. So for us, it's become a routine. We look for more gross margin improvement opportunity every year. And if I look across the businesses, there are still many opportunities for us as we benchmark competitors or other models, the business models we see out there to improve the cost structure of our business in ways that are meaningful for the corporation. Included in that is even the cost of new things launching. The cost of our new diagnostic analyzers will be a tremendous improvement over the cost of our current diagnostic analyzers. And one of the ways you can affect gross margin over the long term is design it into your products, and we are. So I think there's a lot of initiatives internally at the company and across businesses now that make this a part of routine daily life to keep improving gross margin. I can't forecast to you right know how that will impact us. But I think in a world where you're denominated in dollars and every year, exchange tries to erode some of your top and bottom line, it becomes a routine part of your business to always be looking at ways to improve your margin.

Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2016. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2016.  
Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events and developments, except as required by law. Please note that third quarter financial results and guidance provided on the call today for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be used for continuing operations only. 
On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which will be available on our website at abbott.com. Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange, unless otherwise noted.
As you recall, Abbott issued a press release on April 28, 2016, announcing the transaction with St. Jude Medical and a related press release on October 18, 2016. Please refer to those releases for additional important information about Abbott, St. Jude and related matters.

Today, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.59, at the high end of our guidance range. We also raised the midpoint of our 2016 adjusted earnings per share guidance and narrowed the range to $2.19 to $2.21, exceeding the initial guidance we set at the beginning of the year. 
Sales increased 4% in the quarter or more than 5.5%, excluding the impact of Venezuela. Growth was led by strong performance in Established Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices. We achieved our expectations overall, and our pipeline continued to deliver a steady cadence of new product approvals and launches that are contributing to growth. 
At the same time, we continued to actively and strategically shape our portfolio. In September, we took the next logical step in shaping our Medical Device business with the announcement that we will sell our Medical Optics business to J&J. This action is in line with our strategic decision to sharpen our focus on building leadership in cardiovascular devices. 
I'll now briefly review our third quarter results, and I'll start with Diagnostics, where we achieved sales growth of 5.5% in the quarter, driven by continued above-market performance in Core Laboratory and Point of Care Diagnostics. In August, at the American Association for Clinical Chemistry conference, we unveiled our next-generation suite of instruments called Alinity. The Alinity suite includes new instruments for every segment of the diagnostics market in which we compete. Over the next few months, we'll launch new systems for point of care, immunoassay testing, clinical chemistry and blood screening in Europe. Over time, we'll introduce additional systems and launch the full Alinity suite into additional geographies, providing a highly differentiated platform for sustainable, long-term growth. 
In Nutrition, sales declined 1% in the quarter, below our expectations, due to soft performance in China Pediatric Nutrition. As you may recall, I expressed caution on the near-term outlook in China in our last earnings call. Over the last few months, market conditions have remained challenging there, including rapid channel shifts and new safety regulations that are driving an oversupply of product in the market and aggressive levels of discounting. Although conditions are expected to remain challenging in the near term, the long-term fundamentals of the market remain attractive. We have the right portfolio of products for the various channels and the best-in-class global supply network. We've also continued to focus on strengthening our competitiveness in order to deliver growth over the long term. Outside of China, we continued to perform well in Southeast Asia and Latin America and again achieved above-market growth in U.S. Pediatric Nutrition.
In Medical Devices, sales growth in our Vascular business was led by double-digit growth of MitraClip, our market-leading device for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation, and high single-digit growth in endovascular products, driven by vessel closure products and Supera, our unique stent for the treatment of blockages in the leg. During the quarter, we received FDA approval for Absorb, the only fully dissolving vascular stent and an important addition to our drug-eluting stent portfolio.
In Diabetes Care, international sales growth of more than 20% was driven by continued consumer uptake of our revolutionary FreeStyle Libre system in Europe. In September, we received FDA approval for our FreeStyle Libre Pro system in the United States. Libre Pro will help health care professionals make better customized treatment decisions for their patients and at a significantly lower cost than other professional continuous glucose monitoring systems. We also submitted the consumer version of the FreeStyle Libre system for FDA review during the quarter. This system is designed to eliminate the need for routine finger sticks and provides glucose data in a simple format that allows people with diabetes to achieve better health outcomes. 
And in Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, sales grew 9% in the quarter. Double-digit growth in key emerging markets was led by strong growth in India, China and Latin America. EPD continues to execute at a very high level and remains well aligned, with the fundamentals driving long-term growth in emerging markets, a rising middle class, improving access to health care and consumers that are seeking and willing to pay for high-quality brands. 
So in summary, we achieved our financial expectations for the quarter and our diverse business model continues to deliver reliable growth. We've continued to advance our leadership and competitive position through several new product approvals and launches across our businesses. And we continued to take strategic steps to shape our portfolio, building leadership positions for long-term growth. 
I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian?"

That is excluding an unfavorable impact of 1.1% from foreign exchange. Reported sales increased 2.9% in the quarter. 
Regarding other aspects of the P&L. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 57.3% of sales. Adjusted R&D investment was 6.2% of sales. And adjusted SG&A expense was 29.7% of sales, in line with our prior guidance.
Turning to our outlook for the full year 2016. We narrowed our adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $2.19 to $2.21. The midpoint of our guidance range reflects double-digit underlying growth offset by the impact of foreign exchange on our operating results. We continue to forecast operational sales growth in the mid-single digits for the full year 2016.
Based on current exchange rates, we expect exchange to have a negative impact somewhat above 2% on our full year reported sales. This would result in reported sales growth in the low single digits for the full year 2016. We continue to forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 57% of sales for the full year, which includes underlying gross margin improvement initiatives across our businesses. We also continue to forecast adjusted R&D investment of around 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of approaching 31% of sales for the full year.
Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2016. We forecast adjusted earnings per share of $0.64 to $0.66, again reflecting double-digit underlying growth. We forecast operational sales growth of mid-single digits in the fourth quarter. We have now annualized the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar that began late in the second quarter of last year. And at current exchange rates, we expect a favorable impact to sales from exchange of somewhat more than 50 basis points in the fourth quarter.
Turning to other aspects of the P&L for the fourth quarter. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat above 57%, adjusted R&D investments somewhat above 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 28% of sales. And finally, we project specified items of $0.25 in the fourth quarter.
Before we open the call for questions, I will now provide a quick summary of our fourth quarter operational sales growth outlook by business. For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast high single-digit sales growth. In Nutrition, we forecast sales growth similar to the third quarter. In Diagnostics, we forecast mid-single-digit growth. And lastly, in our Medical Devices business, for Vascular, we forecast mid-single-digit sales growth. In Diabetes Care, we forecast double-digit sales growth. And in Medical Optics, we forecast low to mid-single-digit sales growth. 
With that, we will now open the call for your questions."

I'd say the market in China has been in a bit of a transition for a number of months, it would appear, maybe even a little more. And that depends on who you are and what channels you're in and so forth, depending on how it affects you. We expected this year to see 7% to 8% growth in China, slightly above the GDP growth, et cetera. And what we're seeing now is flat to low single digits. And I think some of our competitors have reported the same. So we've gotten some triangulation on kind of just underlying market growth rate. But beyond that, a number of dynamics are at work there. There's some pretty rapid channel shifts from traditional channels like modern trade to various e-commerce channels and so forth. And I don't think that's surprised anybody in terms of just overall trends. But the speed and magnitude of it, I think, has hit China differently than what you'd see in the U.S. or other countries. And so that's been a pretty big chunk. In the process of that, what's happened is some inventories have piled up in, let's say, traditional channels while they've been -- while the market's needs have been satisfied by e-commerce channels. And so the market has got to burn through that, I guess, to some degree. So we've seen growth slow. And in our case, there's been a loss of about 0.5 share point, we estimate. We're also seeing a fair amount of market and competitor reaction to the anticipated new food safety laws, which will become effective in a little over a year, in January of '18. Those new laws will limit the number of brands per manufacturing plant, per competitor, et cetera. All products have to be reregistered and so on. And the government's got a number of goals for that. But I think what's at work here is we're seeing a lot of competitors oversupply this market. And under those scenarios, you see a lot of discounting. So we're seeing that. We're seeing the discounting. We're seeing the channel shift. We're seeing slower growth there. I do think it's transitional. I do think it's transient. But I don't think it's going to be a quick adjustment. I'm cautious for 2017 because I think that it's a little hard to predict the reaction of the many competitors and many brands in the market to these new food safety laws. So I think what we're seeing here could be with us for a while. But I think the long-term attractiveness of the market is definitely there because there aren't fewer moms, there aren't fewer babies, et cetera. But we're in kind of an odd transition period that I don't think was anticipated by the government's intent with its new food safety laws or, frankly, even the channel shift. So I know that's kind of a long-winded answer, but there's a lot of things kind of stacked up here happening at the same time. We've watched the results of some of our competitors, and see that it's hit all of us but all of us kind of differently depending on what channels we might be more prominent in. And taking that apart and trying to understand all the dynamics there, I'd say, has been a key focus over the last couple of quarters here. And I think we've got a pretty good handle on what's happening. But I think it's going to be this way for several quarters."

And Miles, I know you're not going to give '17 guidance, but I just want to think about the framework for it. When we had that call to announce the St. Jude acquisition, and then on the call that you and I had back in June, you talked about the goal of the company historically of delivering double-digit underlying EPS growth. Let's just say that's 10%, and that the goal for '17 would be to try and deliver that. And then on top of it, you'd get the accretion from the transactions. Obviously, we don't know yet what's going to happen with Alere, but it looks like St. Jude is on track to close. If we think about the base business piece of that, given that nutritionals is obviously looking weaker than it was 6 months ago, the device business is looking better, so there's some pluses and minuses, is the underlying business on track to deliver 10% next year? And is the right way to think about '17 the underlying 10% plus the accretion? Or should we back off of the underlying expectations?"

But I would say, look, the underlying growth does continue to be strong in our businesses. Fortunately, we are very diverse, many companies, many businesses, many products, many geographies. And we are not that overindexed in China in any particular case. So I can't say that I think the China Pediatric business is going to be great growth next year. But I don't think it's going to impact in a fashion the overall strength of the growth of the company globally. So I'd tell you that I see the underlying growth continuing to be strong. Clearly, that'll have some impact on us. But at this point, I think we're seeing great growth in our Pharmaceutical business. We're in the midst of preparing to launch a number of new systems in Diagnostics. FreeStyle Libre, I'd say, is going gangbusters in Europe. And we're looking forward to having that in the U.S. shortly. There's a lot of new product launch and approval happening. So there's a lot of drivers of growth here. And frankly, I think there's a lot of growth to be seen in St. Jude as well. So I remain kind of in the same position. I know we've got a slower situation in China, but I don't see us as so overindexed in China that, that is somehow going to knock us back in a way that I can forecast for you right now that this is going to have a huge impact on the company next year. I mean, frankly, if it was going to have a huge impact in a fashion, you'd have seen it this quarter, and we did. I mean, we've seen it in our China numbers. But look at how the company performed. We exceeded our expectations yet again. And owing to the strength and the diversity of the company and the strength in pharmaceuticals, the strength in Medical Devices, I can remember a couple of years ago, we were talking about Medical Devices as the weakness, not so much the strength. So I'd say the good news is we've got a lot of parts of the business that are performing well, if not better, in the midst of new product cycles and launches. And frankly, the other parts of Nutrition are doing reasonably well. If you look at the U.S., which I think everybody has become accustomed to sort of ignoring in the numbers, the U.S. is having a better year than planned, better year than in a long time and it's better than solid. So I think there's a lot of things happening to offset China, to some degree. So I'd caution this way. I'd say, look, we always start the year looking for double-digit earnings growth. And yes, we will have the addition of St. Jude on top of that. Then, as you said, Alere remains to be seen. But in any case, I'm not in a position yet where I can say, ""No, I've got different expectations for '17."" I actually think the underlying growth continues to be strong and everything tracking according to expectations on strategic moves otherwise."

I'd have to say, they definitely put patient safety and patient credibility and physician credibility and the product performance and so forth first, and that's right. And I think that they've done all the right things. They've been in great communication with us. And based on everything that we know, I don't see this impacting the close of the deal or the business long term. I've seen a lot of speculation in the press. Every time there's a product issue or a hiccup or whatever it may be, everybody wants to run to the headlines and speculate about the deal. I'll tell you, based on everything I see, this deal is going to close. And determined by the timing of regulatory approvals, it's probably going to close by year-end. And I haven't seen anything to date that would suggest otherwise. Regarding the performance of the company after that, I'll say honestly, what I'm most anxious for is for their MRI-compatible claim to be approved by the FDA in the U.S. And frankly, if you look at the rest of their businesses, they're all growing at a pretty healthy rate and particularly overseas. And I think their success overseas has demonstrated that when we do get their MRI-compatible claim in the U.S., that their recovery of share, recovery of growth rate, et cetera there should be pretty strong. So I haven't changed my expectations about the performance of St. Jude going forward. And I could probably someday give you my opinion about the current circumstances with the cybersecurity claims and so forth, but I'll keep my thoughts to myself right now, and we'll wait until the deal is closed."

The -- I think the Diagnostics business has been one of the consistent, reliable star performers of the company. It's been a good mid- to higher single-digit performing overall. I mean, it does have a fair number of moving parts. The Core Laboratory business, I think, has performed exceptionally well, continues to. I think the Point of Care business has. We're going through the exit of an agreement in our Molecular business that we will lap in a number of months. But in any case, I think all of those businesses are performing commercially well. What I'm more impressed with, with this team than anything is that over the last 4 to 5 years, they have had an unprecedented number of systems, new diagnostic systems, in development in R&D that are all beginning to launch now. And I don't think ever in the history of this industry or this business has any company attempted to develop and launch multiple new systems simultaneously across every category of its business. And our Diagnostics business is, both in immunoassay, in clinical chemistry, in hematology, in blood screening, in point of care, and then to be followed in Molecular Diagnostics. And that's an unprecedented pipeline move that we will see that roll out over years now. I mean, they're beginning to launch in Europe. We've gotten approvals to go. So we're in an unprecedented launch phase that I think sustains the growth of the Diagnostics business across the board for years to come. And no other competitor is in a position to say that. And I think that the value proposition, the performance proposition, the economic proposition of those systems was well thought out, well designed. They were unveiled and shown at the recent AACC meeting in the United States to a great reception. So I have nothing but high and positive expectations. Now having said that, customers roll slowly -- they tend to be long-term contractors. They tend to be 5, 7, sometimes 10 years in contracts and in tenders and so forth. So I don't expect it to be a vertical line in terms of sales. But I think if you think about the gradual rolling of a customer base and taking of share as tenders come due and so forth, I do expect that our Diagnostics business has a long, positive trajectory ahead of it and no one else does. So I'm pretty excited about that. I think they're in a uniquely strong position as we look forward. And we're all pretty happy about that. It's a challenge to launch that many systems, but we're reviewing them all closely, looking at them all closely. And while you all have the natural hiccups at the end of a project that you do that will cost you a week here and a week there, a week, in the grand schemes of things, isn't much. So I'm pretty pleased with how that's going. With regard to Medical Devices, also pleased. And I can start at the top. And let me mention, in Medical Optics, where I think the cadence of new products and the performance of that R&D team has been exceptional, and particularly even recently with the launch of the Symfony intraocular lenses. And while we have made a deal to sell that business to J&J, we sell it in great shape, with great products, great technology. They're gaining share in the cataract and intraocular lens business. I'm really pleased with what the team's been able to do there. And I think that the business will be in a strategically great home at J&J. We think we've got fair value for the business and we're working on the integration transition of that to J&J. But I think they've been innovative. They've had a great cadence of new product development over time. I realize that, that's mostly to the benefit now of J&J shareholders. But the point is across our businesses, we're seeing productivity out of our R&D and new product development like we've never seen before. If I move to Diabetes Care, our FreeStyle Libre launch in Europe has gone well. We have over 200,000 patients now. That's a lot. And that's a really good success rate so far. We had very ambitious plans for this product. And to be honest, we're behind our plans by a month or 2, but it's a fairly vertical ramp, it's a pretty high ramp. And that ramp is occurring at the trajectory we projected but about a month or 2 behind what we projected. And it will probably stay that way. So we're going to have a terrific performance, as you can already see in the numbers for this year. And even that was behind what we had hoped. But it's not because it's not on that trajectory, it just started slower than we had planned, but now it's pretty on track. And we're anxious to launch the consumer version in the United States and enjoy the same sort of success here. And I think it owes to the capability of the product, the unique medical proposition of the product and, frankly, the economic proposition of the product. A lot of payers and a lot of governments will tell you today, ""Don't bring me new technology, bring me something more cost effective that impacts my ability to spread my budget further and treat patients better."" Well, Libre has got that in the equation in a big way. So we're looking forward to the launch of that. Our Medical Device business will certainly be enhanced by the addition of St. Jude. But at the same time, I think there's a lot of good things happening in our Vascular business, MitraClip is going well, Supera is going well. We continue to do well in our stent business in what is otherwise not a growth business. We still remain the world leader in that category. And Absorb has been licensed and launched in the United States. So I think, across in the board, in Diagnostics and devices, without exception, even including AMO, all these businesses have shown in the last few years real progress, tangible progress in R&D, in innovation, in development, in meeting their time lines in a disciplined fashion, bringing new products to market. And we're seeing all that roll out now and over the next couple of years. And, frankly, I think it will be sustained after that. Now having said that, I expect the same out of our St. Jude piece. And I think there's nothing but good there. So we're pretty bullish about it."

Nevertheless, it's an important business. It's a big business. It's a business we pay a lot of attention to. Frankly, China is an important country for us for a lot of our businesses. But it is true that in the grand scheme of Abbott, as China Pediatric goes, the company isn't necessarily going to be driven by just that. So we think all of our businesses, particularly large ones, and that's a large one, are important. But the diversity of the company and the size of the company, obviously, absorb shock when it happens in other parts of the company. So to your question about are we hands-on mitigating and dealing with what we think we can do with the challenges? Yes, we are. The EVP of that business is spending a lot of time in China. We have made some management and leadership changes in China in a proactive way to enhance our management, our experience, our knowledge, our skill, et cetera, there. I think hope always springs eternal when you make changes in your leadership team, et cetera, but that's -- it's getting a lot of focused attention by the senior leadership team on down and in the right ways. The CFO, the Controller, everybody who's got any kind of way to have a stake in this has weighed in. We do as a team look at our spending allocations, our capital allocations, how we're spending, where we're spending, where the bang for the buck is, et cetera. So I think we've looked at just about everything we can, not only to specifically focus on improving the situation and the performance in China, but also how to mitigate it if it doesn't improve enough or fast enough. And so, yes, it's getting a fair amount of attention that way across the company. With regard to Latin America and Southeast Asia, I'm pleased with the progress in both places, and I'm pleased with the performance of the business, frankly, including the performance of the business in Europe and other places, too. But I'm going to be careful not to project what I think can happen in any given country because the year always starts with a certain set of expectations, and then has some surprise you didn't anticipate, which is one of the reasons I always tout the diverse model because somewhere, something is going to go awry or different from your expectations and no matter how tightly you manage everything. In our case, I'm pleased with our management teams in the various geographies you mentioned. I think they're all doing well. We've got a lot of talent in our organization. We've made some changes where we needed to. In this particular case, our challenge in China wasn't talent-based as much as market-driven and a lot of dynamics that change rapidly there that we've had to react to and deal with. So I think there are a number of other countries picking up slack here, the U.S., surprisingly one of them, in the Nutrition business. I think you can see that in the numbers in the earnings report. Vietnam doing well, strong for us, a lot of other smaller countries doing well. Vietnam, as you know, is a big business for us in the Nutrition business. And we've got a terrific manager there and have had for a long time, and that's doing well. So there's some places that are picking up some of the slack there, and, frankly, so are other businesses of Abbott, like the pharmaceutical business and so forth, having a great year in China and other countries and a good, sustained, high-growth performance. So again, yes, it's proactive. We are mitigating. It's why we're not giving any guidance or anything at this point. I do -- as I answered to Mike Weinstein earlier, the underlying fundamentals of the overall growth rates in our market are good. But one place that sticks out right now as a challenge is the Pediatric business in China, which is about 3% of the company's sales."

You've got the old, established legacy franchise of blood glucose monitoring, and then you've got what we call flash glucose monitoring, or Libre. And that older blood glucose monitoring market is clearly under both volume and price pressure. And Libre is growing rapidly in Europe, and we expect to grow rapidly in the United States. So at some point, we would hope that Libre would grow so significantly that it would overtake the other. So I don't expect, obviously, that kind of growth out of the base. But I think we're going to keep experiencing pretty heavy double-digit growth out of Libre for the foreseeable future. So yes, I think it drives a lot of growth. But where it crosses and say the overall business is somehow double digit, I'm not sure I can project."

And you could see that. You could see it in the performance. You could see it in the bottom line of those businesses. You could see it in the bottom line of the company. You could see it in the gross margin of the company. So we expanded those efforts across the company in a number of places. And I think what we've obviously learned from that is there's always opportunity to improve your business model, improve your cost structure, improve your gross margin, et cetera. It's not -- and it hasn't been done with price. It's been done with the fundamental inputs in costs and the way we do business, the way we manufacture, the way we do a lot of things. So I think there's always opportunity. And we approach the business, and the businesses, every year with that in mind. And it's fortunate that we have because we've had some great success there in a couple of businesses particularly, which has offset the effects of exchange over the last, say, 3 or 4 years, which as you know has been pretty heavy. And without that, the company would have obviously been under a lot more profit growth pressure. So for us, it's become a routine. We look for more gross margin improvement opportunity every year. And if I look across the businesses, there are still many opportunities for us as we benchmark competitors or other models, the business models we see out there, to improve the cost structure of our business in ways that are meaningful for the corporation. That -- included in that is even the costs of new things launching. The costs of our new diagnostic analyzers will be a tremendous improvement over the costs of our current diagnostic analyzers. And one of the ways you can affect gross margin over the long term is design it into your products, and we are. So I think there's a lot of initiatives internally at the company and across businesses now that make this a part of routine daily life, to keep improving gross margin. I can't forecast to you right know how that will impact us. But I think in a world where you're denominated in dollars, and every year, exchange tries to erode some of your top and bottom line, it becomes a routine part of your business to always be looking at ways to improve your margin. And we do, and we are and we're having a fair amount of success with that."

Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2016. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2016.  
Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events and developments, except as required by law. Please note that third quarter financial results and guidance provided on the call today for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be used for continuing operations only. 
On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which will be available on our website at abbott.com. Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange, unless otherwise noted.
As you recall, Abbott issued a press release on April 28, 2016, announcing the transaction with St. Jude Medical and a related press release on October 18, 2016. Please refer to those releases for additional important information about Abbott, St. Jude and related matters. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles."

Today, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.59, at the high end of our guidance range. We also raised the midpoint of our 2016 adjusted earnings per share guidance and narrowed the range to $2.19 to $2.21, exceeding the initial guidance we set at the beginning of the year. 
Sales increased 4% in the quarter or more than 5.5%, excluding the impact of Venezuela. Growth was led by strong performance in Established Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices. We achieved our expectations overall, and our pipeline continued to deliver a steady cadence of new product approvals and launches that are contributing to growth. 
At the same time, we continued to actively and strategically shape our portfolio. In September, we took the next logical step in shaping our Medical Device business with the announcement that we will sell our Medical Optics business to J&J. This action is in line with our strategic decision to sharpen our focus on building leadership in cardiovascular devices. 
I'll now briefly review our third quarter results, and I'll start with Diagnostics, where we achieved sales growth of 5.5% in the quarter, driven by continued above-market performance in Core Laboratory and Point of Care Diagnostics. In August, at the American Association for Clinical Chemistry conference, we unveiled our next-generation suite of instruments called Alinity. The Alinity suite includes new instruments for every segment of the diagnostics market in which we compete. Over the next few months, we'll launch new systems for point of care, immunoassay testing, clinical chemistry and blood screening in Europe. Over time, we'll introduce additional systems and launch the full Alinity suite into additional geographies, providing a highly differentiated platform for sustainable, long-term growth. 
In Nutrition, sales declined 1% in the quarter, below our expectations, due to soft performance in China Pediatric Nutrition. As you may recall, I expressed caution on the near-term outlook in China in our last earnings call. Over the last few months, market conditions have remained challenging there, including rapid channel shifts and new safety regulations that are driving an oversupply of product in the market and aggressive levels of discounting. Although conditions are expected to remain challenging in the near term, the long-term fundamentals of the market remain attractive. We have the right portfolio of products for the various channels and the best-in-class global supply network. We've also continued to focus on strengthening our competitiveness in order to deliver growth over the long term. Outside of China, we continued to perform well in Southeast Asia and Latin America and again achieved above-market growth in U.S. Pediatric Nutrition.
In Medical Devices, sales growth in our Vascular business was led by double-digit growth of MitraClip, our market-leading device for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation, and high single-digit growth in endovascular products, driven by vessel closure products and Supera, our unique stent for the treatment of blockages in the leg. During the quarter, we received FDA approval for Absorb, the only fully dissolving vascular stent and an important addition to our drug-eluting stent portfolio.
In Diabetes Care, international sales growth of more than 20% was driven by continued consumer uptake of our revolutionary FreeStyle Libre system in Europe. In September, we received FDA approval for our FreeStyle Libre Pro system in the United States. Libre Pro will help health care professionals make better customized treatment decisions for their patients and at a significantly lower cost than other professional continuous glucose monitoring systems. We also submitted the consumer version of the FreeStyle Libre system for FDA review during the quarter. This system is designed to eliminate the need for routine finger sticks and provides glucose data in a simple format that allows people with diabetes to achieve better health outcomes. 
And in Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, sales grew 9% in the quarter. Double-digit growth in key emerging markets was led by strong growth in India, China and Latin America. EPD continues to execute at a very high level and remains well aligned, with the fundamentals driving long-term growth in emerging markets, a rising middle class, improving access to health care and consumers that are seeking and willing to pay for high-quality brands. 
So in summary, we achieved our financial expectations for the quarter and our diverse business model continues to deliver reliable growth. We've continued to advance our leadership and competitive position through several new product approvals and launches across our businesses. And we continued to take strategic steps to shape our portfolio, building leadership positions for long-term growth. 
I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian?"

That is excluding an unfavorable impact of 1.1% from foreign exchange. Reported sales increased 2.9% in the quarter. 
Regarding other aspects of the P&L. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 57.3% of sales. Adjusted R&D investment was 6.2% of sales. And adjusted SG&A expense was 29.7% of sales, in line with our prior guidance.
Turning to our outlook for the full year 2016. We narrowed our adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $2.19 to $2.21. The midpoint of our guidance range reflects double-digit underlying growth offset by the impact of foreign exchange on our operating results. We continue to forecast operational sales growth in the mid-single digits for the full year 2016.
Based on current exchange rates, we expect exchange to have a negative impact somewhat above 2% on our full year reported sales. This would result in reported sales growth in the low single digits for the full year 2016. We continue to forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 57% of sales for the full year, which includes underlying gross margin improvement initiatives across our businesses. We also continue to forecast adjusted R&D investment of around 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of approaching 31% of sales for the full year.
Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2016. We forecast adjusted earnings per share of $0.64 to $0.66, again reflecting double-digit underlying growth. We forecast operational sales growth of mid-single digits in the fourth quarter. We have now annualized the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar that began late in the second quarter of last year. And at current exchange rates, we expect a favorable impact to sales from exchange of somewhat more than 50 basis points in the fourth quarter.
Turning to other aspects of the P&L for the fourth quarter. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat above 57%, adjusted R&D investments somewhat above 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 28% of sales. And finally, we project specified items of $0.25 in the fourth quarter.
Before we open the call for questions, I will now provide a quick summary of our fourth quarter operational sales growth outlook by business. For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast high single-digit sales growth. In Nutrition, we forecast sales growth similar to the third quarter. In Diagnostics, we forecast mid-single-digit growth. And lastly, in our Medical Devices business, for Vascular, we forecast mid-single-digit sales growth. In Diabetes Care, we forecast double-digit sales growth. And in Medical Optics, we forecast low to mid-single-digit sales growth. 
With that, we will now open the call for your questions."

And that depends on who you are and what channels you're in and so forth, depending on how it affects you. W",589,"Yes, I'll try to. I'd say the market in China has been in a bit of a transition for a number of months, it would appear, maybe even a little more. And that depends on who you are and what channels you're in and so forth, depending on how it affects you. We expected this year to see 7% to 8% growth in China, slightly above the GDP growth, et cetera. And what we're seeing now is flat to low single digits. And I think some of our competitors have reported the same. So we've gotten some triangulation on kind of just underlying market growth rate. But beyond that, a number of dynamics are at work there. There's some pretty rapid channel shifts from traditional channels like modern trade to various e-commerce channels and so forth. And I don't think that's surprised anybody in terms of just overall trends. But the speed and magnitude of it, I think, has hit China differently than what you'd see in the U.S. or other countries. And so that's been a pretty big chunk. In the process of that, what's happened is some inventories have piled up in, let's say, traditional channels while they've been -- while the market's needs have been satisfied by e-commerce channels. And so the market has got to burn through that, I guess, to some degree. So we've seen growth slow. And in our case, there's been a loss of about 0.5 share point, we estimate. We're also seeing a fair amount of market and competitor reaction to the anticipated new food safety laws, which will become effective in a little over a year, in January of '18. Those new laws will limit the number of brands per manufacturing plant, per competitor, et cetera. All products have to be reregistered and so on. And the government's got a number of goals for that. But I think what's at work here is we're seeing a lot of competitors oversupply this market. And under those scenarios, you see a lot of discounting. So we're seeing that. We're seeing the discounting. We're seeing the channel shift. We're seeing slower growth there. I do think it's transitional. I do think it's transient. But I don't think it's going to be a quick adjustment. I'm cautious for 2017 because I think that it's a little hard to predict the reaction of the many competitors and many brands in the market to these new food safety laws. So I think what we're seeing here could be with us for a while. But I think the long-term attractiveness of the market is definitely there because there aren't fewer moms, there aren't fewer babies, et cetera. But we're in kind of an odd transition period that I don't think was anticipated by the government's intent with its new food safety laws or, frankly, even the channel shift. So I know that's kind of a long-winded answer, but there's a lot of things kind of stacked up here happening at the same time. We've watched the results of some of our competitors, and see that it's hit all of us but all of us kind of differently depending on what channels we might be more prominent in. And taking that apart and trying to understand all the dynamics there, I'd say, has been a key focus over the last couple of quarters here. And I think we've got a pretty good handle on what's happening. But I think it's going to be this way for several quarters."

And Miles, I know you're not going to give '17 guidance, but I just want to think about the framework for it. When we had that call to announce the St. Jude acquisition, and then on the call that you and I had back in June, you talked about the goal of the company historically of delivering double-digit underlying EPS growth. Let's just say that's 10%, and that the goal for '17 would be to try and deliver that. And then on top of it, you'd get the accretion from the transactions. Obviously, we don't know yet what's going to happen with Alere, but it looks like St. Jude is on track to close. If we think about the base business piece of that, given that nutritionals is obviously looking weaker than it was 6 months ago, the device business is looking better, so there's some pluses and minuses, is the underlying business on track to deliver 10% next year? And is the right way to think about '17 the underlying 10% plus the accretion? Or should we back off of the underlying expectations?"

But I would say, look, the underlying growth does continue to be strong in our businesses. Fortunately, we are very diverse, many companies, many businesses, many products, many geographies. And we are not that overindexed in China in any particular case. So I can't say that I think the China Pediatric business is going to be great growth next year. But I don't think it's going to impact in a fashion the overall strength of the growth of the company globally. So I'd tell you that I see the underlying growth continuing to be strong. Clearly, that'll have some impact on us. But at this point, I think we're seeing great growth in our Pharmaceutical business. We're in the midst of preparing to launch a number of new systems in Diagnostics. FreeStyle Libre, I'd say, is going gangbusters in Europe. And we're looking forward to having that in the U.S. shortly. There's a lot of new product launch and approval happening. So there's a lot of drivers of growth here. And frankly, I think there's a lot of growth to be seen in St. Jude as well. So I remain kind of in the same position. I know we've got a slower situation in China, but I don't see us as so overindexed in China that, that is somehow going to knock us back in a way that I can forecast for you right now that this is going to have a huge impact on the company next year. I mean, frankly, if it was going to have a huge impact in a fashion, you'd have seen it this quarter, and we did. I mean, we've seen it in our China numbers. But look at how the company performed. We exceeded our expectations yet again. And owing to the strength and the diversity of the company and the strength in pharmaceuticals, the strength in Medical Devices, I can remember a couple of years ago, we were talking about Medical Devices as the weakness, not so much the strength. So I'd say the good news is we've got a lot of parts of the business that are performing well, if not better, in the midst of new product cycles and launches. And frankly, the other parts of Nutrition are doing reasonably well. If you look at the U.S., which I think everybody has become accustomed to sort of ignoring in the numbers, the U.S. is having a better year than planned, better year than in a long time and it's better than solid. So I think there's a lot of things happening to offset China, to some degree. So I'd caution this way. I'd say, look, we always start the year looking for double-digit earnings growth. And yes, we will have the addition of St. Jude on top of that. Then, as you said, Alere remains to be seen. But in any case, I'm not in a position yet where I can say, ""No, I've got different expectations for '17."" I actually think the underlying growth continues to be strong and everything tracking according to expectations on strategic moves otherwise."

And I think that they've done all the right things. They've been in great communication with us. And based on everything that we know, I don't see this impacting the close of the deal or the business long term. I've seen a lot of speculation in the press. Every time there's a product issue or a hiccup or whatever it may be, everybody wants to run to the headlines and speculate about the deal. I'll tell you, based on everything I see, this deal is going to close. And determined by the timing of regulatory approvals, it's probably going to close by year-end. And I haven't seen anything to date that would suggest otherwise. Regarding the performance of the company after that, I'll say honestly, what I'm most anxious for is for their MRI-compatible claim to be approved by the FDA in the U.S. And frankly, if you look at the rest of their businesses, they're all growing at a pretty healthy rate and particularly overseas. And I think their success overseas has demonstrated that when we do get their MRI-compatible claim in the U.S., that their recovery of share, recovery of growth rate, et cetera there should be pretty strong. So I haven't changed my expectations about the performance of St. Jude going forward.

Well, let me start with Diagnostics. The -- I think the Diagnostics business has been one of the consistent, reliable star performers of the company.

The -- I think the Diagnostics business has been one of the consistent, reliable star performers of the company. It's been a good mid- to higher single-digit performing overall. I mean, it does have a fair number of moving parts. The Core Laboratory business, I think, has performed exceptionally well, continues to. I think the Point of Care business has. We're going through the exit of an agreement in our Molecular business that we will lap in a number of months. But in any case, I think all of those businesses are performing commercially well. What I'm more impressed with, with this team than anything is that over the last 4 to 5 years, they have had an unprecedented number of systems, new diagnostic systems, in development in R&D that are all beginning to launch now. And I don't think ever in the history of this industry or this business has any company attempted to develop and launch multiple new systems simultaneously across every category of its business. And our Diagnostics business is, both in immunoassay, in clinical chemistry, in hematology, in blood screening, in point of care, and then to be followed in Molecular Diagnostics. And that's an unprecedented pipeline move that we will see that roll out over years now. I mean, they're beginning to launch in Europe. We've gotten approvals to go. So we're in an unprecedented launch phase that I think sustains the growth of the Diagnostics business across the board for years to come. And no other competitor is in a position to say that. And I think that the value proposition, the performance proposition, the economic proposition of those systems was well thought out, well designed. They were unveiled and shown at the recent AACC meeting in the United States to a great reception. So I have nothing but high and positive expectations. Now having said that, customers roll slowly -- they tend to be long-term contractors. They tend to be 5, 7, sometimes 10 years in contracts and in tenders and so forth. So I don't expect it to be a vertical line in terms of sales. But I think if you think about the gradual rolling of a customer base and taking of share as tenders come due and so forth, I do expect that our Diagnostics business has a long, positive trajectory ahead of it and no one else does. So I'm pretty excited about that. I think they're in a uniquely strong position as we look forward. And we're all pretty happy about that. It's a challenge to launch that many systems, but we're reviewing them all closely, looking at them all closely. And while you all have the natural hiccups at the end of a project that you do that will cost you a week here and a week there, a week, in the grand schemes of things, isn't much. So I'm pretty pleased with how that's going. With regard to Medical Devices, also pleased. And I can start at the top. And let me mention, in Medical Optics, where I think the cadence of new products and the performance of that R&D team has been exceptional, and particularly even recently with the launch of the Symfony intraocular lenses. And while we have made a deal to sell that business to J&J, we sell it in great shape, with great products, great technology. They're gaining share in the cataract and intraocular lens business. I'm really pleased with what the team's been able to do there. And I think that the business will be in a strategically great home at J&J. We think we've got fair value for the business and we're working on the integration transition of that to J&J. But I think they've been innovative. They've had a great cadence of new product development over time. I realize that, that's mostly to the benefit now of J&J shareholders. But the point is across our businesses, we're seeing productivity out of our R&D and new product development like we've never seen before. If I move to Diabetes Care, our FreeStyle Libre launch in Europe has gone well. We have over 200,000 patients now. That's a lot. And that's a really good success rate so far. We had very ambitious plans for this product. And to be honest, we're behind our plans by a month or 2, but it's a fairly vertical ramp, it's a pretty high ramp. And that ramp is occurring at the trajectory we projected but about a month or 2 behind what we projected. And it will probably stay that way. So we're going to have a terrific performance, as you can already see in the numbers for this year. And even that was behind what we had hoped. But it's not because it's not on that trajectory, it just started slower than we had planned, but now it's pretty on track. And we're anxious to launch the consumer version in the United States and enjoy the same sort of success here. And I think it owes to the capability of the product, the unique medical proposition of the product and, frankly, the economic proposition of the product. A lot of payers and a lot of governments will tell you today, ""Don't bring me new technology, bring me something more cost effective that impacts my ability to spread my budget further and treat patients better."" Well, Libre has got that in the equation in a big way. So we're looking forward to the launch of that. Our Medical Device business will certainly be enhanced by the addition of St. Jude. But at the same time, I think there's a lot of good things happening in our Vascular business, MitraClip is going well, Supera is going well. We continue to do well in our stent business in what is otherwise not a growth business. We still remain the world leader in that category. And Absorb has been licensed and launched in the United States. So I think, across in the board, in Diagnostics and devices, without exception, even including AMO, all these businesses have shown in the last few years real progress, tangible progress in R&D, in innovation, in development, in meeting their time lines in a disciplined fashion, bringing new products to market. And we're seeing all that roll out now and over the next couple of years. And, frankly, I think it will be sustained after that. Now having said that, I expect the same out of our St. Jude piece. And I think there's nothing but good there. So we're pretty bullish about it."

Nevertheless, it's an important business. It's a big business. It's a business we pay a lot of attention to. Frankly, China is an important country for us for a lot of our businesses. But it is true that in the grand scheme of Abbott, as China Pediatric goes, the company isn't necessarily going to be driven by just that. So we think all of our businesses, particularly large ones, and that's a large one, are important. But the diversity of the company and the size of the company, obviously, absorb shock when it happens in other parts of the company. So to your question about are we hands-on mitigating and dealing with what we think we can do with the challenges? Yes, we are. The EVP of that business is spending a lot of time in China. We have made some management and leadership changes in China in a proactive way to enhance our management, our experience, our knowledge, our skill, et cetera, there. I think hope always springs eternal when you make changes in your leadership team, et cetera, but that's -- it's getting a lot of focused attention by the senior leadership team on down and in the right ways. The CFO, the Controller, everybody who's got any kind of way to have a stake in this has weighed in. We do as a team look at our spending allocations, our capital allocations, how we're spending, where we're spending, where the bang for the buck is, et cetera. So I think we've looked at just about everything we can, not only to specifically focus on improving the situation and the performance in China, but also how to mitigate it if it doesn't improve enough or fast enough. And so, yes, it's getting a fair amount of attention that way across the company. With regard to Latin America and Southeast Asia, I'm pleased with the progress in both places, and I'm pleased with the performance of the business, frankly, including the performance of the business in Europe and other places, too. But I'm going to be careful not to project what I think can happen in any given country because the year always starts with a certain set of expectations, and then has some surprise you didn't anticipate, which is one of the reasons I always tout the diverse model because somewhere, something is going to go awry or different from your expectations and no matter how tightly you manage everything. In our case, I'm pleased with our management teams in the various geographies you mentioned. I think they're all doing well. We've got a lot of talent in our organization. We've made some changes where we needed to. In this particular case, our challenge in China wasn't talent-based as much as market-driven and a lot of dynamics that change rapidly there that we've had to react to and deal with. So I think there are a number of other countries picking up slack here, the U.S., surprisingly one of them, in the Nutrition business. I think you can see that in the numbers in the earnings report. Vietnam doing well, strong for us, a lot of other smaller countries doing well. Vietnam, as you know, is a big business for us in the Nutrition business. And we've got a terrific manager there and have had for a long time, and that's doing well. So there's some places that are picking up some of the slack there, and, frankly, so are other businesses of Abbott, like the pharmaceutical business and so forth, having a great year in China and other countries and a good, sustained, high-growth performance. So again, yes, it's proactive. We are mitigating. It's why we're not giving any guidance or anything at this point. I do -- as I answered to Mike Weinstein earlier, the underlying fundamentals of the overall growth rates in our market are good. But one place that sticks out right now as a challenge is the Pediatric business in China, which is about 3% of the company's sales."

And you could see that. You could see it in the performance. You could see it in the bottom line of those businesses. You could see it in the bottom line of the company. You could see it in the gross margin of the company. So we expanded those efforts across the company in a number of places. And I think what we've obviously learned from that is there's always opportunity to improve your business model, improve your cost structure, improve your gross margin, et cetera. It's not -- and it hasn't been done with price. It's been done with the fundamental inputs in costs and the way we do business, the way we manufacture, the way we do a lot of things. So I think there's always opportunity. And we approach the business, and the businesses, every year with that in mind. And it's fortunate that we have because we've had some great success there in a couple of businesses particularly, which has offset the effects of exchange over the last, say, 3 or 4 years, which as you know has been pretty heavy. And without that, the company would have obviously been under a lot more profit growth pressure. So for us, it's become a routine. We look for more gross margin improvement opportunity every year. And if I look across the businesses, there are still many opportunities for us as we benchmark competitors or other models, the business models we see out there, to improve the cost structure of our business in ways that are meaningful for the corporation. That -- included in that is even the costs of new things launching. The costs of our new diagnostic analyzers will be a tremendous improvement over the costs of our current diagnostic analyzers. And one of the ways you can affect gross margin over the long term is design it into your products, and we are. So I think there's a lot of initiatives internally at the company and across businesses now that make this a part of routine daily life, to keep improving gross margin. I can't forecast to you right know how that will impact us. But I think in a world where you're denominated in dollars, and every year, exchange tries to erode some of your top and bottom line, it becomes a routine part of your business to always be looking at ways to improve your margin.
