It was a strong finish to 2015 as revenue increased 18% or EPS increased 20%, and adjusted EBITDA net increased 18% compared to the fourth quarter 2014, impressive growth considering the FX headwinds we faced all year long. For the fourth quar",1701,"Thanks, Ed. It was a strong finish to 2015 as revenue increased 18% or EPS increased 20%, and adjusted EBITDA net increased 18% compared to the fourth quarter 2014, impressive growth considering the FX headwinds we faced all year long. For the fourth quarter, the strong U.S. dollar reduced our reported revenue by about $67 million or 4% hit to the growth rate and core EPS by $0.12 or 3% hit to the growth rate. Organic revenue growth remains strong in the fourth quarter, up 14% on a constant currency basis. That compares to 15% constant currency growth for the full year, reflecting balanced growth throughout 2015. From a capital allocation standpoint, we spent $952 million during 2015, acquiring 3.4 million shares under our repurchase program at an average cost of about $280 per share. We have now reacquired about 80% of the number of shares issued to acquire Conversant at the end of 2014. Looking into 2016, we expect our capital allocation to shift to M&A first probably in the $400 million to $500 million range and then share repurchases up to the $500 million board authorization. Essentially, we'll look to deploy our free cash flow while maintaining or lowering our leverage ratio of about 2.7x. 
Let's flip over to Page 3 and talk about LoyaltyOne. On a constant currency basis, revenue increased 6% to $421 million while adjusted EBITDA decreased 13% to $99 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. A shift in sponsor mix, which lowered the average price per mile issued coupled with increased support of sponsor promotional programs pressured AIR MILES financials results for the quarter. The strength in the U.S. dollar was a year-long headwind and will -- again be in 2015. AIR MILES reward miles issued decreased 8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. this was expected to several sponsor promotions happened earlier in '15 than in 2014. For the year, AIR MILES issued increased 4%, up from 1% growth in 2014. The improvements in annual growth is due to the on-boarding of national brochure, continued promotional activity and growth in the insta reward program. For 2016, we expect issuance growth in the 3% to 5% range with promotions similar to 2015. AIR MILES reward miles redeemed decreased 2% compared to the fourth quarter largely a result of the decrease in AIR MILES reward miles issued. The insta reward option AM Cash continues to grow an accounting for 21% of miles issued and 29% of miles redeemed for the fourth quarter of 2015. This option is growing in popularity at the instant gratification resonates with the -- base especially in a tough economy. 
Turning to BrandLoyalty, revenue increased 18%, and adjusted EBITDA increased 2% on constant currency basis for the fourth quarter of 2015. Growth in adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was dampened by expenses associated with our North American expansion efforts and incremental bonus expense tied to the overall strong annual performance. Overall, it was a tremendous year for BrandLoyalty as constant currency revenue increased 31% and adjusted EBITDA 15% from 2014. Importantly, we made substantial strides in our North American expansion effort ending 2015 with this -- backlog in excess of $45 million in Canada and the pilot set to launch in the U.S. during the first quarter of 2016. Looking ahead to 2016, AIR MILES faces a weakening Canadian economy particularly in Western Canada, which could create a headwind issuance growth and further drop the shifting sponsor mix negatively impacting our profitability. 
Let's turn to page and talk about Epsilon Conversant. Epsilon's revenue increased 38% to $608 million, and adjusted EBITDA increased 54% to $157 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, both helped by the acquisition of Conversant in December 2014. Organic growth was strong as revenue increased 7% and adjusted EBITDA increased 5% for the fourth quarter of 2015. Notably, as shown in the slide, organic top line growth accelerated as the year progressed. Also, adjusted EBITDA margins increased by 270 basis points driven by strong performance Conversant where margins increased to approximately 37% for the fourth quarter 2015. For Epsilon, our main priority for 2015 was to control increases in human capital costs allowing revenue growth to flow through to adjusted EBITDA. We were successful as organic revenue and adjusted EBITDA both increased 5% compared to full year 2014. Strength in the auto vertical coupled with double-digit growth within Epsilon's digital experience offerings contributed to the positive revenue momentum. Our new facility in India became operational during the fourth quarter. We ended 2015 with about 300 associates in India and hope to increase the headcount of about 1,000 by 2016 year-end. We believe the higher percentage of headcount growth in India versus U.S. will allow solid flow-through of revenue growth to the bottom line again in 2016. Of note, Epsilon was named by recent Forrester report as a market leader within the loyalty space, highlighting the business's ability to further in the greatest loyalty capabilities will multichannel marketing solution in order to provide more useful consumer insights. 
Turning to Conversant. As shown on Page -- Slide 5, this was -- 2 halves. The first half was about much-needed change within existing business model and the second half was return-to-growth story led by the cross-sell efforts and on-boarding of the backlog. The quarterly progression of the turn wrapped the year with strong growth in the fourth quarter as revenue grew 6% and adjusted EBITDA grew an impressive 14% compared to pro forma Q4 2014. A methodical -- of lower margin product offerings in the year and refocusing more profitable, data-driven cross by offerings resulted in margins growing close to 300 basis points versus pro forma Q4 2014. Success with the cross-selling effort continues to ramp up as Conversant's rich offering is introduced the Epsilon client base beginning with the retail industry is our primary focus in 2015 but now expanding into key verticals such as automotive, CPG and media. As a result, the backlog has nearly doubled since midway through 2015 increasing to over $90 million in annual contract value with new logos such as Toys ""R"" Us, Cornerstone brands, Staples and a leading telecom provider. Now that the holiday season is over, a time where many clients' budgets tend to be frozen -- already queued up and underway for the first quarter of 2016 seeding the next wave of cross-sell activity. Finally, Conversant's offerings continue to the market recognition with the recent Gartner Magic Quadrant report highlighting the small -- niche player to a challenger in its digital marketing hub report, specifically emphasizing Conversant's high ratio, media targeting and rich an unique ability to personalize 1-to-1 interactions with every consumer across device, media and channel. 
Let's go to the next age and talk about the nice growth we saw in Conversant. If you look during the second quarter and gave guidance that we see turn in the back half of the year. Fortunately, we saw it in Q3 and we actually exceeded Q3 and Q4 expectations. So the turn that we talked about early in the year has definitely manifested and we expect to see that continue into 2016. For Card Services, it was the 16th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth and a strong finish to the year. For the fourth quarter 2015, revenue increased 20%, while adjusted EBITDA net increased a healthy 16%. A nice flow through of revenue growth given the substantial provision built both the quarter and full year as result a strong parts receivables growth and the need to get ahead of the uptick in loss rates. Notably, we achieved substantial expense leveraging for the fourth quarter and full year mitigating the decline in our gross yields from a higher percentage of co-brand receivables. These outstanding results can be attributed to our proven ability to drive credit sells, which increased 22% for the fourth quarter even without the on-boarding of sales, which slipped to January of 2016. If you remember, we on-boarded about $600 million of acquired portfolios during the fourth quarter of 2014 creating a difficult comparable, which is why the growth rate dropped a little bit compared to earlier in the year. As we've mentioned before, our Credit sales growth rate of 3x that of overall brand sales and that's usually what we try to attract to. Core credit sales from brands with us before 2012 were up 11% driving industry north of 200 basis points for the quarter, a strong endorsement of our collaborative tailored approach loyalty. Our card members continue to shop more often than, up nearly 6% the last year and spend more per trip of about 5% the last year, confirming that our brand's best customers were in the stores, online and engage digitally. From a digital perspective, about 10% of our credit applications came through web-enabled mobile channels, and about 40% of our credit sales were online for the fourth quarter of 2015. Retailers online sales trended up this holiday, but our strong results substantially outpaced that performance. In addition, we continue to roll out our my loyalty app with several brands during the quarter. This is our proprietary retailer branded mobile app built to serve the needs of card members value most. Our continued and very purposeful investment in mobile and digital engagement provide great momentum to position us for further strong growth as customer engagement continues to evolve. Average card receivables increased an impressive 25% for the fourth quarter. From a credit quality perspective, principal loss rates were 4.7% for the fourth quarter and 4.5% for the year, both consistent with our original guidance. The 30 basis points increase for '15 is due to normal seasoning of new programs as well as slightly lower recovery rates. Delinquency rate trends have been consistent and stable throughout 2015, trending up slightly from 2014. 
Looking to 2016, momentum remains strong. We signed another $2 billion vintage in 2015 and believe we can do the same in 2015. Our unique and demonstrated strategy of bringing a collaborative targeted approach loyalty provides Card Services with a very vigorous pipeline of potential new brands sustain these growth rates. With that, I will turn it over to Ed."

Thank you, Charles. If everyone can turn to the Slide 2015 wrapup. this Is where it gives me a chance to talk about the year, what went well, what could have done better and how the overall model continues to evolve as we continue down the path",4658,"All right. Thank you, Charles. If everyone can turn to the Slide 2015 wrapup. this Is where it gives me a chance to talk about the year, what went well, what could have done better and how the overall model continues to evolve as we continue down the path into '16, '17 and '18. And again, the best way to start this off and to look at it is that Alliance's model continues to move towards if you think of it a series of platforms, whether it's for a coalition of Private Label card or one-off loyalty program but a series of platforms depending upon what the customer wants that are used really as a capturing device. The ability to capture the clients, customer and what he or she is purchasing down to the SKU level both online and off-line. So it's really a platform to capture these very important unique information, which is then all funneled down to the same type of analytics to gain insight into what purchase behavior within the past few years is saying about these consumer and how we can read into that and rich that consumer on a personalized bases. We believe the model will continue to move from a mass marketing approach to a segmented approach, where it really is to where we are heading, which I think is the 1-to-1 personalized approach, which is beginning to manifest itself today and will over the next 18 to 24 months. So taking that information, gaining the insight, figuring out what makes them tick and then reaching them with the relevant message or communication from our clients, again personalized with their tastes and habits and reaching them through the right channel because it's as important to have the right message but it's important to actually reach the folks to the right channel, whether it is from personalized message to direct mail or permission-based e-mail, mobile, social targeted display, you warp it all together and a big services wrapper and that's really where we are in the model. So oftentimes I am asked where are we in 5 years. In 5 years, you're basically looking at 1 massive platform. But today, what we're looking at is series of platforms in what we want to do is sort of probe and tweak and the peak and choose the platforms that are growing in those that may be less relevant. 
So with that being said, let me dive into the first couple of platforms, 1 would be our coalition program, which is where we have 1 platform where a number of clients come together, pool their marketing dollars and score the AIR MILES reward program in Canada. The reason I gave that introduction is because the critical metric there is the number of points, the number of miles, whatever you want to call it, the number of units that get issued, they are issued based upon the consumer spend. And that's our key metric. That's how we get paid. And last year -- I’m sorry, in 2014, that metric had fallen to a troubling sort of flattish to 1% up, and that is not something that we think is an appropriate run rate for that business, so we put our shareholder into 2015 right as the Canadian economy hit a massive headwind. And so the net result was the team managed to play through the macro environment and actually grew the key metric 4%. And our goal is to grow it somewhere 4%, 5% a year. If we can do that, eventually you'll have the revenue and earnings to follow. It is a deferred model so that just because you're earning this year, it takes a couple of years for it to actually flow through. I've never quite understood the accounting, but that's why we have Charles. So the 4-ish type percent is I think something that was outstanding given the macro environment it and that was our goal. Our goal was to get this thing back in a growth mode and demonstrate that as there's a long runway left in this program. On the negative side, we have -- it didn't yet translate into the type of growth that we really want longer term from a revenue and EBITDA perspective. Again, there's sort of a lag there that takes place. We would expect in 2016 to see slightly better numbers on both top and bottom as we look for positive growth to return on the EBITDA side as well. The key driver of that is, as Charles talked about, was the mix due to sort of the macro factors that were out there. A lot of the growth that we had came through a ton of promotional programs that our big grocers in Canada were pushing and a little less through be somewhat more, I guess, beneficial spend on our big cards that are up there through Bank of Montreal and American Express. Nonetheless, our key metric is back where we want it, and we need to make sure even in a very, very difficult Canadian economy quality -- the recession, I mean to say, we want to see that thing grow earlier this year and that will ensure the long-term growth. 
Turning to a little bit of a different story is our other platform, which is the BrandLoyalty platform, which focuses on much shorter term, largely promotional-type programs at grocers that essentially will hit the consumer hard over a 20-week period to really entice them to spend a little bit more visit, a little bit more often. And what do we do is, again, we're taking all of that information and the data from what they're buying and shopping for in the grocers and moving towards a personalized approach of getting them excited about coming into that grocer 1 extra time or spend a little bit more there to achieve that targeted reward. Needless to say, similar to 2014, BrandLoyalty had a very strong year with revenues of over 30% and EBITDA despite spending a whole bunch of money, getting North American cranked up, was up midteens. So we think the BrandLoyalty approach has a long runway, and we expect another very solid year in '16 as well. The North American approach is kind of interesting in the sense of the -- this is a primarily group European platform and now it's moving to the Americas for the first time. And specifically, what was kind of exciting for me, anyhow, was the fact that we could use the relationships that we've developed in Canada over the past 20 years with the AIR MILES program to introduce them to a different type of targeted marketing approach to the BrandLoyalty program. And sure enough, it went extremely well, and we are lined up, I mean, we'll probably do as much as $40 million or so in revs just from Canada next year. So as you think about the pilot that's also kicking off in the U.S. in '16, in the size of the U.S., if Canada is of any indication, this could be a good business to be in going forward. 
Then finally, we have our coalition program, again, down in Brazil cold Dotz. And it continues to grow. I mean, the membership is up 20% to just under 18 million. We successfully launched in Rio, which was our big goal for the year. And it's growing; it's moving along nicely, and that is in spite of a really challenging environment down there. So we're trying to kind of sit back and hopefully just watch this thing could you to move up at a double-digit pace and it as things stabilize down there the next couple of years, hopefully, we'll really start to see the flow through. But so far, so good there. I think overall, the businesses, the platforms in LoyaltyOne has a very strong year. 
Turning now to Epsilon. Again, I remind folks of what was the goal of Epsilon for the year. The biggest 1 at the sort of the core business itself was to find a way to have a sustainable model that flow the top line growth down to earnings or EBITDA cash flow. And that was a challenge for us over the past several years as we continue to see nice growth on the top line. But the cause of the hot skill set everything else regarding our labor force in the heavy services aspect of the business, it got to be a challenge to actually flow that through to the bottom line. So for the first time, I think we feel comfortable that we have a sustainable model long term that will allow sort of the core Epsilon offerings. And again, these platforms are primarily, these massive database and loyalty platforms that you see out there, the Citibank and -- and the Walgreens and stuff that will allow us to show organic growth rate that about 2x or so GDP or roughly 5-ish, 6-ish percent. But actually have that flow down to earnings as well. And part of that solution was opening up our new office in India, and our new associates over there will be joined with an ever-growing group within North America as well. And we should have, I think, a nice balance on the growth side. So that was our #1 sort of goal. The next 1 was at is sort of trail off that people have noticed over the past couple of years in terms of revenue growth at Epsilon tended to start out strong and then sort of trailed off at the end of the year. We think also that this year was we had a very good momentum built as the year progressed. So Q2 was up 4%. That then moved to 5% in Q3 and we exited the year at 7%, all of which, I think, is it bodes well for 2016. We talked a little bit about our new associates that are joining us over in India. And then on the Conversant side, on the negative for sure, I think on a full year basis, we were too optimistic that we could manage to transform the existing business and get the book of business with the cross-sell side and get it up all and running. We certainly got overseas on that 1. However, after it really tough first half of the year, we started to see the results of this effort. And I couldn't really be more pleased with how the year has turned out in terms of Q4 and how we're stepping off into 2016. As I've said before, I've likened it into changing a tire on a moving car. It's hard to do, and the teams did a wonderful job at finally getting it done. We took the pain early to make it right in the second half and for '16. And as Charles showed you, the revenue went from minus 6 in Q1 to minus 9 in Q2. It bounced all the way back to flat in Q3, and we stepped up a year at plus 6. On the EBITDA side, again, it was a minus 6 in Q1, that bounced back a little bit faster, we got to flat in Q2 and plus 9 in Q3 and exiting the year at plus 14. So in terms of a turner the hockey stick that we've all seen out there, this 1 actually played out, which was kind of nice. And as importantly, as Charles also mentioned, the book of business, and what does that mean? What it means is that we when we sign a deal with Conversant, where we're going to be -- we're going to a let's say a retailer and they're going to start supplying us with all their SKU level information and we're going to be using that as a you to continue to develop models to go out and rich their consumers or others across the various digital channels, it's important that if we look at it and we basically say, okay, where we come, where we are going, what's the next step. And the critical thing here was I think it was a very good marriage of the 2. Epsilon was a little bit light on having the scale needed in the digital side. I think, Conversant, on its own, would have had some challenges trying to compete with some of the larger players out there. You put it together and it seemed to actually have worked very well. And as a result, the book of business that we're looking at here, the vintage, when you signed these clients is not unlike what happens in our card business, where it takes 2 or 3 years to fully realize the full run rate of these relationships. And as a result, we signed up book of up to $90 million of potential top line that would be additive to Conversant as these clients roll off in the next couple of years. We manage to see a lot of that start to come through in Q4. And what was very gratifying was the majority of these came through a collaboration between Conversant and big Epsilon enterprise clients, where we were allowed, able to get the Conversant folks into the Epsilon clients and between the 2 of them, created these sales. I think we're very early in the game in terms of what we're looking to do. We believe across Epsilon, AIR MILES, BrandLoyalty and Card Services, there are about 500 enterprise clients where we have a very good in with the CMOs, and that's what we're going to be spending a lot of our time. And of those 500, we probably hit like 25 or 30 at this point, so a long way to go. Anyhow, feel good about Conversant. 
And finally, Card Services, which continued to just have just a tremendous year. I kind of keep saying that. It seems like I keep saying it every year. But it continues to happen not only because of the offerings we're putting out there but also because it began the macro shift or the secular shift that's going on and how folks are spending. Again, think of this as another platform that also offers liquidity tool, and what we did here is we continue to have a huge amount of demand from retailers, both traditional bricks-and-mortars as well as online, who are very interested once again in understanding moodier consumer is and reaching out to them on a personalized basis. And to do that, we are the folks they trust to hold the SKU level information both online, offline, purchase level SKU. And again, are you going to come to us to spend your digital dollars on search? Probably not. Or social? Probably not. But based on SKU level, you bet you, that's who we are and that's sort of the uniqueness of the model that we have here. So Credit sales, that is actually using -- consumers using our card and spending on the Cards. It was up over 30%, driving the portfolio of receivables up 30%, translating into revenue up 24% and finally, through the cash flow about in the midteens. Obviously, a tremendous year. One of the things that continues to be very important in this business is tender share. We can have also great signings with new clients and everything else, but if you can grow the quarter, the folks who have been with you for many years, where you thought that we've kind of plateaued how much of each dollar spent at the retailer will go through our card. And we used to think it was somewhere in the high 20s, maybe 30%. Now we think that ceiling has been raised quite a bit. Our ability to reach out and personalized messaging to the various consumer groups out there has allowed us to continue to grow our share of spend at these retailers. And when you can grow 150 basis points at these core retailers, you're essentially, along with the growth going to get your first 10% of growth in the portfolio, which used to be for us, with everything could get us. And then you throw in the new vintages that have been signed that are the new clients over the past several years, they take 3 years to ramp up. And that will get you the next 10% of growth. And so that's why the 20% type growth rates year, which if you ask me a few years ago, I would have said I don't think that's a good long-term growth rate, probably more like 8% or 9%. But I've been proven wrong, fortunately, for a number of years here. We signed another $2 billion vintage of new clients from Toyota Lexus to Cornerstone to Wayfair to Farmers Insurance, Red Roof and Univision. Again, good names, and we have those folks up and running. And then finally, from the Credit quality perspective, our seeing is the typical season than you would see as you bring on a large amount of new business. It was also of note that the original guidance that Charles Steve of mid-4% for the year, which was made well before we even started the year, we came in right on the bottom on that 1. So you will continue to see these vintages normalize, and we are not seeing any evidence whatsoever, any type of distress on the part of the consumer. 
To wrap up '15, revenue, EBITDA, EPS all up 20%. We know a tough microenvironment organic, which is the thing that I really focusing on. We try to do 3x GDP as our long-term model. If we could do 8%, 9% a year, that would be great. This past year, we did 11% or actually on a constant currency basis, 15%, which was really gratifying to see. The dollar, which I think everyone under the sun is probably getting sick of hearing about, just put in perspective, we grew the 20% or 11% organic despite being hit with about $0.25 billion of FX top line headwind and about $0.50, so about 4% growth. 
All that being said, let's now move into '16. We say goodbye to '15, and here we go. 2016 outlook, high single-digit growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA on a constant currency basis, that incorporates both BrandLoyalty and it incorporates our Canadian business. And if you were to break it down on a constant currency basis, you would look for BrandLoyalty, obviously, to be the 1 that shows the higher growth rate. We would expect another year of a double-double top and EBITDA type growth rate for BL then obviously something less than that for the Canadian business, but we do want to see the Canadian business turn the corner and continue to start its growth mode. The big initiatives will be with BrandLoyalty. The North American expansion we think were very well placed in Canada. We want to see how the pilots go in the U.S. and we want to really make some headway in the U.S. and start that process going. That's a huge area of growth for us. Again, despite really a challenging macroenvironment in Canada, we do want to continue to see that mid-single-digit issuance growth because that is what drives the success long term in the program. And in Brazil, as we talked about, we want to see a double-digit growth in both membership and constant currency revenue. It continuous not to part of our numbers that you will see in our financials. We own 37%, but we continue to see it moving along. At Epsilon, if you were to sort of mix, again, Conversant and Epsilon, together you would see mid- to high single-digit growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA, I would say, Epsilon should look a lot like this past year with sort of mid-single-digit top and bottom. Conversant will be different, where we expect to start seeing the high single-digits growth rate that we have been expecting long term. So everything looks pretty good there. We want to drive a minimum of another $70 million in cross-sell revenue at Conversant and again, as we penetrate into Epsilon squared client base as well as into our core group and elsewhere. 
All right. Turning to Card Services. Well, we expect another big year, up to 25% growth in the portfolio. We don't expect to slow down. We see things looking quite bright for the business for another year, another year of double-digit revenue and EBITDA growth rate and other funding. We look again to sign another $2 billion vintage. And again, what that means is we sign a bunch of new clients. And over the course of 3 years, they are portfolios, their combining portfolios would aggregate up to about $2 billion in new portfolio growth. So they're big numbers. But if I went back and I looked at the good old days of $300 million or $400 million used to be a big year. And then 2012, we signed our first $1 billion vintage, and then it was $2 billion '13, $2 billion in '14, $2 billion in '15 and we expect $2 billion in '16. So I certainly like to outlook for this business. 
All right getting questions about Credit quality, the health of the consumer, obviously, with some of the noise out there in the marketplace. What can we say? We stay very close to all of these. We have roughly $40 million active households that are in our programs, and we are seeing, again, no distress on the part of the consumer. So it looks like that's in pretty good shape. If you look at the actual loss rates that were going to print, what you are looking at is you thought it go from roughly 4% to 4.5%. It will be about 5% in '16 and then in '17, we expect it to start to level off to about 5.5%, which we believe is the new normal. And so again, I think, we are going to be right on target in terms of the sort of 5% or for '15. Question being asked is why? Why is this drifting upwards? It's primarily -- it's kind a interesting. It's primarily due to the fact than the when you have the great recession in '08, '09, you had massive amounts of charge-offs. And it took until 2014 to really clean up the backlog in terms of recoveries. And in our business, which is different from general purpose Cards, recoveries are a huge part of what constitutes our loss rates. And in the postrecession time period, as people are getting back on their feet, we were actually recovering almost $0.35 on the dollar. And that from a net loss perspective is what kept the losses abnormally low. We sort of kept it had point at this stage and it's beginning to a normalize, so 35% to more in the 20s, probably low 20s is where we'll net out. And if you move from last year to this year, you will have seen the recoveries are coming down about 5 points. And as a result, that turns into about 50 basis points last recovered on the losses. So it's not really the actual loss rate from a gross perspective going up to 50 basis points. It means the net loss rate that is lower recoveries that have normalized that is really driving the net loss rate up about 50 basis points. So we don't see anything alarming there. It's normalization process that happens in the Private Label business and high-growth mode. The remainder tale of any type of trail award will be the continued seasoning of the big vintages. The net story here is that we believe our long-term normalized loss rate before the great recession was about 6.5%. Today, we're very comfortable that you're going to level out around 5.5% probably sometime in '17 going into '18. The reason why it's a little bit lower is the fact that over the past half a dozen years or so, we attracted a bit higher, from a Credit perspective, quality-type consumer. When you bring in the Barney's and -- and bought tons of the road and then you have co-brand expense carry all the lower loss rate, so we think the 5.5% is about right. We're solely marching towards that level, and we feel comfortable with our '16 guidance. I do want to address how it will play out sequentially. I think that's important because you have a seasonality in our business, which again is different from traditional cars that are out there. Q1 will tend to be our highest quarter if you looked at last year 2015, you would jump of from Q4 '14 to Q1 of '15 and your losses jump up about 70 basis points on a seasonal basis. We expect that exact same type behavior to take place in 2016. So you're going from sort of your high 4s at the end of or mid-4 at the end of '16 to sort of somewhere in your low 5s as a starting point. And then from a seasonality perspective, the stars to actually drift down of the year progressed and then flattens out in the back half. So that's how the seasonality works, and so no 1 surprise. And as we talked about, we expect full normalization of around 5.5% as we move into '17. 
From a guidance perspective, to wrap up, we are maintaining our guidance for the full year. We're not going to change that despite, I think, people South of that has gotten got that a little bit more negative on the macro. We think we're in pretty good shape here. So constant currency basis, look at about 7 2 [ph] on top and $17 on the core EPS. That's 100% organic growth rate. We're using FX rates of 78 and 111 for the year. As it relates to Q1, we're looking at about 8% constant currency growth rate and about 5% from an actual print perspective. So that includes the FX headwinds of about $0.10. I think it will be probably a little less than that right now. We use FX rate of about $1.60 for the euro and Canadian, respectively, and right now euro is more like $1.09 and the Canadian dollar, $0.71. So I think that gap is closed somewhat. But look for of those types of numbers in Q1 before we get asked the question. The big difference between this year and last year is the fact that last year Q1 is when BrandLoyalty, their programs all hit in the first quarter and their earnings were up over 100% in Q1. And then we're down 50% in Q2, and that cost quite a bit of questioning in terms of how do you actually flow this thing out. It's tough on a quarterly basis, but the we're looking at here is rather than up 100% in Q1 and down 15% in Q2. You're going to see Marlett flat performance in BrandLoyalty in Q1. The big programs seem to be hitting in Q2. They've been signed up. We expect over 100% growth in Q2 this year. So like Q2, you should see that midteens growth return to earnings. So that's pretty much it. You've got some towards the bouncing ball in terms of the quarterly stuff on an annualized basis, it looks pretty good. From a quality perspective, it looks pretty good. And I know the sentiment our there is fairly negative on the macro side. But what we're seeing the that businesses where it would suggest another double-digit organic growth here for us. So that's it. I'm going to actually let Charles now talk, and we'll wrap it up and take questions. Questions? Operator?"

So I guess first of all, do we have that rate? And then that's pro forma for Conversant. And again I think you mentioned first quarter guide of 8% was really stepped down because of the timing year-over-year versus of where the BrandLoyalty results come in, right, first quarter versus second.

And again, the more and more personalized we make the outreach to the consumer, the more effective it is. The more sales that are created, the better the retention of the consumer is.

And as a result, we backed off in that area because we don't really need it. What you will find this most of our co-brand stuff is an added products to an existing Private Label client. So to answer your question, the co-brand space is not an area where we think that the pricing makes sense.

Impressive growth considering the FX headwinds we faced all year long. For the fourth",1733,"Thanks, Ed. It was a strong finish to 2015, as revenue increased 18%, core EPS increased 20% and adjusted EBITDA net increased 18% compared to the fourth quarter 2014. Impressive growth considering the FX headwinds we faced all year long. 
For the fourth quarter, the strong U.S. dollar reduced our reported revenue by about $67 million or 4% hit to the growth rate, and core EPS by $0.12 or a 3% hit to the growth rate. 
Organic revenue growth remained strong in the fourth quarter, 14% on a constant currency basis. That compares to 15% constant currency growth for the full year, reflecting balanced growth throughout 2015. 
From a capital allocation standpoint, we spent $952 million during 2015, acquiring 3.4 million shares under our repurchase program at an average cost of about $280 per share. We have now reacquired about 80% of the number of shares issued to acquire Conversant at the end of 2014. 
Looking into 2016, we expect our capital allocation to shift to M&A first probably in the $400 million to $500 million range and then to share repurchases up to the $500 million board authorization. Essentially, we'll look to deploy our free cash flow while maintaining or lowering our leverage ratio of about 2.7x. 
Let's flip over to Page 3 and talk about LoyaltyOne. On a constant currency basis, revenue increased 6% to $421 million, while adjusted EBITDA decreased 13% to $99 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. A shift in sponsor mix, which lowered the average price per mile issued, coupled with increased support of our sponsor promotional programs pressured AIR MILES' financials results for the quarter. The strength in U.S. dollar was a year-long headwind and will likely again be in 2015. 
AIR MILES reward miles issued decreased 8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. This was expected as several sponsor promotions happened earlier in '15 than in 2014. For the year, AIR MILES issued increased 4%, up from 1% growth in 2014. The improvements in annual growth is due to the onboarding of national brochure, continued promotional activity and growth in the instant reward program. For 2016, we expect issuance growth in the 3% to 5% range with promotions timed similar to 2015. AIR MILES reward miles redeemed decreased 2% compared to the fourth quarter, largely a result of the decrease in AIR MILES reward miles issued. The instant reward option, AM Cash, continues to grow, accounting for 21% of miles issued and 29% of miles redeemed for the fourth quarter of 2015. This option is growing in popularity as the instant gratification resonates with our collector base especially in a tough economy. 
Turning to BrandLoyalty, revenue increased 18% and adjusted EBITDA increased 2% on a constant currency basis for the fourth quarter of 2015. Growth in adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was dampened by expenses associated with our North American expansion efforts and incremental bonus expense tied to the overall strong annual performance. Overall, it was a tremendous year for BrandLoyalty, as constant currency revenue increased 31% and adjusted EBITDA 15% from 2014. Importantly, we made substantial strides in our North American expansion effort, ending 2015 with a signed backlog in excess of $45 million in Canada and a pilot set to launch in the U.S. during the first quarter of 2016. 
Looking ahead to 2016, AIR MILES faces a weakening Canadian economy, particularly in Western Canada, which could create a headwind to issuance growth and further drive the shift in sponsor mix, negatively impacting our profitability. 
Let's turn the page and talk about Epsilon Conversant. Epsilon's revenue increased 38% to $608 million and adjusted EBITDA increased 54% to $157 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, both helped by the acquisition of Conversant in December 2014. Organic growth was strong, as revenue increased 7% and adjusted EBITDA increased 5% for the fourth quarter of 2015. Notably, as shown on the slide, organic top line growth accelerated as the year progressed. Also, adjusted EBITDA margins increased by 270 basis points, driven by strong performance of Conversant, where margins increased to approximately 37% for the fourth quarter 2015. 
For Epsilon, our main priority for 2015 was to control increases in human capital cost, allowing revenue growth to flow through to adjusted EBITDA. We were successful as organic revenue and adjusted EBITDA both increased 5% compared to full year 2014. Strength in the auto vertical, coupled with double-digit growth within Epsilon's digital experience offerings contributed to the positive revenue momentum. 
Our new facility in India became operational during the fourth quarter. We ended 2015 with about 300 associates in India, and hope to increase the headcount to about 1,000 by 2016 year-end. We believe the higher percentage of headcount growth in India versus U.S. will allow solid flow through of revenue growth to the bottom line, again, in 2016. 
Of note, Epsilon was named by recent Forrester report as a market leader within the loyalty space, highlighting the business' ability to further integrate its loyalty capabilities with a multichannel marketing solution in order to provide more useful customer insights. 
Turning to Conversant. As shown on Page -- Slide 5, this was year's 2 halves. The first half was about much-needed change within existing business model, and the second half was return-to-growth story, led by the cross-sell efforts and onboarding of the backlog. 
The quarterly progression of the turn wrapped the year with strong growth in the fourth quarter, as revenue grew 6% and adjusted EBITDA grew an impressive 14% compared to pro forma Q4 2014. A methodical pruning of lower margin product offerings early in the year and refocusing on the more profitable, data-driven cross-device offerings resulted in margins growing close to 300 basis points versus pro forma Q4 2014. 
Success with the cross-selling effort continues to ramp up as Conversant's rich offering is introduced to the Epsilon client base, beginning with the retail industry as our primary focus in 2015, but now expanding into key verticals such as automotive, CPG and media. As a result, the backlog has nearly doubled since midway through 2015, increasing to over $90 million in annual contract value, with new logos such as Toys ""R"" Us, Cornerstone brands, Staples and a leading telecom provider. Now that the holiday season is over, a time when many clients' budgets tend to be frozen, a half dozen new tests are already queued up and underway for the first quarter of 2016, seeding the next wave of cross-sell activity. 
Finally, Conversant's offerings continue to gain market recognition with the recent Gartner Magic Quadrant report, highlighting this move from a niche player to a challenger in its digital marketing hub report, specifically emphasizing Conversant's high [indiscernible], media targeting and reach, and unique ability to personalize 1-to-1 interactions with every consumer across device, media and channel. 
Let's go to the next page and talk about the nice growth we saw in Conversant. If you look in -- during the second quarter, Ed and I came back and gave guidance that we see it turn in the back half of the year. Fortunately, we saw it in Q3, and we actually exceeded Q3 and Q4 expectations. So the turn that we've talked about early in the year has definitely manifested, and we expect to see that continue into 2016. 
For Card Services, it was the 16th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth and a strong finish to the year. For the fourth quarter 2015, revenue increased 20%, while adjusted EBITDA net increased a healthy 16%. A nice flow through of revenue growth, given the substantial provision build for both the quarter and full year as result a strong card receivables growth and the need to get ahead of the uptick in loss rates. Notably, we achieved substantial expense leveraging for the fourth quarter and full year, mitigating the decline in our gross yields from a higher percentage of co-brand receivables. These outstanding results can be attributed to our proven ability to drive credit sales, which increased 22% for the fourth quarter even without the onboarding of sales, which slipped to January of 2016. If you remember, we onboarded about $600 million of acquired portfolios during the fourth quarter of 2014, creating a difficult comparable, which is why the growth rate dropped a little bit compared to earlier in the year. 
As we've mentioned before, our credit sales growth rate of 3x that of our overall brand sales, and that's usually what we try to attract to. Core credit sales from brands with us before 2012 were up 11%, driving tender share growth north of 200 basis points for the quarter, a strong endorsement of our collaborative, tailored approach to loyalty. Our card members continue to shop more often, up nearly 6% to last year, and spend more per trip, up about 5% to last year, confirming that our brand's best customers who are in the stores, online and engage digitally. 
From a digital perspective, about 10% of our tapped credit applications came through web-enabled mobile channels, and about 40% of our credit sales were online for the fourth quarter of 2015. Retailers online sales trended up this holiday, but our strong results substantially outpaced that performance. 
In addition, we continue to roll out our MyLoyalty app with several brands during the quarter. This is our proprietary retailer branded mobile app built to serve the needs of our card members to value most. Our continued and very purposeful investment in mobile and digital engagement provide great momentum to position us for further strong growth as customer engagement continues to evolve. 
Average card receivables increased an impressive 25% for the fourth quarter. From a credit quality perspective, principal loss rates were 4.7% for the fourth quarter and 4.5% for the year, both consistent with our original guidance. The 30 basis points increase for '15 is due to normal seasoning of new programs as well as slightly lower recovery rates. Delinquency rate trends have been consistent and stable throughout 2015, trending up slightly from 2014. 
Looking to 2016, momentum remains strong. We signed another $2 billion vintage in 2015, and believe we can do the same in 2015. Our unique and demonstrated strategy of bringing a collaborative, targeted approach to loyalty provides Card Services with a very vigorous pipeline of potential new brands to sustain these growth rates. 
With that, I will turn it over to Ed."

Thank you, Charles. If everyone can turn to the Slide 2015 Wrap-up. This is where it gives me a chance to talk about the year, what went well, what could have gone better and how the overall model continues to evolve as we continue down the path into '16, '17 and '18. And again, the best way to start this off and to look at it is that Alliance's model continues to move towards, if you think of it, a series of platforms, whether it's for a coalition of Private Label card or one-off loyalty program, but a series of platforms, depending upon what the customer wants that are used really as a capturing device. The ability to capture the clients -- customer and what he or she is purchasing down to the SKU level both online and off-line. So it's really a platform to capture this very important unique information, which is then all funneled down to the same type of analytics to gain insight into what purchase behavior within the past few years is saying about this consumer, and how we can read into that and reach that consumer on a personalized basis. We believe the model will continue to move from a mass-marketing approach to a segmented approach, where it really is today, to where we're heading, which I think is the 1-to-1 personalized approach, which is beginning to manifest itself today and will over the next 18 to 24 months. 
So taking that information, gaining the insight, figuring out what makes them tick and then reaching them with the relevant message or communication from our clients, again, personalized to their tastes and habits and reaching them through the right channel, because it's as important to have the right message but as important to actually reach the folks through the right channel, whether it is from personalized message to direct mail or permission-based e-mail, mobile, social targeted display. You wrap it all together and a big services wrappering -- wrapper, and that's really where we are on the model. So oftentimes I am asked, where are we in 5 years. In 5 years, you're basically looking at 1 massive platform. But today, what we're looking at are a series of platforms. And what we want to do is sort of probe and tweak, and pick and choose the platforms that are growing in those that may be less relevant. 
So with that being said, let me dive into the first couple of platforms, one would be our coalition program, which is where we have 1 platform, where a number of clients come together, pool their marketing dollars, and it's called the AIR MILES reward program in Canada. The reason I gave that introduction is because the critical metric there is the number of points, the number of miles, whatever you want to call it, the number of units that get issued. They are issued based upon the consumer spend. And that's our key metric. That's how we get paid. And last year -- I’m sorry, in 2014, that metric had fallen to a troubling sort of flattish to 1% up, and that is not something that we think is an appropriate run rate for that business. So we put our shoulder into 2015 right as the Canadian economy hit a massive headwind. And so the net result was the team managed to play through the macro environment and actually grow that key metric 4%, and our goal is to grow it somewhere 4%, 5% a year. If we can do that, eventually you'll have the revenue and earnings to follow. It is a deferred model so that just because you're earning this year, it takes a couple of years for it to actually flow through. I've never quite understood the accounting, but that's why we have Charles. So the 4-ish type percent was, I think, something that was outstanding given the macro environment, and that was our goal. Our goal was to get this thing back in a growth mode and demonstrate that there's a long runway left in this program. 
On the negative side, we have -- it didn't yet translate into the type of growth that we really want longer term from a revenue and EBITDA perspective. Again, there's sort of a lag there that takes place. We would expect in 2016 to see slightly better numbers both on top and bottom as we look for positive growth to return on the EBITDA side as well. The key driver of that is, as Charles talked about, was the mix due to sort of the macro factors that were out there. A lot of the growth that we had came through a ton of work and promotional programs that our big grocers in Canada were pushing, and a little less through the somewhat more, I guess, beneficial spend on our big cards that are up there through Bank of Montreal and American Express. Nonetheless, our key metric is back where we want it, and we need to make sure even in a very, very difficult Canadian economy -- well, it's in a recession, I mean it's not the way to say it, we want to see that thing grow again this year, and that will ensure the long-term growth. 
Turning to a little bit of a different story is our other platform, which is the BrandLoyalty platform, which focuses on much shorter-term, largely promotional-type programs at grocers that essentially will hit the consumer hard over a 20-week period, to really entice them to spend a little bit more visit, a little bit more often. And what do we do is, again, we're taking all that information and the data from what they're buying and shopping for in the grocers and moving towards a personalized approach of getting them excited about coming into the -- that grocer one extra time or to spend a little bit more there to achieve that targeted reward. 
Needless to say, similar to 2014, BrandLoyalty had a very strong year, with revenues up over 30%, and EBITDA, despite spending a whole bunch of money, getting North America cranked up, was up mid-teens. So we think that the BrandLoyalty approach has a long runway, and we expect another very solid year in '16 as well. 
The North American approach is kind of interesting in the sense of -- this has primarily grown out of European platform, and now it's moving to the Americas for the first time. And specifically, what was kind of exciting for me, anyhow, was the fact that we could use the relationships that we've developed in Canada over the past 20 years with the AIR MILES program to introduce them to a different type of targeted marketing approach to the BrandLoyalty program. And sure enough, it went extremely well. And we are lined up, I mean, we'll probably do as much as $40 million or so in revs just from Canada next year. So as you think about the pilot, that's also kicking off in the U.S. in '16, and the size of the U.S., if Canada has any indication, this could be a business to be in going forward. 
Then finally, we have our coalition program, again, down in Brazil, called Dotz, and it continues to grow. I mean, the membership is up 20% to just under 18 million. We successfully launched in Rio, which was our big goal for the year. And it's growing. It's moving along nicely, and that is in spite of a really challenging environment down there. So we're kind of going to sit back and just, hopefully, watch this thing continue to move up at a double-digit pace. And as things stabilize down there the next couple of years, hopefully, we'll really start to see the flow through. But so far so good there. I think, overall, the businesses, the platforms within LoyaltyOne had a very strong year. 
Turning now to Epsilon. Again, I remind folks of what was the goal of Epsilon for the year. The biggest one at the sort of the core business itself was to find a way to have a sustainable model that flow to top line growth down to earnings or EBITDA cash flow. And that was a challenge for us over the past several years as we continue to see nice growth on the top line. But because of the hot skills and everything else required in our labor force and the heavy services aspect of the business, it got to be a challenge to actually flow that through to the bottom line. So for the first time, I think we feel comfortable that we have a sustainable model long term that will allow sort of the core Epsilon offerings. And again, these platforms are primarily -- these massive database and loyalty platforms that you see out there, the Citibank ThankYous and the Hilton HHonors and the Walgreens and stuff. That will allow us to show organic growth rate at about 2x or so GDP or roughly 5-ish, 6-ish percent, but actually have that flow down to earnings as well. And part of that solution was opening up our new office in India. And our new associates over there will be joined with an ever-growing group within North America as well, and we should have, I think, a nice balance on the growth side. So that was our #1 sort of goal. 
The next one was this sort of trail off that people have noticed over the past couple of years. In terms of revenue growth at Epsilon, it tended to start out strong and then sort of trailed off at the end of the year. We think also that this year was we had a very good momentum build as the year progressed. So Q2 was up 4%, that then moved to 5% in Q3, and we exited the year at 7%, all of which, I think, is -- it bodes well for 2016. 
We talked a little bit about our new associates that are joining us over in India. 
And then on the Conversant side, on the negative for sure, I think, on a full year basis. We were too optimistic that we could manage to transform the existing business and get the book of business with the cross-sell signed and get it up all and running. We certainly got over SKUs on that one. However, after really tough first half of the year, we started to see the results of this effort. And I couldn't really be more pleased with how the year has turned out in terms of Q4, and how we're stepping off into 2016. 
As I've said before, I've likened it to changing a tire on a moving car. It's hard to do, and the teams did a wonderful job at finally getting it done. We took the pain early to make it right in the second half and for '16. And as Charles showed you, the revenue went from minus 6 in Q1 to minus 9 in Q2. It bounced all the way back to flat in Q3, and we stepped off the year at plus 6. 
On the EBITDA side. Again, it was a minus 6 in Q1. That bounced back a little bit faster. We got to flat in Q2 and plus 9 in Q3, and exiting the year at a plus 14. 
So in terms of a turn or the hockey stick that we've all seen out there, this one actually played out, which was kind of nice. And as importantly, as Charles also mentioned, the book of business, and what does that mean? What it means is that we -- when we sign a deal with Conversant, where we're going to be -- we're going to a -- let's say, a retailer and they're going to start supplying us with all their SKU level information, and we're going to be using that SKU to continue to develop models to go out and reach their consumers or others across the various digital channels. It's important that if we look at it and we basically say, okay, where we come, where we're going, what's the next step. And the critical thing here was -- I think, it was a very good marriage of the 2. Epsilon was a little bit light on having the scale it needed in the digital side. I think, Conversant on its own, would have had some challenges trying to compete with some of the larger players out there. You put it together and it seemed to actually have worked very well. And as a result, the book of business that we're looking at here, the vintage, when you signed these clients it's not unlike what happens in our card business, where it takes 2 or 3 years to fully realize the full run rate of these relationships. And as a result, we signed up book of up to $90 million of potential top line that would be additive to Conversant as these clients rollout over the next couple of years. We managed to see a lot of that start to come through in Q4. And what was very gratifying was the majority of these came through a collaboration between Conversant and big Epsilon enterprise clients, where we were allowed, able to get the Conversant folks into the Epsilon clients and between the 2 of them created the sales. I think we're very early in the game in terms of what we're looking to do. We believe across Epsilon, AIR MILES, BrandLoyalty and Card Services, there are about 500 enterprise clients where we have a very good in with the CMOs, and that's where we're going to be spending a lot of our time. And of those 500, we probably hit like 25 or 30 at this point, so a long way to go. Anyhow, I feel good about Conversant. 
And finally, Card Services, which continued to just have just a tremendous year. I kind of keep saying that. It seems like I keep saying it every year. But it continues to happen not only because of the offerings we're putting out there but also because of, again, the macro shift or the secular shift that's going on and how folks are spending. Again, think of this as another platform that also offers a liquidity tool. And what we did here is we continue to have a huge amount of demand from retailers, both traditional bricks and mortars as well as pure online, who are very interested, once again, in understanding who their consumer is and reaching out to them on a personalized basis. And to do that, we are the folks they trust to hold the SKU level information, both online, offline, purchase level SKU. And again, are you going to come to us to spend your digital dollars on search? Probably not. Or social? Probably not. But based on SKU level, you bet you, that's who we are, and that's sort of the uniqueness of the model that we have here. And so our credit sales, and that is actually using -- consumers using our card and spending on the cards. It was up over 30%, driving the portfolio of receivables up 30%, translating into revenue up 24%, and finally, through to cash flow about in the mid-teens. Obviously, a tremendous year. 
One of the things that continues to be very important in this business is tender share. We can have also great signings with new clients and everything else, but if you can grow the core, the folks who have been with you for many years, where you thought that we've kind of plateaued in terms of how much of each dollar spent at the retailer will go through our card. And we used to think it was somewhere in the high 20s, maybe 30%. Now we think that ceiling has been raised quite a bit. Our ability to reach out and personalize messaging to the various consumer groups out there has allowed us to continue to grow our share of spend at these retailers. And when you can grow 150 basis points at these core retailers, you're essentially, along with their growth, going to get your first 10% of growth in the portfolio, which used to be for us what everything together could get us. Then you throw in the new vintages that have been signed, that are the new clients over the past several years, they take 3 years to ramp up, and that 3 gets your next 10% of growth. And so that's why a 20% type growth rate here, which if you ask me a few years ago, I would have said, I don't think that's a good long-term growth rate, probably more like 8% or 9%. But I've been proven wrong, fortunately, for a number of years here. 
We signed another $2 billion vintage of new clients from Toyota Lexus to Cornerstone to Wayfair to Farmers Insurance, Red Roof and Univision. Again, good names, and we have those folks up and running. 
And then finally, from the Credit quality perspective. Our seeing is the typical seasoning you would see as you bring on a large amount of new business. It was also of note that the original guidance that Charles gave of mid-4% for the year, which was made well before we even started the year, we came in right on the bottom on that one. So you will continue to see these vintages normalize, and we are not seeing any evidence whatsoever of any type of distress on the part of the consumer. 
To wrap up '15, revenue, EBITDA, EPS, all up 20%. We know a tough microenvironment organic, which is the thing that I really focusing on. We try to do 3x GDP as our long-term model. If we could do like 8%, 9% a year, that'd be great. This past year, we did 11% or actually on a constant currency basis 15%, which was really gratifying to see. The dollar, which I think everyone under the sun is probably getting sick of hearing about, but just to put it in perspective, we grew the 20% or 11% organic, despite being hit with about $0.25 billion of FX top line headwind and about $0.50, so it knocked about 4 points of our growth. 
All that being said, let's now move into '16. We say goodbye to '15, and here we go. 2016 outlook. High single-digit growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA on a constant currency basis. That incorporates both BrandLoyalty and it incorporates our Canadian business. And if you were to break it down on a constant currency basis, you would look for BrandLoyalty, obviously, to be the one that shows the higher growth rate. We would expect another year of a double-double top in EBITDA type growth rate for BL and obviously, something less than that for the Canadian business. But we do want to see the Canadian business turn the corner and continue to start its growth mode. 
The big initiatives will be with BrandLoyalty. The North American expansion, we think, were very well placed in Canada. We want to see how the pilots go in the U.S., and we want to really make some headway in the U.S. and start that process going. That's a huge area of growth for us. 
Again, despite really a challenging macro environment in Canada, we do want to continue to see that mid-single-digit issuance growth, because that is what drives the success long term in the program. 
And in Brazil, as we talked about, we want to see double-digit growth in both membership and constant currency revenue. It continues. It's not part of our numbers that you see in our financials. We own 37%, but we continue to see it moving along. 
At Epsilon, if you were to sort of mix, again, Conversant and Epsilon together, you would see mid- to high single-digit growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA, I would say, Epi -- Epsilon should look a lot like this past year with sort of mid-single-digit top and bottom. Conversant will be different, where we expect to start seeing the high single-digits growth rate that we had been expecting long term. So everything looks pretty good there. We want to drive a minimum of another $70 million in cross-sell revenue at Conversant, and again, as we penetrate into Epsilon's core client base as well as into our Card group and elsewhere. 
All right. Turning to Card Services. Well, we expect another big year, up to 25% growth in the portfolio. We don't expect to slow down. We see things looking quite bright for the business for another year. Another year of double-digit revenue and EBITDA growth rate net of funding. We look again to sign another $2 billion vintage. And again, what that means is we sign a bunch of new clients, and over the course of 3 years their portfolios -- their combined portfolios would aggregate up to about $2 billion in new portfolio growth. So they're big numbers. But if I went back and I looked at the good old days of $300 million or $400 million used to be a big year. And then 2012, we signed our first $1 billion vintage, and then it was $2 billion '13, $2 billion in '14, $2 billion in '15, and we expect $2 billion in '16. So I certainly like the outlook for this business. 
All right. Getting questions about credit quality, the health of the consumer. Obviously, with some of the noise out there in the marketplace, what can we say? We stay very close to all of this. We have roughly 40 million active households that are in our programs, and we are seeing, again, no distress on the part of the consumer. So it looks like that's in pretty good shape. 
If you look at the actual loss rates that we're going to print, what you're looking at is you saw it go from roughly 4% to 4.5%. It will be about 5% in '16, and then in '17 we expect it to start to level off at about 5.5%, which we believe is the new normal. And so again, I think, we are going to be right on target in terms of the sort of 5 percenter for '15. Question being asked is why? Why is this drifting upwards? It's primarily -- it's kind of interesting. It's primarily due to the fact that when you had the Great Recession in '08, '09, you had massive amounts of charge-offs. And it took until 2014 to really clean up the backlog in terms of recoveries. And in our business, which is different from general purpose cards, recoveries are a huge part of what constitutes our loss rates. And in the post-recession time period, as people are getting back on their feet, we were actually recovering almost $0.35 on the dollar. And that from a net loss perspective is what kept the losses abnormally low. We've sort of passed that point at this stage, and it's beginning to normalize on 35% to more in the 20s, probably low 20s is where we'll net out. And if you moved from last year to this year, you will have seen the recoveries are coming down about 5 points, and as a result that turns into about 50 basis points less recovered on the losses. So it's not really the actual loss rate from a gross perspective going up 50 basis points, it means the net loss rate, that is lower recoveries that have normalized, that is really driving the net loss rate up about 50 basis points. So we don't see anything alarming there. It's a normalization process that happens in the Private Label business in a high-growth mode. The remainder tale of any type of drift upward will be the continued seasoning of the big vintages. 
The net story here is that, we believe our long-term normalized loss rate before the Great Recession was about 6.5%. Today, we're very comfortable that we're going to level out around 5.5%, probably sometime in '17, going into '18. The reason why it's a little bit lower is the fact that over the past half a dozen years or so, we've attracted a bit higher from a credit perspective quality-type consumer. When you bring on the Barneys and the Talbots and [indiscernible] of the world and then you have some co-brand mixed in, which carries a lower loss rate. So we think the 5.5% is about right. We're solely marching towards that level, and we feel comfortable with our '16 guidance. 
I do want to address how it will play out sequentially. I think that's important, because you have seasonality in our business, which, again, is different from traditional cards that are out there. Q1 will tend to be our highest quarter. If you looked at last year, 2015, you jumped off from Q4 of '14 to Q1 of '15, and your losses jumped up about 70 basis points on a seasonal basis. We expect that exact same type behavior to take place in 2016. So you're going from sort of your high 4s at the end of -- or mid-4s at the end of '16 to sort of somewhere in your low 5s as a starting point. And then from a seasonality perspective, that starts actually to drift down as the year progresses and then flattens out in the back half. So that's how the seasonality works, and so no one is surprised. And as we talked about, we expect full normalization at around 5.5% as we move into '17. 
From a guidance perspective, to wrap up, we are maintaining our guidance. For the full year, we're not going to change that despite, I think, people's outlook, that has gotten a little bit more negative on the macro. We think we're in pretty good shape here. So constant currency basis, look at about 7.2 on top and $17 on the core EPS. That's 100% organic growth rate. We're using FX rates of 0.78 and 1.11 for the year. As it relates to Q1, we're looking at about 8% constant currency growth rate and about 5% from an actual print perspective. So that includes the FX headwinds of about $0.10. I think it will probably be a little bit less than that right now. We used FX rates of about $1.69 for the euro and Canadian respectively, and right now the euro is more like $1.09 and the Canadian dollar, $0.71. So I think that gap is closed somewhat. But look for of those types of numbers in Q1. 
Before we get asked the question, the big difference between this year and last year is the fact that last year Q1 is when BrandLoyalty, their programs all hit in the first quarter, and their earnings were up over 100% in Q1. And then we're down 50% in Q2, and that cost quite a bit of questioning in terms of how do you actually flow this thing out. It's tough on a quarterly basis. But what we're looking at here is rather than up 100% in Q1 and down 15% in Q2. You're going to see more like flat performance in both BrandLoyalty in Q1. The big programs seem to be hitting in Q2. They've been signed up. We expect over 100% growth in Q2 this year. So like Q2, you should see that mid-teens growth return to earnings. So that's pretty much it. You've got some towards the bouncing ball in terms of the quarterly stuff. On an annualized basis, it looks pretty good. From a quality perspective, it looks pretty good. And I know the sentiment out there is fairly negative on the macro side. But what we're seeing in the businesses we're in would suggest another double-digit organic growth here for us. 
So that's it. I'm going to actually let Charles now talk, and we'll wrap it up and take questions. Questions? Operator?"

I guess first of all, do we have that right? And then that's pro forma for Conversant. And again, I think you mentioned first quarter's guide of 8% was really stepped down because of the timing year-over-year versus of where the BrandLoyalty results come in, right, first quarter versus second. Just make sure that the only difference. And then if that difference did not exist, what would your first quarter growth rate look like? I'm just curious.

And again, the more and more personalized we make the outreach to the consumer, the more effective it is. The more sales that are created, the better the retention of the consumer is.

The shuffling or the competitive pressure that you're seeing is really on the co-brand side. That's where, let's say, you're running into the buzz of the big banks who are looking to grow balances. And the best way to grow balances is certainly not through Private Label, right? They're are tiny balances, but through the big co-brand balances. And so what we are seeing out that there is the pricing on co-brand deals, the big Visa, MasterCard balances, which are 5x, 6x what our Private Label balances are. It's getting credibly competitive, and as a result we backed off in that area because we don't really need it. What you'll find is most of our co-brand stuff is an added product to an existing Private Label client. So to answer your question, the co-brand space is not an area where we think that the pricing makes sense. In terms of the Private Label stuff, that's where you get a lot more focus on the card being viewed as surely the loyalty tool, which gets into the data and the digital, and that's where you get the Conversant discussions beginning to come in and the Epsilon discussions. That's sort of our sweet spot. And the more assets we bring on the digital side, like a Conversant, the better off we are with those businesses. And frankly, the sale on the Private Label side is more a sale of developing a loyalty program with all the digital channels attached to it, and that's where we don't really run in the type of pricing issues that you're running elsewhere, and that's where we're going to stay."

Impressive growth considering the FX headwinds we faced all year long. For the fourth",1738,"Thanks, Ed. It was a strong finish to 2015, as revenue increased 18%, core EPS increased 20% and adjusted EBITDA net increased 18% compared to the fourth quarter 2014. Impressive growth considering the FX headwinds we faced all year long. 
For the fourth quarter, the strong U.S. dollar reduced our reported revenue by about $67 million or 4% hit to the growth rate, and core EPS by $0.12 or a 3% hit to the growth rate. 
Organic revenue growth remained strong in the fourth quarter, up 14% on a constant currency basis. That compares to 15% constant currency growth for the full year, reflecting balanced growth throughout 2015. 
From a capital allocation standpoint, we spent $952 million during 2015, acquiring 3.4 million shares under our repurchase program at an average cost of about $280 per share. We have now reacquired about 80% of the number of shares issued to acquire Conversant at the end of 2014. 
Looking into 2016, we expect our capital allocation to shift to M&A first probably in the $400 million to $500 million range and then to share repurchases up to the $500 million board authorization. Essentially, we'll look to deploy our free cash flow while maintaining or lowering our leverage ratio of about 2.7x. 
Let's flip over to Page 3 and talk about LoyaltyOne. On a constant currency basis, revenue increased 6% to $421 million, while adjusted EBITDA decreased 13% to $99 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. A shift in sponsor mix, which lowered the average price per mile issued, coupled with increased support of our sponsor promotional programs pressured AIR MILES' financials results for the quarter. The strength in U.S. dollar was a year-long headwind and will likely again be in 2015. 
AIR MILES reward miles issued decreased 8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. This was expected as several sponsor promotions happened earlier in '15 than in 2014. For the year, AIR MILES issued increased 4%, up from 1% growth in 2014. The improvements in annual growth is due to the onboarding of a national grocer, continued promotional activity and growth in the instant reward program. For 2016, we expect issuance growth in the 3% to 5% range with promotions timed similar to 2015. AIR MILES reward miles redeemed decreased 2% compared to the fourth quarter, largely a result of the decrease in AIR MILES reward miles issued. The instant reward option, AM Cash, continues to grow, accounting for 21% of miles issued and 29% of miles redeemed for the fourth quarter of 2015. This option is growing in popularity as the instant gratification resonates with our collector base, especially in a tough economy. 
Turning to BrandLoyalty, revenue increased 18% and adjusted EBITDA increased 2% on a constant currency basis for the fourth quarter of 2015. Growth in adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was dampened by expenses associated with our North American expansion efforts and incremental bonus expense tied to the overall strong annual performance. Overall, it was a tremendous year for BrandLoyalty, as constant currency revenue increased 31% and adjusted EBITDA 15% from 2014. Importantly, we made substantial strides in our North American expansion effort, ending 2015 with a signed backlog in excess of $45 million in Canada and a pilot set to launch in the U.S. during the first quarter of 2016. 
Looking ahead to 2016, AIR MILES faces a weakening Canadian economy, particularly in Western Canada, which could create a headwind to issuance growth and further drive the shift in sponsor mix, negatively impacting our profitability. 
Let's turn the page and talk about Epsilon Conversant. Epsilon's revenue increased 38% to $608 million and adjusted EBITDA increased 54% to $157 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, both helped by the acquisition of Conversant in December 2014. Organic growth was strong, as revenue increased 7% and adjusted EBITDA increased 5% for the fourth quarter of 2015. Notably, as shown on the slide, organic top line growth accelerated as the year progressed. Also, adjusted EBITDA margins increased by 270 basis points, driven by strong performance of Conversant, where margins increased to approximately 37% for the fourth quarter 2015. 
For Epsilon, our main priority for 2015 was to control increases in human capital cost, allowing revenue growth to flow through to adjusted EBITDA. We were successful as organic revenue and adjusted EBITDA both increased 5% compared to full year 2014. Strength in the auto vertical, coupled with double-digit growth within Epsilon's digital experience offerings contributed to the positive revenue momentum. 
Our new facility in India became operational during the fourth quarter. We ended 2015 with about 300 associates in India, and hope to increase the headcount to about 1,000 by 2016 year-end. We believe the higher percentage of headcount growth in India versus U.S. will allow solid flow through of revenue growth to the bottom line, again, in 2016. 
Of note, Epsilon was named by recent Forrester report as a market leader within the loyalty space, highlighting the business' ability to further integrate its loyalty capabilities with a multichannel marketing solution in order to provide more useful customer insights. 
Turning to Conversant. As shown on Page -- Slide 5, this was a year of 2 halves. The first half was about much-needed change within existing business model, and the second half was return-to-growth story, led by the cross-sell efforts and onboarding of the backlog. 
The quarterly progression of the turn wrapped the year with strong growth in the fourth quarter, as revenue grew 6% and adjusted EBITDA grew an impressive 14% compared to pro forma Q4 2014. A methodical pruning of lower margin product offerings early in the year and refocusing on the more profitable, data-driven cross-device offerings resulted in margins growing close to 300 basis points versus pro forma Q4 2014. 
Success with the cross-selling effort continues to ramp up as Conversant's rich offering is introduced to the Epsilon client base, beginning with the retail industry as our primary focus in 2015, but now expanding into key verticals such as automotive, CPG and media. As a result, the backlog has nearly doubled since midway through 2015, increasing to over $90 million in annual contract value, with new logos such as Toys ""R"" Us, Cornerstone brands, Staples and a leading telecom provider. Now that the holiday season is over, a time when many clients' budgets tend to be frozen, a half dozen new tests are already queued up and underway for the first quarter of 2016, seeding the next wave of cross-sell activity. 
Finally, Conversant's offerings continue to gain market recognition with the recent Gartner Magic Quadrant report, highlighting it's evolved from a niche player to a challenger in its digital marketing hub report, specifically emphasizing Conversant's high mass ratio, media targeting and reach, and unique ability to personalize 1-to-1 interactions with every consumer across device, media and channel. 
Let's go to the next page and talk about the nice growth we saw in Conversant. If you look in -- during the second quarter, Ed and I came back and gave guidance that we see it turn in the back half of the year. Fortunately, we saw it in Q3, and we actually exceeded Q3 and Q4 expectations. So the turn that we've talked about early in the year has definitely manifested, and we expect to see that continue into 2016. 
For Card Services, it was the 16th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth and a strong finish to the year. For the fourth quarter 2015, revenue increased 20%, while adjusted EBITDA net increased a healthy 16%. A nice flow through of revenue growth, given the substantial provision build for both the quarter and full year as result a strong card receivables growth and the need to get ahead of the uptick in loss rates. Notably, we achieved substantial expense leveraging for the fourth quarter and full year, mitigating the decline in our gross yields from a higher percentage of co-brand receivables. These outstanding results can be attributed to our proven ability to drive credit sales, which increased 22% for the fourth quarter even without the onboarding of Zales, which slipped to January of 2016. If you remember, we on boarded about $600 million of acquired portfolios during the fourth quarter of 2014, creating a difficult comparable, which is why the growth rate dropped a little bit compared to earlier in the year. 
As we've mentioned before, our credit sales growth rate of 3x that of our overall brand sales, and that's usually what we try to track to. Core credit sales from brands with us before 2012 were up 11%, driving to industry growth north of 200 basis points for the quarter, a strong endorsement of our collaborative, tailored approach to loyalty. Our card members continue to shop more often, up nearly 6% to last year, and spend more per trip, up about 5% to last year, confirming that our brand's best customers who are in the stores, online and engage digitally. 
From a digital perspective, about 10% of our credit applications came through web-enabled mobile channels, and about 40% of our credit sales were online for the fourth quarter of 2015. Retailers online sales trended up this holiday, but our strong results substantially outpaced that performance. 
In addition, we continue to roll out our MyLoyalty app with several brands during the quarter. This is our proprietary retailer branded mobile app built to serve the needs of our card members to value most. Our continued and very purposeful investment in mobile and digital engagement provide great momentum to position us for further strong growth as customer engagement continues to evolve. 
Average card receivables increased an impressive 25% for the fourth quarter. From a credit quality perspective, principal loss rates were 4.7% for the fourth quarter and 4.5% for the year, both consistent with our original guidance. The 30 basis points increase for '15 is due to normal seasoning of new programs as well as slightly lower recovery rates. Delinquency rate trends have been consistent and stable throughout 2015, trending up slightly from 2014. 
Looking to 2016, momentum remains strong. We signed another $2 billion vintage in 2015, and believe we can do the same in 2015. Our unique and demonstrated strategy of bringing a collaborative, targeted approach to loyalty provides Card Services with a very vigorous pipeline of potential new brands to sustain these growth rates. 
With that, I will turn it over to Ed."

Thank you, Charles. If everyone can turn to the Slide 2015 Wrap-up. This is where it gives me a chance to talk about the year, what went well, what could have gone better and how the overall model continues to evolve as we continue down the path into '16, '17 and '18. And again, the best way to start this off and to look at it is that Alliance's model continues to move towards, if you think of it, a series of platforms, whether it's for a coalition of Private Label card or one-off loyalty program, but a series of platforms, depending upon what the customer wants that are used really as a capturing device. The ability to capture the clients -- customer and what he or she is purchasing down to the SKU level both online and off-line. So it's really a platform to capture this very important unique information, which is then all funneled down to the same type of analytics to gain insight into what purchase behavior within the past few years is saying about this consumer, and how we can read into that and reach that consumer on a personalized basis. We believe the model will continue to move from a mass-marketing approach to a segmented approach, where it really is today, to where we're heading, which I think is the 1-to-1 personalized approach, which is beginning to manifest itself today and will over the next 18 to 24 months. 
So taking that information, gaining the insight, figuring out what makes them tick and then reaching them with the relevant message or communication from our clients, again, personalized to their tastes and habits and reaching them through the right channel, because it's as important to have the right message but as important to actually reach the folks through the right channel, whether it is from personalized message to direct mail or permission-based e-mail, mobile, social targeted display. You wrap it all together and a big services wrappering -- wrapper, and that's really where we are on the model. So oftentimes I am asked, where are we in 5 years. In 5 years, you're basically looking at 1 massive platform. But today, what we're looking at are a series of platforms. And what we want to do is sort of probe and tweak, and pick and choose the platforms that are growing in those that may be less relevant. 
So with that being said, let me dive into the first couple of platforms, one would be our coalition program, which is where we have 1 platform, where a number of clients come together, pool their marketing dollars, and it's called the AIR MILES reward program in Canada. The reason I gave that introduction is because the critical metric there is the number of points, the number of miles, whatever you want to call it, the number of units that get issued. They are issued based upon the consumer spend. And that's our key metric. That's how we get paid. And last year -- I’m sorry, in 2014, that metric had fallen to a troubling sort of flattish to 1% up, and that is not something that we think is an appropriate run rate for that business. So we put our shoulder into 2015 right as the Canadian economy hit a massive headwind. And so the net result was the team managed to play through the macro environment and actually grow that key metric 4%, and our goal is to grow it somewhere 4%, 5% a year. If we can do that, eventually you'll have the revenue and earnings to follow. It is a deferred model so that just because you're earning this year, it takes a couple of years for it to actually flow through. I've never quite understood the accounting, but that's why we have Charles. So the 4-ish type percent was, I think, something that was outstanding given the macro environment, and that was our goal. Our goal was to get this thing back in a growth mode and demonstrate that there's a long runway left in this program. 
On the negative side, we have -- it didn't yet translate into the type of growth that we really want longer term from a revenue and EBITDA perspective. Again, there's sort of a lag there that takes place. We would expect in 2016 to see slightly better numbers both on top and bottom as we look for positive growth to return on the EBITDA side as well. The key driver of that is, as Charles talked about, was the mix due to sort of the macro factors that were out there. A lot of the growth that we had came through a ton of work in promotional programs that our big grocers in Canada were pushing, and a little less through the somewhat more, I guess, beneficial spend on our big cards that are up there through Bank of Montreal and American Express. Nonetheless, our key metric is back where we want it, and we need to make sure even in a very, very difficult Canadian economy -- well, it's in a recession, I mean there's no other way to say it, we want to see that thing grow again this year, and that will ensure the long-term growth. 
Turning to a little bit of a different story is our other platform, which is the BrandLoyalty platform, which focuses on much shorter-term, largely promotional-type programs at grocers that essentially will hit the consumer hard over a 20-week period, to really entice them to spend a little bit more, visit a little bit more often. And what do we do is, again, we're taking all that information and the data from what they're buying and shopping for in the grocers and moving towards a personalized approach of getting them excited about coming into the -- that grocer one extra time or to spend a little bit more there to achieve that targeted reward. 
Needless to say, similar to 2014, BrandLoyalty had a very strong year, with revenues up over 30%, and EBITDA, despite spending a whole bunch of money, getting North America cranked up, was up mid-teens. So we think that the BrandLoyalty approach has a long runway, and we expect another very solid year in '16 as well. 
The North American approach is kind of interesting in the sense of -- this has primarily grown out of European platform, and now it's moving to the Americas for the first time. And specifically, what was kind of exciting for me, anyhow, was the fact that we could use the relationships that we've developed in Canada over the past 20 years with the AIR MILES program to introduce them to a different type of targeted marketing approach through the BrandLoyalty program. And sure enough, it went extremely well. And we are lined up, I mean, we'll probably do as much as $40 million or so in revs just from Canada next year. So as you think about the pilot, that's also kicking off in the U.S. in '16, and the size of the U.S., if Canada is any indication, this could be a business to be in going forward. 
Then finally, we have our coalition program, again, down in Brazil, called Dotz, and it continues to grow. I mean, the membership is up 20% to just under 18 million. We successfully launched in Rio, which was our big goal for the year. And it's growing. It's moving along nicely, and that is in spite of a really challenging environment down there. So we're kind of going to sit back and just, hopefully, watch this thing continue to move up at a double-digit pace. And as things stabilize down there the next couple of years, hopefully, we'll really start to see the flow through. But so far so good there. I think, overall, the businesses, the platforms within LoyaltyOne had a very strong year. 
Turning now to Epsilon. Again, I remind folks of what was the goal of Epsilon for the year. The biggest one at the sort of the core business itself was to find a way to have a sustainable model that flow to top line growth down to earnings or EBITDA cash flow. And that was a challenge for us over the past several years as we continue to see nice growth on the top line. But because of the hot skills and everything else required in our labor force and the heavy services aspect of the business, it got to be a challenge to actually flow that through to the bottom line. So for the first time, I think we feel comfortable that we have a sustainable model long term that will allow sort of the core Epsilon offerings. And again, these platforms are primarily -- these massive database and loyalty platforms that you see out there, the Citibank ThankYous and the Hilton HHonors and the Walgreens and stuff. That will allow us to show organic growth rate at about 2x or so GDP or roughly 5-ish, 6-ish percent, but actually have that flow down to earnings as well. And part of that solution was opening up our new office in India. And our new associates over there will be joined with an ever-growing group within North America as well, and we should have, I think, a nice balance on the growth side. So that was our #1 sort of goal. 
The next one was this sort of trail off that people have noticed over the past couple of years. In terms of revenue growth at Epsilon, it tended to start out strong and then sort of trailed off at the end of the year. We think also that this year was we had a very good momentum build as the year progressed. So Q2 was up 4%, that then moved to 5% in Q3, and we exited the year at 7%, all of which, I think, is -- it bodes well for 2016. 
We talked a little bit about our new associates that are joining us over in India. 
And then on the Conversant side, on the negative for sure, I think, on a full year basis. We were too optimistic that we could manage to transform the existing business and get the book of business with the cross-sell signed and get it up all and running. We certainly got over our skis on that one. However, after really tough first half of the year, we started to see the results of this effort. And I couldn't really be more pleased with how the year has turned out in terms of Q4, and how we're stepping off into 2016. 
As I've said before, I've likened it to changing a tire on a moving car. It's hard to do, and the teams did a wonderful job at finally getting it done. We took the pain early to make it right in the second half and for '16. And as Charles showed you, the revenue went from minus 6 in Q1 to minus 9 in Q2. It bounced all the way back to flat in Q3, and we stepped off the year at plus 6. 
On the EBITDA side. Again, it was a minus 6 in Q1. That bounced back a little bit faster. We got to flat in Q2 and plus 9 in Q3, and exiting the year at a plus 14. 
So in terms of a turn or the hockey stick that we've all seen out there, this one actually played out, which was kind of nice. And as importantly, as Charles also mentioned, the book of business, and what does that mean? What it means is that we -- when we sign a deal with Conversant, where we're going to be -- we're going to a -- let's say, a retailer and they're going to start supplying us with all their SKU level information, and we're going to be using that SKU to continue to develop models to go out and reach their consumers or others across the various digital channels. It's important that if we look at it and we basically say, okay, where we come, where we're going, what's the next step. And the critical thing here was -- I think, it was a very good marriage of the 2. Epsilon was a little bit light on having the scale it needed in the digital side. I think, Conversant on its own, would have had some challenges trying to compete with some of the larger players out there. You put it together and it seemed to actually have worked very well. And as a result, the book of business that we're looking at here, the vintage, when you signed these clients it's not unlike what happens in our card business, where it takes 2 or 3 years to fully realize the full run rate of these relationships. And as a result, we signed up book of up to $90 million of potential top line that would be additive to Conversant as these clients rollout over the next couple of years. We managed to see a lot of that start to come through in Q4. And what was very gratifying was the majority of these came through a collaboration between Conversant and big Epsilon enterprise clients, where we were allowed, able to get the Conversant folks into the Epsilon clients and between the 2 of them created the sales. I think we're very early in the game in terms of what we're looking to do. We believe across Epsilon, AIR MILES, BrandLoyalty and Card Services, there are about 500 enterprise clients where we have a very good in with the CMOs, and that's where we're going to be spending a lot of our time. And of those 500, we probably hit like 25 or 30 at this point, so a long way to go. Anyhow, I feel good about Conversant. 
And finally, Card Services, which continued to just have just a tremendous year. I kind of keep saying that. It seems like I keep saying it every year. But it continues to happen not only because of the offerings we're putting out there but also because of, again, the macro shift or the secular shift that's going on in how folks are spending. Again, think of this as another platform that also offers a liquidity tool. And what we did here is we continue to have a huge amount of demand from retailers, both traditional bricks and mortars as well as pure online, who are very interested, once again, in understanding who their consumer is and reaching out to them on a personalized basis. And to do that, we are the folks they trust to hold the SKU level information, both online, offline, purchase level SKU. And again, are you going to come to us to spend your digital dollars on search? Probably not. Or social? Probably not. But based on SKU level, you bet you, that's who we are, and that's sort of the uniqueness of the model that we have here. And so our credit sales, and that is actually using -- consumers using our card and spending on the cards. It was up over 30%, driving the portfolio of receivables up 30%, translating into revenue up 24%, and finally, through to cash flow about in the mid-teens. Obviously, a tremendous year. 
One of the things that continues to be very important in this business is tender share. We can have all sorts of great signings with new clients and everything else, but if you can grow the core, the folks who have been with you for many years, where you thought that we've kind of plateaued in terms of how much of each dollar spent at the retailer will go through our card. And we used to think it was somewhere in the high 20s, maybe 30%. Now we think that ceiling has been raised quite a bit. Our ability to reach out and personalize messaging to the various consumer groups out there has allowed us to continue to grow our share of spend at these retailers. And when you can grow 150 basis points at these core retailers, you're essentially, along with their growth, going to get your first 10% of growth in the portfolio, which used to be for us what everything together could get us. Then you throw in the new vintages that have been signed, that are the new clients over the past several years, they take 3 years to ramp up, and that is where you get your next 10% of growth. And so that's why a 20% type growth rate here, which if you ask me a few years ago, I would have said, I don't think that's a good long-term growth rate, probably more like 8% or 9%. But I've been proven wrong, fortunately, for a number of years here. 
We signed another $2 billion vintage of new clients from Toyota Lexus to Cornerstone to Wayfair to Farmers Insurance, Red Roof and Univision. Again, good names, and we have those folks up and running. 
And then finally, from the Credit quality perspective. All we are seeing is the typical seasoning you would see as you bring on a large amount of new business. It was also of note that the original guidance that Charles gave of mid-4% for the year, which was made well before we even started the year, we came in right on the button on that one. So you will continue to see these vintages normalize, and we are not seeing any evidence whatsoever of any type of distress on the part of the consumer. 
To wrap up '15, revenue, EBITDA, EPS, all up 20%. We know a tough microenvironment organic, which is the thing that I really focus in on. We try to do 3x GDP as our long-term model. If we could do like 8%, 9% a year, that'd be great. This past year, we did 11% or actually on a constant currency basis 15%, which was really gratifying to see. The dollar, which I think everyone under the sun is probably getting sick of hearing about, but just to put it in perspective, we grew the 20% or 11% organic, despite being hit with about $0.25 billion of FX top line headwind and about $0.50, so it knocked about 4 points off of growth. 
All that being said, let's now move into '16. We say goodbye to '15, and here we go. 2016 outlook. High single-digit growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA on a constant currency basis. That incorporates both BrandLoyalty and it incorporates our Canadian business. And if you were to break it down on a constant currency basis, you would look for BrandLoyalty, obviously, to be the one that shows the higher growth rate. We would expect another year of a double-double top in EBITDA type growth rate for BL and obviously, something less than that for the Canadian business. But we do want to see the Canadian business turn the corner and continue to start its growth mode. 
The big initiatives will be with BrandLoyalty. The North American expansion, we think, were very well placed in Canada. We want to see how the pilots go in the U.S., and we want to really make some headway in the U.S. and start that process going. That's a huge area of growth for us. 
Again, despite really a challenging macro environment in Canada, we do want to continue to see that mid-single-digit issuance growth, because that is what drives the success long term in the program. 
And in Brazil, as we talked about, we want to see double-digit growth in both membership and constant currency revenue. It continues. It's not part of our numbers that you see in our financials. We own 37%, but we continue to see it moving along. 
At Epsilon, if you were to sort of mix, again, Conversant and Epsilon together, you would see mid- to high single-digit growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA, I would say, Epi -- Epsilon should look a lot like this past year with sort of mid-single-digit top and bottom. Conversant will be different, where we expect to start seeing the high single-digits growth rate that we had been expecting long term. So everything looks pretty good there. We want to drive a minimum of another $70 million in cross-sell revenue at Conversant, and again, as we penetrate into Epsilon's core client base as well as into our Card group and elsewhere. 
All right. Turning to Card Services. Well, we expect another big year, up to 25% growth in the portfolio. We don't expect to slow down. We see things looking quite bright for the business for another year. Another year of double-digit revenue and EBITDA growth rate net of funding. We look again to sign another $2 billion vintage. And again, what that means is we sign a bunch of new clients, and over the course of 3 years their portfolios -- their combined portfolios would aggregate up to about $2 billion in new portfolio growth. So they're big numbers. But if I went back and I looked at the good old days of $300 million or $400 million used to be a big year. And then 2012, we signed our first $1 billion vintage, and then it was $2 billion '13, $2 billion in '14, $2 billion in '15, and we expect $2 billion in '16. So I certainly like the outlook for this business. 
All right. Getting questions about credit quality, the health of the consumer. Obviously, with some of the noise out there in the marketplace, what can we say? We stay very close to all of this. We have roughly 40 million active households that are in our programs, and we are seeing, again, no distress on the part of the consumer. So it looks like that's in pretty good shape. 
If you look at the actual loss rates that we're going to print, what you're looking at is you saw it go from roughly 4% to 4.5%. It will be about 5% in '16, and then in '17 we expect it to start to level off at about 5.5%, which we believe is the new normal. And so again, I think, we are going to be right on target in terms of the sort of 5 percenter for '15. Question being asked is why? Why is this drifting upwards? It's primarily -- it's kind of interesting. It's primarily due to the fact that when you had the Great Recession in '08, '09, you had massive amounts of charge-offs. And it took until 2014 to really clean up the backlog in terms of recoveries. And in our business, which is different from general purpose cards, recoveries are a huge part of what constitutes our loss rates. And in the post-recession time period, as people are getting back on their feet, we were actually recovering almost $0.35 on the dollar. And that from a net loss perspective is what kept the losses abnormally low. We've sort of passed that point at this stage, and it's beginning to normalize from 35% to more in the 20s, probably low 20s is where we'll net out. And if you moved from last year to this year, you will have seen the recoveries are coming down about 5 points, and as a result that turns into about 50 basis points less recovered on the losses. So it's not really the actual loss rate from a gross perspective going up 50 basis points, it means the net loss rate, that is lower recoveries that have normalized, that is really driving the net loss rate up about 50 basis points. So we don't see anything alarming there. It's a normalization process that happens in the Private Label business in a high-growth mode. The remainder tail of any type of drift upward will be the continued seasoning of the big vintages. 
The net story here is that, we believe our long-term normalized loss rate before the Great Recession was about 6.5%. Today, we're very comfortable that we're going to level out around 5.5%, probably sometime in '17, going into '18. The reason why it's a little bit lower is the fact that over the past half a dozen years or so, we've attracted a bit higher from a credit perspective quality-type consumer. When you bring on the Barneys and the Talbots and Bon-Ton of the world and then you have some co-brand mixed in, which carries a lower loss rate. So we think the 5.5% is about right. We're slowly marching towards that level, and we feel comfortable with our '16 guidance. 
I do want to address how it will play out sequentially. I think that's important, because you have seasonality in our business, which, again, is different from traditional cards that are out there. Q1 will tend to be our highest quarter. If you looked at last year, 2015, you jumped off from Q4 of '14 to Q1 of '15, and your losses jumped up about 70 basis points on a seasonal basis. We expect that exact same type behavior to take place in 2016. So you're going from sort of your high 4s at the end of -- or mid-4s at the end of '16 to sort of somewhere in your low 5s as a starting point. And then from a seasonality perspective, that starts actually to drift down as the year progresses and then flattens out in the back half. So that's how the seasonality works, and so no one is surprised. And as we talked about, we expect full normalization at around 5.5% as we move into '17. 
From a guidance perspective, to wrap up, we are maintaining our guidance. For the full year, we're not going to change that despite, I think, people's outlook, that has gotten a little bit more negative on the macro. We think we're in pretty good shape here. So constant currency basis, look at about 7.2 on top and $17 on the core EPS. That's 100% organic growth rate. We're using FX rates of 0.78 and 1.11 for the year. As it relates to Q1, we're looking at about 8% constant currency growth rate and about 5% from an actual print perspective. So that includes the FX headwinds of about $0.10. I think it will probably be a little bit less than that right now. We used FX rates of about $1.69 for the euro and Canadian respectively, and right now the euro is more like $1.09 and the Canadian dollar, $0.71. So I think that gap is closed somewhat. But look for of those types of numbers in Q1. 
Before we get asked the question, the big difference between this year and last year is the fact that last year Q1 is when BrandLoyalty, their programs all hit in the first quarter, and their earnings were up over 100% in Q1. And then we're down 50% in Q2, and that caused quite a bit of questioning in terms of how do you actually flow this thing out. It's tough on a quarterly basis. But what we're looking at here is rather than up 100% in Q1 and down 50% in Q2. You're going to see more like flat performance in BrandLoyalty in Q1. The big programs seem to be hitting in Q2. They've been signed up. We expect over 100% growth in Q2 this year. So by Q2, you should see that mid-teens growth return to earnings. So that's pretty much it. You've got some watch the bouncing ball in terms of the quarterly stuff. On an annualized basis, it looks pretty good. From a quality perspective, it looks pretty good. And I know the sentiment out there is fairly negative on the macro side. But what we're seeing in the businesses we're in would suggest another double-digit organic growth year for us. 
So that's it. I'm going to actually let Charles now talk, and we'll wrap it up and take questions. Questions? Operator?"

I guess first of all, do we have that right? And then that's pro forma for Conversant. And again, I think you mentioned first quarter's guide of 8% was really stepped down because of the timing year-over-year versus of where the BrandLoyalty results come in, right, first quarter versus second. Just make sure that the only difference. And then if that difference did not exist, what would your first quarter growth rate look like? I'm just curious.

And we were more like plus 8 to 10 at those core -- at those retailers. So the tender share stuff adds anywhere from 5 to 7 points of growth over and above what the retailers grow at. So if the retailers grow at nominal GDP plus the tender share, we feel pretty good that 10% -- first 10% of growth in the business is going to come from the core. It really seems like this tender share thing is for real. We've seen it now the past several years. And again, the more and more personalized we make the outreach to the consumer, the more effective it is. The more sales that are created, the better the retention of the consumer is. So I think we've got tender share at some of our folks that are over 50%. And if we're somewhere around 30-ish today, we've got a long way to go."

The shuffling or the competitive pressure that you're seeing is really on the co-brand side. That's where, let's say, you're running into the buzz saw of the big banks who are looking to grow balances. And the best way to grow balances is certainly not through Private Label, right? They're are tiny balances, but through the big co-brand balances. And so what we are seeing out that there is the pricing on co-brand deals, the big Visa, MasterCard balances, which are 5x, 6x what our Private Label balances are. It's getting incredibly competitive, and as a result we backed off in that area because we don't really need it. What you'll find is most of our co-brand stuff is an added product to an existing Private Label client. So to answer your question, the co-brand space is not an area where we think that the pricing makes sense. In terms of the Private Label stuff, that's where you get a lot more focus on the card being viewed as purely the loyalty tool, which gets into the data and the digital, and that's where you get the Conversant discussions beginning to come in and the Epsilon discussions. That's sort of our sweet spot. And the more assets we bring on the digital side, like a Conversant, the better off we are with those businesses. And frankly, the sale on the Private Label side is more a sale of developing a loyalty program with all the digital channels attached to it, and that's where we don't really run in the type of pricing issues that you're run in elsewhere, and that's where we're going to stay."

Canada looks rough as the mix shifts reduces the revenue per mile redeemed ergo it reduces our profitability. Epsilon, I think, we gave pretty good guidance. Mid-single-digit revenue and EBITDA growth seems solid. There could be a little opportunity there, so we get traction in our marketing tech, but I think that's sort of middle-of-the-road. Upsides are always if we deployed the buyback program, it takes our share count down. Upside will be we'll deploy our free cash flow and we buy small tuck-in acquisition that's immediately accretive.

Turning to Slide 2, we'll talk about the first quarter results, and they were pretty much as we expected, with the revenue up [ph] 5% to $1.68 billion and quarter [indiscernible] EPS of $3.84. It was a quarter with several positives but also a few negatives that tempered overall results. One of the negatives, foreign exchange rates, reduced both revenue end quarter EPS by about 2 points for the first quarter. The good news is that FX rates seem to have stabilized and the drag could drop to near zero in the back half of 2016.
Looking forward, we expect growth in each quarter to accelerate as 2016 progresses. Revenue growth of 5% in Q1 is expected to increase to 8% in Q2 and then double-digit growth in Q3 and Q4. Adjusted EBITDA and core EPS are expected to follow a similar trend. 
Now why do we believe this? Putting aside improving foreign-exchange comparables, there are several reasons. First, gross yield compression at Card Services should lessen each quarter as we anniversary several program changes made last year. Second, loss rates were expected to drift downward from first quarter highs. Third, BrandLoyalty has passed its most difficult comparable. If you remember in first quarter 2015, the revenue was up over 100% on a constant currency basis. 
Lastly, Epsilon's agency weakness should lessen, coupled with a record year end backlog per second half delivery. During the quarter, we acquired 2 million shares under our repurchase program for approximately $440 million. The buyback program remains our top capital allocation priority and we expect will be executed somewhat ratably over the remainder of 2016. Essentially, we will look to deploy our free cash flow while maintaining the leverage ratio of less than 3x.

LoyaltyOne had a better-than-expected quarter as revenue decreased 2% to $381 million, but adjusted EBITDA increased 10% to $85 million on a constant currency basis. Breaking it down further, at AIR MILES our revenue increased 4% and adjusted EBITDA increased a robust 11% on a constant currency basis, and that was driven by a favorable issuance mix and prudent cost controls. 
As expected at BrandLoyalty, revenue was down 9% on a constant currency basis due to program timing differences. Encouragingly, adjusted EBITDA increased 9% on a constant currency basis due to higher margin programs that were driving a 300 basis points expansion in adjusted EBITDA margins.
AIR MILES issued increased a robust 5% or 57 million miles over the same quarter from last year. Issuance was particularly strong with our financial vertical as we continue to convert BMO MasterCard holders to the Premium World Elite card that had a more compelling consumer proposition and a higher AIR MILES earn offer. This strong growth was achieved despite economic uncertainty in Western Canada that's a result of the declining global oil prices that has been negatively impacting activity at our grocery partners, and also the suspension of point issuance on prescriptions in British Columbia.
Looking ahead, we anticipate a 2% decline in issuance growth through the second quarter due to reduced promotional activity and the one-time conversion of the Sobeys legacy program that happened in 2015, which of course would not be repeated.
As we have stated previously, quarterly results can vary based on the timing of promotional activity, but our target remains a full year issuance growth of mid-single digits. 
AIR MILES redeemed increased 6% compared to the first quarter of 2015 with our AIR MILES cash program, that instant reward option, driving approximately half of the increase as its liquidity feature resonates with collectors in the current macro environment.
For the full year, we anticipate redemption growth to be in line with issuance growth. 
For the year, we anticipate full year constant currency revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth for AIR MILES to be in the mid-single digit range as well.
Now turning to BrandLoyalty. We anticipate a very strong second quarter whereby revenue could be up as much as 50% on a constant currency basis. On the North American expansion front, BrandLoyalty continues to increase its presence in Canada with sticks promotions that have been planned for 2016, and this represents a significant increase in sales over last year.
In addition, we launched our first pilot in the U.S. late in the first quarter. We were pleased with the results to date and look forward to additional programs in this market. The full year expectation for BrandLoyalty continues to be midteens growth in both revenue and adjusted EBITDA as compared to 2015 on a constant currency basis.
Lastly, let me update you on Dotz and Precima. Starting with Dotz, our Brazilian coalition program, where we continue to see steady growth in our collector based to over 18 million currently. In November of last year, Dotz successfully launched the coalition program in Rio de Janeiro with the [indiscernible] grocery banner called [indiscernible] as a key partner.
[indiscernible] is the third-largest grocery in Brazil and collector reception has been positive, with over 1 million collectors now enrolled and active in Rio. 
Precima, our data analytics unit, continues to fire on all cylinders, recently signing a deal with Morrison, one of the UK's top 4 grocers, where we will apply data intelligence and shopper insights to help Morrisons effectively apply their customer-centric retailing approach.
In closing, LoyaltyOne achieve solid Q1 results with a positive outlook for the remainder of 2016. I'd like to take this opportunity to congratulate the entire team on a great quarter and look forward to their commitment to our valued clients and to LoyaltyOne. Awesome job, everyone. Back to you, Charles."

Let's turn to Slide 4. Epsilon's revenue decreased 2% to $493 million and [indiscernible] decreased 22% to $81 million for the first quarter of 2016. Results in this segment were mixed at 3/4 of the business, digital and technology platform",1125,"Thanks, Bryan. Let's turn to Slide 4. Epsilon's revenue decreased 2% to $493 million and [indiscernible] decreased 22% to $81 million for the first quarter of 2016. Results in this segment were mixed at 3/4 of the business, digital and technology platforms grew at best 8% during the quarter, while the remaining 1/4, agency reforms where revenues declined by 23% versus the first quarter 2015. Adjusted EBITDA decreased $23 million from the first quarter of 2015, primarily due to higher payroll costs, staffing levels increase in anticipation of revenue that is yet to occur.
Before we dive into the individual portions, you see that we have a new reporting format here. We thought that the old formats which we talked about database and data support is really not reflective with the way we go with business these days. Specifically, is the broad portfolio of off-line, online services Epsilon delivers our package for bundle, omnichannel solutions, it just doesn't make sense for us to get into the format. So what we've done is we put this together and we're going to highlight 2 categories that represent the underlying services and assets deployed to serve our clients. 
The first category, digital and technology platforms, consists of businesses which primarily drives from revenues tied to one of the many core data or technology platforms that Epsilon can manage. These platforms are used to house and manage data in real-time, to analyze and model data, and to automate the usage of that data across a variety of channels, whether it be through our loyalty program within e-mail communication or an online message delivery on mobile or desktop devices.
The remainder of the business, agency media and services, consist of services which are primarily focus on supporting the agency sector. Both media services delivered agencies on behalf of their clients as well as agency engagements in which Epsilon acts as a primary agency directly on behalf of its clients.
Now let's turn to the digital and technology portion of this segment, where quarterly revenue grew by $28 [ph] million year-over-year or about 8% mostly due to continued success of the cross-sell efforts and on boarding of strong CRM backlog within Conversant. The products offered within the CRM business continued to resonate with both new and existing clients, as 50 new contract have already been signed this year versus 30, all of last year. The 2016 vintage thus far includes GMC, Brooks Brothers, Coach and Sears as a great follow-up to last year's efforts. These clients along with others such as Walgreens, are connecting with real people as a result of combining an automized first party with third-party data and $80 billion daily online interactions to develop a persistent consumer ID.
Moving on to agency media and services, revenue declined 23% from the first quarter of 2015. Perhaps launched Epsilon's traditional business, we see broad-based weakness, especially in the telco, CPG and retail verticals. In addition, the agency business to conversant which is the nondata driven traditional display business was down as large agencies push more programmatic buying due to internal platforms versus using third-party DSPs.
We don't know if this bubble is a bubble with an agency or more structural needs to play out as the year progresses. If it's structural, we have to be more aggressive going after cost cuts to maintain our earnings. Although it will likely continue to volatility within agency on a quarterly basis, it is our key part of the CMO selling process which attracts more broad and less IT-centric relationships.
Now let's go over to the next slide and talk about Card Services. Card Services delivered strong financial results, achieving a 17 consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Revenue increased 17% for the first quarter of 2016, driven by 27% increase in average receivables. Adjusted EBITDA net grew 9%, dampened slightly by the provision builds. Importantly, principal loss rates were 5.2% for the quarter, 10 basis points better than our original guidance.
Focusing on the key drivers for our growth. Credit sales increased a healthy 25%, driven by our proven ability to grow customer loyalty for both our long-standing and through its brand partners, as well as favorable weather and an early Easter. Our core business, brand partners with us for 4 years or more, continue to contribute roughly half of our credit sales growth. Importantly, we continue to grow tender share, up over 200 basis points for the first quarter by leveraging our large understanding of our brands along with the deep data analytics we bring to bear.
Most of the tender share pickup is being driven the card members have been engage with their card for multiple years, not from new accounts. In other words, these are tenured cardmembers with a proven spending and payment history and they are demonstrating increased spend with the brands they love. This is a testament to the power of our customized marketing programs and the value they deliver to our long-standing partners. It's also a key differentiator and critical element in our ability to welcome new partners.
Looking at the remaining drivers of our performance, we talked about revenue grew 17% driven by the strong air [ph] growth. importantly, we really strong operating expense leverage as we are able to chop our expense ratio by 70 bps during the quarter. 
As expected, gross yields experience some compression driven primarily by brand mix, accounting for acquired files and lower late fees as we obtain several declined for several months in our first stage delinquency bucket. This pressure is predominantly in the first half of the year, and we expect the yields to normalize as we anniversary these guidance.
Managing losses was key in the first quarter, and we exceeded guidance previously outlined. Losses delinquency levels and  [indiscernible] in line were both expectations and seasonal trends. During the quarter, we decided not to renew card programs for renewal at [indiscernible]. The related receivables net of the allowance for loan loss has been reclassified to assets held for sale at March 31, 2016. Accordingly, $430 million has been removed from card receivables and $15 [ph] million has been removed from the allowance for loan loss. 
Our reserve for loan losses was 5.7% of reservable receivables at March 31, 2016, up from 5.5% at December 31, 2015. Reserve dollars dropped by $15 million from December 31, due to the reclassification previously discussed. 
In closing for Card Services, we delivered another stellar quarter with all the key metrics outpacing the industry and consistent with our expectations. We are positioned for another record year in line with our strategy of 20% plus credit sales and AR growth, leveraging both organic growth and new partnerships.
With that, I'll turn it over to Ed."
24604,329506026,960523,"Alliance Data Systems Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Bread Financial Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, guys.

When we turn to first quarter scorecard and the goal, of course, is to have more greens than yellows and reds, and right now, we're tracking with 30 being green. I would say in terms of Q1 a couple of general comments, one is, as Charles mentioned, this was obviously our toughest quarter. Comp versus last year was very difficult. And putting in a plus 5 top, plus 5 earnings, was right on the money of what we wanted to do. And our view into the rest of the year looks solid. So it's good to get that behind us.
Also, you'll find that it was kind of a mixed bag in terms of what it got us from A to B. But at the end, the pluses sort of outweighed the minuses and we got where we wanted to be.
As we move into the second quarter and the rest of the year, things are accelerating nicely. We have a good line of sight into the rest of the year. From our first quarter perspective, consolidated, we came right in where we said in terms of guidance at about $1.7 billion top and about $384 million [ph] on earnings. That was -- that included getting hit on the FX side with about $26 million in top and about $0.05 [ph] on earnings from FX, which, if it holds, will fortunately start to anniversary as we move into the back half. 
We talked about the toughest comp of the years now behind us, and we were pretty active in the buyback, taking in a bunch of shares which we thought were pretty cheap.
So overall consolidated, we got where we wanted to be and remain on track for the year in Card Services. Just the highlights, of course, the portfolio continues to grow very quickly, with over 20% growth, revenue in the high teens. And then obviously, due to the fact that we're growing so quickly, we need to obviously set up reserves and that tends to be a damper on EBITDA. Nonetheless, they grow 9%. 
Yields get the yellow, it was a little over 200 basis points due to multiple factors that we can talk about. Again, the good news there is that it's already beginning to burn away, and we expect less compression as each quarter goes by for the year, and we have pretty good visibility into that as well. So more of a Q1 issue. 
The loss rate, we spent the first 3 months of the year here dealing with 2 questions that people were spooked about, the first being credit quality, and the second being Canada going into a depression. And what's interesting is those are the 2 items that probably performed best during the quarter. Credit quality actually came in a little bit better than we had anticipated. We now expect it to drift downwards as the year progresses from a seasonally high Q1. And similar to what we said 3 months ago, we'll say the same thing now. We check with our collectors and everyone else. There is 0 pressure that we're seeing coming in, that would suggest that there's any type of stress on the consumer at this point. So we're just not seeing it. We didn't see it before. And again, we're just normalizing the loss rates in the file, which right now we're tracking nicely to that.
I will emphasize the next point which is tender share. That's often lost in all these discussions about growth and are you growing too fast, too strongly, how are you growing? Is it good quality, bad quality and all that other stuff. Tender share is up 200 basis points, which means if 30% of the sales at a retailer were on our card a year ago, now it's 32%. And that is not being moved by putting on a bunch of new accounts. And in fact, what it essentially means is that when the retailers growing 2%, 3%, we're growing 10%. And so the first 10 points of portfolio growth are coming from a deeper penetration of that retailer sales base. And the next bullet point to me really brings it home that 80% of this tender share again, they're coming from the mature accounts. They're coming from accounts that have been with us for 20, 24 months or more, which means they passed the peak sort of loss point. And they're very mature. And our ability to get in there and motivate incremental spend is really what it's all about. That's the data-driven targeted marketing. And I think that's probably the most important take away is that this is not coming from a bunch of whole new accounts or changing underwriting or anything like that. It's coming from driving those very long term loyal customers to visit more often and spend a bit more on each visit. So that continues to work out well. The pipeline, we expect another year of $2 billion in new vintages. We have a bunch that have been signed, haven't been released and will be released over the next couple of quarters. So the pipeline looks good. 
And as we move to Epsilon on the next page, that's where we run into probably, if you were to ask me, about where the concern is for the year. It's certainly not on the credit side. It's certainly not on the Canadian side. It's certainly not on the technology and data and digital sides of Epsilon Conversant. We are focused, however, on some weakness on the agency side, which is about 1/4 of Epsilon Conversant. And what we saw there was another general pullback in a number of verticals. And we're going to watch that carefully, as Charles said. We don't know whether it's just a result of CMOs taking a breather in the first quarter given the turmoil or whether that's more structural. In any event, if it is structural, we will make sure that earnings will remain on track, which means we'd have to focus on the expense side. 
But we don't know right now, and we're not going to need your opinion at this point. 
On the other side of it, the digital and technology platform stuff, up 8%. That's 3 quarters of Epsilon Conversant. And we continue to see very, very strong take up in terms of the data-driven targeted display offerings from Conversant. The number of wins that we're seeing right now are already half [ph] of what they were for the entire year last year. And then from an expense perspective and flexibly perspective, our India [ph] office is up and running. And we're hopefully continuing to staff that up as the year progresses, the metal finally beginning to move the needle on the expense side towards the latter part of the year. 
LoyaltyOne, I think Bryan covered that. Obviously, BrandLoyalty is a very choppy business. It had a -- frankly a little bit better Q1 from the EBITDA perspective than we have initially talked about. But recall last year, Q1 was when revenue was up 100%. So it was then down in Q2. This year, it will be more of the reverse where you'll have a very strong Q2 for BrandLoyalty, and it's all driven by when the grosses have decided to put their programs on the calendar.
Bryan have talked about the BrandLoyalty expansion into North America. Canada is doing quite well and moving nicely towards our goal there. And the U.S. actually we're beginning to make some nice inroads there as well. So good news on that front. 
Again, the concern on the AIR MILES side in Canada was net issuance would fall off as consumer spend was weak. What we found was the reverse, which was issuance was very strong and specifically issuance from the financial services space, which had been lagging before actually came back quite strongly. So it looks like Canada is still alive and kicking and doing quite well.
Revenue and EBITDA, plus 4, plus 11, frankly on a constant currency basis was the best we've seen in years. And so it looks like the business up there is back in growth mode. 
Overall, for those of you who have covered ADS for a number of years, it's kind of a typical ADS quarter. You've got a bunch of things that went a little bit better than expected. You had some things that weren't worse than expected. And the end result is they kind of even out and we meet or we beat our guidance. And that's pretty much been on our track record for the last 15 years. We expect that to be the case going forward as well.
If you look at it in the Cards group, the yields were a little bit worse than we have anticipated, but losses were a little bit better. And then at Epsilon, at digital and tech platforms, remained on track. We talked about agency and media was a weak, That was offset by the fact that LoyaltyOne, that AIR MILES was better, our BrandLoyalty was tracking. So again, looking at us, you can pick and choose whatever data points you want. But at the end of the day, the pluses and minuses, hopefully, even out to get to a double-digit growth rate for the year. And as we turn to our full year guidance, that's exactly what we're saying. It's very straightforward. Now with Q1 behind us, we have even a higher level of confidence on how the rest of the year is going to play out. And we feel very comfortable reiterating our full year guidance of revenue of 7 [ph] 1 [ph], up 10% of earnings of 16 75 [ph], up 11%. And the nice thing about it is the slowest quarter is behind us. We're going to ramp up to high single digits in the second quarter, and then we'll do double-digit top and bottom Q3, double-digit top and bottom in Q4, and that will give us a nice jump off into 2017. Visibility is quite strong. 
Q2 guidance rests around $1.6 billion [ph], up 8%. And earnings, also up about 8%. i think those are good numbers to start the acceleration.
From a Card Services perspective, you'll see the principal loss rate forecast that we gave a while ago. And lo and behold, it seems to be playing out at that level, if not just a smidge better, which is good. We expect for the year Card Services to once again deliver double-digit growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA net of funding. 
Yield compression, which I'm sure we'll get some questions on, will lessen each quarter as the year progresses, so that we wind up at the end of the year with a very modest impression, which is how we want to take it into '17. And then I always said the pipeline is very robust, and that will get into a little bit about our decisions around who to renew, when to renew, at what levels will we renew clients, given that there's a certain amount of capital we want to put into the business, but we want to maintain it sort of a 20 plus growth rate in the file, and that means maybe our capital is better spent on other areas and we don't renew certain folks. 
So that's where we are on Epsilon. We talked about digital and tech platforms are 3 cores of the business. We expect that to continue clipping along in the high single digits. The signings for the Conversant CRM vintage, if you recall last year, was about 30 wins and a very strong vintage signing of 80-ish plus. Once they fully pull up, we expect to lease that this year, if not a bit better, which will be great. And now the agency is we're going to watch it and we're going to see the people-intensive business. It's in about a quarter of Epsilon Conversant. From what we're seeing, it looks soft, but it looks already like it's lessening in terms of the softness as we progress into Q2 and the rest of the year.
Okay. Last slide full year. LoyaltyOne, BrandLoyalty, Q2 is the big one for them. So expect a very, very strong double-digit rev in EBITDA. And then in AIR MILES, we remain comfortable that issuance, which is the key metric there, that's how we get paid, is going to be about 4% for the year, which will drive on a constant currency basis low single-digit revs, and EBITDA full year, which again would fly in the face of sort of the weakening consumer in Canada.
Overall, as I mentioned, several moving pieces, but full year is shaping up nicely. We are seeing zero stress on the consumer side. We are not seeing weakness in Canada. So those 2 data points are consistent with last quarter and the quarter before that. I just would talk a little bit about the model itself for Alliance. From 2007 through 2015, we produced annual growth rates of 15% and 18% for revenue and earnings per share, respectively, every single year. And for '16 and '17, as losses normalize and with the huge growth in the file, we're setting aside reserves for future losses, which are essentially doing knocking that growth rate down a bit. But you're still looking at low end double-digit growth rates and top and bottom. So this year, we're looking at 10 [ph] and 11 [ph], and that includes some drag from FX. And then in '18, if, in fact we're right and these rates have stabilized, then there's no reason to doubt that it would snap right back to the prior model and need to have a reacceleration in the growth rate.
So if you look at long-term for the company, you're looking somewhere midteens to high teens rev and core EPS. Then when you're in a period of normalization and building reserves, you're probably looking at low end, top and bottom double digits. And then you snap back to sort of midteens when that normalizes. So overall, not too shabby as a model. You'll also find with us that we tend to have different levers in different businesses cycle up and down at different times. But overall, the model holds together quite nicely. 
For guidance on the last slide, we're keeping at the same, and we're not going to spend a lot of time going through the this and that's of how we get there. But it looks pretty solid at plus 10%, plus 11%. And that puts our organic growth rate actually quite a bit above our 3x GDP target. We look at cash flow, looks very nice. Very strong this year at $1.4 billion. And when it comes to FX and all that other stuff, we'll adjust when it becomes meaningful as the year plays out. But again, we're not going to be tweaking everything every quarter. We're going to try to get this thing going on a consolidated basis.
So that's all I have. Why don't we open it up for Q&A? Q&A. Operator?"

Frankly, there's a whole bunch of business out there. And there are times in the past where we've had some clients who decided not to pour all their energy and efforts into driving tender share growth and card growth. It usually comes with the change in management. Other times, it's a change in strategy. And normally, we just sort of said that's fine. We'll go with the flow. Right now, we're dealing with how do we allocate our capital? If we want to continue to grow the business, the other file, 20-plus percent for the year, how do we maintain the type of returns that we expect. And frankly, there are a couple of programs there that based upon, how do we say it? The comments being made about the dollars that folks are willing to put into it, and the direction of those businesses, it didn't look like the best use of our capital. And so we've reallocated that capital to a couple of wins that we think are, I think, more down the stairway for us. So it's a nice -- I'm trying the polite way of saying there's going to be sometimes where the capital is better used elsewhere, and this is one of those times.

The fact that as we talked about the bulk of our growth, the 10% in the core growth is really coming from accounts that are very mature, have been well seasoned, well pass the peak charge-offs cycle. We are normalizing the loss rate. I think may be 2 more staff might be helpful, which is look before the Great Recession, our normalized loss rate was 6.5%. We're seeing it's 5.5% now. Why is that? Why are we comfortable that that's our long term run rate? And that's what we're normalizing towards. Probably a couple of interesting stats there. One is the new mix of co-brand which carries a higher scoring customer as well as some of the higher end type retailers that have joined us, we're attracting cardholders that tend to skew a little bit higher on the credit spectrum. So for example, if you were to compare all of our active account today versus 2007, the scores today on average are higher than they were in 2007, even with some of a lot of the accounts that we've added recently. So from an active account basis, the average score is higher. Also if you look at it from a balanced perspective, the average score per balance today is higher than it was in 2007. And so you put those 2 together and that's how you get to -- we're not going to normalize out of 6.5%, we're going to normalize out of 5.5%. But look, it's not like we're trying to keep it lower. The fact is you give up some yields by not being at higher loss rates. So I'm not sure it's a strategy of ours to keep it at 5.5%. It's just the way the file is playing out right now."

If you look at the breakdown, it was weakness in both categories. We saw weakness in traditional agency for Epsilon where we saw weakness in across many verticals. I couldn't pinpoint any one client because it was broad-based. On the Conversant side, on the traditional display, we've definitely seen pure people trying to use our private exchange. You've got the big agencies trying to push the client into their own trading platforms. So regardless of the quality, the impressions we can provide, they're trying to stuff it through the old system, we saw a general pull back there. So that was a little bit unexpected. So I'd say it was both sides of it.

A large chunk of it, probably half of it, relates to what I call consumer-friendly programs, which I probably should find. It basically is we look at all of our practices, and basically said how do we continue to see the premium provider in the marketplace, the most customer friendly provider in the marketplace as we continue to ramp up? And so there's a bunch of things that we put in place as we went into back capital of last year. So for example, it doesn't seem like a lot, but it does move the needle in terms of if someone gets paid on the 15th of each month, but their balance is due on the 13th, well that doesn't work out all that well sometimes. So what we've done is we've given everyone the right to move their due date to later on in the month, if they wanted to. And that, again, it doesn't seem like much, but it actually does affect the late fees. But at the same time, and also helps our OpEx as you see with the leverage because we have much lower talk time of people coming off, calling on, saying hey, we need a couple more days. So you have that. You have people who are calling in where there used to be a fee if you're paying by the phone. We decided that wasn't best practices. We took that out as well. And so we just took a number of things out of the system that frankly cost more grief than they added. We got a lot of it back in lower OpEx in terms of lower talk time and everything else and we have a much happier client and customer base. And so I think that's sort of what it is. None of it was dictated by any regulatory authority. It was something we proactively went out and just did. We think we're taking the hit now for it, and seeing it anniversary in the back half is probably the best thing to do. Hopefully, that will pay dividends down the line."

Turning to Slide 2, I will talk about the first quarter results, and they were pretty much as we expected, with revenue up 5% to $1.68 billion and core EPS up 5% at $3.84.

Turning to Slide 2, I will talk about the first quarter results, and they were pretty much as we expected, with revenue up 5% to $1.68 billion and core EPS up 5% at $3.84. It was a quarter with several positives but also a few negatives that tempered overall results. One of the negatives, foreign exchange rates, reduced both revenue and core EPS by about 2 points for the first quarter. The good news is that FX rates seem to have stabilized and the drag could drop to near zero in the back half of 2016.
Looking forward, we expect growth in each quarter to accelerate as 2016 progresses. Revenue growth of 5% in Q1 is expected to increase to 8% in Q2 and then double-digit growth in Q3 and Q4. Adjusted EBITDA and core EPS are expected to follow a similar trend. 
Now why do we believe this? Putting aside improving foreign-exchange comparables, there are several reasons. First, gross yield compression at Card Services should lessen each quarter as we anniversary several program changes made last year. Second, loss rates were expected to drift downward from first quarter highs. Third, BrandLoyalty has passed its most difficult comparable. If you remember in the first quarter 2015, the revenue was up over 100% on a constant currency basis. 
Lastly, Epsilon's agency weakness should lessen, coupled with a record year-end backlog for second half delivery. During the quarter, we acquired 2 million shares under our repurchase program for approximately $440 million. The buyback program remains our top capital allocation priority, and we expect will be executed somewhat ratably over the remainder of 2016. Essentially, we will look to deploy our free cash flow, while maintaining the leverage ratio of less than 3x.
With that, let's go to the next slide and Bryan will walk you through the Q1 results."

LoyaltyOne had a better-than-expected quarter as revenue decreased 2% to $381 million, but adjusted EBITDA increased 10% to $85 million on a constant currency basis. Breaking it down further, at AIR MILES our revenue increased 4% and adjusted EBITDA increased a robust 11% on a constant currency basis, and that was driven by a favorable issuance mix and prudent cost controls. 
As expected at BrandLoyalty, revenue was down 9% on a constant currency basis due to program timing differences. Encouragingly, adjusted EBITDA increased 9% on a constant currency basis due to higher margin programs that were driving a 300 basis points expansion in adjusted EBITDA margins.
AIR MILES issued increased a robust 5% or 57 million miles over the same quarter from last year. Issuance was particularly strong with our financial vertical as we continue to convert BMO MasterCard holders through the Premium World Elite card that has a more compelling consumer proposition and a higher AIR MILES earn offer. This strong growth was achieved despite economic uncertainty in Western Canada that's the result of the declining global oil prices that has been negatively impacting activity at our grocery partners, and also the suspension of point issuance on prescriptions in British Columbia.
Looking ahead, we anticipate a 2% decline in issuance growth through the second quarter due to reduced promotional activity and the onetime conversion of the Sobeys legacy program that happened in 2015, which of course would not be repeated.
As we have stated previously, quarterly results can vary based on the timing of promotional activity, but our target remains a full year issuance growth of mid-single digits. 
AIR MILES redeemed increased 6% compared to the first quarter of 2015, with our AIR MILES cash program, that the instant reward option, driving approximately half of the increase as its liquidity feature resonates with collectors in the current macro environment.
For the full year, we anticipate redemption growth to be in line with issuance growth. 
For the year, we anticipate full year constant currency revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth for AIR MILES to be in the mid-single-digit range as well.
Now turning to BrandLoyalty. We anticipate a very strong second quarter whereby revenue could be up as much as 50% on a constant currency basis. On the North American expansion front, BrandLoyalty continues to increase its presence in Canada, with sticks promotions that have been planned for 2016, and this represents a significant increase in sales over last year.
In addition, we launched our first pilot in the U.S. late in the first quarter. We were pleased with the results to date and look forward to additional programs in this market. The full year expectation for BrandLoyalty continues to be mid-teens growth in both revenue and adjusted EBITDA as compared to 2015 on a constant currency basis.
Lastly, let me update you on Dotz and Precima. Starting with Dotz, our Brazilian coalition program, where we continue to see steady growth in our collector base to over 18 million currently. In November of last year, Dotz successfully launched the coalition program in Rio de Janeiro with the Cencosud grocery banner called Prezunic as a key partner.
Cencosud is the third-largest grocer in Brazil and collector reception has been positive, with over 1 million collectors now enrolled and active in Rio. 
Precima, our data analytics unit, continues to fire on all cylinders, recently signing a deal with Morrisons, one of the UK's top 4 grocers, where we will apply data intelligence and shopper insights to help Morrisons more effectively apply their customer-centric retailing approach.
In closing, LoyaltyOne achieve solid first quarter results with a positive outlook for the remainder of 2016.

Let's turn to Slide 4. Epsilon's revenue decreased 2% to $493 million and adjusted EBITDA decreased 22% to $81 million for the first quarter of 2016. Results in this segment were mixed at 3/4 of the business, digital and technology platform",1141,"Thanks, Bryan. Let's turn to Slide 4. Epsilon's revenue decreased 2% to $493 million and adjusted EBITDA decreased 22% to $81 million for the first quarter of 2016. Results in this segment were mixed at 3/4 of the business, digital and technology platforms grew a best 8% during the quarter, while the remaining 1/4, agency reforms, where the revenues declined by 23% versus the first quarter 2015. Adjusted EBITDA decreased $23 million from the first quarter of 2015, primarily due to higher payroll costs, staffing levels increased in anticipation of revenue that is yet to occur.
Before we dive into the individual portions, you see that we have a new reporting format here. We thought that the old formats where we just talked about database and data and support really is not reflective of the way we go to business these days. Specifically, is the broad portfolio of off-line, online services Epsilon delivers our package for bundled, omnichannel solutions, it just doesn't make sense for us to give it to you in that format. So what we've done is we put this together. We're going to highlight 2 categories that represent the underlying services and assets deployed to serve our clients. 
The first category, digital and technology platforms, consists of businesses which is primarily derived from revenues tied to one of the many core data and our technology platforms that Epsilon and Conversant manage. These platforms are used to house and manage data in real-time, to analyze and model data, and to automate usage of that data across a variety of channels, whether it be through a loyalty program within e-mail communication or an online message delivered on mobile or desktop devices.
The remainder of the business, agency media and services, consist of services which are primarily focused on supporting the agency sector. Both media services delivered to agencies on behalf of their clients as well as agency engagements in which Epsilon acts as the primary agency directly on behalf of its clients.
Now let's turn to the digital and technology portion of this segment, where quarterly revenue grew by $28 million year-over-year or about 8% mostly due to continued success of the cross-sell efforts and on-boarding of the strong CRM backlog within Conversant. The products offered within the CRM business continue to resonate with both new and existing clients, as 50 new contracts have already been signed this year versus 30, all of last year. The 2016 vintage thus far includes GNC, Brooks Brothers, Coach and Sears is a great follow-up to last year's efforts. These clients along with others such as Walgreens, are connecting with real people as a result of combining an automized first party with third-party data and $80 billion daily online interactions to develop a persistent consumer ID.
Moving on to agency media and services, revenue declined 23% from the first quarter of 2015. For Epsilon's traditional agency business, we saw broad-based weakness, especially in the telco, CPG and retail verticals. In addition, the agency business are conversant which is the nondata-driven traditional display business was down as large agencies push more programmatic buying through their internal trading platforms versus using third-party DSPs.
We don't know if this bubble is a bubble with an agency or more structural. It needs to play out as the year progresses. If it's structural, we have to be more aggressive on going after cost cuts to maintain our earnings. Although it will likely continue to see volatility within the agency on a quarterly basis, it is a key part of the CMO selling process which attracts more broad and less IT-centric relationships.
Now let's go over to the next slide and talk about Card Services. Card Services delivered strong financial results, achieving a 17th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Revenue increased 17% for the first quarter of 2016, driven by 27% increase in average receivables. Adjusted EBITDA net grew 9%, dampened slightly by the provision builds. Importantly, principal loss rates were 5.2% for the quarter, 10 basis points better than our original guidance.
Focusing on the key drivers for our growth. Credit sales increased a healthy 25%, driven by our proven ability to grow customer loyalty for both our long standing and through its brand partners as well as favorable weather and an early Easter. Our core business, brand partners with us from 4 years or more, continues to contribute roughly half of our credit sales growth. Importantly, we continue to grow tender share, up over 200 basis points for the first quarter by leveraging our large understanding of our brands along with the deep data analytics we bring to bear.
Most of the tender share pickup is being driven by card members, who have been engage with their card for multiple years, not from new accounts. In other words, these are tenured cardmembers with a proven spending and payment history and they are demonstrating increased spend with the brands they love. This is a testament to the power of our customized marketing programs and the value they deliver to our long-standing partners. It's also a key differentiator and critical element in our ability to welcome new partners.
Looking at the remaining drivers of our performance, we talked about revenue grew 17% driven by the strong AR growth. Importantly, we really have strong operating expense leverage as we are able to drop our expense ratio by 70 bps for the quarter. 
As expected, gross yields are experiencing some compression driven primarily by brand mix, accounting for acquired files and lower late fees as we obtain several declines for several months in our first stage delinquency bucket. This pressure is predominantly in the first half of the year, and we expect yields to normalize as we anniversary these items.
Managing losses was key in the first quarter, and we exceeded guidance previously outlined. Losses, delinquency levels and funding costs were all in line with both expectations and seasonal trends. During the quarter, we decided not to renew 2 card programs for renewal at year-end. The related receivables net of the allowance for loan loss have been reclassified to assets held for sale at March 31, 2016. Accordingly, $430 million has been removed from card receivables and $15 million has been removed from the allowance for loan loss. 
Our reserve for loan losses was 5.7% of receivables at March 31, 2016, up from 5.5% at December 31, 2015. Reserve dollars dropped by $15 million from December 31, due to the reclassification previously discussed. 
In closing for Card Services, we delivered another stellar quarter, with all the key metrics outpacing the industry and consistent with our expectations. We are positioned for another record year in line with our strategy of 20% plus credit sales and AR growth, leveraging both organic growth and new partnerships.
With that, I'll turn it over to Ed."
24604,329506026,960893,"Alliance Data Systems Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Bread Financial Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, guys.

I would say in terms of Q1 a couple of general comments, one is, as Char",2533,"Great. Thanks, guys. When we turn to first quarter scorecard and the goal, of course, is to have more greens than yellows and reds, and right now, we're tracking with 30 being green. I would say in terms of Q1 a couple of general comments, one is, as Charles mentioned, this was obviously our toughest quarter. Comp versus last year was very difficult. And putting in a plus 5 top, plus 5 earnings, was right on the money of what we wanted to do. And our view into the rest of the year looks solid. So it's good to get that behind us.
Also, you'll find that it was kind of a mixed bag in terms of what it got us from A to B. But at the end, the pluses sort of outweighed the minuses and we got where we wanted to be.
As we move into the second quarter and the rest of the year, things are accelerating nicely. We have a good line of sight into the rest of the year. From our first quarter perspective, consolidated, we came right in where we said in terms of guidance at about $1.7 billion top and about $384 million on earnings. That was -- that included getting hit on the FX side, with about $26 million in top and about $0.05 on earnings from FX, which, if it holds, will fortunately start to anniversary as we move into the back half. 
We talked about the toughest comp of the year's now behind us, and we were pretty active in the buyback, taking in a bunch of shares which we thought were pretty cheap.
So overall consolidated, we got where we wanted to be and remain on track for the year in Card Services. Just the highlights, of course, the portfolio continues to grow very quickly, with over 20% growth, revenue in the high teens. And then obviously, due to the fact that we're growing so quickly, we need to obviously set up reserves and that tends to be a damper on EBITDA. Nonetheless, they did grow 9%. 
Yields gets the yellow. It was a little over 200 basis points due to multiple factors that we can talk about. Again, the good news there is that it's already beginning to burn away, and we expect less compression as each quarter goes by for the year, and we have pretty good visibility into that as well, so more of a Q1 issue. 
The loss rate, we spent the first 3 months of the year here, dealing with 2 questions that people were spooked about. The first being credit quality, and the second being Canada going into a depression. And what's interesting is those are the 2 items that probably performed best during the quarter. Credit quality actually came in a little bit better than we had anticipated. We now expect it to drift downwards as the year progresses from a seasonally high Q1. And similar to what we said 3 months ago, we'll say the same thing now. We check with our collectors and everyone else. There is 0 pressure that we're seeing coming in that would suggest that there's any type of stress on the consumer at this point. So we're just not seeing it. We didn't see it before. And again, we're just normalizing the loss rates in the file, which right now we're tracking nicely to that.
I will emphasize the next point which is tender share. That's often lost in all these discussions about growth and are you growing too fast, too slowly, how are you growing? Is it good quality, bad quality and all that other stuff. Tender share is up 200 basis points, which means if 30% of the sales at a retailer were on our card a year ago, now it's 32%. And that is not being moved by putting on a bunch of new accounts. And in fact, what it essentially means is that when the retailers growing 2%, 3%, we're growing 10%. And so the first 10 points of portfolio growth are coming from a deeper penetration of that retailer sales base. And the next bullet point to me really brings it home that 80% of this tender share gained, they're coming from the mature accounts. They're coming from accounts that have been with us for 20, 24 months or more, which means they passed the peak sort of loss point, and they're very mature. And our ability to get in there and motivate incremental spend is what it's all about. And that's the data-driven targeted marketing. And I think that's probably the most important takeaway is that this is not coming from tossing on a whole bunch of new accounts or changing, underwriting or anything like that. It's coming from driving those very long-term loyal customers to visit more often and spend a bit more on each visit. So that continues to work out well. The pipeline, we expect another year of $2 billion in new vintages. We have a bunch that have been signed, haven't been released and they will be released over the next couple of quarters. So the pipeline looks good. 
And as we move to Epsilon on the next page, that's where we run into probably, if you were to ask me, about where the concern is for the year. It's certainly not on the credit side. It's certainly not on the Canadian side. It's certainly not on the technology and data and digital sides of Epsilon Conversant. We are focused, however, on some weakness on the agency side, which is about 1/4 of Epsilon Conversant. And what we saw there was sort of a general pullback in a number of the verticals. And we're going to watch that carefully, as Charles said. We don't know whether that's just a result of CMOs taking a breather in the first quarter, given the turmoil or whether that's more structural. In any event, if it is structural, we will make sure that earnings will remain on track, which means we'd have to focus on the expense side. 
But we don't know right now, and we're not going to need your take at this point. 
On the other side of it, the digital and technology platform stuff, up 8%. That's 3 quarters of Epsilon Conversant. And we continue to see very, very strong take up in terms of the data-driven targeted display offerings from Conversant. The number of wins that we're seeing right now are already half of what they were for the entire year last year. And then from an expense perspective and flexibly perspective, our India office is up and running. And we are hopefully continuing to staff that up as the year progresses, and that will finally begin to move the needle on the expense side towards the latter part of the year. 
LoyaltyOne, I think Bryan covered that. Obviously, BrandLoyalty is a very choppy business. It had a -- frankly a little bit better Q1 from the EBITDA perspective than we had initially talked about. But recall last year, Q1 was when revenue was up 100%. So it was then down in Q2. This year, it will be more of the reverse where you'll have a very strong Q2 for BrandLoyalty, and it's all driven by when the grosses have decided to put the programs on the calendar.
Bryan also talked about the BrandLoyalty expansion into North America. Canada is doing quite well and moving nicely towards our goal there. And the U.S. actually we're beginning to make some nice inroads there as well. So good news on that front. 
Again, the concern on the AIR MILES side in Canada was the issuance would fall off as consumer spend was weak. What we found was the reverse, which was issuance is very strong and specifically, issuance in the financial services space, which had been lagging before actually came back quite strongly. So it looks like Canada is still alive and kicking, and doing quite well.
Revenue and EBITDA, plus 4, plus 11, frankly on a constant currency basis was the best we've seen in years. And so it looks like the business up there is back in growth mode. 
Overall, for those of you who have covered ADS for a number of years, it's kind of a typical ADS quarter. You've got a bunch of things that went a little bit better than expected. You had some things that went worse than expected. And the end result is they kind of even out, and we meet or we beat our guidance. And that's pretty much been our track record for the last 15 years. We expect that to be the case going forward as well.
If you look at it in the Cards group, the yields were a little bit worse than we had anticipated, but losses were a little bit better. And then at Epsilon, the digital and tech platforms remained on track. We talked about agency and media was weak. That was offset by the fact in LoyaltyOne that AIR MILES was better, our BrandLoyalty was tracking. So again, looking at us, you can pick and choose whatever data points you want. But at the end of the day, the pluses and minuses, hopefully, even out to get to a double-digit growth rate for the year. And as we turn to our full year guidance, that's exactly what we're saying. It's very straightforward. Now with Q1 behind us, we have even a higher level of confidence on how the rest of the year is going to play out. And we feel very comfortable reiterating our full year guidance of revenue of $7.1 billion, up 10% and earnings of $16.75, up 11%. And the nice thing about it is the slowest quarter is behind us. We're going to ramp up to high single digits in the second quarter, and then we'll do double-digit top and bottom Q3, double-digit top and bottom in Q4, and that will give us a nice jump off into 2017. Visibility is quite strong. 
Q2 guidance revs around $1.6 billion, up 8%. And earnings, also up about 8%. I think those are good numbers to start the acceleration.
From a Card Services perspective, you'll see the principal loss rate forecast that we gave a while ago. And lo and behold, it seems to be playing out at that level, if not just a smidge better, which is good. We expect for the year, Card Services to once again deliver double-digit growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA net of funding. 
Yield compression, which I'm sure we'll get some questions on, will lessen each quarter as the year progresses, so that we wind up at the end of the year with a very modest compression, which is how we want to take it into '17. And then I always said the pipeline is very robust, and that we'll get into a little bit about our decisions around who to renew, when to renew, at what levels will we renew clients, given that there's a certain amount of capital we want to put into the business, but we want to maintain sort of a 20-plus growth rate in the file, and that means maybe our capital is better spent on other areas and we don't renew certain folks. 
So that's where we are on Epsilon. We talked about digital and tech platforms are 3 cores of the business. We expect that to continue clipping along in the high single digits. The signings for the Conversant CRM vintage, if you recall last year, was about 30 wins in a very strong vintage signing of 80-ish plus. Once they fully spooled up, we expected to lease that this year, if not a little bit better, which will be great. And then now the agency stuff, look we're going to watch it and we're going to see the people-intensive business. It's in about a quarter of Epsilon Conversant. From what we're seeing, it looks soft, but it looks already like it's lessening in terms of the softness as we progress into Q2 and the rest of the year.
Okay. Last slide, full year. LoyaltyOne, BrandLoyalty, Q2 is the big one for them. So expect very, very strong double-digit rev in EBITDA. And then in AIR MILES, we remain comfortable that issuance, which is the key metric there, that's how we get paid, is going to be up about 4% for the year, which will drive on a constant currency basis low single-digit revs, and EBITDA for the year, which again would fly in the face of sort of the weakening consumer in Canada.
Overall, as I mentioned, several moving pieces, but full year is shaping up nicely. We are seeing zero stress on the consumer side. We are not seeing weakness in Canada. So those 2 data points are consistent with last quarter and the quarter before that. I just would talk a little bit about the model itself for Alliance. From 2007 through 2015, we produced annual growth rates of 15% and 18% for revenue and earnings per share, respectively, every single year. And for '16 and '17, as losses normalize and with the huge growth in the file, we're setting aside reserves for future losses, which are essentially doing is, you're knocking that growth rate down a bit. But you're still looking at low end double-digit growth rates in top and bottom. So this year, we're looking at 10% and 11%, and that includes some drag from FX. And then in '18, if, in fact we're right and these rates have stabilized, then there's no reason to doubt that it would snap right back to the prior model, you need to have a reacceleration in growth rate.
So if you look at long term for the company, you're looking somewhere mid-teens to high teens revs and core EPS. Then when you're in a period of normalization and building reserves, you're probably looking at low end, top and bottom double digits. And then you snap back to sort of mid-teens when that normalizes. So overall, not too shabby as a model. You'll also find with us that we tend to have different levers in different businesses cycle up and down at different times. But overall, the model holds together quite nicely. 
For guidance on the last slide, we're keeping at the same, and we're not going to spend a lot of time going through the nits and nats of how we get there. But it looks pretty solid at plus 10%, plus 11%. And that puts our organic growth rate actually quite a bit above our 3x GDP target. We look -- the cash flow, looks very nice. Very strong this year at about $1.4 billion. And look, when it comes to FX and all that other stuff, we'll adjust it when it becomes meaningful as the year plays out. But again, we're not going to be tweaking everything, every quarter. We're going to try to get this thing going on a consolidated basis.
So that's all I have. Why don't we open it up for Q&A? Q&A. Operator?"

And then if you can you give us a little more color on the levers that you have capable of pulling from a cost standpoint at Epsilon if it has to start next quarter, I guess how much room do we have? It feels like an area that you're trying to cut costs in the past and outsource I think to India, et cetera? So I look to see more color on how much room there is."

I mean, right now, what we're seeing is continuation of a strong demand for the Digital Products at Conversant, specifically sort of the SKU level, data-driven targeted display offering. Very strong. In general, the more core Epsilon, Big Loyalty and customer data base builds are strong and data offerings are strong. So a lot of -- all that heavy tech stuff demand continues to be strong. We expect that to continue for the rest of the year. On the agency side, look, we need to be very careful, we don't knee-jerk this thing. If it's an air pocket, then great, and we're back in business. If it looks like it's softer than we expect, then it's a very project intensive, people-intensive business. You would have to move quickly to make sure that revenues and expenses sync up. But what we're seeing right now is the softness in Q1 is already lessening a bit as we move into Q2. So we're going to hold off knee-jerking this thing. And if, in fact, Q2 comes in very soft on the agency side, we'll still make our numbs for the company from a guidance perspective, for sure. But we'll have to take some expenses out to make sure we take our numbers for the year."

The fact that as we talked about the bulk of our growth, the 10% in the core growth that we're seeing is really coming from accounts that are very mature, have been well seasoned, well passed the peak charge-off cycle. We are normalizing the loss rate. I think may be 2 more staffs might be helpful, which is look, we thought before the Great Recession, our normalized loss rate was 6.5%. We're seeing its 5.5% now. Why is that? Why are we comfortable that that's our long-term run rate, and that's what we're normalizing towards. Probably a couple of interesting stats there. One is with the new mix of co-brand, which carries a higher scoring customer as well as some of the higher-end type retailers that have joined us, we're attracting cardholders that tend to skew a little bit higher on the credit spectrum. So for example, if you were to compare all of our active accounts today versus 2007, the scores today on average are higher than they were in 2007, even with some of -- a lot of the accounts we've added recently. So from an active account basis, the average score is higher. Also if you looked at it from a balance perspective, the average score per balance today is higher than it was in 2007. And so you put those 2 together and that's how you get to -- we're not going to normalize out of 6.5%, we're going to normalize out of 5.5%. But look, it's not like we're trying to keep it lower. The fact is you give up some yield by not being at a higher loss rate. So I'm not sure it's a strategy of ours to keep it at 5.5%. It's just the way the file is playing out right now."

I couldn't pinpoint any one client because it was broad-based. On the Conversant side, on the traditional display, we've definitely seen pure people trying to use our private exchange. You've got the big agencies trying to push the programmatic client through their own trading platforms. So regardless of the quality, the impressions we can provide, they're trying to stuff it through their own system, and we just saw a general pullback there. So that was a little bit unexpected.

It's the highest EBITDA margin. So it's from a pure mix standpoint. You should get some EBITDA margin expansion in this year and in the future. Clearly, we'll have to look at the agency and play through if it's the short-term hiccup or air pocket as I said before, or it is the case where we have to structurally cut back on cost to get our margins back where they need to be. That's a little bit of the unknown at this point. But long term, I would expect the margins to expand slightly based on mix."

A large chunk of it, probably half of it, relates to what I call consumer-friendly programs, which I probably should find. It basically is we look at all of our practices, and basically said how do we continue to be the premium provider in the marketplace, the most customer-friendly provider in the marketplace as we continue to ramp up? And so there's a bunch of things that we put in place as we went into back half of last year. So for example, it doesn't seem like a lot, but it does move the needle in terms of if someone gets paid on the 15th of each month, but their bill is due on the 13th. Well, that doesn't work out all that well sometimes. So what we've done is we've given everyone the right to move their due date to later on in the month, if they wanted to. And that, again, it doesn't seem like much, but it actually does affect the late fees. But at the same time, it also helps our OpEx as you can see with the leverage because we have much lower talk time of people calling off, saying hey, I need a couple more days. So you have that. You have people who are calling in, where there used to be a fee if you're paying by the phone. We decided that wasn't best practices. We took that out as well. And so we just took a number of things out of the system that frankly caused more grief than they added. We got a lot of it back in lower OpEx in terms of talk time and everything else, and we have a much happier client and customer base. And so I think that's sort of what it is. None of it was dictated by any regulatory authority. It was something we proactively went out and just did. And we think, taking the hit now for it, and seeing it anniversary in the back half is probably the best thing to do. And hopefully, that will pay dividends down the line."

Turning to Slide 2, I will talk about the first quarter results, and they were pretty much as we expected, with revenue up 5% to $1.68 billion and core EPS up 5% at $3.84.

Turning to Slide 2, I will talk about the first quarter results, and they were pretty much as we expected, with revenue up 5% to $1.68 billion and core EPS up 5% at $3.84. It was a quarter with several positives but also a few negatives that tempered overall results. One of the negatives, foreign exchange rates, reduced both revenue and core EPS by about 2 points for the first quarter. The good news is that FX rates seem to have stabilized and the drag could drop to near zero in the back half of 2016.
Looking forward, we expect growth in each quarter to accelerate as 2016 progresses. Revenue growth of 5% in Q1 is expected to increase to 8% in Q2 and then double-digit growth in Q3 and Q4. Adjusted EBITDA and core EPS are expected to follow a similar trend. 
Now why do we believe this? Putting aside improving foreign-exchange comparables, there are several reasons. First, gross yield compression at Card Services should lessen each quarter as we anniversary several program changes made last year. Second, loss rates were expected to drift downward from first quarter highs. Third, BrandLoyalty has passed its most difficult comparable. If you remember in the first quarter 2015, the revenue was up over 100% on a constant currency basis. 
Lastly, Epsilon's agency weakness should lessen, coupled with a record year-end backlog for second half delivery. During the quarter, we acquired 2 million shares under our repurchase program for approximately $440 million. The buyback program remains our top capital allocation priority, and we expect will be executed somewhat ratably over the remainder of 2016. Essentially, we will look to deploy our free cash flow, while maintaining the leverage ratio of less than 3x.
With that, let's go to the next slide and Bryan will walk you through the Q1 results."

LoyaltyOne had a better-than-expected quarter as revenue decreased 2% to $381 million, but adjusted EBITDA increased 10% to $85 million on a constant currency basis. Breaking it down further, at AIR MILES our revenue increased 4% and adjusted EBITDA increased a robust 11% on a constant currency basis, and that was driven by a favorable issuance mix and prudent cost controls. 
As expected at BrandLoyalty, revenue was down 9% on a constant currency basis due to program timing differences. Encouragingly, adjusted EBITDA increased 9% on a constant currency basis due to higher margin programs that were driving a 300 basis points expansion in adjusted EBITDA margins.
AIR MILES issued increased a robust 5% or 57 million miles over the same quarter from last year. Issuance was particularly strong with our financial vertical as we continued to convert BMO MasterCard holders to the Premium World Elite card that has a more compelling consumer proposition and a higher AIR MILES earn offer. This strong growth was achieved despite economic uncertainty in Western Canada that's the result of the declining global oil prices that has been negatively impacting activity at our grocery partners, and also the suspension of point issuance on prescriptions in British Columbia.
Looking ahead, we anticipate a 2% decline in issuance growth through the second quarter due to reduced promotional activity and the onetime conversion of the Sobeys legacy program that happened in 2015, which of course would not be repeated.
As we have stated previously, quarterly results can vary based upon the timing of promotional activity, but our target remains a full year issuance growth of mid-single digits. 
AIR MILES redeemed increased 6% compared to the first quarter of 2015, with our AIR MILES cash program, that instant reward option, driving approximately half of the increase as its liquidity feature resonates with collectors in the current macro environment.
For the full year, we anticipate redemption growth to be in line with issuance growth. 
For the year, we anticipate full year constant currency revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth for AIR MILES to be in the mid-single-digit range as well.
Now turning to BrandLoyalty. We anticipate a very strong second quarter whereby revenue could be up as much as 50% on a constant currency basis. On the North American expansion front, BrandLoyalty continues to increase its presence in Canada, with 6 promotions that have been planned for 2016, and this represents a significant increase in sales over last year.
In addition, we launched our first pilot in the U.S. late in the first quarter. We were pleased with the results to-date and look forward to additional programs in this market. The full year expectation for BrandLoyalty continues to be mid-teens growth in both revenue and adjusted EBITDA as compared to 2015 on a constant currency basis.
Lastly, let me update you on Dotz and Precima. Starting with Dotz, our Brazilian coalition program, where we continue to see steady growth in our collector base to over 18 million currently. In November of last year, Dotz successfully launched the coalition program in Rio de Janeiro with the Cencosud grocery banner called Prezunic as a key partner.
Cencosud is the third-largest grocer in Brazil and collector reception has been positive, with over 1 million collectors now enrolled and active in Rio. 
Precima, our data analytics unit, continues to fire on all cylinders, recently signing a deal with Morrisons, one of the UK's top 4 grocers, where we will apply data intelligence and shopper insights to help Morrisons more effectively apply their customer-centric retailing approach.
In closing, LoyaltyOne achieved solid first quarter results with a positive outlook for the remainder of 2016. I'd like to take this opportunity to congratulate the entire team on a great quarter and look forward to their commitment to our valued clients and to LoyaltyOne. Awesome job, everyone. I guess, back to you, Charles."

Let's turn to Slide 4. Epsilon's revenue decreased 2% to $493 million and adjusted EBITDA decreased 22% to $81 million for the first quarter of 2016. Results in this segment were mixed as 3/4 of the business, digital and technology platform",1143,"Thanks, Bryan. Let's turn to Slide 4. Epsilon's revenue decreased 2% to $493 million and adjusted EBITDA decreased 22% to $81 million for the first quarter of 2016. Results in this segment were mixed as 3/4 of the business, digital and technology platforms grew at best [ph] 8% during the quarter, while the remaining 1/4, agency reforms, where the revenues declined by 23% versus the first quarter 2015. Adjusted EBITDA decreased $23 million from the first quarter of 2015, primarily due to higher payroll costs as staffing levels increased in anticipation of revenue that is yet to occur.
Before we dive into the individual portions, you see that we have a new reporting format here. We felt that the old formats where we used to talk about database and data and support really it's not reflective of the way we go to business these days. Specifically, is the broad portfolio of off-line, online services Epsilon delivers our package for bundled, omnichannel solutions, it just doesn't make sense for us to give it to you in that format. So what we've done is we put it together where we're going to highlight 2 categories that represent the underlying services and assets deployed to serve our clients. 
The first category, digital and technology platforms, consists of businesses which is primarily derived from revenues tied to one of the many core data and our technology platforms that Epsilon and Conversant manage. These platforms are used to house and manage data in real-time, to analyze and model data, and to automate usage of that data across a variety of channels, whether it be through a loyalty program, within e-mail communication or an online message delivered on mobile or desktop devices.
The remainder of the business, agency media and services, consist of services which are primarily focused on supporting the agency sector, both media services delivered to agencies on behalf of their clients as well as agency engagements in which Epsilon acts as the primary agency directly on behalf of its clients.
Now let's turn to the digital and technology portion of this segment, where quarterly revenue grew by $28 million year-over-year or about 8% mostly due to continued success of the cross-sell efforts and on-boarding of the strong CRM backlog within Conversant. The products offered within the CRM business continue to resonate with both new and existing clients, as 50 new contracts have already been signed this year versus 30 all of last year. The 2016 vintage thus far includes GNC, Brooks Brothers, Coach and Sears as a great follow-up to last year's efforts. These clients along with others such as Walgreens, are connecting with real people as a result of combining an automized first party with third-party data and 80 billion daily online interactions to develop a persistent consumer ID.
Moving on to agency media and services, revenue declined 23% from the first quarter of 2015. For Epsilon's traditional agency business, we saw broad-based weakness, especially in the telco, CPG and retail verticals. In addition, the agency business at Conversant which is the nondata-driven traditional display business was down as large agencies push more programmatic buying through their internal trading platforms versus using third-party DSPs.
We don't know if this bubble is a bubble with an agency or more structural. It needs to play out as the year progresses. If it's structural, we'll have to be more aggressive on going after cost cuts to maintain our earnings. Although we will likely continue to see volatility within agency on a quarterly basis, it is a key part of the CMO selling process which attracts more broad and less IT-centric relationships.
Now let's go over to the next slide and talk about Card Services. Card Services delivered strong financial results, achieving its 17th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Revenue increased 17% for the first quarter of 2016, driven by a 27% increase in average receivables. Adjusted EBITDA net grew 9%, dampened slightly by the provision builds. Importantly, principal loss rates were 5.2% for the quarter, 10 basis points better than our original guidance.
Focusing on the key drivers for our growth. Credit sales increased a healthy 25%, driven by our proven ability to grow customer loyalty for both our long-standing and newest brand partners as well as favorable weather and an early Easter. Our core business, brand partners with us from 4 years or more, continues to contribute roughly half of our credit sales growth. Importantly, we continue to grow tender share, up over 200 basis points for the first quarter by leveraging our large understanding of our brands along with the deep data analytics we bring to bear.
Most of the tender share pickup is being driven by card members, who have been engaged with their card for multiple years, not from new accounts. In other words, these are tenured cardmembers with a proven spending and payment history and they are demonstrating increased spend with the brands they love. This is a testament to the power of our customized marketing programs and the value they deliver to our long-standing partners. It's also a key differentiator and critical element in our ability to welcome new partners.
Looking at the remaining drivers of our performance, we talked about revenue grew 17% driven by the strong AR growth. Importantly, we realized strong operating expense leverage as we were able to drop our expense ratio by 70 bps for the quarter. 
As expected, gross yields experienced some compression driven primarily by brand mix, accounting for acquired files and lower late fees as we obtained several declines for several months in our first stage delinquency bucket. This pressure is predominantly in the first half of the year, and we expect yields to normalize as we anniversary these items.
Managing losses was key in the first quarter, and we exceeded guidance previously outlined. Losses, delinquency levels and funding costs were all in line with both expectations and seasonal trends. During the quarter, we decided not to renew 2 card programs up for renewal at year-end. The related receivables net of the allowance for loan loss have been reclassified to assets held for sale at March 31, 2016. Accordingly, $430 million has been removed from card receivables and $15 million has been removed from the allowance for loan loss. 
Our reserve for loan losses was 5.7% of reservable receivables at March 31, 2016, up from 5.5% at December 31, 2015. Reserve dollars dropped by $15 million from December 31, due to the reclassification previously discussed. 
In closing for Card Services, we delivered another stellar quarter, with all the key metrics outpacing the industry and consistent with our expectations. We are positioned for another record year in line with our strategy of 20% plus credit sales and AR growth, leveraging both organic growth and new partnerships.
With that, I'll turn it over to Ed."
24604,329506026,961177,"Alliance Data Systems Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Bread Financial Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, guys.

I would say in terms of Q1 a couple of general comments. One is, as Char",2528,"Great. Thanks, guys. When we turn to first quarter scorecard and the goal, of course, is to have more greens than yellows and reds, and right now, we're tracking with 30 being green. I would say in terms of Q1 a couple of general comments. One is, as Charles mentioned, this was obviously our toughest quarter. Comp versus last year was very difficult. And putting in a plus 5 top, plus 5 earnings, was right on the money of what we wanted to do. And our view into the rest of the year looks solid. So it's good to get that behind us.
Also, you'll find that it was kind of a mixed bag in terms of what it got us from A to B. But at the end, the pluses sort of outweighed the minuses and we got where we wanted to be.
As we move into the second quarter and the rest of the year, things are accelerating nicely. We have a good line of sight into the rest of the year. From our first quarter perspective, consolidated, we came right in where we said in terms of guidance at about $1.7 billion top and about $384 million on earnings. That was -- that included getting hit on the FX side, with about $26 million in top and about $0.05 on earnings from FX, which, if it holds, will fortunately start to anniversary as we move into the back half. 
We talked about the toughest comp of the year is now behind us, and we were pretty active in the buyback, taking in a bunch of shares which we thought were pretty cheap.
So overall consolidated, we got where we wanted to be and remain on track for the year in Card Services. Just the highlights, of course, the portfolio continues to grow very quickly, with over 20% growth, revenue in the high teens. And then obviously, due to the fact that we're growing so quickly, we need to obviously set up reserves and that tends to be a damper on EBITDA. Nonetheless, that did grow 9%. 
Yields gets the yellow. It was a little over 200 basis points due to multiple factors that we can talk about. Again, the good news there is that it's already beginning to burn away, and we expect less compression as each quarter goes by for the year, and we have pretty good visibility into that as well, so more of a Q1 issue. 
The loss rate, we spent the first 3 months of the year here, dealing with 2 questions that people were spooked about, the first being credit quality, and the second being Canada going into a depression. And what's interesting is those are the 2 items that probably performed best during the quarter. Credit quality actually came in a little bit better than we had anticipated. We now expect it to drift downwards as the year progresses from a seasonally high Q1. And similar to what we said 3 months ago, we'll say the same thing now. We check with our collectors and everyone else. There is 0 pressure that we're seeing coming in that would suggest that there's any type of stress on the consumer at this point. So we're just not seeing it. We didn't see it before. And again, we're just normalizing the loss rates in the file, which right now we're tracking nicely to that.
I will emphasize the next point which is tender share. That's often lost in all these discussions about growth and are you growing too fast, too slowly, how are you growing? Is it good quality, bad quality and all that other stuff. Tender share is up 200 basis points, which means if 30% of the sales at a retailer were on our card a year ago, now it's 32%. And that is not being moved by putting on a bunch of new accounts. And in fact, what it essentially means is that when the retailer is growing 2%, 3%, we're growing 10%. And so the first 10 points of portfolio growth are coming from a deeper penetration of that retailer sales base. And the next bullet point to me really brings it home that 80% of this tender share gain, they're coming from the mature accounts. They're coming from accounts that have been with us for 20, 24 months or more, which means they passed the peak sort of loss point, and they're very mature. And our ability to get in there and motivate incremental spend is what it's all about. And that's the data-driven targeted marketing. And I think that's probably the most important takeaway is that this is not coming from tossing on a whole bunch of new accounts or changing underwriting or anything like that. It's coming from driving those very long-term loyal customers to visit more often and spend a bit more on each visit. So that continues to work out well. The pipeline, we expect another year of $2 billion in new vintages. We have a bunch that have been signed, haven't been released and they will be released over the next couple of quarters. So the pipeline looks good. 
And as we move to Epsilon on the next page, that's where we run into probably -- if you were to ask me, about where the concern is for the year, it's certainly not on the credit side. It's certainly not on the Canadian side. It's certainly not on the technology and data and digital sides of Epsilon Conversant. We are focused, however, on some weakness on the agency side, which is about 1/4 of Epsilon Conversant. And what we saw there was sort of a general pullback in a number of the verticals. And we're going to watch that carefully, as Charles said. We don't know whether that's just a result of CMOs taking a breather in the first quarter, given the turmoil or whether that's more structural. In any event, if it is structural, we will make sure that earnings will remain on track, which means we'd have to focus on the expense side. 
But we don't know right now, and we're not going to knee-jerk it at this point. 
On the other side of it, the digital and technology platform stuff, up 8%. That's 3/4 of Epsilon Conversant. And we continue to see very, very strong takeup in terms of the data-driven targeted display offerings from Conversant. The number of wins that we're seeing right now are already half of what they were for the entire year last year. And then from an expense perspective and flexibility perspective, our India office is up and running. And we are hopefully continuing to staff that up as the year progresses, and that will finally begin to move the needle on the expense side towards the latter part of the year. 
LoyaltyOne, I think Bryan covered that. Obviously, BrandLoyalty is a very choppy business. It had a -- frankly a little bit better Q1 from the EBITDA perspective than we had initially talked about. But recall last year, Q1 was when revenue was up 100%. So it was then down in Q2. This year, it will be more of the reverse where you'll have a very strong Q2 for BrandLoyalty, and it's all driven by when the grocers have decided to put the programs on the calendar.
Bryan also talked about the BrandLoyalty expansion into North America. Canada is doing quite well and moving nicely towards our goal there. And the U.S. actually we're beginning to make some nice inroads there as well. So good news on that front. 
Again, the concern on the AIR MILES side in Canada was that issuance would fall off as consumer spend was weak. What we found was the reverse, which was issuance is very strong and specifically, issuance in the financial services space, which had been lagging before actually came back quite strongly. So it looks like Canada is still alive and kicking, and doing quite well.
Revenue and EBITDA, plus 4, plus 11, frankly on a constant currency basis was the best we've seen in years. And so it looks like the business up there is back in growth mode. 
Overall, for those of you who have covered ADS for a number of years, it's kind of a typical ADS quarter. You've got a bunch of things that went a little bit better than expected. You had some things that went worse than expected. And the end result is they kind of even out, and we meet or we beat our guidance. And that's pretty much been our track record for the last 15 years. We expect that to be the case going forward as well.
If you look at it in the Cards group, the yields were a little bit worse than we had anticipated, but losses were a little bit better. And then at Epsilon, the digital and tech platforms remained on track. We talked about agency and media was weak. That was offset by the fact in LoyaltyOne that AIR MILES was better, our BrandLoyalty was tracking. So again, looking at us, you can pick and choose whatever data points you want. But at the end of the day, the pluses and minuses hopefully even out to get to a double-digit growth rate for the year. And as we turn to our full year guidance, that's exactly what we're saying. It's very straightforward. Now with Q1 behind us, we have even a higher level of confidence on how the rest of the year is going to play out. And we feel very comfortable reiterating our full year guidance of revenue of $7.1 billion, up 10% and earnings of $16.75, up 11%. And the nice thing about it is the slowest quarter is behind us. We're going to ramp up to high single digits in the second quarter, and then we'll do double-digit top and bottom Q3, double-digit top and bottom in Q4, and that will give us a nice jump off into 2017. Visibility is quite strong. 
Q2 guidance revs around $1.6 billion, up 8%. And earnings, also up about 8%. I think those are good numbers to start the acceleration.
From a Card Services perspective, you'll see the principal loss rate forecast that we gave a while ago. And lo and behold, it seems to be playing out at that level, if not just a smidge better, which is good. We expect for the year, Card Services to once again deliver double-digit growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA net of funding. 
Yield compression, which I'm sure we'll get some questions on, will lessen each quarter as the year progresses, so that we wind up at the end of the year with a very modest compression, which is how we want to take it into '17. And then we said the pipeline is very robust, and that we'll get into a little bit about our decisions around who to renew, when to renew, at what levels will we renew clients, given that there's a certain amount of capital we want to put into the business, but we want to maintain sort of a 20-plus growth rate in the file, and that means maybe our capital is better spent on other areas and we don't renew certain folks. 
So that's where we are on Epsilon. We talked about digital and tech platforms are 3/4 of the business. We expect that to continue clipping along in the high single digits. The signings for the Conversant CRM vintage, if you recall last year, was about 30 wins in a very strong vintage signing of 80-ish plus, once they fully spooled up. We expected at least that this year, if not a little bit better, which would be great. And then now the agency stuff, look we're going to watch it and we're going to see. It's a people-intensive business. It's about 1/4 of Epsilon Conversant. From what we're seeing, it looks soft, but it looks already like it's lessening in terms of the softness as we progress into Q2 and the rest of the year.
Okay. Last slide, full year. LoyaltyOne, BrandLoyalty, Q2 is the big one for them. So expect very, very strong double-digit rev in EBITDA. And then in AIR MILES, we remain comfortable that issuance, which is the key metric there, it's how we get paid, is going to be up about 4% for the year, which will drive on a constant currency basis low single-digit revs, and EBITDA full year, which again would fly in the face of sort of the weakening consumer in Canada.
Overall, as I mentioned, several moving pieces, but full year is shaping up nicely. We are seeing zero stress on the consumer side. We are not seeing weakness in Canada. So those 2 data points are consistent with last quarter and the quarter before that. I just would talk a little bit about the model itself for Alliance. From 2007 through 2015, we produced annual growth rates of 15% and 18% for revenue and earnings per share, respectively, every single year. And for '16 and '17, as losses normalize and with a huge growth in the file, we're setting aside reserves for future losses. What you're essentially doing is you're knocking that growth rate down a bit. But you're still looking at low end double-digit growth rates in top and bottom. So this year, we're looking at 10% and 11%, and that includes some drag from FX. And then in '18, if, in fact we're right and these rates have stabilized, then there's no reason to doubt that it would snap right back to the prior model and you'd have a reacceleration in growth rate.
So if you look at long term for the company, you're looking somewhere mid-teens to high teens revs and core EPS. Then when you're in a period of normalization and building reserves, you're probably looking at low end, top and bottom double digit. And then you snap back to sort of mid-teens when that normalizes. So overall, not too shabby of a model. You'll also find with us that we tend to have different levers in different businesses cycle up and down at different times. But overall, the model holds together quite nicely. 
For guidance on the last slide, we're keeping it the same, and we're not going to spend a lot of time going through the nits and nats of how we get there. But it looks pretty solid at plus 10%, plus 11%. And that puts our organic growth rate actually quite a bit above our 3x GDP target. We look -- the cash flow looks very nice. Very strong this year at about $1.4 billion. And look, when it comes to FX and all that other stuff, we'll adjust it when it becomes meaningful as the year plays out. But again, we're not going to be tweaking everything every quarter. We're going to try to get this thing going on a consolidated basis.
So that's all I had. Why don't we open it up for Q&A? Q&A. Operator?"

That usually comes with a change in management. Other times, it's a change in strategy. And normally, we've just sort of said that's fine. We'll go with the flow. Right now, we're dealing with how do we allocate our capital? If we want to continue to grow the business, the file, 20-plus percent for the year, how do we maintain the type of returns that we expect. And frankly, there are a couple of programs there that based upon, how do we say it? The comments being made about the dollars that folks are willing to put into it, and the direction of those businesses, it didn't look like the best use of our capital. And so we've reallocated that capital to a couple of wins that we think are, I think, more down the stairway for us.

The fact that as we talked about the bulk of our growth, the 10% in the core growth that we're seeing is really coming from accounts that are very mature, have been well-seasoned, well past the peak charge-off cycle. We are normalizing the loss rate. I think maybe 2 more stats might be helpful, which is look, we thought before the Great Recession, our normalized loss rate was 6.5%. We're seeing it's 5.5% now. Why is that? Why are we comfortable that that's our long-term run rate, and that's what we're normalizing towards. Probably a couple of interesting stats there. One is with the new mix of co-brand, which carries a higher scoring customer as well as some of the higher-end type retailers that have joined us, we're attracting cardholders that tend to skew a little bit higher on the credit spectrum. So for example, if you were to compare all of our active accounts today versus 2007, the scores today on average are higher than they were in 2007, even with some of -- a lot of the accounts we've added recently. So from an active account basis, the average score is higher. Also if you looked at it from a balance perspective, the average score per balance today is higher than it was in 2007. And so you put those 2 together and that's how you get to -- we're not going to normalize out at 6.5%, we're going to normalize out at 5.5%. But look, it's not like we're trying to keep it lower. The fact is you give up some yield by not being at a higher loss rate. So I'm not sure it's a strategy of ours to keep it at 5.5%. It's just the way the file is playing out right now."

If you look at the breakdown, it was weakness in both categories. We saw weakness in traditional agency for Epsilon, where we saw weakness across many verticals. I couldn't pinpoint any one client because it was broad-based. On the Conversant side, on the traditional display, we've definitely seen pure people trying to use their private exchange. You've got the big agencies trying to push the programmatic client through their own in trading platforms. So regardless of the quality, the impressions we can provide, they're trying to stuff it through their own system, and we just saw a general pullback there. So that was a little bit unexpected.

It basically means we look at all of our practices, and basically said how do we continue to be the premium provider in the marketplace, the most customer-friendly provider in the marketplace as we continue to ramp up? And so there's a bunch of things that we put in place as we went into the back half of last year. So for example, it doesn't seem like a lot, but it does move the needle in terms of if someone gets paid on the 15th of each month, but their bill is due on the 13th. Well, that doesn't work out all that well sometimes. So what we've done is we've given everyone the right to move their due date to later on in the month, if they wanted to. And that, again, it doesn't seem like much, but it actually does affect the late fees. But at the same time, it also helps our OpEx as you start to see with the leverage because we have much lower talk time of people calling up, saying ""Hey, I need a couple more days."" So you have that. You have people who are calling in, where there used to be a fee if you're paying by the phone. We decided that wasn't best practices. We took that out as well. And so we just took a number of things out of the system that frankly caused more grief than they added. We got a lot of it back in lower OpEx in terms of talk time and everything else, and we have a much happier client and customer base. And so I think that's sort of what it is. None of it was dictated by any regulatory authority. It was something we proactively went out and just did. And we think, taking the hit now for it, and seeing it anniversary in the back half is probably the best thing to do. And hopefully, that will pay dividends down the line."

Turning to Slide 2, I will talk about the first quarter results, and they were pretty much as we expected, with revenue up 5% to $1.68 billion and core EPS up 5% at $3.84. It was a quarter with several positives but also a few negatives that tempered overall results. One of the negatives, foreign exchange rates, reduced both revenue and core EPS by about 2 points for the first quarter. The good news is that FX rates seem to have stabilized and the drag could drop to near zero in the back half of 2016.
Looking forward, we expect growth in each quarter to accelerate as 2016 progresses. Revenue growth of 5% in Q1 is expected to increase to 8% in Q2 and then double-digit growth in Q3 and Q4. Adjusted EBITDA and core EPS are expected to follow a similar trend. 
Now why do we believe this? Putting aside improving foreign-exchange comparables, there are several reasons. First, gross yield compression at Card Services should lessen each quarter as we anniversary several program changes made last year. Second, loss rates were expected to drift downward from first quarter highs. Third, BrandLoyalty has passed its most difficult comparable. If you remember in the first quarter 2015, the revenue was up over 100% on a constant currency basis. 
Lastly, Epsilon's agency weakness should lessen, coupled with a record year-end backlog for second half delivery. During the quarter, we acquired 2 million shares under our repurchase program for approximately $440 million. The buyback program remains our top capital allocation priority, and we expect will be executed somewhat ratably over the remainder of 2016. Essentially, we will look to deploy our free cash flow, while maintaining the leverage ratio of less than 3x.
With that, let's go to the next slide and Bryan will walk you through the Q1 results."

LoyaltyOne had a better-than-expected quarter as revenue decreased 2% to $381 million, but adjusted EBITDA increased 10% to $85 million on a constant currency basis. Breaking it down further, at AIR MILES our revenue increased 4% and adjusted EBITDA increased a robust 11% on a constant currency basis, and that was driven by a favorable issuance mix and prudent cost controls. 
As expected at BrandLoyalty, revenue was down 9% on a constant currency basis due to program timing differences. Encouragingly, adjusted EBITDA increased 9% on a constant currency basis due to higher margin programs that were driving a 300 basis points expansion in adjusted EBITDA margins.
AIR MILES issued increased a robust 5% or 57 million miles over the same quarter from last year. Issuance was particularly strong with our financial vertical as we continued to convert BMO MasterCard holders to the Premium World Elite card that has a more compelling consumer proposition and a higher AIR MILES earn offer. This strong growth was achieved despite economic uncertainty in Western Canada that's the result of the declining global oil prices that has been negatively impacting activity at our grocery partners, and also the suspension of point issuance on prescriptions in British Columbia.
Looking ahead, we anticipate a 2% decline in issuance growth through the second quarter due to reduced promotional activity and the onetime conversion of the Sobeys legacy program that happened in 2015, which of course would not be repeated.
As we have stated previously, quarterly results can vary based upon the timing of promotional activity, but our target remains a full year issuance growth of mid-single digits. 
AIR MILES redeemed increased 6% compared to the first quarter of 2015, with our AIR MILES cash program, that instant reward option, driving approximately half of the increase as its liquidity feature resonates with collectors in the current macro environment.
For the full year, we anticipate redemption growth to be in line with issuance growth. 
For the year, we anticipate full year constant currency revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth for AIR MILES to be in the mid-single-digit range as well.
Now turning to BrandLoyalty. We anticipate a very strong second quarter whereby revenue could be up as much as 50% on a constant currency basis. On the North American expansion front, BrandLoyalty continues to increase its presence in Canada, with 6 promotions that have been planned for 2016, and this represents a significant increase in sales over last year.
In addition, we launched our first pilot in the U.S. late in the first quarter. We were pleased with the results to-date and look forward to additional programs in this market. The full year expectation for BrandLoyalty continues to be mid-teens growth in both revenue and adjusted EBITDA as compared to 2015 on a constant currency basis.
Lastly, let me update you on Dotz and Precima. Starting with Dotz, our Brazilian coalition program, where we continue to see steady growth in our collector base to over 18 million currently. In November of last year, Dotz successfully launched the coalition program in Rio de Janeiro with the Cencosud grocery banner called Prezunic as a key partner.
Cencosud is the third-largest grocer in Brazil and collector reception has been positive, with over 1 million collectors now enrolled and active in Rio. 
Precima, our data analytics unit, continues to fire on all cylinders, recently signing a deal with Morrisons, one of the UK's top 4 grocers, where we will apply data intelligence and shopper insights to help Morrisons more effectively apply their customer-centric retailing approach.
In closing, LoyaltyOne achieved solid first quarter results with a positive outlook for the remainder of 2016. I'd like to take this opportunity to congratulate the entire team on a great quarter and look forward to their commitment to our valued clients and to LoyaltyOne. Awesome job, everyone. I guess, back to you, Charles."

Let's turn to Slide 4. Epsilon's revenue decreased 2% to $493 million and adjusted EBITDA decreased 22% to $81 million for the first quarter of 2016.

Epsilon's revenue decreased 2% to $493 million and adjusted EBITDA decreased 22% to $81 million for the first quarter of 2016. Results in this segment were mixed as 3/4 of the business, digital and technology platforms grew at best [ph] 8% during the quarter, while the remaining 1/4, agency reforms, where the revenues declined by 23% versus the first quarter 2015. Adjusted EBITDA decreased $23 million from the first quarter of 2015, primarily due to higher payroll costs as staffing levels increased in anticipation of revenue that is yet to occur.
Before we dive into the individual portions, you see that we have a new reporting format here. We felt that the old formats where we used to talk about database and data and support really it's not reflective of the way we go to business these days. Specifically, is the broad portfolio of off-line, online services Epsilon delivers our package for bundled, omnichannel solutions, it just doesn't make sense for us to give it to you in that format. So what we've done is we put it together where we're going to highlight 2 categories that represent the underlying services and assets deployed to serve our clients. 
The first category, digital and technology platforms, consists of businesses which is primarily derived from revenues tied to one of the many core data and our technology platforms that Epsilon and Conversant manage. These platforms are used to house and manage data in real-time, to analyze and model data, and to automate usage of that data across a variety of channels, whether it be through a loyalty program, within e-mail communication or an online message delivered on mobile or desktop devices.
The remainder of the business, agency media and services, consist of services which are primarily focused on supporting the agency sector, both media services delivered to agencies on behalf of their clients as well as agency engagements in which Epsilon acts as the primary agency directly on behalf of its clients.
Now let's turn to the digital and technology portion of this segment, where quarterly revenue grew by $28 million year-over-year or about 8% mostly due to continued success of the cross-sell efforts and on-boarding of the strong CRM backlog within Conversant. The products offered within the CRM business continue to resonate with both new and existing clients, as 50 new contracts have already been signed this year versus 30 all of last year. The 2016 vintage thus far includes GNC, Brooks Brothers, Coach and Sears as a great follow-up to last year's efforts. These clients along with others such as Walgreens, are connecting with real people as a result of combining an automized first party with third-party data and 80 billion daily online interactions to develop a persistent consumer ID.
Moving on to agency media and services, revenue declined 23% from the first quarter of 2015. For Epsilon's traditional agency business, we saw broad-based weakness, especially in the telco, CPG and retail verticals. In addition, the agency business at Conversant which is the nondata-driven traditional display business was down as large agencies push more programmatic buying through their internal trading platforms versus using third-party DSPs.
We don't know if this bubble is a bubble with an agency or more structural. It needs to play out as the year progresses. If it's structural, we'll have to be more aggressive on going after cost cuts to maintain our earnings. Although we will likely continue to see volatility within agency on a quarterly basis, it is a key part of the CMO selling process which attracts more broad and less IT-centric relationships.
Now let's go over to the next slide and talk about Card Services. Card Services delivered strong financial results, achieving its 17th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Revenue increased 17% for the first quarter of 2016, driven by a 27% increase in average receivables. Adjusted EBITDA net grew 9%, dampened slightly by the provision builds. Importantly, principal loss rates were 5.2% for the quarter, 10 basis points better than our original guidance.
Focusing on the key drivers for our growth. Credit sales increased a healthy 25%, driven by our proven ability to grow customer loyalty for both our long-standing and newest brand partners as well as favorable weather and an early Easter. Our core business, brand partners with us from 4 years or more, continues to contribute roughly half of our credit sales growth. Importantly, we continue to grow tender share, up over 200 basis points for the first quarter by leveraging our large understanding of our brands along with the deep data analytics we bring to bear.
Most of the tender share pickup is being driven by card members, who have been engaged with their card for multiple years, not from new accounts. In other words, these are tenured cardmembers with a proven spending and payment history and they are demonstrating increased spend with the brands they love. This is a testament to the power of our customized marketing programs and the value they deliver to our long-standing partners. It's also a key differentiator and critical element in our ability to welcome new partners.
Looking at the remaining drivers of our performance, we talked about revenue grew 17% driven by the strong AR growth. Importantly, we realized strong operating expense leverage as we were able to drop our expense ratio by 70 bps for the quarter. 
As expected, gross yields experienced some compression driven primarily by brand mix, accounting for acquired files and lower late fees as we obtained several declines for several months in our first stage delinquency bucket. This pressure is predominantly in the first half of the year, and we expect yields to normalize as we anniversary these items.
Managing losses was key in the first quarter, and we exceeded guidance previously outlined. Losses, delinquency levels and funding costs were all in line with both expectations and seasonal trends. During the quarter, we decided not to renew 2 card programs up for renewal at year-end. The related receivables net of the allowance for loan loss have been reclassified to assets held for sale at March 31, 2016. Accordingly, $430 million has been removed from card receivables and $15 million has been removed from the allowance for loan loss. 
Our reserve for loan losses was 5.7% of reservable receivables at March 31, 2016, up from 5.5% at December 31, 2015. Reserve dollars dropped by $15 million from December 31, due to the reclassification previously discussed. 
In closing for Card Services, we delivered another stellar quarter, with all the key metrics outpacing the industry and consistent with our expectations. We are positioned for another record year in line with our strategy of 20% plus credit sales and AR growth, leveraging both organic growth and new partnerships.
With that, I'll turn it over to Ed."

When we turn to first quarter scorecard and the goal, of course, is to have more greens than yellows and reds, and right now, we're tracking with 30 being green. I would say in terms of Q1 a couple of general comments. One is, as Charles mentioned, this was obviously our toughest quarter. Comp versus last year was very difficult. And putting in a plus 5 top, plus 5 earnings, was right on the money of what we wanted to do. And our view into the rest of the year looks solid. So it's good to get that behind us.
Also, you'll find that it was kind of a mixed bag in terms of what it got us from A to B. But at the end, the pluses sort of outweighed the minuses and we got where we wanted to be.
As we move into the second quarter and the rest of the year, things are accelerating nicely. We have a good line of sight into the rest of the year. From our first quarter perspective, consolidated, we came right in where we said in terms of guidance at about $1.7 billion top and about $384 million on earnings. That was -- that included getting hit on the FX side, with about $26 million in top and about $0.05 on earnings from FX, which, if it holds, will fortunately start to anniversary as we move into the back half. 
We talked about the toughest comp of the year is now behind us, and we were pretty active in the buyback, taking in a bunch of shares which we thought were pretty cheap.
So overall consolidated, we got where we wanted to be and remain on track for the year in Card Services. Just the highlights, of course, the portfolio continues to grow very quickly, with over 20% growth, revenue in the high teens. And then obviously, due to the fact that we're growing so quickly, we need to obviously set up reserves and that tends to be a damper on EBITDA. Nonetheless, that did grow 9%. 
Yields gets the yellow. It was a little over 200 basis points due to multiple factors that we can talk about. Again, the good news there is that it's already beginning to burn away, and we expect less compression as each quarter goes by for the year, and we have pretty good visibility into that as well, so more of a Q1 issue. 
The loss rate, we spent the first 3 months of the year here, dealing with 2 questions that people were spooked about, the first being credit quality, and the second being Canada going into a depression. And what's interesting is those are the 2 items that probably performed best during the quarter. Credit quality actually came in a little bit better than we had anticipated. We now expect it to drift downwards as the year progresses from a seasonally high Q1. And similar to what we said 3 months ago, we'll say the same thing now. We check with our collectors and everyone else. There is 0 pressure that we're seeing coming in that would suggest that there's any type of stress on the consumer at this point. So we're just not seeing it. We didn't see it before. And again, we're just normalizing the loss rates in the file, which right now we're tracking nicely to that.
I will emphasize the next point which is tender share. That's often lost in all these discussions about growth and are you growing too fast, too slowly, how are you growing? Is it good quality, bad quality and all that other stuff. Tender share is up 200 basis points, which means if 30% of the sales at a retailer were on our card a year ago, now it's 32%. And that is not being moved by putting on a bunch of new accounts. And in fact, what it essentially means is that when the retailer is growing 2%, 3%, we're growing 10%. And so the first 10 points of portfolio growth are coming from a deeper penetration of that retailer sales base. And the next bullet point to me really brings it home that 80% of this tender share gain, they're coming from the mature accounts. They're coming from accounts that have been with us for 20, 24 months or more, which means they passed the peak sort of loss point, and they're very mature. And our ability to get in there and motivate incremental spend is what it's all about. And that's the data-driven targeted marketing. And I think that's probably the most important takeaway is that this is not coming from tossing on a whole bunch of new accounts or changing underwriting or anything like that. It's coming from driving those very long-term loyal customers to visit more often and spend a bit more on each visit. So that continues to work out well. The pipeline, we expect another year of $2 billion in new vintages. We have a bunch that have been signed, haven't been released and they will be released over the next couple of quarters. So the pipeline looks good. 
And as we move to Epsilon on the next page, that's where we run into probably -- if you were to ask me, about where the concern is for the year, it's certainly not on the credit side. It's certainly not on the Canadian side. It's certainly not on the technology and data and digital sides of Epsilon Conversant. We are focused, however, on some weakness on the agency side, which is about 1/4 of Epsilon Conversant. And what we saw there was sort of a general pullback in a number of the verticals. And we're going to watch that carefully, as Charles said. We don't know whether that's just a result of CMOs taking a breather in the first quarter, given the turmoil or whether that's more structural. In any event, if it is structural, we will make sure that earnings will remain on track, which means we'd have to focus on the expense side. 
But we don't know right now, and we're not going to knee-jerk it at this point. 
On the other side of it, the digital and technology platform stuff, up 8%. That's 3/4 of Epsilon Conversant. And we continue to see very, very strong takeup in terms of the data-driven targeted display offerings from Conversant. The number of wins that we're seeing right now are already half of what they were for the entire year last year. And then from an expense perspective and flexibility perspective, our India office is up and running. And we are hopefully continuing to staff that up as the year progresses, and that will finally begin to move the needle on the expense side towards the latter part of the year. 
LoyaltyOne, I think Bryan covered that. Obviously, BrandLoyalty is a very choppy business. It had a -- frankly a little bit better Q1 from the EBITDA perspective than we had initially talked about. But recall last year, Q1 was when revenue was up 100%. So it was then down in Q2. This year, it will be more of the reverse where you'll have a very strong Q2 for BrandLoyalty, and it's all driven by when the grocers have decided to put the programs on the calendar.
Bryan also talked about the BrandLoyalty expansion into North America. Canada is doing quite well and moving nicely towards our goal there. And the U.S. actually we're beginning to make some nice inroads there as well. So good news on that front. 
Again, the concern on the AIR MILES side in Canada was that issuance would fall off as consumer spend was weak. What we found was the reverse, which was issuance is very strong and specifically, issuance in the financial services space, which had been lagging before actually came back quite strongly. So it looks like Canada is still alive and kicking, and doing quite well.
Revenue and EBITDA, plus 4, plus 11, frankly on a constant currency basis was the best we've seen in years. And so it looks like the business up there is back in growth mode. 
Overall, for those of you who have covered ADS for a number of years, it's kind of a typical ADS quarter. You've got a bunch of things that went a little bit better than expected. You had some things that went worse than expected. And the end result is they kind of even out, and we meet or we beat our guidance. And that's pretty much been our track record for the last 15 years. We expect that to be the case going forward as well.
If you look at it in the Cards group, the yields were a little bit worse than we had anticipated, but losses were a little bit better. And then at Epsilon, the digital and tech platforms remained on track. We talked about agency and media was weak. That was offset by the fact in LoyaltyOne that AIR MILES was better, our BrandLoyalty was tracking. So again, looking at us, you can pick and choose whatever data points you want. But at the end of the day, the pluses and minuses hopefully even out to get to a double-digit growth rate for the year. And as we turn to our full year guidance, that's exactly what we're saying. It's very straightforward. Now with Q1 behind us, we have even a higher level of confidence on how the rest of the year is going to play out. And we feel very comfortable reiterating our full year guidance of revenue of $7.1 billion, up 10% and earnings of $16.75, up 11%. And the nice thing about it is the slowest quarter is behind us. We're going to ramp up to high single digits in the second quarter, and then we'll do double-digit top and bottom Q3, double-digit top and bottom in Q4, and that will give us a nice jump off into 2017. Visibility is quite strong. 
Q2 guidance revs around $1.6 billion, up 8%. And earnings, also up about 8%. I think those are good numbers to start the acceleration.
From a Card Services perspective, you'll see the principal loss rate forecast that we gave a while ago. And lo and behold, it seems to be playing out at that level, if not just a smidge better, which is good. We expect for the year, Card Services to once again deliver double-digit growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA net of funding. 
Yield compression, which I'm sure we'll get some questions on, will lessen each quarter as the year progresses, so that we wind up at the end of the year with a very modest compression, which is how we want to take it into '17. And then we said the pipeline is very robust, and that we'll get into a little bit about our decisions around who to renew, when to renew, at what levels will we renew clients, given that there's a certain amount of capital we want to put into the business, but we want to maintain sort of a 20-plus growth rate in the file, and that means maybe our capital is better spent on other areas and we don't renew certain folks. 
So that's where we are on Epsilon. We talked about digital and tech platforms are 3/4 of the business. We expect that to continue clipping along in the high single digits. The signings for the Conversant CRM vintage, if you recall last year, was about 30 wins in a very strong vintage signing of 80-ish plus, once they fully spooled up. We expected at least that this year, if not a little bit better, which would be great. And then now the agency stuff, look we're going to watch it and we're going to see. It's a people-intensive business. It's about 1/4 of Epsilon Conversant. From what we're seeing, it looks soft, but it looks already like it's lessening in terms of the softness as we progress into Q2 and the rest of the year.
Okay. Last slide, full year. LoyaltyOne, BrandLoyalty, Q2 is the big one for them. So expect very, very strong double-digit rev in EBITDA. And then in AIR MILES, we remain comfortable that issuance, which is the key metric there, it's how we get paid, is going to be up about 4% for the year, which will drive on a constant currency basis low single-digit revs, and EBITDA full year, which again would fly in the face of sort of the weakening consumer in Canada.
Overall, as I mentioned, several moving pieces, but full year is shaping up nicely. We are seeing zero stress on the consumer side. We are not seeing weakness in Canada. So those 2 data points are consistent with last quarter and the quarter before that. I just would talk a little bit about the model itself for Alliance. From 2007 through 2015, we produced annual growth rates of 15% and 18% for revenue and earnings per share, respectively, every single year. And for '16 and '17, as losses normalize and with a huge growth in the file, we're setting aside reserves for future losses. What you're essentially doing is you're knocking that growth rate down a bit. But you're still looking at low end double-digit growth rates in top and bottom. So this year, we're looking at 10% and 11%, and that includes some drag from FX. And then in '18, if, in fact we're right and these rates have stabilized, then there's no reason to doubt that it would snap right back to the prior model and you'd have a reacceleration in growth rate.
So if you look at long term for the company, you're looking somewhere mid-teens to high teens revs and core EPS. Then when you're in a period of normalization and building reserves, you're probably looking at low end, top and bottom double digit. And then you snap back to sort of mid-teens when that normalizes. So overall, not too shabby of a model. You'll also find with us that we tend to have different levers in different businesses cycle up and down at different times. But overall, the model holds together quite nicely. 
For guidance on the last slide, we're keeping it the same, and we're not going to spend a lot of time going through the nits and nats of how we get there. But it looks pretty solid at plus 10%, plus 11%. And that puts our organic growth rate actually quite a bit above our 3x GDP target. We look -- the cash flow looks very nice. Very strong this year at about $1.4 billion. And look, when it comes to FX and all that other stuff, we'll adjust it when it becomes meaningful as the year plays out. But again, we're not going to be tweaking everything every quarter. We're going to try to get this thing going on a consolidated basis.
So that's all I had. Why don't we open it up for Q&A? Q&A. Operator?"

That usually comes with a change in management. Other times, it's a change in strategy. And normally, we've just sort of said that's fine. We'll go with the flow. Right now, we're dealing with how do we allocate our capital? If we want to continue to grow the business, the file, 20-plus percent for the year, how do we maintain the type of returns that we expect. And frankly, there are a couple of programs there that based upon, how do we say it? The comments being made about the dollars that folks are willing to put into it, and the direction of those businesses, it didn't look like the best use of our capital.

The fact that as we talked about the bulk of our growth, the 10% in the core growth that we're seeing is really coming from accounts that are very mature, have been well-seasoned, well past the peak charge-off cycle. We are normalizing the loss rate. I think maybe 2 more stats might be helpful, which is look, we thought before the Great Recession, our normalized loss rate was 6.5%. We're seeing it's 5.5% now. Why is that? Why are we comfortable that that's our long-term run rate, and that's what we're normalizing towards. Probably a couple of interesting stats there. One is with the new mix of co-brand, which carries a higher scoring customer as well as some of the higher-end type retailers that have joined us, we're attracting cardholders that tend to skew a little bit higher on the credit spectrum. So for example, if you were to compare all of our active accounts today versus 2007, the scores today on average are higher than they were in 2007, even with some of -- a lot of the accounts we've added recently. So from an active account basis, the average score is higher. Also if you looked at it from a balance perspective, the average score per balance today is higher than it was in 2007. And so you put those 2 together and that's how you get to -- we're not going to normalize out at 6.5%, we're going to normalize out at 5.5%. But look, it's not like we're trying to keep it lower. The fact is you give up some yield by not being at a higher loss rate. So I'm not sure it's a strategy of ours to keep it at 5.5%. It's just the way the file is playing out right now."

If you look at the breakdown, it was weakness in both categories. We saw weakness in traditional agency for Epsilon, where we saw weakness across many verticals. I couldn't pinpoint any one client because it was broad-based. On the Conversant side, on the traditional display, we've definitely seen pure people trying to use their private exchange. You've got the big agencies trying to push the programmatic client through their own in trading platforms. So regardless of the quality, the impressions we can provide, they're trying to stuff it through their own system, and we just saw a general pullback there. So that was a little bit unexpected.

It basically means we look at all of our practices, and basically said how do we continue to be the premium provider in the marketplace, the most customer-friendly provider in the marketplace as we continue to ramp up? And so there's a bunch of things that we put in place as we went into the back half of last year. So for example, it doesn't seem like a lot, but it does move the needle in terms of if someone gets paid on the 15th of each month, but their bill is due on the 13th. Well, that doesn't work out all that well sometimes. So what we've done is we've given everyone the right to move their due date to later on in the month, if they wanted to. And that, again, it doesn't seem like much, but it actually does affect the late fees. But at the same time, it also helps our OpEx as you start to see with the leverage because we have much lower talk time of people calling up, saying ""Hey, I need a couple more days."" So you have that. You have people who are calling in, where there used to be a fee if you're paying by the phone. We decided that wasn't best practices. We took that out as well. And so we just took a number of things out of the system that frankly caused more grief than they added. We got a lot of it back in lower OpEx in terms of talk time and everything else, and we have a much happier client and customer base. And so I think that's sort of what it is. None of it was dictated by any regulatory authority. It was something we proactively went out and just did. And we think, taking the hit now for it, and seeing it anniversary in the back half is probably the best thing to do. And hopefully, that will pay dividends down the line."

[Audio Gap]
Double-digit revenue and adjusted EBITDA for both LoyaltyOne and Card Services, a return to positive revenue growth at Epsilon and stable FX rates. Another positive during the quarter was the opportunity to acquire earlier than scheduled the remaining 20% ownership in BrandLoyalty. It made sense to us as the company's performance has exceeded all of our expectations and the opportunity in North America looks very compelling. 
Accordingly, we acquired remaining interest effective April 1, 2016, for approximately $259 million in consideration, which was funded by upside in BrandLoyalty's credit facility. 
Now the accounting is little unique because the remaining ownership was purchased prior to the 10% tranches scheduled for January 17 and January 18, the consideration paid exceeded the current value of the redeemable now controlling interest our balance sheet, which would've increased over the next 1.5 years to roughly equal the purchase price paid. The difference of $68 million is immediate charge to retain earnings on the balance sheet but nonetheless, it's considered in the calculation of EPS, which was reduced by $1.14. Excluding this charge, EPS increased 13% for the second quarter. 
While this acquisition means to ADS? From the revenue standpoint, nothing as we already consolidate 100% of BrandLoyalty's revenue. From a profitable standpoint, it will add a few cents to our EPS and our core EPS for 2016. 
Turning to the repurchase program. We've acquired approximately 2.6 million shares under our repurchase program year-to-date. We have approximately 460 million of our board authorization left, which we expect to use somewhat ratably over the remainder of 2016. 
Let's go to Page 3 and talk about LoyaltyOne. LoyaltyOne had a very strong second quarter as revenue increased 17% to $352 million and adjusted EBITDA increased 20% to $79 million. Negative FX translation rates knocked up about 2 points upgrowth off to the second quarter, but on a positive the note, we do not expect any FX drag in the second half of 2016 if current spot rates hold. 
AIR MILES' revenue increased 6% on a constant currency basis, driven by an 8% increase in miles redeemed. 
AIR MILES issued declined 3% versus the same quarter last year, which was expected. As you may recall, we converted Sobeys legacy reward program into the AIR MILES reward program in the second quarter of 2015. That makes for a difficult year-over-year comparable. 
In addition, we had less promotional activity in the grocery vertical this year. AIR MILES redeemed increased 8% compared to the second quarter 2015, primarily driven by AM Cash or instant reward option. 
In particular, we are seeing growth in in-store redemptions, which are popular at our AIR MILES grocery partners. 
Moving to BrandLoyalty. Revenue increased 44% on a constant currency basis, driven by an increase in the number of short term loyalty programs executed during the quarter. 
Continued expansion into new markets such as South Africa and New Zealand contributed to growth. The pilot recently executed with the top 3 grocery in the U.S. finished with a very strong results as pilot stores showed revenue growth approximately 1.5% higher than non-pilot stores. 
This was accomplished largely through an increased basket sizes. Plans are currently underway with this grocery to extend the program the full store network at later day. Additional pilot programs in the U.S. and Canada are also planned for the back half of this year. Overall, a terrific quarter. 
Now let's flip over to the next slide and talk about Epsilon. Epsilon's revenue increased 5% to $519 million for the second quarter, a solid turn from the revenue decline of 2% in the first quarter of 2016. 
Adjusted EBITDA decreased 9% to $103 million, primarily due to the duplicate cost in R&D operation and severance costs. We expect these costs to abate during the third quarter allowing the full flow through of revenue to EBITDA. 
Our digital and technology platforms businesses is hot, posting robust 14% growth versus the prior year. This performance was supported by solid contributions from all offerings in this category with our automotive platform and Conversant CRM service leading the way. 
In addition, solid traction in the affiliate business and strong new business within our Harmony platform added momentum. 
In particular,, Conversant CRM business with industry-leading cross-device recognition and reach had a terrific quarter with revenue of 66% and a building backlog that should exceed the book of business we won in 2015 with over 20 new clients signed and launched in the first half, including Zales, Beach Body, Justice and White House black market. 
Our agency media & services business continues to struggle as revenue declined 15% versus the prior year. This offering has been weak for several quarters due to a combination of decreased spending by large customer in our traditional agency and lower volume of digital media buys from large third party agencies. 
In response, 3 initiatives were started during the second quarter. The first would suggest the cost structure commensurate with low revenue expectations that is largely complete. The second, which is a longer-term initiative is to redirect the digital agency toward mid-sized agencies and maybe direct to clients.  Third, we've begun pivoting this offering to core data-driven marketing and insights, thus creating a CRM-like solution for clients who aren't ready yet for full CRM. Earlier results are encouraging as we've begun to gain traction in new verticals such as media and entertainment. 
Overall, we see 2 key market trends align well with Epsilon's core strategy: Demands from CMOs for measurable results and the ongoing shift from traditional marketing channels to digital and data-driven channels. With a highly differentiated digital and offline data asset, a rich portfolio of services and its deep marketing advertising technology stack, the business is poised to resume healthy steady growth. 
Topic declines are growing at a high single digit rate and the business has robust topline.  Paired with prudent cost management initiatives currently underway, we expect to see the return to profitable growth in the back half of 2016 and exit the year with a healthier cost structure going into 2017. 
I will now turn it over to Melisa to talk about Card Services."

Good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 5. I am so pleased to highlight that the Card Services business had another quarter of strong performance, delivering the 18 consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Revenues are",1156,"Thank you, Charles. Good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 5. I am so pleased to highlight that the Card Services business had another quarter of strong performance, delivering the 18 consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. 
Revenues are up 25% over last year, translating to a 10% increase in adjusted EBITDA net of funding costs. 
Let's turn now to Page 6 and go over some of the key drivers of the strong performance. First, credit sales were up 18%, resulting in year-over-year tender share gains on 180 basis points were measurable. Now each quarter, you hear us comment on tender share, and we do so because it really is a fundamental metric to the success of our programs. And what may be helpful context here is these tender share gains we reference come from our legacy programs, and do not include any gains from our newer card programs. Put differently, the tender share gains we reference are results of increasing the number of trips, spend and card member retention from those card programs with us prior to 2013. 
Importantly, the average tenure of our 12 months active shopper is 5 years, and the sales distribution of our most tenured card members has been remarkably stable for 4 years. 
And I mentioned this because these are highly seasoned relationships and as such, we have great visibility into their past behavior, and that allows us to accurately predict how our card members will behave in the future. These gains are not a result of any widening, loosening or lessening of our credit standards. And is consistent increase in tender share is really a result of that data-driven targeted marketing no more sell more brand promise, and the increases this year are certainly a signal of card members growing engagement with our brand partners. 
Second, as expected, gross yields are normalizing and the year-over-year compression is lessening and with very good visibility into the remainder of the year, we expect to achieve our annual guidance for gross yields of 25.1% as well. 
Third, operating expenses grew 24% this quarter, while improving 40 basis points to 9.5% of our average card receivables. And even with this improvement, we continue to make investments in preparation for the onboarding of several new partners from diverse retail verticals. For example, we deliberately entered the high gross segment of fast fashion with our recently announced Forever 21 partnership. We look forward to announcing additional significant partnerships in the coming quarters. 
And this year as in years past, the new partnerships we will sign represent more than $2 billion in steady-state accounts receivable. Our pipeline remains robust as we continue to identify strong potential partners that are passionate about driving consumer engagement in line with the revolving need and view the card program as the ultimate loyalty tool. 
And fourth, our loss rate for the quarter came in at 5.1% in line with prior guidance, and we remain confident in achieving our guidance of a 5% loss rate for the full year. 
We continue to see success in this proven ability to drive stronger engagement and loyalty through our tailored marketing solutions driven largely by these data analytics, insights and innovative capabilities. 
Now speaking of engagement, let's spend just a moment to cover up on some of the brands we most recently on boarded. We're super enthusiastic about the progress of our newer partners. They're posting very strong results year-over-year, and I wanted to take just a moment to share 2 very specific examples. 
One partner experienced greater than as 70% increase in application volume and a credit sales jump of 37% thus driving tender share gains of more than 800 basis points with just a few months post conversion. And another important partners on tender share gains of 400 basis points and credit sales increases of 45% post-conversion. These gains are really due to our improved tools and stronger multi-channel engagement and are, again, testament to the increase to spend we generate for our brand partners. 
Now we also know that despite these strong program results, concerns still exist in the market around the strength and health of the U.S. consumer. Candidly, we are seeing very few signs of concern. Our view is that consumer confidence is stable, delinquency trends are within expected parameters, card retention is very strong, and we continue to find success in engaging brands and their customers. We are welcoming card members to our programs well the existing card members continue to spend across channel. 
Now if I can comment just a moment about the consumer spend. To be clear, they are spending and they are spending differently. 
For instance, in some categories, we see our digital credit sales, so those sales outside of the brick and mortar environment, growing significantly year-over-year specialty retail currently sees digital credit sales over 40%, which is certainly higher than digital sales for the brand and has been steadily climbing. 
Similarly, 67% of home to core credit sales now come through digital channels, nearly a 10% jump in just 2 years. Multi-channel shoppers, so those actively purchasing both in-store and digitally are our fastest-growing segment, and they are also the most valuable to our partners. These multi-channel shoppers spent twice as much as digital and single-channel shoppers and looking more broadly, nearly 4 out of 10 applications are now completed outside of the store, with mobile applications, in particular, the fastest-growing channel. This continuing shift to mobile is reflective of consumer behavior as it is the channel where she increasingly chooses to engage with her favorite brands. 
As early adopters in the mobile space, we've been innovating on this trend for many years and believe it will continue to accelerate. As such, our investment strategy remains focused on delivering [indiscernible] capabilities that bring the most value to card members and our brand partners, facilitating deeper loyalty and ultimately, increased spend. 
For example, our MyLoyalty app solution continues to help brands cater to, engage with, card members as they apply, shop, earn and redeem all through a seamless, intuitive and highly targeted customer experience. 
A newer capabilities such as the development of a proprietary mobile application experience that significantly reduces its customer time and effort serves the changing consumer who's looking for every into action to be fabulous. 
So in summary, Card Services has delivered another strong quarter, producing results in line with our high expectations. We're confident in our full year guidance around our loss rate, our yields have stabilized ahead of our expectations, and we remain confident in our consumer outlook and the overall quality and performance of our card members. 
Our investments and partnerships aligned to the evolving needs of both our brands customers and the retail landscape overall. That's demonstrating the value we bring to our partners through our broader retail heritage and our experienced lends to the market. 
Thanks so much. And Ed, I'll turn this over to you."

Why don't we turn to the second quarter store card, we'll try to wrap this up as neatly as we can. And we're going with the color-coded circles on the left. We're looking for more green than other colors, that would be a good thing. And as we are midway through the year, it looks like we're heading in the right direction. 
So to sort of sum it up on a consolidated basis, $1.75 billion in revs, up 17%, $3.68 in EPS, up 11%. 
I think for those of you who have been hearing Charles and I talk about how the year would play out, we talked about a Q1, sort of plus 5 top, plus 5 bottom, and then Q2, move into 8 and 8 and then eventually double-digit in the back half. The fact that we're at 17 in Q2 and 11 on the bottom in Q2 as well essentially means that we pulled -- we're running ahead by a quarter. So essentially, the back half has been accelerated and that essentially what you're seeing in Q2. We were -- we had some signs of things we're accelerating, but of course, we wanted to be able to deliver more careful into what actually played through. So I think the way to look at the quarter is it's not unexpected that we're running at double-digit. What was unexpected is that we're running a double-digit this early in the year. So that certainly takes the risk out of the back half of the year. We're nicely ahead of guidance, and in fact, we feel comfortable raising guidance at this point for the year. As Charles mentioned, the buyback, we're about halfway through and the year is about halfway through,and we'll leave it at that. 
Now let's turn to Card Services. Melisa talked extensively about performance once again. Very strong growth in the overall portfolio, and we do talk on and on about tender share because that is so important to us. That's sort of what makes or breaks our model versus other models out there and essentially, that is the ability of triggering an additional purchase or visit with a purchase by the shopper over and above what she would traditionally do. And that's all done through our data-driven marketing and targeting. 
And as most have talked about, 85% of this tender share gain is from very mature accounts. Folks have been with us for years and years and years. It's not a function of just pumping more plastic out into the marketplace, and that something that's important. 
So the model works. Probably the biggest surprise for the quarter in terms of good news was the gross yield certainly came in well ahead of expectations. 
Specifically, if you recall, Q1 is where we saw the compression in yields of 210 basis points. We suggested that we thought this would roll off as the year progressed, as we anniversary various programs. We actually saw a faster burn in Q2. And as a result, we picked up a very, very nice chunk of revenues from the gross yield compressor being less than expected. 
So put simply, we went from 200 basis points compression in Q1 all the way down to 80 basis points in Q2 and then we'll trickle ahead for the rest of the year a little bit better than that as the final programs burn through. 
So those probably the first good news surprise for the quarter. Losses, they're dead on. There is not a lot to talk about there. We talked about a 5% loss rate for the full year way back at the beginning of the year. We are dead on with that number as we look to the back half, so no surprises there. There's no big cliff heading our way out there, it's pretty straightforward and this is just normal account seasoning. And as Melisa said, there's no distress that we're  seeing in the consumers so a very straightforward on the loss side. 
And then obviously, what Melisa and I spend a lot of time on is what is the future look like? And the future, again, looks very promising. We've just announced thus Boscov’s, Forever 21, Children’s Place, Bed Bath & Beyond, Hot Topic. We probably have another half dozen that are signed, including a couple of biggies that we will be announcing in the back half of the year. So very, very robust signing season for Card Services. 
So I think that's it for cards. We move now on to Epsilon, where we have moved from a green yellow and red to now green and yellow, which I think is a good thing. And I probably would say the second, if you would call it piece of good news our surprise for the quarter, was that we knew Epsilon was turning and again, Epsilon includes both Epsilon core as well as the Conversant folks. And in Q1, obviously, it was a disappointing quarter. Revenues were down 2%. Our goal was to swing that to positive a couple of points by Q2 and then hit mid-single digits as we move into the back half and accelerate from there. Again, the news here was that the revenue acceleration occurred faster than we had anticipated and we actually swung from minus 2 to plus 5 between Q1 and Q2. So 7 points growth -- change in growth is quite a bit. And needless to say, we were pleased to see that. We expect that type of performance to continue, if not tick up as we go into the back half. And as Charles mentioned, the good news now is once we have a top line turned, the cost structure should play out as soon as the quarter we're in now, Q3. So essentially, as we've talked to people, we had a -- we're in the process over the last year of a very significant ramp up as we build up our in depth operation, and we had a lot of the duplicative cost, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. The bottom line is the flow through will begin in Q3 and that should put us in a very good shape for not only the back half, but more importantly, as we go into next year and the following year. So that would be what we call the Q3 flip for lack of a better term. 
And then I'd like to spend just a couple of seconds on Conversant. So Conversant became part of Alliance at the beginning of last year. And obviously, it was met with a fair amount of skepticism out there. Some of it made a lot of sense, some of it, we disagreed with. But at this point, if you look at the 3 pieces of Conversant, sort of the traditional Conversant before we went into how we reported today sort of mashed up with the core Epsilon, it has 3 pieces. The traditional Conversant had about a quarter of the business in agency and that is probably we're going to run down for the, year probably 15% or something like that. Then you have a quarter of the business that's what we call CJ affiliate, and that's running nicely at mid-single digits up and a very strong cash flow contributor. And then you have the biggest piece, half of Conversant, which is the data-driven CRM piece, and that is running between 40% and 50% for the year. And that is -- that's really the huge piece, and you obviously want your biggest piece to be fur fastest-grower. So if you put it all together, what you essentially have is in Q2, if you look at Conversant from a traditional perspective, you would have seen double-digit top consolidated of all 3 pieces and double-digit bottom. And I raise that because of the fact that, that was our goal. If we went back to the original pieces beyond the acquisition, we knew that the affiliate business is a good business, and we'll chug along. We knew that the agency business would be pressured, and we need to find a way to distinguish that from the other businesses. But primarily, the CRM business, we were hoping for the huge cross sell for the last of Alliance. That has happened, and that as a result, we are seeing sort of 10% top and bottom that the original deal was based upon. 
So as far as we're concerned, we hit our goals from the original deal. You look at BrandLoyalty, obviously, came out of the gate double-digit across-the-board right from the beginning of the acquisition, so the 2 deals we've done on the last 3, 4 years have performed quite nicely. Some started a little bit faster than others. But right now, both seem to be producing. And as we move into the LoyaltyOne segment, and we talk about BrandLoyalty. We mentioned in Q1 that it is a lumpy business, and we have good visibility on full year, but quarter-by-quarter, it's difficult. But needless to say, Q2 was fairly impressive with revenue up over 40% and EBITDA up over 100%. So that was obviously, a very big quarter for BrandLoyalty. We think we probably don't want to keep that as a run rate going forward, although I'd love to, but I think mid-teens top and bottom would be a good numbers set of number for the year. 
Also as Charles mentioned, the BrandLoyalty U.S. pilot has been completed, has been very successful. We need to be able to careful about chatting about what's next, but we have very high hopes in terms of upcoming activity in the U.S. 
Now let's turn to Canada and AIR MILES' revenue was up 6% and I believe it was up 5% in Q1. EBITDA for Q2 was up 4% and EBITDA in Q1 was up 11%. 
So I think the bottom line of all of it is that there's been murmurs out there that the Canadian business is too mature and that it's not really going anywhere and that it's very sluggish. This is a solid mid-single-digit top and bottom with very strong cash flow generation. This is a great business, and I think it's going to be around for a long time, and that's why we keep it firmly as part of the assets within Alliance, so very pleased with that issuance. Again, jumps by quarter. It was up 5% in Q1, it was down 3% in Q2. I think on a full year basis, we're still shooting for somewhere around 4% or something like that. So overall, we did have over performance versus guidance. It came from 3 areas. First, on the top line basis, Epsilon's revenues swung faster than we had anticipated, 7-point swing versus we were looking at more like 4 or 5. 
Second, in Card Services, yields came in better than expected as we saw the burn through of these programs occur faster, and that was good news. 
And then finally, on the bottom line, it didn't help top line, but on the bottom line, as Charles said, we accelerated the opportunity to take the final 20% of BrandLoyalty and that added a few pennies in addition to the other stuff. 
So probably those 3 things drove the over performance, but in general, really, across the board, it was a really good story. 
I think on a full year basis, let's just jump to that. We are raising full year guidance to revenues of $7.15 billion, up 11%. Core EPS of $16.85, up 12% and the new guidance does reflect the flow through of the second quarter be to our guidance. And we'll flow through additional over performance, if any, if it occurs in the back half of the year. 
Essentially, this year has been playing out, neither Charles nor I want to get too far out over our skis here so what we're effectively doing is we'll flow through the over performance when it comes, but let's not go charging down the road too quickly right now. Certainly, things are heading in the right direction, there's an upward bias to the even existing guidance, but when it comes, we'll flow it through. You can think of it almost as a hedge against foreign exchange rates going wonky, again. We don't want to have to recut and go through all that stuff, again. But in general, back half looks good, second quarter, obviously, double double look very good. 
Card Services, we still expect double-digit growth, top and bottom for the year. Yield compression, we'll continue to lessen each quarter, and we went from 2 10 to 80, and it will continue to lessen as the final 2 quarters play out, which gives us, again, from where Melisa and I said a very nice jump up points for next year. 
Principal loss rates, a lot of chatter out there in the marketplace, losses are going up, they're going up faster, they're going up slower. It's pretty straightforward. We're seeing the seasoning we thought at the beginning of the year, we'll do 5% and then the other 50 basis points next year. So we're not seeing any consumer distress and the new vintages that we're signing, we have already completed the $2 billion in signings we needed for the full year this year. So it's only July, but again, a wonderful year. 
Epsilon, revenue growth rate snapped back to mid-single. We expect that to drift up a bit and improve and even Q3 in Q4 at the moment and continues. We expect the revenue flow through to EBITDA starting as soon as Q3 as India is fully ramped up. And again, we'll call it the Q3 flip. 
Digital & technology  businesses are hot. As Charles mentioned, double-digit growth, it's 3 quarters of Epsilon-Conversant so it's by far, the largest chunk of it, and it is doing extremely well. 
The final piece, the quarter of the business that's agency and media and media services, again, better than Q1, still has some work to do. We have a number of initiatives underway. I guess, the overall way to think about Epsilon and Conversant is that we manage a portfolio of products and services that can range from products that are in decline 15%, 20% to those that are going over 60%. The goal here is to manage to a way that average growth rate into the mid- to high single digits. And so I think we're back on track there. 
And on the agency side specifically, we have a number of initiatives underway, specifically sort of a data-driven CRM light if you want to call it for clients who don't want to do the full scale heavy-duty CRM offering, but also potentially looking at maybe a white label type approach to the platform, offering up to the mid-tier and smaller agencies that can afford to bring all that stuff in-house. So again, I think there's a bunch of good stuff going on there that we're still feeling pretty optimistic about it. 
Finally, and then we'll take some questions, LoyaltyOne. We expect mid-single-digit growth in revenue on a constant currency basis. And as I said, this is a -- it's a good business, and it continues to get good traction up there. 
AIR MILES issued also about 4% and then, of course, BrandLoyalty strong double-digit top and bottom line growth as the business continues to expand globally. 
All right, overall, if you were to look at the bigger picture, in the longer-term picture, you would see that if you went from the year before the Great Recession and then including the Great Recession and all the way up to last year, this company has delivered top line growth averaging 15% a year and bottom line growth, of core EPS growth of 18% a year. And again, that includes the Great Recession. So it's not all that surprising that we're already back to double-digit top and bottom. Again, I think it's recorded ahead of schedule, but we are raising guidance and expect to be running at plus 11 and plus 12 for rev and core EPS. It's the ability to grow our core EPS by double digits despite being in a period of normalization in our card business. So what does that all mean? Would it essentially means is we're dumping a whole bunch of P&L expense, not cash expense but P&L expense into our reserves as losses normalize and as we are growing 20-plus percent, it's a big drag on our numbs, and you're talking a couple hundred million dollars and what that effectively does is that knocks 10 points off our of growth rate. And so even in its big higher growth period with big reserve builds, we're still able to deliver double-digit top and bottom, that's pretty good. And so if we can do plus 11 top, plus 12 bottom, essentially in a period where you're done seasoning in loss rate to stable, that would have been plus 11 and plus 22. So that's the order of magnitude here. Our goal is even in a seasoning period, which is what we're in now, we still expect to deliver double top, double bottom. 
Okay. So I think that our business outlook looks good, and I think if we don't have anything else here, we just might go to Q&A. Obviously, you can tell from our tone that what once was a very heavily weighted back in this year is no longer the case, and we're feeling pretty cheerful about it. 
So why don't we open it up to Q&A?"

Because the goal of that part of the business was originally to go out and find inventory, an appropriate inventory where we could place the various advertisements and messaging. And so as that has happened in programmatic trading and everything else has come into play, what we're looking at and where we think there's a big opportunity is there's a lot of clients out there who love the huge CRM type offering that requires them to give us the SKU level information, both online, off line. We take that, we turn it to the big machines, we find the right patterns, we go out and place those with the appropriate folks out in the digital space. But there's also, we believe, a huge chunk of folks, clients out there who don't necessarily want or need the whole soup to nuts that we offer with big CRM as we call it. So I'm going to call it CRM light, which is where you use some data. So for example, client me just say, look, I'm having a big sale, it's going to be in the southeast region of the country. I want to go out and I want to find these folks who are most likely to visit. Here's my email list, could you go out, use that data and let everyone know that's appropriate about the sale and what's going on? And that's a much smaller commitment from the client, and we think that's a good way to get them in the door and hopefully, eventually up sell to big CRM. So the long-winded answer is, if we can do that, along with our partners at, let's say, the mid-tier agencies who can afford to build these massive trading platforms, programmatic type platforms, that this could be a nice winner and a nice feeder as well into the CRM. We've already started the retraining of our agency sales folks into CRM. And so we expect this thing to start taking root really towards the back half of the year. So hopefully, we'll see some results before we exit this year."

And in the Great Recession, what actually happened was that even though Private Label tends -- it always has run a point-or-so above loss rates in sort of the general-purpose arena. What actually happened in the Great Recession is we performed a lot better in the general-purpose cards, and so what it really hit the fan, the general-purpose cards, those portfolios went from 4%, 5% to 10% or 11% loss rate. I mean, 600 basis points. We went up 300 and the reason behind that is why, I guess, we don't share the concern that others do about Private Label and everything else is the fact that for sure, it's a card that doesn't have utilization of a general-purpose card but that's great in terms of when times get stretched because of the fact that you do not have a big open up byline, and you do not have the ability to go use it to buy food and put gas in the gas and then go bankrupt. So what you're seeing is there may be lots of cards out there, but as you go down the credit spectrum, you bring down your credit lines, and so you may have $100 credit line on someone with a thin file and that the ability to manage or open to buy and your credit lines across 40 million households is what allowed us to really manage to a very modest hit during the Great Recession, and that's why I think we don't expect to see any spike because we are very active in terms of managing credit lines."

Another positive during the quarter was the opportunity to acquire earlier than scheduled the remaining 20% ownership in BrandLoyalty. It made sense to us as the company's performance has exceeded all of our expectations and the opportunity in North America looks very compelling.
Accordingly, we acquired the remaining interest effective April 1, 2016, for approximately $259 million in consideration, which was funded by upside in BrandLoyalty's credit facility. 
Now the accounting is little unique, because the remaining ownership was purchased prior to the 10% tranches scheduled for January 17 and January 18, the consideration paid exceeded the current value of the redeemable now controlling interest from the balance sheet, which would have increased over the next 1.5 years to roughly equal the purchase price paid. The difference of $68 million is an immediate charge to retain earnings on the balance sheet but nonetheless, it's considered in the calculation of EPS, which was reduced by $1.14. Excluding this charge, EPS increased 13% for the second quarter. 
What does the early acquisition means to ADS? From the revenue standpoint, nothing as we already consolidated 100% of BrandLoyalty's revenue. From a profitability standpoint, it will add a few cents to our EPS and our core EPS for 2016. 
Turning to the repurchase program. We've acquired approximately 2.6 million shares under our repurchase program year-to-date. We have approximately 460 million of our board authorization left, which we expect to use somewhat ratably over the remainder of 2016. 
Let's go to Page 3 and talk about LoyaltyOne. LoyaltyOne had a very strong second quarter as revenue increased 17% to $352 million and adjusted EBITDA increased 20% to $79 million. Negative FX translation rates knocked about 2 points upgrowth off for the second quarter, but on a positive note, we do not expect any FX drag in the second half of 2016 if current spot rates hold. 
AIR MILES' revenue increased 6% on a constant currency basis, driven by an 8% increase in miles redeemed. 
AIR MILES issued declined 3% versus the same quarter last year, which was expected. As you may recall, we converted Sobeys legacy reward program into the AIR MILES reward program in the second quarter of 2015. That makes for a difficult year-over-year comparable. 
In addition, we had less promotional activity in the grocery vertical this year. AIR MILES redeemed increased 8% compared to the second quarter 2015, primarily driven by AM Cash or instant reward option. 
In particular, we are seeing growth in in-store redemptions, which are popular at our AIR MILES grocery partners. 
Moving to BrandLoyalty. Revenue increased 44% on a constant currency basis, driven by an increase in the number of short-term loyalty programs executed during the quarter. 
Continued expansion into new markets such as South Africa and New Zealand contributed growth. The pilot recently executed with the top 3 grocery in the U.S. finished with very strong results, as pilot stores showed revenue growth approximately 1.5% higher than non-pilot stores. 
This was accomplished largely through an increased basket sizes. Plans are currently underway with this grocery to extend the program to the full store network at later day. Additional pilot programs in the U.S. and Canada are also planned for the back half of this year. Overall, a terrific quarter. 
Now let's flip over to the next slide and talk about Epsilon. Epsilon's revenue increased 5% to $519 million for the second quarter, a solid turn from the revenue decline of 2% in the first quarter of 2016. 
Adjusted EBITDA decreased 9% to $103 million, primarily due to duplicative costs in R&D operation and severance costs. We expect these costs to abate during the third quarter allowing the full flow through of revenue to EBITDA. 
Our digital and technology platforms businesses is hot, posting robust 14% growth versus the prior year. This performance was supported by solid contributions from all offerings in this category with our automotive platform and Conversant CRM business leading the way. 
In addition, solid traction in the affiliate business and strong new business within our Harmony platform added momentum. 
In particular, Conversant CRM business with industry-leading cross-device recognition and reach had a terrific quarter with revenue of 66% and a building backlog that should exceed the book of business we won in 2015 with over 20 new clients signed and launched in the first half, including Zales, Beach Body, Justice and White House Black Market. 
Our agency media & services business continues to struggle as revenue declined 15% versus the prior year. This offering has been weak for several quarters due to a combination of decreased spending by large customer in our traditional agency and lower volume of digital media buys from large third party agencies. 
In response, 3 initiatives were started during the second quarter. The first to adjust the cost structure commensurate with lower revenue expectations that is largely complete. The second, which is the longer-term initiative is to redirect digital agency toward mid side agencies and maybe direct to clients. Third, we begun pivoting this offering to our data-driven marketing and insights, thus creating a CRM-like solution for clients who aren't ready yet for full CRM. Early results were encouraging as we've begun to gain traction in new verticals such as media and entertainment.
Overall, we see 2 key market trends aligned well with Epsilon's core strategy: demands from CMOs for measurable results and the ongoing shift from traditional marketing channels to digital and data-driven channels. With a highly differentiated digital and offline data asset, a rich portfolio of services and its deep marketing advertising technology stack, the business is poised to resume healthy steady growth. 
Topic declines are growing at a high single-digit rate and the business has robust topline. Paired with prudent cost management initiatives currently underway, we expect to see the return to profitable growth in the back half of 2016 and exit the year with a healthier cost structure going into 2017. 
I will now turn it over to Melisa to talk about Card Services."

I am so pleased to highlight that the Card Services business had another quarter of strong performance, delivering the 18th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. 
Revenues are up 25% over the last year, translating to a 10% increase in adjusted EBITDA net of funding costs. 
Let's turn now to Page 6 and go over some of the key drivers of the strong performance. First, credit sales were up 18%, resulting in year-over-year tender share gains of 180 basis points were measurable. Now each quarter, you hear us comment on tender share, and we do so, because it really is a fundamental metric to the success of our programs. And what may be helpful context here is these tender share gains we reference come from our legacy programs, and do not include any gains from our newer card programs. Put differently, the tender share gains we reference are result of increasing the number of trips, spend and card member retention from those card programs with us prior to 2013. 
Importantly, the average tenure of our 12-month active shopper is 5 years, and the sales distribution of our most tenured card members has been remarkably stable for 4 years. 
And I mentioned this because these are highly seasoned relationships and as such, we have great visibility into their past behavior, and that allows us to accurately predict how our card members will behave in the future. These gains are not a result of any widening, loosening or lessening of our credit standards. And is consistent increase in tender share is really a result of that data-driven targeted marketing no more sell more brand promise, and the increases here are certainly a signal of card members growing engagement with our brand partners. 
Second, as expected, gross yields are normalizing, and the year-over-year compression is lessening. And with very good visibility into the remainder of the year, we expect to achieve our annual guidance for gross yields of 25.1% as well. 
Third, operating expenses grew 24% this quarter, while improving 40 basis points to 9.5% of our average card receivables. And even with this improvement, we continue to make investments in preparation for the onboarding of several new partners from diverse retail verticals. For example, we deliberately entered the high gross segment of fast fashion with our recently announced Forever 21 partnership. We look forward to announcing additional significant partnerships in the coming quarters.
And this year as in years past, the new partnerships we will sign represent more than $2 billion in steady-state accounts receivable. Our pipeline remains robust as we continue to identify strong potential partners that are passionate about driving consumer engagement in line with the revolving need and view the card program as the ultimate loyalty tool.
And fourth, our loss rate for the quarter came in at 5.1% in line with prior guidance, and we remain confident in achieving our guidance of a 5% loss rate for the full year. 
We continue to see success in this proven ability to drive stronger engagement and loyalty through our tailored marketing solutions driven largely by deep data analytics, insights and innovative capabilities. 
Now speaking of engagement, let's spend just a moment to cover off on some of the brands we most recently onboarded. We're super enthusiastic about the progress of our newer partners. They're posting very strong results year-over-year. And I wanted to take just a moment to share 2 very specific examples. One partner experienced greater than a 70% increase in application volume and a credit sales jump of 37%. This driving tender share gains of more than 800 basis points with just a few months post conversion. And another important partner saw tender share gains of 400 basis points and credit sales increases of 45% post conversion. These gains are really due to our improved tools and stronger multi-channel engagement and are, again, testament to the increase spend we generate for our brand partners. 
Now we also know that despite these strong program results, concerns still exist in the market around the strength and health of the U.S. consumer. Candidly, we are seeing very few signs of concern. Our view is that consumer confidence is stable, delinquency trends are within expected parameters, card retention is very strong, and we continue to find success in engaging brands and their customers. We are welcoming new card members to our programs, while the existing card members continue to spend across channel. 
Now if I can comment just a moment about the consumer spend. To be clear, they are spending and they are spending differently. For instance, in some categories, we see our digital credit sales, so those sales outside of the brick-and-mortar environment growing significantly year-over-year. Specialty retail currently sees digital credit sales over 40%, which is certainly higher than digital sales for the brand and has been steadily climbing. 
Similarly, 67% of home to core credit sales now come through digital channels, nearly a 10% jump in just 2 years. Multi-channel shoppers, so those actively purchasing both in-store and digitally are our fastest-growing segment, and they are also the most valuable to our partners. These multi-channel shoppers spent twice as much as digital and single-channel shoppers. And looking more broadly, nearly 4 out of 10 applications are now completed outside of the store, with mobile applications, in particular, the fastest growing channel. This continuing shift to mobile is reflective of consumer behavior as it is the channel where she increasingly chooses to engage with her favorite brands. 
As early adopters in the mobile space, we've been innovating on this trend for many years and believe it will continue to accelerate. As such, our investment strategy remains focused on delivering inventive capabilities that bring the most value to card members and to our brand partners, facilitating deeper loyalty and ultimately, increased spend. 
For example, our MyLoyalty app solution continues to help brands cater to, engage with, card members as they apply, shop, earn and redeem all through a seamless, intuitive and highly targeted customer experience. 
A newer capability such as the development of a proprietary mobile application experience that significantly reduces customer time and effort, serves the changing consumer who's looking for every interaction to be effortless. 
So in summary, Card Services has delivered another strong quarter, producing results in line with our high expectations. We're confident in our full year guidance around our loss rate, our yields have stabilized ahead of our expectations, and we remain confident in our consumer outlook and the overall quality and performance of our card members. 
Our investments and partnerships aligned to the evolving needs of both our brands customers and the retail landscape overall, that's demonstrating the value we bring to our partners through our broader retail heritage and our experienced lends to the market. 
Thank you so much. And Ed, I'll turn this over to you."

We'll try to wrap this up as neatly as we can. And we're going with the color-coded circles on the left. We're looking for more green than other colors, that would be a good thing. And as we are midway through the year, it looks like we're heading in the right direction. 
So to sort of sum it up on a consolidated basis, $1.75 billion in revs, up 17%, $3.68 on EPS, up 11%. 
I think for those of you who have been hearing Charles and I talked about how the year would play out, we talked about Q1, sort of plus 5 top, plus 5 bottom, and then Q2, move into 8 and 8 and then eventually double-digit in the back half. The fact that we're at 17 in Q2 and 11 on the bottom in Q2 as well, essentially means that we pulled -- we're running ahead by a quarter. So essentially, the back half has been accelerated and that essentially what you're seeing in Q2. We were -- we had some signs of things we're accelerating but, of course, we wanted to be a little more careful into what actually played through. So I think the easiest way to look at the quarter is it's not unexpected that we're running at double-digit, what was unexpected is that we're running at double-digit this early in the year. So that certainly takes the risk out of the back half of the year. We're nicely ahead of guidance, and in fact, we feel comfortable raising guidance at this point for the year. As Charles mentioned, the buyback, we're about halfway through and the year is about halfway through, and we'll leave it at that. 
Now let's turn to Card Services. Melisa talked extensively about performance. Once again, very strong growth in the overall portfolio, and we do talk on and on about tender share because that is so important to us. That's sort of what makes or breaks our model versus other models out there and essentially, that is the ability of triggering an additional purchase or visit with a purchase by the shopper over and above what she would traditionally do. And that's all done through our data-driven marketing and targeting.
And as most have talked about, 85% of this tender share gain is from very mature accounts. Folks have been with us for years and years and years. It's not a function of just pumping more plastic out into the marketplace, and that's something that's important. So the model works. 
Probably the biggest surprise for the quarter in terms of good news was the gross yield certainly came in well ahead of expectations. 
Specifically, if you recall, Q1 is where we saw the compression in yields of 210 basis points. We suggested that we thought this would roll off as the year progressed, as we anniversaried various programs. We actually saw a faster burn-in in Q2, and as a result, we picked up a very, very nice chunk of revenues from the gross yield compression being less than expected.
So put simply, we went from 200 basis points compression in Q1 all the way down to 80 basis points in Q2 and then we'll trickle ahead for the rest of the year a little bit better than that as the final programs burn through. So that was probably the first good news surprise for the quarter. 
Losses, they're dead on. There is not a lot to talk about there. We talked about a 5% loss rate for the full year way back at the beginning of the year. We are dead on with that number as we look to the back half, so no surprises there. There is no big cliff heading our way out there. It's pretty straightforward. And this is just normal account seasoning. And as Melisa said, there is no distress that we're seeing in the consumers. So very straightforward on the loss side. 
And then obviously, what Melisa and I spend a lot of time on is what is the future look like. And the future, again, looks very promising. We've just announced thus far Boscov’s, Forever 21, Children’s Place, Bed Bath & Beyond, Hot Topic. We probably have another half dozen that are signed, including a couple of biggies that we will be announcing in the back half of the year. So very, very robust signing season for Card Services.
So I think that's it for cards. We move now on to Epsilon, where we have moved from green, yellow and red to now green and yellow, which I think is a good thing. And I probably would say the second, if you would call it piece of good news or a surprise for the quarter, was that we knew Epsilon was turning and again, Epsilon includes both Epsilon core as well as the Conversant folks. And in Q1, obviously, it was a disappointing quarter. Revenues were down 2%. Our goal was to swing that to positive a couple of points by Q2 and then hit mid-single digits as we move into the back half and accelerate from there. Again, the news here was that the revenue acceleration occurred faster than we had anticipated, and we actually swung from minus 2 to plus 5 between Q1 and Q2. So 7 points growth -- change in growth is quite a bit. And needless to say, we were pleased to see that. We expect that type of performance to continue, if not tick up as we go into the back half. And as Charles mentioned, the good news now is once we have a top line turned, the cost structure should play out as soon as the quarter we're in now, Q3. So essentially, as we've talked to people, we had a -- we're in the process over the last year of a very significant ramp up as we build up our India operation, and we had a lot of duplicative costs, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Bottom line is the flow through will begin in Q3 and that should put us in very good shape for not only the back half but more importantly as we go into next year and the following year. So that would be what we call the Q3 flip for lack of a better term. 
And then I'd like to spend just a couple of seconds on Conversant. So Conversant became part of Alliance at the beginning of last year. And obviously, it was met with a fair amount of skepticism out there. Some of it made a lot of sense, some of it, we disagreed with. But at this point, if you looked at the 3 pieces of Conversant, sort of the traditional Conversant before we went into how we reported today sort of mashed up with the core Epsilon, it has 3 pieces. And the traditional Conversant had about a quarter of the business in agency and that is probably we're going to run down for the year, probably 15% or something like that. Then you have a quarter of the business that's what we call CJ affiliate, and that's running nicely at mid-single digits up and as a very strong cash flow contributor. And then you have the biggest piece, half of Conversant, which is the data-driven CRM piece, and that is running between 40% and 50% for the year. And that is -- that's really the huge piece, and you obviously want your biggest piece to be your fastest grower. So if you put it all together, what you essentially have is in Q2. If you look at Conversant from a traditional perspective, you would have seen double-digit top consolidated with -- of all 3 pieces and double-digit bottom. And I raise that because of the fact that, that was our goal. If we went back to the original thesis behind the acquisition, we knew that the affiliate business is a good business, and we'll chug along. We knew that the agency business would be pressured, and we'd need to find a way to distinguish that from other businesses. But primarily, the CRM business, we were hoping for the huge cross sell to the rest of Alliance. That has happened, and as a result, we are seeing sort of 10% top and bottom that the original deal was based upon.
So as far as we're concerned, we hit our goals from the original deal. You look at BrandLoyalty, obviously, came out of the gate double-digit across-the-board right from the beginning of the acquisition, so the 2 deals we've done on the last 3, 4 years have performed quite nicely. Some started a little bit faster than others. But right now, both seem to be producing. And as we move into the LoyaltyOne segment, and we talk about BrandLoyalty. We mentioned in Q1 that it is a lumpy business, and we have good visibility on full year, but quarter-by-quarter, it's difficult. But needless to say, Q2 was fairly impressive with revenue up over 40% and EBITDA up over 100%. So that was obviously a very big quarter for BrandLoyalty. We think we probably don't want to keep that as a run rate going forward, although I'd love to, but I think mid-teens top and bottom would be a good numb, set of numbs for the year. 
Also as Charles mentioned, the BrandLoyalty U.S. pilot has been completed, has been very successful. We need to be a little careful about chatting about what's next, but we have very high hopes in terms of upcoming activity in the U.S. 
Now let's turn to Canada and AIR MILES' revenue was up 6%, and I believe it was up 5% in Q1. EBITDA for Q2 was up 4% and EBITDA in Q1 was up 11%.
So I think the bottom line of all of it is that there's been murmurs out there that the Canadian business is premature and that it's not really going anywhere and that it's very sluggish. This is a solid mid-single-digit top and bottom with very strong cash flow generation. This is a great business, and I think it's going to be around for a long time, and that's why we keep it firmly as part of the assets within Alliance, so very pleased with that issuance. Again, jumps by quarter. It was up 5% in Q1. It was down 3% in Q2. I think on a full year basis, we're still shooting for somewhere around 4% or something like that. 
So overall, we did have overperformance versus guidance. It came from 3 areas. First, on the top line basis, Epsilon's revenues swung faster than we had anticipated, 7-point swing versus we were looking at more like 4 or 5. 
Second, in Card Services, yields came in better than expected, as we saw the burn through of these programs occur faster, and that was good news. 
And then finally, on the bottom line, it didn't help top line, but on the bottom line, as Charles said, we accelerated the opportunity to take the final 20% of BrandLoyalty and that added a few pennies in addition to the other stuff. 
So probably those 3 things drove the overperformance, but in general, really across the board, it was a really good story. 
I think on a full year basis, let's just jump to that. We are raising full year guidance to revenues of $7.15 billion, up 11%. Core EPS of $16.85, up 12% and the new guidance does reflect the flow through of the second quarter be to our guidance. And we'll flow through additional overperformance, if any, if it occurs in the back half of the year. 
Essentially, this year has been playing out, neither Charles nor I want to get too far out over our skews here, so what we're effectively doing is we'll flow through the overperformance when it comes, but let's not go charging down the road too quickly right now. Certainly, things are heading in the right direction. There's an upward bias to even the existing guidance, but when it comes, we'll flow it through. You can think of it almost as a hedge against if foreign exchange rates start going wonky again. We don't want to -- we have to recut and go through all that stuff again. But in general, back half looks good. Second quarter, obviously, double double, look very good. 
Card Services, we still expect double-digit growth, top and bottom for the year. Yield compression, we'll continue to lessen each quarter, and we went from 210 to 80, and it will continue to lessen as the final 2 quarters play out, which gives us, again, from where Melisa and I said a very nice jump of point for next year. 
Principal loss rates, a lot of chatter out there in the marketplace, losses are going up. They're going up faster. They're going up slower. It's pretty straightforward. We're seeing the seasoning. We thought at the beginning of the year, we'll do 5% and then the other 50 basis points next year. So we're not seeing any consumer distress. And the new vintages that we're signing, we have already completed the $2 billion in signings we needed for the full year this year. So it's only July, but again, a wonderful year. 
Epsilon, revenue growth rate snapped back to mid-single. We expect that to drift up a bit and improve in even Q3 in Q4 at the moment and continues. We expect the revenue flow through to EBITDA starting as soon as Q3 as India is fully ramped up. And again, we'll call it the Q3 flip.
Digital & technology businesses are hot. As Charles mentioned, double-digit growth. It's 3 quarters of Epsilon-Conversant, so it's by far the largest chunk of it, and it is doing extremely well. 
The final piece, the quarter of the business that's agency media and media services, again, better than Q1, still has some work to do. We have a number of initiatives underway. I guess, the overall way to think about Epsilon and Conversant is that we manage a portfolio of products and services that can range from products that are in decline 15%, 20% to those that are growing over 60%. The goal here is to manage to a way that average growth rate into the mid- to high single digits. And so I think we're back on track there. 
And on the agency side specifically, we have a number of initiatives underway, specifically sort of a data-driven CRM light if you want to call it for clients who don't want to do the full scale heavy-duty CRM offering, but also potentially looking at maybe a white label type approach to the platform, offering up to the mid-tier and smaller agencies that can afford to bring all that stuff in-house. So again, I think there is a bunch of good stuff going on there that we're still feeling pretty optimistic about it. 
Finally, and then we'll take some questions. LoyaltyOne, we expect mid-single-digit growth in revenue on a constant currency basis. And as I said, this is a -- it's a good business, and it continues to get good traction up there. 
AIR MILES issued also about 4% and then, of course, BrandLoyalty strong double-digit top and bottom line growth as the business continues to expand globally.
All right, overall, if you were to look at the bigger picture, in the longer-term picture, you would see that if you went from the year before the Great Recession, then including the Great Recession and all the way up to last year, this company has delivered top line growth averaging 15% a year and bottom line growth, a core EPS growth of 18% a year again and that includes the Great Recession. So it's not all that surprising that we're already back to double-digit top and bottom. Again, I think it's recorded ahead of schedule, but we are raising guidance and expect to be running at plus 11 and plus 12 for rev and core EPS. It's the ability to grow our core EPS by double digits despite being in a period of normalization in our card business. So what does that all mean? What it essentially means is we're dumping a whole bunch of P&L expense, not cash expense but P&L expense into our reserves as losses normalize and as we are growing 20-plus percent, it's a big drag on our numbs, and you're talking a couple of hundred million dollars, and what that effectively does is that knocks 10 points off our of growth rate. And so even in its big high growth period with big reserve builds, we're still able to deliver double-digit top and bottom, that's pretty good. And so if we can do plus 11 top, plus 12 bottom, essentially in a period where you're done seasoning in loss rate to stable, that would have been plus 11 and plus 22. So that's the order of magnitude here. Our goal is even in a seasoning period, which is what we're in now, we still expect to deliver double top, double bottom. 
Okay. So I think that our business outlook looks good, and I think if we don't have anything else here, we might just go to Q&A. Obviously, you can tell from our tone that what once was a very heavily weighted back in year is now no longer the case, and we're feeling pretty cheerful about it. 
So why don't we open it up to Q&A?"

Because the goal of that part of the business is -- was originally to go out and find inventory, an appropriate inventory where we could place the various advertisements and messaging. And so as that has happened in programmatic trading and everything else has come into play, what we're looking at and where we think there is a big opportunity is there is a lot of clients out there who love the huge CRM-type offering that requires them to give us the SKU level information, both online, off-line. We take that. We turn it to the big machines. We find the right patterns. We go out and place those with the appropriate folks out on -- out in the digital space. But there is also, we believe, a huge chunk of folks, clients out there who don't necessarily want or need the whole soup to nuts that we offer with big CRM as we call it. So I'm going to call it CRM light, which is where you'll use some data. So for example, a client may just say, look, I'm having a big sale. It's going to be in the southeast region of the country. I want to go out and I want to find those folks who are most likely to visit. Here's my email list, could you go out, use that data and let everyone know that's appropriate about the sale and what's going on? And that's a much smaller commitment from the client, and we think that's a good way to get them in the door and hopefully, eventually up sell to big CRM. So the long-winded answer is, if we can do that, along with our partners at, let's say, the mid-tier agencies who can afford to build these massive trading platforms, programmatic-type platforms, that this could be a nice winner and a nice feeder as well into big CRM. We've already started the retraining of our agency sales folks into CRM. And so we expect this thing to start taking root really towards the back half of the year. So hopefully, we'll see some results before we exit this year."

I think probably the biggest stress test that anyone has ever faced was the Great Recession. And in the Great Recession, what actually happened was that even though Private Label tends to -- it always has run a point-or-so above loss rates in sort of the general-purpose arena. What actually happened in the Great Recession is we performed a lot better in the general-purpose cards. And so what it really hit the fan, the general-purpose cards, those portfolios went from 4%, 5% to 10% or 11% loss rate. I mean, 600 basis points. We went up 300 and the reason behind that is why, I guess, we don't share the concern that others do about Private Label and everything else is the fact that for sure, it's a card that doesn't have utilization of a general-purpose card but that's great in terms of when times get stretched because of the fact that you do not have a big open up buy line, and you do not have the ability to go use it to buy food and put gas in the car and then go bankrupt. So what you're seeing is there may be lots of cards out there, but as you go down the credit spectrum, you bring down your credit lines, and so you may have $100 credit line on someone with a thin file and that ability to manage or open to buy in your credit lines across 40 million households is what allowed us to really manage to a very modest hit during the Great Recession, and that's why I think we don't expect to see any spike, because we are very active in terms of managing credit lines."

Another positive during the quarter was the opportunity to acquire earlier than scheduled the remaining 20% ownership in BrandLoyalty. It made sense to us as the company's performance has exceeded all of our expectations and the opportunity in North America looks very compelling.
Accordingly, we acquired the remaining interest effective April 1, 2016, for approximately $259 million in consideration, which was funded by upside in BrandLoyalty's credit facility. 
Now the accounting is little unique, because the remaining ownership was purchased prior to the 10% tranches scheduled for January 17 and January 18, the consideration paid exceeded the current value of the redeemable non-controlling interest from the balance sheet, which would have increased over the next 1.5 years to roughly equal the purchase price paid. The difference of $68 million is an immediate charge to retain earnings on the balance sheet but nonetheless, it's considered in the calculation of EPS, which was reduced by $1.14. Excluding this charge, EPS increased 13% for the second quarter. 
What does the early acquisition mean to ADS? From the revenue standpoint, nothing, as we already consolidated 100% of BrandLoyalty's revenue. From a profitability standpoint, it will add a few cents to our EPS and our core EPS for 2016. 
Turning to the repurchase program. We've acquired approximately 2.6 million shares under our repurchase program year-to-date. We have approximately 460 million of our board authorization left, which we expect to use somewhat ratably over the remainder of 2016. 
Let's go to Page 3 and talk about LoyaltyOne. LoyaltyOne had a very strong second quarter as revenue increased 17% to $352 million and adjusted EBITDA increased 20% to $79 million. Negative FX translation rates knocked about 2 points upgrowth off for the second quarter, but on a positive note, we do not expect any FX drag in the second half of 2016 if current spot rates hold. 
AIR MILES' revenue increased 6% on a constant currency basis, driven by an 8% increase in miles redeemed. 
AIR MILES issued declined 3% versus the same quarter last year, which was expected. As you may recall, we converted Sobeys legacy reward program into the AIR MILES reward program in the second quarter of 2015. That makes for a difficult year-over-year comparable. 
In addition, we had less promotional activity in the grocery vertical this year. AIR MILES redeemed increased 8% compared to the second quarter 2015, primarily driven by AM Cash, or instant reward option. 
In particular, we are seeing growth in in-store redemptions, which are popular at our AIR MILES grocery partners. 
Moving to BrandLoyalty. Revenue increased 44% on a constant currency basis, driven by an increase in the number of short-term loyalty programs executed during the quarter. 
Continued expansion into new markets such as South Africa and New Zealand contributed growth. The pilot recently executed with the top 3 grocers in the U.S. finished with very strong results, as pilot stores showed revenue growth approximately 1.5% higher than non-pilot stores. 
This was accomplished largely through an increased basket sizes. Plans are currently underway with this grocery to extend the program to the full store network at later day. Additional pilot programs in the U.S. and Canada are also planned for the back half of this year. Overall, a terrific quarter. 
Now let's flip over to the next slide and talk about Epsilon. Epsilon's revenue increased 5% to $519 million for the second quarter, a solid turn from the revenue decline of 2% in the first quarter of 2016. 
Adjusted EBITDA decreased 9% to $103 million, primarily due to duplicative costs in R&D operation and severance costs. We expect these costs to abate during the third quarter allowing the full flow through of revenue to EBITDA. 
Our digital and technology platforms business is hot, posting robust 14% growth versus the prior year. This performance was supported by solid contributions from all offerings in this category, with our automotive platform and Conversant CRM business leading the way. 
In addition, solid traction in the affiliate business and strong new business within our Harmony platform added to the momentum. 
In particular, Conversant CRM business, with industry-leading cross-device recognition and reach, had a terrific quarter, with revenue up 66% and a building backlog that should exceed the book of business we won in 2015, with over 20 new clients signed and launched in the first half, including Zales, Beach Body, Justice and White House Black Market. 
Our agency media & services business continues to struggle as revenue declined 15% versus the prior year. This offering has been weak for several quarters due to a combination of decreased spending by a large customer in our traditional agency and lower volume of digital media buys from large third-party agencies. 
In response, 3 initiatives were started during the second quarter. The first was to adjust the cost structure commensurate with lower revenue expectations. That is largely complete. The second, which is the longer-term initiative is to redirect digital agency toward mid side agencies and maybe direct to clients. Third, we begun pivoting this offering to our data-driven marketing and insights, thus creating a CRM-like solution for clients who aren't ready yet for full CRM. Early results are encouraging as we've begun to gain traction in new verticals such as media and entertainment.
Overall, we see 2 key market trends that align well with Epsilon's core strategy: demands from CMOs for measurable results and the ongoing shift from traditional marketing channels to digital and data-driven channels. With a highly differentiated digital and offline data asset, a rich portfolio of services and its deep marketing advertising technology stack, the business is poised to resume healthy steady growth. 
Topic declines are growing at a high single-digit rate and the business has a robust pipeline. Paired with prudent cost management initiatives currently underway, we expect to see the return to profitable growth in the back half of 2016 and exit the year with a healthier cost structure going into 2017. 
I will now turn it over to Melisa to talk about Card Services."

Good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 5.

Revenues a",1153,"Thank you, Charles. Good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 5. I am so pleased to highlight that the Card Services business had another quarter of strong performance, delivering the 18th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. 
Revenues are up 25% over last year, translating to a 10% increase in adjusted EBITDA net of funding costs. 
Let's turn now to Page 6 and go over some of the key drivers of this strong performance. First, credit sales were up 18%, resulting in year-over-year tender share gains of 180 basis points where measurable. Now each quarter, you hear us comment on tender share, and we do so, because it really is a fundamental metric to the success of our programs. And what may be helpful context here is these tender share gains we reference come from our legacy programs, and do not include any gains from our newer card programs. Put differently, the tender share gains we reference are a result of increasing the number of trips, spend and card member retention from those card programs with us prior to 2013. 
Importantly, the average tenure of our 12-month active shopper is 5 years, and the sales distribution of our most tenured card members has been remarkably stable for 4 years. 
And I mentioned this because these are highly seasoned relationships and as such, we have great visibility into their past behavior, and that allows us to accurately predict how our card members will behave in the future. These gains are not a result of any widening, loosening or lessening of our credit standards. And this consistent increase in tender share is really a result of that data-driven targeted marketing Know More, Sell More brand promise, and the increases here are certainly a signal of card members' growing engagement with our brand partners. 
Second, as expected, gross yields are normalizing, and the year-over-year compression is lessening. And with very good visibility into the remainder of the year, we expect to achieve our annual guidance for gross yields of 25.1% as well. 
Third, operating expenses grew 24% this quarter, while improving 40 basis points to 9.5% of our average card receivables. And even with this improvement, we continue to make investments in preparation for the onboarding of several new partners from diverse retail verticals. For example, we deliberately entered the high gross segment of fast fashion with our recently announced Forever 21 partnership. We look forward to announcing additional significant partnerships in the coming quarters.
And this year, as in years past, the new partnerships we will sign represent more than $2 billion in steady-state accounts receivable. Our pipeline remains robust as we continue to identify strong potential partners that are passionate about driving consumer engagement in line with their revolving need and view the card program as the ultimate loyalty tool.
And fourth, our loss rate for the quarter came in at 5.1% in line with prior guidance, and we remain confident in achieving our guidance of a 5% loss rate for the full year. 
We continue to see success in this proven ability to drive stronger engagement and loyalty through our tailored marketing solutions, driven largely by deep data analytics, insights and innovative capabilities. 
Now speaking of engagement, let's spend just a moment to cover off on some of the brands we most recently onboarded. We're super enthusiastic about the progress of our newer partners. They're posting very strong results year-over-year. And I wanted to take just a moment to share 2 very specific examples. One partner experienced greater than a 70% increase in application volume and a credit sales jump of 37%, this driving tender share gains of more than 800 basis points with just a few months’ post conversion. And another important partner saw tender share gains of 400 basis points and credit sales increases of 45% post conversion. These gains are really due to our improved tools and stronger multi-channel engagement and are, again, testament to the increase spend we generate for our brand partners. 
Now we also know that despite these strong program results, concerns still exist in the market around the strength and health of the U.S. consumer. Candidly, we are seeing very few signs of concern. Our view is that consumer confidence is stable, delinquency trends are within expected parameters, card retention is very strong, and we continue to find success in engaging brands and their customers. We are welcoming new card members to our programs, while the existing card members continue to spend across channels. 
Now if I can comment just a moment about the consumer spend. To be clear, they are spending and they are spending differently. For instance, in some categories, we see our digital credit sales, so those sales outside of the brick-and-mortar environment, growing significantly year-over-year. Specialty retail currently sees digital credit sales over 40%, which is certainly higher than digital sales for the brand and has been steadily climbing. 
Similarly, 67% of home to core credit sales now come through digital channels, nearly a 10% jump in just 2 years. Multi-channel shoppers, so those actively purchasing both in-store and digitally, are our fastest-growing segment, and they are also the most valuable to our partners. These multi-channel shoppers spend twice as much as digital and single-channel shoppers. And looking more broadly, nearly 4 out of 10 applications are now completed outside of the store, with mobile applications, in particular, the fastest-growing channel. This continuing shift to mobile is reflective of consumer behavior as it is the channel where she increasingly chooses to engage with her favorite brands. 
As early adopters in the mobile space, we've been innovating on this trend for many years and believe it will continue to accelerate. As such, our investment strategy remains focused on delivering inventive capabilities that bring the most value to card members and to our brand partners, facilitating deeper loyalty and, ultimately, increased spend. 
For example, our MyLoyalty app solution continues to help brands cater to, engage with, card members as they apply, shop, earn and redeem all through a seamless, intuitive and highly targeted customer experience. 
A newer capability such as the development of a proprietary mobile application experience that significantly reduces customer time and effort, serves the changing consumer who's looking for every interaction to be effortless. 
So in summary, Card Services has delivered another strong quarter, producing results in line with our high expectations. We're confident in our full year guidance around our loss rates, our yields have stabilized ahead of our expectations, and we remain confident in our consumer outlook and the overall quality and performance of our card members. 
Our investments and partnerships aligned to the evolving needs of both our brands customers and the retail landscape overall, that's demonstrating the value we bring to our partners through our broader retail heritage and our experienced lends to the market. 
Thank you so much. And, Ed, I'll turn this over to you."
24604,369780993,1009867,"Alliance Data Systems Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Bread Financial Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Melisa. Why don't we turn to the second quarter scorecard? We'll try to wrap this up as neatly as we can. And we're going with the color-coded circles on the left. We're looking for more green than other colors. That would be a good thing.",2942,"Great. Thanks, Melisa. Why don't we turn to the second quarter scorecard? We'll try to wrap this up as neatly as we can. And we're going with the color-coded circles on the left. We're looking for more green than other colors. That would be a good thing. And as we are midway through the year, it looks like we're heading in the right direction. 
So to sort of sum it up on a consolidated basis, $1.75 billion in revs, up 17%, $3.68 on EPS, up 11%. 
I think for those of you who have been hearing Charles and I talked about how the year would play out, we talked about a Q1 sort of plus 5 top, plus 5 bottom, and then Q2 moving to 8 and 8 and then eventually double-digit in the back half. The fact that we're at 17 in Q2 and 11 on the bottom in Q2 as well, essentially means that we pulled -- we're running ahead by a quarter. So essentially, the back half has been accelerated and that essentially what you're seeing in Q2. We were -- we had some signs of things we're accelerating but, of course, we wanted to be a little bit more careful into what actually played through. So I think the easiest way to look at the quarter is it's not unexpected that we're running at double-digit, what was unexpected is that we're running at double-digit this early in the year. So that certainly takes the risk out of the back half of the year. We're nicely ahead of guidance, and, in fact, we feel comfortable raising guidance at this point for the year. As Charles mentioned, the buyback, we're about halfway through and the year is about halfway through, and we'll leave it at that. 
Now let's turn to Card Services. Melisa talked extensively about performance. Once again, very strong growth in the overall portfolio, and we do talk on and on about tender share because that is so important to us. That's sort of what makes or breaks our model versus other models out there and essentially, that is the ability of triggering an additional purchase or visit with a purchase by the shopper over and above what she would traditionally do. And that's all done through our data-driven marketing and targeting.
And as most have talked about, 85% of this tender share gain is from very mature accounts. Folks have been with us for years and years and years. It's not a function of just pumping more plastic out into the marketplace, and that's something that's important. So the model works. 
Probably the biggest surprise for the quarter in terms of good news was that gross yield certainly came in well ahead of expectations. 
Specifically, if you recall, Q1 is where we saw the compression in yields of 210 basis points. We suggested that we thought this would roll off as the year progressed, as we anniversaried various programs. We actually saw a faster burn-in in Q2, and as a result, we picked up a very, very nice chunk of revenues from the gross yield compression being less than expected.
So put simply, we went from 200 basis points compression in Q1 all the way down to 80 basis points in Q2, and then we'll trickle ahead for the rest of the year a little bit better than that as the final programs burn through. So that was probably the first good news surprise for the quarter. 
Losses, they're dead on. There is not a lot to talk about there. We talked about a 5% loss rate for the full year way back at the beginning of the year. We are dead on with that number as we look to the back half, so no surprises there. There is no big cliff heading our way out there. It's pretty straightforward. And this is just normal account seasoning. And as Melisa said, there is no distress that we're seeing in the consumers. So very straightforward on the loss side. 
And then obviously, what Melisa and I spend a lot of time on is what does the future look like. And the future, again, looks very promising. We've just announced thus far Boscov’s, Forever 21, Children’s Place, Bed Bath & Beyond, Hot Topic. We probably have another half dozen that are signed, including a couple of biggies that we will be announcing in the back half of the year. So very, very robust signing season for Card Services.
So I think that's it for cards. We move now on to Epsilon, where we have moved from green, yellow and red to now green and yellow, which I think is a good thing. And I probably would say the second, if you would call it piece of good news or a surprise for the quarter, was that we knew Epsilon was turning and, again, Epsilon includes both Epsilon core as well as the Conversant folks. And in Q1, obviously, it was a disappointing quarter. Revenues were down 2%. Our goal was to swing that to positive a couple of points by Q2 and then hit mid-single digits as we move into the back half and accelerate from there. Again, the news here was that the revenue acceleration occurred faster than we had anticipated, and we actually swung from minus 2 to plus 5 between Q1 and Q2. So 7 points growth -- change in growth is quite a bit. And needless to say, we were pleased to see that. We expect that type of performance to continue, if not tick up as we go into the back half. And as Charles mentioned, the good news now is once we have a top line turned, the cost structure should play out as soon as the quarter we're in now, Q3. So essentially, as we've talked to people, we had a -- we were in the process over the last year of a very significant ramp up as we build up our India operation, and we had a lot of duplicative costs, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Bottom line is the flow through will begin in Q3 and that should put us in very good shape for not only the back half but more importantly as we go into next year and the following year. So that would be what we call the Q3 flip for lack of a better term. 
And then I'd like to spend just a couple of seconds on Conversant. So Conversant became part of Alliance at the beginning of last year. And obviously, it was met with a fair amount of skepticism out there. Some of it made a lot of sense, some of it, we disagreed with. But at this point, if you looked at the 3 pieces of Conversant, sort of the traditional Conversant before we went into how we report it today sort of mashed up with the core Epsilon, it has 3 pieces. And the traditional Conversant had about 1/4 of the business in agency, and that is probably we're going to run down for the year, probably 15% or something like that. Then you have 1/4 of the business, that's what we call CJ affiliate, and that's running nicely at mid-single digits up and is a very strong cash flow contributor. And then you have the biggest piece, 1/2 of Conversant, which is the data-driven CRM piece, and that is running between 40% and 50% for the year. And that is -- that's really the huge piece, and you obviously want your biggest piece to be your fastest grower. So if you put it all together, what you essentially have is in Q2. If you look at Conversant from a traditional perspective, you would have seen double-digit top consolidated with -- of all 3 pieces and double-digit bottom. And I raise that because of the fact that, that was our goal. If you went back to the original thesis behind the acquisition, we knew that the affiliate business is a good business, and will chug along. We knew that the agency business would be pressured, and we'd need to find a way to distinguish that from other businesses. But primarily, the CRM business, we were hoping for the huge cross-sell to the rest of Alliance. That has happened, and as a result, we are seeing this sort of 10% top and bottom that the original deal was based upon.
So as far as we're concerned, we hit our goals from the original deal. You look at BrandLoyalty, obviously, came out of the gate double-digit across-the-board right from the beginning of the acquisition. So the 2 deals we've done on the last 3, 4 years have performed quite nicely. Some started a little bit faster than others. But right now, both seem to be producing. And as we move into the LoyaltyOne segment, and we talk about BrandLoyalty. We mentioned in Q1 that it is a lumpy business, and we have good visibility on full year, but quarter-by-quarter is difficult. But needless to say, Q2 was fairly impressive, with revenue up over 40% and EBITDA up over 100%. So that was obviously a very big quarter for BrandLoyalty. We think we probably don't want to keep that as a run rate going forward, although I'd love to, but I think mid-teens top and bottom would be a good num, set of nums for the year. 
Also as Charles mentioned, the BrandLoyalty U.S. pilot has been completed, has been very successful. We need to be a little careful about chatting about what's next, but we have very high hopes in terms of upcoming activity in the U.S. 
Now let's turn to Canada. And AIR MILES' revenue was up 6%, and I believe it was up 5% in Q1. EBITDA for Q2 was up 4% and EBITDA in Q1 was up 11%.
So I think the bottom line of all of it is that there's been murmurs out there that the Canadian business is too mature and that it's not really going anywhere and that it's very sluggish. This is a solid mid-single-digit top and bottom with very strong cash flow generation. This is a great business, and I think it's going to be around for a long time, and that's why we keep it firmly as part of the assets within Alliance, so very pleased with that issuance. Again, jumps by quarter. It was up 5% in Q1. It was down 3% in Q2. I think on a full year basis, we're still shooting for somewhere around 4% or something like that. 
So overall, we did have overperformance versus guidance. It came from 3 areas. First, on a top line basis, Epsilon's revenues swung faster than we had anticipated, 7-point swing versus we were looking at more like 4 or 5. 
Second, in Card Services, yields came in better than expected, as we saw the burn through of these programs occur faster, and that was good news. 
And then finally, on the bottom line, it didn't help top line, but on the bottom line, as Charles said, we accelerated the opportunity to take the final 20% of BrandLoyalty and that added a few pennies in addition to the other stuff. 
So probably those 3 things drove the overperformance, but in general, really across the board, it was a really good story. 
I think on a full year basis, let's just jump to that. We are raising full year guidance to revenues of $7.15 billion, up 11%. Core EPS of $16.85, up 12% and the new guidance does reflect the flow through of the second quarter be to our guidance. And we'll flow through additional overperformance, if any, if it occurs in the back half of the year. 
Essentially, this year has been playing out, neither Charles nor I want to get too far out over our skiis here, so what we're effectively doing is we'll flow through the overperformance when it comes, but let's not go charging down the road too quickly right now. Certainly, things are heading in the right direction. There's an upward bias to even the existing guidance, but when it comes, we'll flow it through. You can think of it almost as a hedge against if foreign exchange rates start going wonky again. We don't want to have to recut and go through all that stuff again. But in general, back half looks good. Second quarter, obviously, double-double, look very good. 
Card Services, we still expect double-digit growth, top and bottom for the year. Yield compression, we'll continue to lessen each quarter, and we went from 210 to 80, and it will continue to lessen as the final 2 quarters play out, which gives us, again, from where Melisa and I sit, a very nice jump of point for next year. 
Principal loss rates, a lot of chatter out there in the marketplace, losses are going up. They're going up faster. They're going up slower. It's pretty straightforward. We're seeing the seasoning. We thought at the beginning of the year, we'll do 5% and then the other 50 basis points next year. So we're not seeing any consumer distress. And the new vintages that we're signing, we have already completed the $2 billion in signings we needed for the full year this year. So it's only July, but again, a wonderful year. 
Epsilon, revenue growth rate snapped back to mid-single. We expect that to drift up a bit and improve in even Q3 in Q4 as the moment continues. We expect the revenue flow through to EBITDA starting as soon as Q3, as India is fully ramped up. And again, we'll call it the Q3 flip.
Digital & technology businesses are hot. As Charles mentioned, double-digit growth. It's 3 quarters of Epsilon-Conversant, so it's by far the largest chunk of it, and it is doing extremely well. 
The final piece, the quarter of the business that's agency media and media services, again, better than Q1, still has some work to do. We have a number of initiatives under way. I guess the overall way to think about Epsilon and Conversant is that we manage a portfolio of products and services that can range from products that are in decline 15%, 20% to those that are growing over 60%. The goal here is to manage to a weighted average growth rate into the mid- to high single digits. And so I think we're back on track there. 
And on the agency side specifically, we have a number of initiatives under way, specifically sort of a data-driven CRM light if you want to call it for clients who don't want to do the full-scale heavy-duty CRM offering, but also potentially looking at maybe a white-label type approach to the platform, offering up to the mid-tier and smaller agencies that can afford to bring all that stuff in-house. So again, I think there is a bunch of good stuff going on there that we're still feeling pretty optimistic about it. 
Finally, and then we'll take some questions. LoyaltyOne, we expect mid-single-digit growth in revenue on a constant currency basis. And as I said, this is a -- it's a good business, and it continues to get good traction up there. 
AIR MILES issued also about 4% and then, of course, BrandLoyalty strong double-digit top and bottom line growth as the business continues to expand globally.
All right, overall, if you were to look at the bigger picture and the longer-term picture, you would see that if you went from the year before the Great Recession, then including the Great Recession and all the way up to last year, this company has delivered top line growth averaging 15% a year and then bottom line growth, or core EPS growth, of 18% a year again and that includes the Great Recession. So it's not all that surprising that we're already back to double-digit top and bottom. Again, I think it's a quarter ahead of schedule, but we are raising guidance and expect to be running at plus 11 and plus 12 for rev and core EPS. It's the ability to grow our core EPS by double digits despite being in a period of normalization in our card business. So what does that all mean? What it essentially means is we're dumping a whole bunch of P&L expense, not cash expense but P&L expense into our reserves as losses normalize and as we are growing 20-plus percent, it's a big drag on our nums, and you're talking a couple of hundred million dollars. And what that effectively does is that knocks 10 points off of our growth rate. And so even in this big high growth period with big reserve builds, we're still able to deliver double-digit top and bottom. That's pretty good. And so if we can do plus 11 top, plus 12 bottom, essentially in a period where you're done seasoning and loss rate is stable, that would have been plus 11 and plus 22. So that's the order of magnitude here. Our goal is even in a seasoning period, which is what we're in now, we still expect to deliver double top, double bottom. 
Okay. So I think that our business outlook looks good, and I think if we don't have anything else here, we might just go to Q&A. Obviously, you can tell from our tone that what once was a very heavily weighted back end of the year is now no longer the case, and we're feeling pretty chipper about it. 
So why don't we open it up to Q&A?"

Because the goal of that part of the business is -- was originally to go out and find inventory, an appropriate inventory where we could place the various advertisements and messaging. And so as that has happened in programmatic trading and everything else has come into play, what we're looking at and where we think there is a big opportunity is there is a lot of clients out there who love the huge CRM-type offering that requires them to give us the SKU level information, both online, off-line. We take that. We churn it through the big machines. We find the right patterns. We go out and place those with the appropriate folks out on -- out in the digital space. But there is also, we believe, a huge chunk of folks, clients out there who don't necessarily want or need the whole soup to nuts that we offer with big CRM, as we call it. So I'm going to call it CRM light, which is where you'll use some data. So for example, a client may just say, ""Look, I'm having a big sale. It's going to be in the southeast region of the country. I want to go out and I want to find those folks who are most likely to visit. Here's my email list, could you go out, use that data and let everyone know that's appropriate about the sale and what's going on?"" And that's a much smaller commitment from the client, and we think that's a good way to get them in the door and, hopefully, eventually upsell to big CRM. So the long-winded answer is, if we can do that, along with our partners at, let's say, the mid-tier agencies who can afford to build these massive trading platforms, programmatic-type platforms, that this could be a nice winner and a nice feeder as well into big CRM. We've already started the retraining of our agency sales folks into CRM. And so we expect this thing to start taking root really towards the back half of the year. So hopefully, we'll see some results before we exit this year."

And having been in the business for 1,000 years here, going back to the '90s and the various cycles to where we are today, I think probably the biggest stress test that anyone has ever faced was the Great Recession. And in the Great Recession, what actually happened was that even though Private Label tends to and always has run a point-or-so above loss rates in sort of the general-purpose arena, what actually happened in the Great Recession is we performed a lot better in the general-purpose cards. And so what it really hit the fan, the general-purpose cards, those portfolios went from 4%, 5% to 10% or 11% loss rate. I mean, 600 basis points. We went up 300 and the reason behind that is why, I guess, we don't share the concern that others do about Private Label and everything else is the fact that for sure, it's a card that doesn't have utilization of a general-purpose card, but that's great in terms of when times get stretched because of the fact that you do not have a big open up buy line, and you do not have the ability to go use it to buy food and put gas in the car and then go bankrupt. So what you're seeing is there may be lots of cards out there, but as you go down the credit spectrum, you bring down your credit lines, and so you may have $100 credit line on someone with a thin file and that ability to manage or open to buy in your credit lines across 40 million households is what allowed us to really manage to a very modest hit during the Great Recession, and that's why I think we don't expect to see any spike, because we are very active in terms of managing credit lines."

But sort of that $900 million is sort of what we play with and that either goes towards buyback or it goes towards M&A. And look, the M&A could be at the bank level with the portfolio.

Another positive during the quarter was the opportunity to acquire earlier than scheduled the remaining 20% ownership in BrandLoyalty. It made sense to us as the company's performance has exceeded all of our expectations and the opportunity in North America looks very compelling.
Accordingly, we acquired the remaining interest effective April 1, 2016, for approximately $259 million in consideration, which was funded by upside in BrandLoyalty's credit facility. 
Now the accounting is little unique, because the remaining ownership was purchased prior to the 10% tranches scheduled for January 17 and January 18, the consideration paid exceeded the current value of the redeemable non-controlling interest from the balance sheet, which would have increased over the next 1.5 years to roughly equal the purchase price paid. The difference of $68 million is an immediate charge to retain earnings on the balance sheet but nonetheless, it's considered in the calculation of EPS, which was reduced by $1.14. Excluding this charge, EPS increased 13% for the second quarter. 
What does the early acquisition mean to ADS? From the revenue standpoint, nothing, as we already consolidated 100% of BrandLoyalty's revenue. From a profitability standpoint, it will add a few cents to our EPS and our core EPS for 2016. 
Turning to the repurchase program. We've acquired approximately 2.6 million shares under our repurchase program year-to-date. We have approximately 460 million of our board authorization left, which we expect to use somewhat ratably over the remainder of 2016. 
Let's go to Page 3 and talk about LoyaltyOne. LoyaltyOne had a very strong second quarter as revenue increased 17% to $352 million and adjusted EBITDA increased 20% to $79 million. Negative FX translation rates knocked about 2 points upgrowth off for the second quarter, but on a positive note, we do not expect any FX drag in the second half of 2016 if current spot rates hold. 
AIR MILES' revenue increased 6% on a constant currency basis, driven by an 8% increase in miles redeemed. 
AIR MILES issued declined 3% versus the same quarter last year, which was expected. As you may recall, we converted Sobeys legacy reward program into the AIR MILES reward program in the second quarter of 2015. That makes for a difficult year-over-year comparable. 
In addition, we had less promotional activity in the grocery vertical this year. AIR MILES redeemed increased 8% compared to the second quarter 2015, primarily driven by AM Cash, or instant reward option. 
In particular, we are seeing growth in in-store redemptions, which are popular at our AIR MILES grocery partners. 
Moving to BrandLoyalty. Revenue increased 44% on a constant currency basis, driven by an increase in the number of short-term loyalty programs executed during the quarter. 
Continued expansion into new markets such as South Africa and New Zealand contributed growth. The pilot recently executed with the top 3 grocers in the U.S. finished with very strong results, as pilot stores showed revenue growth approximately 1.5% higher than non-pilot stores. 
This was accomplished largely through an increased basket sizes. Plans are currently underway with this grocery to extend the program to the full store network at later day. Additional pilot programs in the U.S. and Canada are also planned for the back half of this year. Overall, a terrific quarter. 
Now let's flip over to the next slide and talk about Epsilon. Epsilon's revenue increased 5% to $519 million for the second quarter, a solid turn from the revenue decline of 2% in the first quarter of 2016. 
Adjusted EBITDA decreased 9% to $103 million, primarily due to duplicative costs in R&D operation and severance costs. We expect these costs to abate during the third quarter allowing the full flow through of revenue to EBITDA. 
Our digital and technology platforms business is hot, posting robust 14% growth versus the prior year. This performance was supported by solid contributions from all offerings in this category, with our automotive platform and Conversant CRM business leading the way. 
In addition, solid traction in the affiliate business and strong new business within our Harmony platform added to the momentum. 
In particular, Conversant CRM business, with industry-leading cross-device recognition and reach, had a terrific quarter, with revenue up 66% and a building backlog that should exceed the book of business we won in 2015, with over 20 new clients signed and launched in the first half, including Zales, Beach Body, Justice and White House Black Market. 
Our agency media & services business continues to struggle as revenue declined 15% versus the prior year. This offering has been weak for several quarters due to a combination of decreased spending by a large customer in our traditional agency and lower volume of digital media buys from large third-party agencies. 
In response, 3 initiatives were started during the second quarter. The first was to adjust the cost structure commensurate with lower revenue expectations. That is largely complete. The second, which is the longer-term initiative is to redirect digital agency toward mid side agencies and maybe direct to clients. Third, we began pivoting this offering to our data-driven marketing and insights, thus creating a CRM-like solution for clients who aren't ready yet for full CRM. Early results are encouraging as we've begun to gain traction in new verticals such as media and entertainment.
Overall, we see 2 key market trends that align well with Epsilon's core strategy: demands from CMOs for measurable results and the ongoing shift from traditional marketing channels to digital and data-driven channels. With a highly differentiated digital and offline data asset, a rich portfolio of services and its deep marketing advertising technology stack, the business is poised to resume healthy steady growth. 
Topic declines are growing at a high single-digit rate and the business has a robust pipeline. Paired with prudent cost management initiatives currently underway, we expect to see the return to profitable growth in the back half of 2016 and exit the year with a healthier cost structure going into 2017. 
I will now turn it over to Melisa to talk about Card Services."

I am so pleased to highlight that the Card Services business had another quarter of strong performance, delivering the 18th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. 
Revenues are up 25% over last year, translating to a 10% increase in adjusted EBITDA net of funding costs. 
Let's turn now to Page 6 and go over some of the key drivers of this strong performance. First, credit sales were up 18%, resulting in year-over-year tender share gains of 180 basis points where measurable. Now each quarter, you hear us comment on tender share, and we do so, because it really is a fundamental metric to the success of our programs. And what may be helpful context here is these tender share gains we reference come from our legacy programs, and do not include any gains from our newer card programs. Put differently, the tender share gains we reference are a result of increasing the number of trips, spend and card member retention from those card programs with us prior to 2013. 
Importantly, the average tenure of our 12-month active shopper is 5 years, and the sales distribution of our most tenured card members has been remarkably stable for 4 years. 
And I mentioned this because these are highly seasoned relationships and as such, we have great visibility into their past behavior, and that allows us to accurately predict how our card members will behave in the future. These gains are not a result of any widening, loosening or lessening of our credit standards. And this consistent increase in tender share is really a result of that data-driven targeted marketing Know More, Sell More brand promise, and the increases here are certainly a signal of card members' growing engagement with our brand partners. 
Second, as expected, gross yields are normalizing, and the year-over-year compression is lessening. And with very good visibility into the remainder of the year, we expect to achieve our annual guidance for gross yields of 25.1% as well. 
Third, operating expenses grew 24% this quarter, while improving 40 basis points to 9.5% of our average card receivables. And even with this improvement, we continue to make investments in preparation for the onboarding of several new partners from diverse retail verticals. For example, we deliberately entered the high gross segment of fast fashion with our recently announced Forever 21 partnership. We look forward to announcing additional significant partnerships in the coming quarters.
And this year, as in years past, the new partnerships we will sign represent more than $2 billion in steady-state accounts receivable. Our pipeline remains robust as we continue to identify strong potential partners that are passionate about driving consumer engagement in line with their revolving need and view the card program as the ultimate loyalty tool.
And fourth, our loss rate for the quarter came in at 5.1% in line with prior guidance, and we remain confident in achieving our guidance of a 5% loss rate for the full year. 
We continue to see success in this proven ability to drive stronger engagement and loyalty through our tailored marketing solutions, driven largely by deep data analytics, insights and innovative capabilities. 
Now speaking of engagement, let's spend just a moment to cover off on some of the brands we most recently onboarded. We're super enthusiastic about the progress of our newer partners. They're posting very strong results year-over-year. And I wanted to take just a moment to share 2 very specific examples. One partner experienced greater than a 70% increase in application volume and a credit sales jump of 37%, this driving tender share gains of more than 800 basis points with just a few months’ post conversion. And another important partner saw tender share gains of 400 basis points and credit sales increases of 45% post conversion. These gains are really due to our improved tools and stronger multi-channel engagement and are, again, testament to the increase spend we generate for our brand partners. 
Now we also know that despite these strong program results, concerns still exist in the market around the strength and health of the U.S. consumer. Candidly, we are seeing very few signs of concern. Our view is that consumer confidence is stable, delinquency trends are within expected parameters, card retention is very strong, and we continue to find success in engaging brands and their customers. We are welcoming new card members to our programs, while the existing card members continue to spend across channels. 
Now if I can comment just a moment about the consumer spend. To be clear, they are spending and they are spending differently. For instance, in some categories, we see our digital credit sales, so those sales outside of the brick-and-mortar environment, growing significantly year-over-year. Specialty retail currently sees digital credit sales over 40%, which is certainly higher than digital sales for the brand and has been steadily climbing. 
Similarly, 67% of home to core credit sales now come through digital channels, nearly a 10% jump in just 2 years. Multi-channel shoppers, so those actively purchasing both in-store and digitally, are our fastest-growing segment, and they are also the most valuable to our partners. These multi-channel shoppers spend twice as much as digital and single-channel shoppers. And looking more broadly, nearly 4 out of 10 applications are now completed outside of the store, with mobile applications, in particular, the fastest-growing channel. This continuing shift to mobile is reflective of consumer behavior as it is the channel where she increasingly chooses to engage with her favorite brands. 
As early adopters in the mobile space, we've been innovating on this trend for many years and believe it will continue to accelerate. As such, our investment strategy remains focused on delivering inventive capabilities that bring the most value to card members and to our brand partners, facilitating deeper loyalty and, ultimately, increased spend. 
For example, our MyLoyalty app solution continues to help brands cater to, engage with, card members as they apply, shop, earn and redeem all through a seamless, intuitive and highly targeted customer experience. 
A newer capability such as the development of a proprietary mobile application experience that significantly reduces customer time and effort, serves the changing consumer who's looking for every interaction to be effortless. 
So in summary, Card Services has delivered another strong quarter, producing results in line with our high expectations. We're confident in our full year guidance around our loss rates, our yields have stabilized ahead of our expectations, and we remain confident in our consumer outlook and the overall quality and performance of our card members. 
Our investments and partnerships aligned to the evolving needs of both our brands customers and the retail landscape overall, that's demonstrating the value we bring to our partners through our broader retail heritage and our experienced lends to the market. 
Thank you so much. And, Ed, I'll turn this over to you."

We'll try to wrap this up as neatly as we can. And we're going with the color-coded circles on the left. We're looking for more green than other colors. That would be a good thing. And as we are midway through the year, it looks like we're heading in the right direction. 
So to sort of sum it up on a consolidated basis, $1.75 billion in revs, up 17%, $3.68 on EPS, up 11%. 
I think for those of you who have been hearing Charles and I talked about how the year would play out, we talked about a Q1 sort of plus 5 top, plus 5 bottom, and then Q2 moving to 8 and 8 and then eventually double-digit in the back half. The fact that we're at 17 in Q2 and 11 on the bottom in Q2 as well, essentially means that we pulled -- we're running ahead by a quarter. So essentially, the back half has been accelerated and that essentially what you're seeing in Q2. We were -- we had some signs of things we're accelerating but, of course, we wanted to be a little bit more careful into what actually played through. So I think the easiest way to look at the quarter is it's not unexpected that we're running at double-digit, what was unexpected is that we're running at double-digit this early in the year. So that certainly takes the risk out of the back half of the year. We're nicely ahead of guidance, and, in fact, we feel comfortable raising guidance at this point for the year. As Charles mentioned, the buyback, we're about halfway through and the year is about halfway through, and we'll leave it at that. 
Now let's turn to Card Services. Melisa talked extensively about performance. Once again, very strong growth in the overall portfolio, and we do talk on and on about tender share because that is so important to us. That's sort of what makes or breaks our model versus other models out there and essentially, that is the ability of triggering an additional purchase or visit with a purchase by the shopper over and above what she would traditionally do. And that's all done through our data-driven marketing and targeting.
And as most have talked about, 85% of this tender share gain is from very mature accounts. Folks have been with us for years and years and years. It's not a function of just pumping more plastic out into the marketplace, and that's something that's important. So the model works. 
Probably the biggest surprise for the quarter in terms of good news was that gross yield certainly came in well ahead of expectations. 
Specifically, if you recall, Q1 is where we saw the compression in yields of 210 basis points. We suggested that we thought this would roll off as the year progressed, as we anniversaried various programs. We actually saw a faster burn-in in Q2, and as a result, we picked up a very, very nice chunk of revenues from the gross yield compression being less than expected.
So put simply, we went from 200 basis points compression in Q1 all the way down to 80 basis points in Q2, and then we'll trickle ahead for the rest of the year a little bit better than that as the final programs burn through. So that was probably the first good news surprise for the quarter. 
Losses, they're dead on. There is not a lot to talk about there. We talked about a 5% loss rate for the full year way back at the beginning of the year. We are dead on with that number as we look to the back half, so no surprises there. There is no big cliff heading our way out there. It's pretty straightforward. And this is just normal account seasoning. And as Melisa said, there is no distress that we're seeing in the consumers. So very straightforward on the loss side. 
And then obviously, what Melisa and I spend a lot of time on is what does the future look like. And the future, again, looks very promising. We've just announced thus far Boscov’s, Forever 21, Children’s Place, Bed Bath & Beyond, Hot Topic. We probably have another half dozen that are signed, including a couple of biggies that we will be announcing in the back half of the year. So very, very robust signing season for Card Services.
So I think that's it for cards. We move now on to Epsilon, where we have moved from green, yellow and red to now green and yellow, which I think is a good thing. And I probably would say the second, if you would call it piece of good news or a surprise for the quarter, was that we knew Epsilon was turning and, again, Epsilon includes both Epsilon core as well as the Conversant folks. And in Q1, obviously, it was a disappointing quarter. Revenues were down 2%. Our goal was to swing that to positive a couple of points by Q2 and then hit mid-single digits as we move into the back half and accelerate from there. Again, the news here was that the revenue acceleration occurred faster than we had anticipated, and we actually swung from minus 2 to plus 5 between Q1 and Q2. So 7 points growth -- change in growth is quite a bit. And needless to say, we were pleased to see that. We expect that type of performance to continue, if not tick up as we go into the back half. And as Charles mentioned, the good news now is once we have a top line turned, the cost structure should play out as soon as the quarter we're in now, Q3. So essentially, as we've talked to people, we had a -- we were in the process over the last year of a very significant ramp up as we build up our India operation, and we had a lot of duplicative costs, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Bottom line is the flow through will begin in Q3 and that should put us in very good shape for not only the back half but more importantly as we go into next year and the following year. So that would be what we call the Q3 flip for lack of a better term. 
And then I'd like to spend just a couple of seconds on Conversant. So Conversant became part of Alliance at the beginning of last year. And obviously, it was met with a fair amount of skepticism out there. Some of it made a lot of sense, some of it, we disagreed with. But at this point, if you looked at the 3 pieces of Conversant, sort of the traditional Conversant before we went into how we report it today sort of mashed up with the core Epsilon, it has 3 pieces. And the traditional Conversant had about 1/4 of the business in agency, and that is probably we're going to run down for the year, probably 15% or something like that. Then you have 1/4 of the business, that's what we call CJ affiliate, and that's running nicely at mid-single digits up and is a very strong cash flow contributor. And then you have the biggest piece, 1/2 of Conversant, which is the data-driven CRM piece, and that is running between 40% and 50% for the year. And that is -- that's really the huge piece, and you obviously want your biggest piece to be your fastest grower. So if you put it all together, what you essentially have is in Q2. If you look at Conversant from a traditional perspective, you would have seen double-digit top consolidated with -- of all 3 pieces and double-digit bottom. And I raise that because of the fact that, that was our goal. If you went back to the original thesis behind the acquisition, we knew that the affiliate business is a good business, and will chug along. We knew that the agency business would be pressured, and we'd need to find a way to distinguish that from other businesses. But primarily, the CRM business, we were hoping for the huge cross-sell to the rest of Alliance. That has happened, and as a result, we are seeing this sort of 10% top and bottom that the original deal was based upon.
So as far as we're concerned, we hit our goals from the original deal. You look at BrandLoyalty, obviously, came out of the gate double-digit across-the-board right from the beginning of the acquisition. So the 2 deals we've done on the last 3, 4 years have performed quite nicely. Some started a little bit faster than others. But right now, both seem to be producing. And as we move into the LoyaltyOne segment, and we talk about BrandLoyalty. We mentioned in Q1 that it is a lumpy business, and we have good visibility on full year, but quarter-by-quarter is difficult. But needless to say, Q2 was fairly impressive, with revenue up over 40% and EBITDA up over 100%. So that was obviously a very big quarter for BrandLoyalty. We think we probably don't want to keep that as a run rate going forward, although I'd love to, but I think mid-teens top and bottom would be a good num, set of nums for the year. 
Also as Charles mentioned, the BrandLoyalty U.S. pilot has been completed, has been very successful. We need to be a little careful about chatting about what's next, but we have very high hopes in terms of upcoming activity in the U.S. 
Now let's turn to Canada. And AIR MILES' revenue was up 6%, and I believe it was up 5% in Q1. EBITDA for Q2 was up 4% and EBITDA in Q1 was up 11%.
So I think the bottom line of all of it is that there's been murmurs out there that the Canadian business is too mature and that it's not really going anywhere and that it's very sluggish. This is a solid mid-single-digit top and bottom with very strong cash flow generation. This is a great business, and I think it's going to be around for a long time, and that's why we keep it firmly as part of the assets within Alliance, so very pleased with that issuance. Again, jumps by quarter. It was up 5% in Q1. It was down 3% in Q2. I think on a full year basis, we're still shooting for somewhere around 4% or something like that. 
So overall, we did have overperformance versus guidance. It came from 3 areas. First, on a top line basis, Epsilon's revenues swung faster than we had anticipated, 7-point swing versus we were looking at more like 4 or 5. 
Second, in Card Services, yields came in better than expected, as we saw the burn through of these programs occur faster, and that was good news. 
And then finally, on the bottom line, it didn't help top line, but on the bottom line, as Charles said, we accelerated the opportunity to take the final 20% of BrandLoyalty and that added a few pennies in addition to the other stuff. 
So probably those 3 things drove the overperformance, but in general, really across the board, it was a really good story. 
I think on a full year basis, let's just jump to that. We are raising full year guidance to revenues of $7.15 billion, up 11%. Core EPS of $16.85, up 12% and the new guidance does reflect the flow through of the second quarter be to our guidance. And we'll flow through additional overperformance, if any, if it occurs in the back half of the year. 
Essentially, this year has been playing out, neither Charles nor I want to get too far out over our skiis here, so what we're effectively doing is we'll flow through the overperformance when it comes, but let's not go charging down the road too quickly right now. Certainly, things are heading in the right direction. There's an upward bias to even the existing guidance, but when it comes, we'll flow it through. You can think of it almost as a hedge against if foreign exchange rates start going wonky again. We don't want to have to recut and go through all that stuff again. But in general, back half looks good. Second quarter, obviously, double-double, look very good. 
Card Services, we still expect double-digit growth, top and bottom for the year. Yield compression, we'll continue to lessen each quarter, and we went from 210 to 80, and it will continue to lessen as the final 2 quarters play out, which gives us, again, from where Melisa and I sit, a very nice jump of point for next year. 
Principal loss rates, a lot of chatter out there in the marketplace, losses are going up. They're going up faster. They're going up slower. It's pretty straightforward. We're seeing the seasoning. We thought at the beginning of the year, we'll do 5% and then the other 50 basis points next year. So we're not seeing any consumer distress. And the new vintages that we're signing, we have already completed the $2 billion in signings we needed for the full year this year. So it's only July, but again, a wonderful year. 
Epsilon, revenue growth rate snapped back to mid-single. We expect that to drift up a bit and improve in even Q3 in Q4 as the moment continues. We expect the revenue flow through to EBITDA starting as soon as Q3, as India is fully ramped up. And again, we'll call it the Q3 flip.
Digital & technology businesses are hot. As Charles mentioned, double-digit growth. It's 3 quarters of Epsilon-Conversant, so it's by far the largest chunk of it, and it is doing extremely well. 
The final piece, the quarter of the business that's agency media and media services, again, better than Q1, still has some work to do. We have a number of initiatives under way. I guess the overall way to think about Epsilon and Conversant is that we manage a portfolio of products and services that can range from products that are in decline 15%, 20% to those that are growing over 60%. The goal here is to manage to a weighted average growth rate into the mid- to high single digits. And so I think we're back on track there. 
And on the agency side specifically, we have a number of initiatives under way, specifically sort of a data-driven CRM light if you want to call it for clients who don't want to do the full-scale heavy-duty CRM offering, but also potentially looking at maybe a white-label type approach to the platform, offering up to the mid-tier and smaller agencies that can afford to bring all that stuff in-house. So again, I think there is a bunch of good stuff going on there that we're still feeling pretty optimistic about it. 
Finally, and then we'll take some questions. LoyaltyOne, we expect mid-single-digit growth in revenue on a constant currency basis. And as I said, this is a -- it's a good business, and it continues to get good traction up there. 
AIR MILES issued also about 4% and then, of course, BrandLoyalty strong double-digit top and bottom line growth as the business continues to expand globally.
All right, overall, if you were to look at the bigger picture and the longer-term picture, you would see that if you went from the year before the Great Recession, then including the Great Recession and all the way up to last year, this company has delivered top line growth averaging 15% a year and then bottom line growth, or core EPS growth, of 18% a year again and that includes the Great Recession. So it's not all that surprising that we're already back to double-digit top and bottom. Again, I think it's a quarter ahead of schedule, but we are raising guidance and expect to be running at plus 11 and plus 12 for rev and core EPS. It's the ability to grow our core EPS by double digits despite being in a period of normalization in our card business. So what does that all mean? What it essentially means is we're dumping a whole bunch of P&L expense, not cash expense but P&L expense into our reserves as losses normalize and as we are growing 20-plus percent, it's a big drag on our nums, and you're talking a couple of hundred million dollars. And what that effectively does is that knocks 10 points off of our growth rate. And so even in this big high growth period with big reserve builds, we're still able to deliver double-digit top and bottom. That's pretty good. And so if we can do plus 11 top, plus 12 bottom, essentially in a period where you're done seasoning and loss rate is stable, that would have been plus 11 and plus 22. So that's the order of magnitude here. Our goal is even in a seasoning period, which is what we're in now, we still expect to deliver double top, double bottom. 
Okay. So I think that our business outlook looks good, and I think if we don't have anything else here, we might just go to Q&A. Obviously, you can tell from our tone that what once was a very heavily weighted back end of the year is now no longer the case, and we're feeling pretty chipper about it. 
So why don't we open it up to Q&A?"

Because the goal of that part of the business is -- was originally to go out and find inventory, an appropriate inventory where we could place the various advertisements and messaging. And so as that has happened in programmatic trading and everything else has come into play, what we're looking at and where we think there is a big opportunity is there is a lot of clients out there who love the huge CRM-type offering that requires them to give us the SKU level information, both online, off-line. We take that. We churn it through the big machines. We find the right patterns. We go out and place those with the appropriate folks out on -- out in the digital space. But there is also, we believe, a huge chunk of folks, clients out there who don't necessarily want or need the whole soup to nuts that we offer with big CRM, as we call it. So I'm going to call it CRM light, which is where you'll use some data. So for example, a client may just say, ""Look, I'm having a big sale. It's going to be in the southeast region of the country. I want to go out and I want to find those folks who are most likely to visit. Here's my email list, could you go out, use that data and let everyone know that's appropriate about the sale and what's going on?"" And that's a much smaller commitment from the client, and we think that's a good way to get them in the door and, hopefully, eventually upsell to big CRM. So the long-winded answer is, if we can do that, along with our partners at, let's say, the mid-tier agencies who can afford to build these massive trading platforms, programmatic-type platforms, that this could be a nice winner and a nice feeder as well into big CRM. We've already started the retraining of our agency sales folks into CRM. And so we expect this thing to start taking root really towards the back half of the year. So hopefully, we'll see some results before we exit this year."

And having been in the business for 1,000 years here, going back to the '90s and the various cycles to where we are today, I think probably the biggest stress test that anyone has ever faced was the Great Recession. And in the Great Recession, what actually happened was that even though Private Label tends to and always has run a point-or-so above loss rates in sort of the general-purpose arena, what actually happened in the Great Recession is we performed a lot better in the general-purpose cards. And so what it really hit the fan, the general-purpose cards, those portfolios went from 4%, 5% to 10% or 11% loss rate. I mean, 600 basis points. We went up 300 and the reason behind that is why, I guess, we don't share the concern that others do about Private Label and everything else is the fact that for sure, it's a card that doesn't have utilization of a general-purpose card, but that's great in terms of when times get stretched because of the fact that you do not have a big open up buy line, and you do not have the ability to go use it to buy food and put gas in the car and then go bankrupt. So what you're seeing is there may be lots of cards out there, but as you go down the credit spectrum, you bring down your credit lines, and so you may have $100 credit line on someone with a thin file and that ability to manage or open to buy in your credit lines across 40 million households is what allowed us to really manage to a very modest hit during the Great Recession, and that's why I think we don't expect to see any spike, because we are very active in terms of managing credit lines."

You take that out of $1.4 billion, you're down to $900 million, and that essentially is what we have to play with without sort of increasing the leverage a lot. But sort of that $900 million is sort of what we play with and that either goes towards buyback or it goes towards M&A. And look, the M&A could be at the bank level with the portfolio.

It was a terrific third quarter with double-digit growth in all profitability measures. LoyaltyOne and Card Services came in better than expected for the third quarter while Epsilon lagged a bit on the top line growth expectations but executed",655,"Thanks, Ed. It was a terrific third quarter with double-digit growth in all profitability measures. LoyaltyOne and Card Services came in better than expected for the third quarter while Epsilon lagged a bit on the top line growth expectations but executed the important turn in adjusted EBITDA, which was flat for the third quarter after being down in the first and second quarters. 
As a result of the Q3 strong performance, we are raising annual guidance for the second time this year, increasing revenue from $7.15 billion to $7.2 billion and core EPS from $16.85 to $16.90. We did not pass through the full $0.32 beat to third quarter core EPS guidance because a large portion is timing-related, whereby some earnings were pulled forward out of Q4 to Q3. 
In particular, for AIR MILES, we expect redemption activity to moderate in Q4 after a run in Q3. Basically, collectors were getting ahead of the upcoming expiry date. And for Card Services, our principal loss rates came in 20 basis points better than guidance in Q3. We expect to get that back in Q4, which will prompt some reserve build. Lastly, I expect tax rates to tick up a bit in Q4. 
Turning to the repurchase program. We have acquired approximately 3.3 million shares under our repurchase program year-to-date and have approximately $300 million of our board authorization left in 2016. You will notice from the slide that we are making a big change in our shareholder return philosophy with our Board of Directors declaring a quarterly dividend yielding 1% with a record date of November 3. Going forward, we expect these balance of share repurchases and dividends to return capital to investors. Ed will talk about this some later in the presentation. 
Let's flip over to Page 4 and talk about LoyaltyOne. As previously mentioned, LoyaltyOne exceeded expectations for the third quarter as revenue and adjusted EBITDA increased 28% and 14%, respectively. BrandLoyalty came in as planned with the revenue up 5%. AIR MILES revenue greatly exceeded expectations increasing 43% from the third quarter 2015 due to elevated redemption activity. As you can see from the slide, foreign exchange rates had a nominal impact to the quarter. 
AIR MILES issued increased 6% in the third quarter, rebounding from a 3% decline in the second quarter and is on track for about 3% growth for the full year. AIR MILES redeemed increased 74% compared to the third quarter of 2015 as we saw a spike in activity in front of the 12/31 expiration date. Although expiry was introduced almost 5 years ago, this was the first quarter of elevated redemption activity related to it. We expect that some of the activities is just a pull-forward from Q4 to Q3 and that activity will abate somewhat in Q4, a matter of timing. 
Now the answer -- the question everyone will now be asking me is what does this mean for the accounting assumptions around the AIR MILES program? The answer is it's too early to know. We need to see if the elevated activity continues through Q4 and we need to evaluate which collectors are redeeming as the breakage estimate assumes certain collectors will redeem and certain collectors will not redeem. Only this second group really impacts breakage estimates. 
Fast-forward to the end of the year. If we determine that a breakage adjustment is needed, keep in mind that the accounting assumptions for the program are not evaluated in isolation, rather several other factors in accounting assumptions, such as cost of mile, loss of mile, residual, et cetera, will also need to be reevaluated. These potentially mitigate the impact of lowering breakage rates. 
Moving to BrandLoyalty. We recently signed supermarket chain, Lowes Foods, whereby we will manage promotional campaign in 75 Lowes Foods stores in North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. Overall, we are making solid progress in the U.S. 
Let's move to Epsilon and Bryan Kennedy."

Epsilon's revenue increased to $543 million for the third quarter, up 2% compared to the third quarter of 2015. Importantly, adjusted EBITDA came in at $135 million, which is flat compared to prior year after 2 straight quarter",996,"All right, thanks, Charles. Epsilon's revenue increased to $543 million for the third quarter, up 2% compared to the third quarter of 2015. Importantly, adjusted EBITDA came in at $135 million, which is flat compared to prior year after 2 straight quarters of decline. 
So to give you an update on our business, let me first discuss the EBITDA results. Our most critical focus at Epsilon for the last several quarters has been to alter the long-term trajectory of the cost structure required to support our business. And a big part of that has been the ramp-up of the investment in our India operations to fuel the global staffing model. I'm pleased that adjusted EBITDA after a Q1 decline of 22%, followed by a Q2 decline of 9%, has leveled off flat in Q3, even while still carrying substantial duplicative costs. While it's taken perhaps a quarter or 2 longer than we originally anticipated, I think on the cost front, we can safely say that our strategy is working, and we expect to see that trend continue to play out positively in Q4. 
So let's turn briefly to the revenue picture and a breakdown of the offerings within the Epsilon segment. I'll start with agency media & services, roughly 25% of the total business. These offerings produced $138 million of revenue for the quarter, a decline of 5% versus prior year. At the beginning of the year, this business line was one of our concern areas. And our objective was quite simply to lower the drag that it was placing on overall growth rates. We've made steady progress with each sequential quarter, from a decline of 23% in Q1 to a decline of 15% in Q2. And in this quarter, as you can see, we've now narrowed that drag to a mid-single-digit decline. 
Two key drivers fueled this. First, after a slow first half, Epsilon's agency offering has generated a number of new wins beginning to fuel back half growth, such as the agency record of win we announced this quarter with Del Monte Foods. Second, we've been working to pivot Conversant's agency media offering away from a commoditized offering with a dependence on large holding company agencies. We've got a sound plan in place, and we're progressing each quarter. 
Specifically, we're shifting towards an emphasis on more direct client relationships, on midsized agencies and on a data-driven digital media offering, fueled by our unique assets and scale. A central part of this plan involves the consolidation of all of our digital media on to what we call our core platform, which is the engine that fuels Conversant's data-rich, high-growth CRM business. And over the next 2 quarters, we will have substantially migrated the agency business to this core platform. What that does for us is important. It increases the quality and granularity of the audiences we can offer to our clients and it enhances our ability to deliver the metrics that clients are looking for. So we're on a good track to continue the transition of this business. 
All right. Let's turn to the digital & technology platforms business, the other 75% of our revenue. We grew to $405 million of revenue for the quarter, up 5% over the third quarter of 2015. Performance here was lower than expected, driven by 2 key offerings that I'll outline, one on the negative side and one on the positive side. 
First, the negative. Our Epsilon technology platform business, consisting specifically of loyalty and data-based solutions, was soft for the quarter, dampening an otherwise healthy growth for this category. This technology platform area in particular has been the focal point of the cost initiatives I described earlier as we've worked to correct this historic issue of being able to produce nice top line growth without demonstrating equal or better profitability growth. Consequentially, at the same time as we've been pulling back to focus internally on reining in costs, we've seen some external market conditions spike up that include price pressure and increased competitive forces. And in turn, we've missed some top line growth opportunities. Although it was critical to get to the cost side of this equation first, now that we're beginning to see it play out, we should be in a better position to return our focus on growth as we move through 2017.  
On the positive side, the second driver for the quarter here was Conversant's CRM business, which continues to perform very well. This offering was up over 50% compared to prior year and really led the growth for this overall category again. We continue to see strong demand with both new client wins and ongoing cross-sell into Epsilon's client portfolio. And as of this quarter, we've closed 36 year-to-date wins and a book of business that already exceeds our 2015 book by over 25% in potential value. 
In summary, if you look in aggregate the year we've put together so far for Epsilon/Conversant, it hasn't quite what we'd hoped for. But we have gotten some critical things done and are moving in the right direction. We addressed the cost structure within Epsilon, where the demand by clients for hot skills wasn't matching up with a market willing to let us pass on those costs. And while we might have lost some momentum on the growth front due to that, this was the right priority for our business. And we focused on the ongoing transformation at Conversant while driving successfully the growth of our CRM business. 
We're happy with the progress there. And really that's Phase 1 that we're now wrapping up. Phase 2 will be our focus as we enter and move through 2017, completing the agency pivot at Conversant, expanding our CRM offering, putting our shoulder back into raising the growth profile of our database and LoyaltyOne business. We're well-poised for that with our deep, unique assets and an excellent global team to service our clients. 
All right. Back over to you, Charles."

Let's flip over to Page 6 and talk about Card Services. Card Services had a better-than-expected quarter with a revenue of 26% and adjusted EBITDA net of 14% compared to the third quarter of 
[Audio Gap] 
essentially, the cardholder-friendly changes we made mid-2015 have burned in and the related compression has dissipated. Second, we continue to drive operating expense leveraging with operating expenses as a percentage of average card receivables dropping 30 basis points compared to third quarter of 2015. Third, principal loss rates were 20 basis points better than guidance of 4.7% and trends in delinquency rates are moving consistent with our principal loss rate forecast for 2016. Looking forward, we believe the beat to Q3 loss rate guidance is due to timing from seasonality and that we'll get it back in Q4. 
Conversely, we did see credit sales slow during the quarter. While we increased tender share with our brands by approximately 150 basis points during the third quarter, softness at several of our core brands dropped credit sales growth in our core to 3%, down from 7% growth in the first half of 2016. We expect that softness to continue into the fourth quarter. 
Counterbalancing, we have had a terrific year with new signings, The Children’s Place, ULTA Beauty and Williams-Sonoma, to name a few. Two of these brands have launched we are seeing early and very encouraging results as we welcome new card members to the programs. We have seen healthy application to the first few weeks, thanks to our new frictionless mobile credit acquisition capability, which reduces the times to apply by 25% and reduces abandonment rates more than 5x. 
Turning back to our solid loss performance. We have a good view into the rest of the year and expect that we will track in line with full year expectations. We also expect that as vintages mature, we will see delinquencies normalize around the middle of 2017 with losses normalizing thereafter. Ed will talk about this a bit later. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Ed."

And this is the commentary I'll give on third quarter, full year, then we'll go into a couple",2654,"Great. All right. If everyone could be on Slide 8 that says Third Quarter and Full Year Outlook. It has a bunch of colored dots on it to make it easy to follow. And this is the commentary I'll give on third quarter, full year, then we'll go into a couple of other items, and then '17.  
And from a consolidated level, third quarter revenue of $1.9 billion, up 19%, and earnings per share of $4.74, up 20%. Obviously, this was the largest quarter we have ever had in our history. And needless to say, very, very pleased at how strong a quarter it was, especially in this environment of low growth for the economy. Obviously, compared to guidance, we exceeded guidance by a lot. And I did want to break out our thinking in terms of how much to pass through or not pass through. We decided to sort of break it up into 3 pieces. 
Clearly, some of it was timing, right? Our loss rate in Q3 was lower than expected, but we expect the loss rate in Q4 to be -- to get that back. And as a result, if you want to call $0.15 or the $0.30 sort of that timing issue between quarters for loss rates, that's just how it goes. So we don't expect to recapture that additional $0.15. The second is yes, we're flowing through some of the overperformance into higher guidance. We've raised guidance twice this year. And that's what hopefully we'll continue to do as is our practice. And then finally, the third is little bit of, hey, we need a little bit more flexibility in Q4, specifically as it relates to our AIR MILES business in Canada. 
As Charles talked about, we are now approaching the first time in the program's history where we're looking at actually expiring miles from, I think, it was 1992 through 2011. So you've got 20 years about to expire now. Everyone has been informed of this 5 years ago and has been informed since then. However, we did not know exactly what the behavior was going to be as we're approaching the final end date here. And as a result, what we found is there is volumes that have picked up fairly dramatically in terms of people wanting to look at redeeming their miles. 
And as a result, what we found is that it did drive a big spike in redemption activity, which does drive a little bit of profit through to the bottom line as redemptions go up higher than anticipated. And that's what you saw in Q3. However, what we want to do is we want to make sure that the consumer is having a good experience and it has been challenging. We are putting, therefore, many millions of dollars into customer care. We have hired a ton of folks to work the phones on the redemption side up in Canada. We've got management taking phone calls on the floor. And as a result, we want to make sure that the millions that we're putting into this customer experience effort gives -- that's where we want to have the flexibility in terms of some of the excess from the Q3 overperformance. 
And so would we need it all? Don't know, but it's better to be prudent, it's better that you have a good experience up there because frankly we're getting flooded with folks trying to get this stuff in. And our job is to make sure that we don't damage the brand. So bear with us through the rest of the year. We think we're in very good shape, but we do want to have a little bit of flexibility here to make sure we can bulk up those resources as needed. 
So we're raising annual guidance to 11% growth in top line or $7.2 billion and core EPS of $16.90 or 12%. Again, I am reminded of the beginning of the year when we started out, and there were lots and lots of concern about the ability to continue to be a growth company in the face of normalizing credit conditions, followed by frankly a very soft Q1 of only about 5% growth. We knew the engine was going to pick up eventually. It did so starting in Q2. There were then concerns about whether that can continue forward. Hopefully, this has finally put that thing to bed. And what you have is you're beginning to see what this model can do. And what this model can do is double-digit top line, double-digit earnings growth while also absorbing almost 10 percentage points of growth rate from normalizing in losses. Said differently, if we're guiding to 12% in a normal -- in the environment that wouldn't have been normalizing, we would have done over 20%. So that's what the model can do. We're very happy with it. 
And finally, on the share repurchase side, I think we've done around $700 million so far. And corporate leverage ratio remains quite manageable at less than 3x. Again, Charles hates when I use -- when I round up or round down. But in general, you've got about $5 billion of debt. You've got a little under a couple of billion of EBITDA. And again, the EBITDA is measured for our covenants and indentures across the entire enterprise. So you're talking well under 3x, and that we feel is a very manageable level. So we're good there. And then for the first time since we started the company, we are, in fact, establishing a quarterly dividend at 1%. And that is to provide a sort of a more balanced return to shareholders. So you're going to see both dividends and you're going to see share repurchases. 
We are a growth company. And that's something that's frankly I have debated for years and years and years. The tide certainly has swung in favor of let's do a combo platter of both dividend and share repurchase. That's what we're doing. And being a growth company, one of the nice things is you have a dividend that's going to grow quite nicely in the coming years as we continue to grow at a rapid clip. So it's sort of a nice thing to have out there and it's also not significant enough to our cash flow that it hampers our flexibility when it comes to either buybacks or M&A or additional growth in our card business. 
Speaking of which, let's go to our card business. Another heck of a quarter portfolio growth, over 20% for both the quarter and the full year. And that's great news for me. Why? More pleased with frankly is the fact that our tender share, which again is defined as the amount of sales at a retailer that flow through our card versus other forms of payments. Basically, it means that more and more of the dollars that are being spent at retailers are flowing through our card. And that either means that we're bringing on more and more folks, perhaps they're folks with of lesser credit quality. That's always been a question out there. And as we look at it, we continue to see that's not the case. And in fact, that 85% of the additional tender share or growth that's coming on our cards are coming from accounts that have been with us for 3 years or more. 
So it means that the personalized data-driven marketing stuff, so to speak, works. We've had tender share gains of between 150 basis points and 180 basis points. What does that mean? It basically means if the retailer is doing a couple of points of sales growth, well, we're going to do somewhere between 5 to 8 points higher than that. That's how important this tender share growth is, and that's why it's so important, especially coming from those nice mature accounts.  
Gross yields, Charles talked about. Again, that was a huge concern of folks at the beginning of the year when year-over-year, we saw yields down over 200 basis points. We felt comfortable that, that was going to clean itself up as the year progressed. And sure enough, by Q2, it was only down 80 and Q3, we're almost back to flat. So that's one big concern that we can check the box on. 
Finally, delinquency rates and principal loss rates are tracking around the 50 basis points for the full year. We talked about Q3 loss rate was below sort of our guidance of almost a year ago and Q4 loss rate will make up the difference. But overall, you're going to slosh around and come in right around where we want it to be for the year. The other huge thing that sort of got lost this year was the fact that this was, by far, the best year in our history in terms of signing high-quality clients. And it was, by far, the biggest vintage we've ever signed, vintage, meaning that most of these folks are starting from scratch. We ramped them up over the process of 3 years. And when fully ramped up, they should be adding north of $2 billion of portfolio growth. And if you look at the clients, Boscov's and Hot Topic, Forever 21, The Children’s Place, Bed Bath & Beyond, Williams-Sonoma, Century 21 and ULTA, you're talking about by far the best vintage in terms of size and quality that we've ever had, which suggests the market is still quite robust. 
All right. Let's go on to the next page, talk a little bit about Epsilon/Conversant. As Bryan talked about, I would say if there was something that was a bit of a disappointment so far this year, it would have to be our top line at Epsilon. Frankly, we were hoping that we could pull off the cost restructuring in the whole India initiative while at the same time not losing any momentum on the revenue side. I think our appetite was a bit too large on that one. 
So the revenue growth is still choppy. It was down 2% in Q1. It was up 5% in Q2. It was up 2% in Q3. That's not our model. That's not what we're shooting for. We want to get into a very solid mid-single-digit growth run rate on top line and actually have a very consistent flow-through with some leverage to the bottom line. And in order to do that, as Bryan talked about, we needed to completely revamp our cost structure, essentially trying to mitigate the cost of the high skills with perhaps potentially some better leverage on the labor side. And that was the whole India initiative, where we have our office today and are very happy with how that thing is ramping up. 
So from, I guess, a longer-term perspective, from my perspective, from Bryan's perspective, we believe we have the cost structure fixed. And you can see that it's beginning to actually show results with your EBITDA year-over-year going from a mines 22% decline to minus 9% to flat. And I expect this thing up 5% in Q4, and then we exit the year and hopefully put this thing behind us. We'll have the cost structure in shape so that we can now go after the top line, knowing what our costs are. So it's been a long process and somewhat painful at times. But nonetheless, we're done with it. 
We turn now to LoyaltyOne, which comprises our European-based BrandLoyalty business. What can you say there? They're continuing to track double-digit growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA for the year. The thing seems to be a machine. The Canadian rollout has been very successful. And we're looking at $45 million or so in revs just from that, and that's only a year or so old. And then we had a big announcement of our first client in the United States. And that rollout is beginning to takeoff. And with that, hopefully we'll have many more announcements moving on from there. Obviously, with the U.S. being 10x the size of Canada, the opportunity there is quite large. 
Looking at AIR MILES, which is our Canadian loyalty business. We are seeing double-digit growth in revenue, some of that driven by the extra redemption activity that's flowing through. But we are seeing mid-single-digit growth in EBITDA as well. So the the program itself is vibrant, it's robust, it's still growing. It is far from sunsetting, that's for sure. And probably the only cautionary that we have there is we are working very hard to make sure that the brand does not get scarred with some of the drama around the expiration of 20 years' worth of miles. It's happening. It's going to happen. It's one and done for us. Financially, we don't think there's much risk there. However, we are being very cautious in terms of making sure we put as many resources as we can against this thing from people, et cetera, et cetera, to make sure that the consumer experience is as good as possible, even though it is a little bit crazy right now. So that's where we are. 
And let's now talk about the 2017 outlook again at a very high level. As we usually do this time of year, we give a base case. And the base case is plus 10%, plus 10%. We expect also nicely growing cash flow, free cash flow to go along with that, which you'll tend to get with our type of business model. So that's the base. It doesn't assume any meaningful share repurchases, any meaningful M&A. And it also factors in what we believe is the final drag from the Card Services loss rate normalization. So again, you're talking we expect to grow double-double despite absorbing another 10 points of potential earnings growth that's going towards this normalization process. 
And right now, from what we're seeing, it looks pretty good out there. The consumer looks good. And we expect another solid year of double-digit growth. So we started 2016 with a lot of folks skeptical that we could, in fact, hit double-double. And in fact, we're doing quite a bit above that despite absorbing this drag. We expect a similar rollout in 2017. And hopefully, people now feel comfortable that this is the type of model that can absorb this type of normalization. 
On LoyaltyOne, one of the big things we're trying to do, with BrandLoyalty, continue what they're doing. It's pretty straightforward, especially in North America, let's keep going. There's a lot of wood to chop out there, so that's what we're going to be doing. In AIR MILES, we expect to have a solid 2017. That being said, I do believe that we're going to get dinged a little bit on our brand in terms of this whole expiry process. Even though it will be over by the end of the year and will be on a very simple quarterly basis and you won't have the type of noise or drama, the fact is we're going to have to think hard about are we going to have to do something to make sure that our customers still feel loved and respected and that they're getting value out of the program? So we're going to watch very closely what the behavior is, what the reaction is. And we're going to try to mitigate anything that comes out that's somewhat negative.  
On Epsilon, Bryan talked about what we've done this year. It's critical next year that Conversant continue exceptional growth in its CRM business. This is the data-driven business, where we ingest SKU-level information from of areas clients. We than match up with that type of behavior to unique IDs associated with folks out there. And reach out to them with very targeted messaging. That business has been growing rapidly what, 30%, 40%, 50%? Something like that."

You're growing summer between $80 million and $100 million of revenue, and we expect that to be a big engine going forward. What sort of lost in that is the whole agency piece of Conversant, which again is when -- it's the old value quick business where we used to provide inventory to the big holding companies on Madison Ave., that of course, has gone the way of the rotary dial phone. And what we are now doing is we have made the decision that this is absolutely a business that can be pivoted towards CRM light or for those clients who don't need the full heavy-duty CRM, if it's just a lease activation type program where we are reaching out very quickly for sale that's coming up in 2 days, this is a perfectly of doing it. So we think we're going to got a solution there that could also help feed dimensionally into the big CRM business. On the core, Epsilon core, we need to convert this new cost structure quite frankly into revenue growth. It's time to get going on this thing. We've got the cost structure that we want, we know how the price the deals now and we expect to get some movement here. 
On Card Services, it's going to be a little bit different in '17. The focus will be laser like on existing organic growth and making sure that there's huge book that we signed in 2016 has a very strong start up. So we'll probably be a little bit less on just looking for bulk out there in the marketplace. That is big portfolios to purchase. We're looking more on taking our bread and butter, which is these great names that have never had a program starting them from scratch, nurturing them and getting them moving and grooving. And we expect that allows us to keep the types of returns that is unique in the marketplace. 
So that's what we're focused on. Also, the less of a focus on pure bulk relates to the fact that some of these big files that are out there frankly, the [ph] in the market is such that it's just not that attractive to us. So we're going to be very disciplined about it here been here before, we'll do it again, nonetheless, we expect personally growth in cards, and we did now forget talking about the final stage, the normalization in credit quality, which should take place this year. I did want to mention very quickly, I've seen a couple of commentaries up there about the '15 vintage and loosening credit everything else but as we make it very clear. We did not loosen credit atolls in and if our vintages. What happens, however, the massive to further and further away from coming back from the Great Recession is that the clients that you signed and the cardholders that signed up will tend to skew more towards the lower and of our acceptable range. But we did not lower standards at all. But what you have this more folks coming from the lower end of that acceptable range and it's not being balanced out in the higher end. So as we move into '16, in the '16 vintage, you'll see that we did in fact tried to balance that out a little bit that are. And we did tweak the credit quality to be a little bit higher. And that should balance out nicely. So I wanted to make sure, that no one misunderstood that piece of it. 
Okay, appreciate everyone's patience. Let's go to the outlook with the fabulous chart that we have here. this delinquency and that loss rates. And Charles, and I and the folks at Card Services have spent I don't know how much time trying to figure out the easiest way to communicate and to provide comfort that this is not a runaway train. And that in fact this is a normal process that needs to take place after a long period of abnormally low losses following the Great Recession. And we have been through every single possible scenario and have come up with probably the easiest way for people to view this. And this is how we run our business, frankly, which is you look at delinquency rates. So an account that is delinquent needs to flow through 180 days of being delinquent before it actually writes off and the write-off results in a charge to the P&L statement. And that means that you have a nice view into what the ultimate loss rate will be. 
Delinquency rates have been the best predictor that there is in the card business. And in our business for sure with a 90% correlation over many, many, many years. And so you will see from the first chart here that in 2016, we saw our delinquency rate go from 4 2 to 4 7, and you saw our corresponding move on the loss rate side. We expect 2017 to be around 5% and stabilize out there going into '18 as well. 
How did we come up with this stuff we just completed? We go through a portfolio by portfolio over 155 clients, vintage by vintage and each portfolio, take a look at the aging and then we lay out what we believe the delinquency will be. This is what we're going to use. We will update this every month. We will provide these in our monthly release and this is really the best metric that we know that really captures everything. 
So if you start seeing these delinquency rates, start spiking higher, then chances are you're going losses as well. 
All right, let's go to our final page, I believe, or second or final page, which is the 2000, which we're calling, closing the wedge. This is a very simple concept. What you're looking at here in our delinquency cards. As fascinating as they are, let's spent a couple of seconds on it. And what you'll see your is it's by months what you'll also see is how the curves look very similar and how they go up and down, which means there is a great deal of seasonality to delinquencies. 
And so for example, when we released our recent monthly data and it showed a 5% or something on delinquencies and I've got a couple of folks saying, oh my gosh, your delinquencies are going up, that's seasonality. October, which we haven't released yet, you're going to be in the low 5s and then November, December, you're going to start dipping below in the 4s [ph]. That's just the way the cycle works. So again, this is the best way to look at things. And if you look at the Orange line, if you can see it, that's 2016, it shows how it is about the red line by about 50 basis points, which was 2015 and fairly consistently so. And that's right the good predictor of your loss rate. 
As we go into '17, this is the critical point, '17 is the dotted blue line. You will see that we will enter '17 we believe around that 50 or 60 basis point spread versus last year. And then the whole that comes down to just these gap starts to narrow? The wedge close? If, in fact, the wedge closes, over the next couple of quarters, and starts to narrow, then you just know by definition that the eventual losses that are spit out based on those delinquencies will normalize as well. 
So what this essentially says the normalization process is nearing its end. We get into Q1. We get through Q2, Q2 should start to narrow. And by the end of Q3, you're basically on top of where we were this year, which means the losses that come out after that are going to be flat to this year. 
And what does that all mean? It means earnings accelerates from the low double digits to the 20-plus that you're used to. So get used to the wedge, that's what we're going to be talking about. And it also takes a lot of the noise out of the system. And the idea of talking about delinquency flows up and down and master trust and growth losses and net losses and total losses and everything else, frankly, the noise level, it's hard to really get the message out there. And so this is how we run our business if the wedge doesn't close, then you know we have another year that we've got a to fight this thing in 2018. We do not believe that's not the case, but we're trying to be as transparent as possible. 
All right, finishing up on summary. Over the past 15 years, this company has had revenue growth of 16% a year for 15 years. Core EPS has been up 26% each year for 15 years. As we look at '16 and '17, because of the normalization and loss rates, which essentially means, look, the Great Recession washed a bunch of stuff out. You had sort of pristine credit only coming out of the recession and that's beginning to normalize now as people have repaired their credit and we have a more normal consumer mix in our portfolio. It's nothing to get worked up about. It just makes things are returning to a level that we had anticipated. But the normalization process has knocked 10 points off of our earnings growth and brought it from the 20s into the 12% we're looking at for '16. Nonetheless, despite this normalization effort, you have a model that sufficiently diversified and business is cycling at different times where we can absorb this hit and still grow double-digit as we have this year. Top and bottom in double-digit in the 17 and then back to the 20% after the wedge closes. 
At the end of the day, I'll finish up finally, and say that I think, the narrative for this company frankly has been lost this year in terms of the noise that has been out in the marketplace. We expect to regain the narrative, and we will be talking more and more about the strategic positioning of this company why we believe financially even in a normalization period we're double double. When the wedge closes, we go back to 20%. But there's a reason for that or the reason for that is all of our businesses are benefiting from the secular trends that we're seeing, whereby, data and unique data is being used to gain insights to then provide marketing and creative that are then turned into personalized one-to-one communications to our clients customers. And that's through the various digital channels where we have unique IDs on individuals around the world. And that's a secular trend we expect to continue. It's certainly not going away and it's something that we're very excited about across all of our businesses.

I think that's something that we look pretty carefully. No question there's a lot of companies that are playing in the space and have entered the space from the Google's and Facebook's of the world that provides solutions to the SaaS players to the big agency holding companies that are scrambling to put together technology and data solutions. We stand back and look at it, we think that it's still a very vibrant market. We have a particular focus, which is to bring our data-driven solutions together with technology and creative and then deliver those in kind of client-intimate way. So we're looking for the segment of the market where clients really value a services rich sort of delivery. That's not going to be the model that the entire market will chase after but we think there is plenty for us. So I think for an Epsilon at this point, this is a bit more of a scenario, where our win rate has slowed a bit that perhaps is because we have been here more picky and cautious with all of the focus on cost. And then if you look at our existing client base, we've seen a bit of a pullback in some of our large clients, again, perhaps the parents also focus the help to work as we move through 2017. We certainly will have much more intense focus on growth as we roll into the year. So a couple of factors out there but I don't think major drivers for this market."

Be happy to, Wayne. I think one of the areas that is of concern is the fact that our client base -- although the consumer, right, is doing quite well and his holding up the economy, what we're not seeing is we're seeing the translate into a lot of good growth at our clients. What we're seeing at our clients probably overall is actually there are same-store sales, Wayne, have been down, 1% to 2%. And that's not new news to anyone but soft good apparel, high-end home furnishings, jewelry, stuff like that, you're just not seeing the consumer spending there. The consumer is spending it on autos and things like that which, of course, benefits our auto business. But so would the same-store sales are probably minus 1, minus 2. And as a result, with the tender share gains, we can get probably plus 5, plus 6 in sales growth from the core, whereas before, we used to do plus 10 when the clients were doing plus 3. So you sort of downshifted little bit in terms of expectations from the core. We still expect to get somewhere between 5 and 8 percentage points above same-store sales of the clients but right now, we're seeing softness. I know the NRF came out and suggest that we're going to have a pretty decent holiday. Hopefully, that is the case. But again, that sort of downshifted sort of mitigating that for our as has been the fact that the vintage that we did sign for 2016 frankly was well north of what's going to be $2 billion add to the file. The big growth chain change like Ulta and the Forever 21's of the world, those are going to do quite well. The other was our very large clients, the Williams-Sonoma's of the world, the Bath and Beyond of the world, they're going to be code sized files. And so I would say that the weakness on the core client base itself is going to be mitigated by the ramp up on the organic side from the big 2016 vintage. As we look at big portfolio purchases in '17, frankly, we don't see much out there that is usually attractive. If we do something, it will have to meet some very strict hurdle rates. We are not going to dilute the business. We want to see our yields hold up very firmly through 2017. So we may sacrifice a bit of growth on the portfolio to maintain more robust yields and a better use of capital. So look for '17 to reflect the less robust growth from the core due to the core it self, the retailers being sort of subpar growth on the results sales but we do expect the tender share gains and a very strong '16 contribution."

The first answer to where it is when we start the program, I can't even do that without rounding. It's at 0. And then over the course of 3 years, we'll probably get it up to around 30% or so of our sales that retailer our card. And then the real fun stuff kicks in. The longer we have all worked clients, the more SKU level information we have in our customers of their client, which means the more precise the targeting is when we do all of our targeting to the clients through all the different channels that, whether it's point of sale or whether it's through all the various digital channels using Conversant, and we actually have a number of clients who are over 50%. And what we're finding is a huge chunk of the incremental pickup for us, Wayne, as to the online channels, these retailers are using online very effectively.

You're having more and more folks who have repaired their credit, who are back in the market, who have jobs again, who are working and they tend to flow into the file. And as a result, what you saw was it's less about losses going up, it's more about losses are beginning to conform more to sort of the type of consumer that we cater to. So that's sort of the big sort of misperception there of we got -- we're not shooting for percent loss rate. That's not how we optimize the file.

Specific to your question, yes, when we saw the 15 vintage, and we saw that we were kind of -- it look like a lot of the prime folks who are at the high end of the pool, there are fewer of those in more folks who still met our credit criteria but was a little bit lower in the overall packing order, they tended to do a little bit more in we needed to tighten up a little bit."

Everyone is comparing prices. And as a result, that's what you did a lot of pressure on our clients, which is really on the pricing side. And so that's why the margins have been so tough at our clients. Obviously, the whole online space makes a lot more convenient for people to work. I do think the retailers in our space are coming back strongly with their online offerings. And the we'll make a nice dance on that side of it. But andrew, I really, from what we're seeing, it's the pricing side of it, your Amazon has educated the consumer to such a degree that the consumer no one pays full price anymore. And as a result, your sales service offering as much from pricing declines as from just unit declines. And so that's what the retailers are struggling with is what the new model. What we're trying to do is obviously this flows very nicely into how we run our business, which is -- you can't just have $200 million marketing budget and go out and splash it around to everyone. You need to be much more precise, much more effective with how you market the folks down to the one-on-one level.

So I think from a market perspective, having watched us for 20 years, I don't see that, that's going to change radically. So that's kind of the focus point for our business. In terms of whether there is something structural that goes well beyond that, we're going to was without quarter-to-quarter. But we really believe strongly and this is coming from the voice of the clients that we serve in the Global 1000 CMO that we're targeting that, that needed there in the marketplace and that those are skills that they don't have and have. The focus issue for us and really isn't putting this foundation in place is the change we did see is a scenario where the kinds of skills that you need to service those relationships aren't always matched up with the client's willingness to continue to pay more for those as cost of living goes up, et cetera.

It's kind of complicated decision process for our clients to navigate in terms of thinking through all of the those options and then selecting the right choice. I mean, part of what we've done historically is position ourselves as kind of a trusted adviser that has the ability to really help a client navigate those decisions and then actually drive outcomes from their investments. That's a different position than a lot of the other providers, including some of our partners were a little more focused on a software sales with less accountability and responsibility to really drive results. So part of what we did to do better I think, is kind the double down on that there can terms of educating our clients. And then focusing carefully on the players that really value the sort of services that we bring to the table and not frankly chasing everything. The other side of it from our perspective is when you look at the assets that Conversant brings to the table from a digital execution perspective, from the ability to really have a pristine device capabilities and then incredible ability to which consumers. When you put that together with our big technology platforms, including Harmony and our database and loyalty platforms, you start to really see I think, some significant differentiation in terms of what we do versus the rest of the market these.

It was a terrific third quarter with double-digit growth in all profitability measures. LoyaltyOne and Card Services came in better than expected for the third quarter while Epsilon lagged a bit on the top line growth expectations but executed the important turn in adjusted EBITDA, which was flat for the third quarter after being down in the first and second quarters. 
As a result of the Q3 strong performance, we are raising annual guidance for the second time this year, increasing revenue from $7.15 billion to $7.2 billion and core EPS from $16.85 to $16.90. We did not pass through the full $0.32 beat to third quarter core EPS guidance because a large portion is timing-related, whereby some earnings were pulled forward out of Q4 to Q3. 
In particular, for AIR MILES, we expect redemption activity to moderate in Q4 after a run in Q3. Basically, collectors were getting ahead of the upcoming expiry date. And for Card Services, our principal loss rates came in 20 basis points better than guidance in Q3. We expect to get that back in Q4, which will prompt some reserve build. Lastly, I expect tax rates to tick up a bit in Q4. 
Turning to the repurchase program. We have acquired approximately 3.3 million shares under our repurchase program year-to-date and have approximately $300 million of our board authorization left in 2016. You will notice from the slide that we are making a big change in our shareholder return philosophy with our Board of Directors declaring a quarterly dividend yielding 1% with a record date of November 3. Going forward, we expect these balance of share repurchases and dividends to return capital to investors. Ed will talk about this some later in the presentation. 
Let's flip over to Page 4 and talk about LoyaltyOne. As previously mentioned, LoyaltyOne exceeded expectations for the third quarter as revenue and adjusted EBITDA increased 28% and 14%, respectively. BrandLoyalty came in as planned with the revenue up 5%. AIR MILES revenue greatly exceeded expectations increasing 43% from the third quarter 2015 due to elevated redemption activity. As you can see from the slide, foreign exchange rates had a nominal impact to the quarter. 
AIR MILES issued increased 6% in the third quarter, rebounding from a 3% decline in the second quarter and is on track for about 3% growth for the full year. AIR MILES redeemed increased 74% compared to the third quarter of 2015 as we saw a spike in activity in front of the 12/31 expiration date. Although expiry was introduced almost 5 years ago, this was the first quarter of elevated redemption activity related to it. We expect that some of the activities is just a pull-forward from Q4 to Q3 and that activity will abate somewhat in Q4, a matter of timing. 
Now the answer -- the question everyone will now be asking me is what does this mean for the accounting assumptions around the AIR MILES program? The answer is it's too early to know. We need to see if the elevated activity continues through Q4 and we need to evaluate which collectors are redeeming as the breakage estimate assumes certain collectors will redeem and certain collectors will not redeem. Only this second group really impacts breakage estimates. 
Fast-forward to the end of the year. If we determine that a breakage adjustment is needed, keep in mind that the accounting assumptions for the program are not evaluated in isolation, rather several other factors in accounting assumptions, such as cost of mile, loss of mile, residual, et cetera, will also need to be reevaluated. These potentially mitigate the impact of lowering breakage rates. 
Moving to BrandLoyalty. We recently signed supermarket chain, Lowes Foods, whereby we will manage promotional campaign in 75 Lowes Foods stores in North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. Overall, we are making solid progress in the U.S. 
Let's move to Epsilon and Bryan Kennedy."

Epsilon's revenue increased to $543 million for the third quarter, up 2% compared to the third quarter of 2015. Importantly, adjusted EBITDA came in at $135 million, which is flat compared to prior year after 2 straight quarter",996,"All right, thanks, Charles. Epsilon's revenue increased to $543 million for the third quarter, up 2% compared to the third quarter of 2015. Importantly, adjusted EBITDA came in at $135 million, which is flat compared to prior year after 2 straight quarters of decline. 
So to give you an update on our business, let me first discuss the EBITDA results. Our most critical focus at Epsilon for the last several quarters has been to alter the long-term trajectory of the cost structure required to support our business. And a big part of that has been the ramp-up of the investment in our India operations to fuel the global staffing model. I'm pleased that adjusted EBITDA after a Q1 decline of 22%, followed by a Q2 decline of 9%, has leveled off flat in Q3, even while still carrying substantial duplicative costs. While it's taken perhaps a quarter or 2 longer than we originally anticipated, I think on the cost front, we can safely say that our strategy is working, and we expect to see that trend continue to play out positively in Q4. 
So let's turn briefly to the revenue picture and a breakdown of the offerings within the Epsilon segment. I'll start with agency media & services, roughly 25% of the total business. These offerings produced $138 million of revenue for the quarter, a decline of 5% versus prior year. At the beginning of the year, this business line was one of our concern areas. And our objective was quite simply to lower the drag that it was placing on overall growth rates. We've made steady progress with each sequential quarter, from a decline of 23% in Q1 to a decline of 15% in Q2. And in this quarter, as you can see, we've now narrowed that drag to a mid-single-digit decline. 
Two key drivers fueled this. First, after a slow first half, Epsilon's agency offering has generated a number of new wins beginning to fuel back half growth, such as the agency record of win we announced this quarter with Del Monte Foods. Second, we've been working to pivot Conversant's agency media offering away from a commoditized offering with a dependence on large holding company agencies. We've got a sound plan in place, and we're progressing each quarter. 
Specifically, we're shifting towards an emphasis on more direct client relationships, on midsized agencies and on a data-driven digital media offering, fueled by our unique assets and scale. A central part of this plan involves the consolidation of all of our digital media on to what we call our core platform, which is the engine that fuels Conversant's data-rich, high-growth CRM business. And over the next 2 quarters, we will have substantially migrated the agency business to this core platform. What that does for us is important. It increases the quality and granularity of the audiences we can offer to our clients and it enhances our ability to deliver the metrics that clients are looking for. So we're on a good track to continue the transition of this business. 
All right. Let's turn to the digital & technology platforms business, the other 75% of our revenue. We grew to $405 million of revenue for the quarter, up 5% over the third quarter of 2015. Performance here was lower than expected, driven by 2 key offerings that I'll outline, one on the negative side and one on the positive side. 
First, the negative. Our Epsilon technology platform business, consisting specifically of loyalty and data-based solutions, was soft for the quarter, dampening an otherwise healthy growth for this category. This technology platform area in particular has been the focal point of the cost initiatives I described earlier as we've worked to correct this historic issue of being able to produce nice top line growth without demonstrating equal or better profitability growth. Consequentially, at the same time as we've been pulling back to focus internally on reining in costs, we've seen some external market conditions spike up that include price pressure and increased competitive forces. And in turn, we've missed some top line growth opportunities. Although it was critical to get to the cost side of this equation first, now that we're beginning to see it play out, we should be in a better position to return our focus on growth as we move through 2017.  
On the positive side, the second driver for the quarter here was Conversant's CRM business, which continues to perform very well. This offering was up over 50% compared to prior year and really led the growth for this overall category again. We continue to see strong demand with both new client wins and ongoing cross-sell into Epsilon's client portfolio. And as of this quarter, we've closed 36 year-to-date wins and a book of business that already exceeds our 2015 book by over 25% in potential value. 
In summary, if you look in aggregate the year we've put together so far for Epsilon/Conversant, it hasn't quite what we'd hoped for. But we have gotten some critical things done and are moving in the right direction. We addressed the cost structure within Epsilon, where the demand by clients for hot skills wasn't matching up with a market willing to let us pass on those costs. And while we might have lost some momentum on the growth front due to that, this was the right priority for our business. And we focused on the ongoing transformation at Conversant while driving successfully the growth of our CRM business. 
We're happy with the progress there. And really that's Phase 1 that we're now wrapping up. Phase 2 will be our focus as we enter and move through 2017, completing the agency pivot at Conversant, expanding our CRM offering, putting our shoulder back into raising the growth profile of our database and loyalty business. We're well-poised for that with our deep, unique assets and an excellent global team to service our clients. 
All right. Back over to you, Charles."

Let's flip over to Page 6 and talk about Card Services. Card Services had a better-than-expected quarter with a revenue of 26% and adjusted EBITDA net of 14% compared to the third quarter of 2015.Now what really drove the overperformance?",378,"Thanks, Bryan. Let's flip over to Page 6 and talk about Card Services. Card Services had a better-than-expected quarter with a revenue of 26% and adjusted EBITDA net of 14% compared to the third quarter of 2015.
Now what really drove the overperformance? And there's really several things I'd point to. First, gross yields came in at 26.8%, 60 points better than original guidance and within 10 basis points of last year. Essentially, the cardholder-friendly changes we made mid-2015 have burned in and the related compression has dissipated. Second, we continue to drive operating expense leveraging with operating expenses as a percentage of average card receivables dropping 30 basis points compared to third quarter of 2015. Third, principal loss rates were 20 basis points better than guidance of 4.7% and trends in delinquency rates are moving consistent with our principal loss rate forecast for 2016. Looking forward, we believe the beat to Q3 loss rate guidance is due to timing from seasonality and that we'll get it back in Q4. 
Conversely, we did see credit sales slow during the quarter. While we increased tender share with our brands by approximately 150 basis points during the third quarter, softness at several of our core brands dropped credit sales growth in our core to 3%, down from 7% growth in the first half of 2016. We expect that softness to continue into the fourth quarter. 
Counterbalancing, we have had a terrific year with new signings, The Children’s Place, ULTA Beauty and Williams-Sonoma, to name a few. Two of these brands have launched we are seeing early and very encouraging results as we welcome new card members to the programs. We have seen healthy application to the first few weeks, thanks to our new frictionless mobile credit acquisition capability, which reduces the times to apply by 25% and reduces abandonment rates more than 5x. 
Turning back to our solid loss performance. We have a good view into the rest of the year and expect that we will track in line with full year expectations. We also expect that as vintages mature, we will see delinquencies normalize around the middle of 2017 with losses normalizing thereafter. Ed will talk about this a bit later. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Ed."

It has a bunch of colored dots on it to make it easy to follow. And this is the commentary I'll give on third quarter, full year, then we'll go into a couple of other items, and then '17.  
And from a consolidated level, third quarter revenue of $1.9 billion, up 19%, and earnings per share of $4.74, up 20%. Obviously, this was the largest quarter we have ever had in our history. And needless to say, very, very pleased at how strong a quarter it was, especially in this environment of low growth for the economy. Obviously, compared to guidance, we exceeded guidance by a lot. And I did want to break out our thinking in terms of how much to pass through or not pass through. We decided to sort of break it up into 3 pieces. 
Clearly, some of it was timing, right? Our loss rate in Q3 was lower than expected, but we expect the loss rate in Q4 to be -- to get that back. And as a result, if you want to call $0.15 or the $0.30 sort of that timing issue between quarters for loss rates, that's just how it goes. So we don't expect to recapture that additional $0.15. The second is yes, we're flowing through some of the overperformance into higher guidance. We've raised guidance twice this year. And that's what hopefully we'll continue to do as is our practice. And then finally, the third is little bit of, hey, we need a little bit more flexibility in Q4, specifically as it relates to our AIR MILES business in Canada. 
As Charles talked about, we are now approaching the first time in the program's history where we're looking at actually expiring miles from, I think, it was 1992 through 2011. So you've got 20 years about to expire now. Everyone has been informed of this 5 years ago and has been informed since then. However, we did not know exactly what the behavior was going to be as we're approaching the final end date here. And as a result, what we found is there is volumes that have picked up fairly dramatically in terms of people wanting to look at redeeming their miles. 
And as a result, what we found is that it did drive a big spike in redemption activity, which does drive a little bit of profit through to the bottom line as redemptions go up higher than anticipated. And that's what you saw in Q3. However, what we want to do is we want to make sure that the consumer is having a good experience and it has been challenging. We are putting, therefore, many millions of dollars into customer care. We have hired a ton of folks to work the phones on the redemption side up in Canada. We've got management taking phone calls on the floor. And as a result, we want to make sure that the millions that we're putting into this customer experience effort gives -- that's where we want to have the flexibility in terms of some of the excess from the Q3 overperformance. 
And so would we need it all? Don't know, but it's better to be prudent, it's better that you have a good experience up there because frankly we're getting flooded with folks trying to get this stuff in. And our job is to make sure that we don't damage the brand. So bear with us through the rest of the year. We think we're in very good shape, but we do want to have a little bit of flexibility here to make sure we can bulk up those resources as needed. 
So we're raising annual guidance to 11% growth in top line or $7.2 billion and core EPS of $16.90 or 12%. Again, I am reminded of the beginning of the year when we started out, and there were lots and lots of concern about the ability to continue to be a growth company in the face of normalizing credit conditions, followed by frankly a very soft Q1 of only about 5% growth. We knew the engine was going to pick up eventually. It did so starting in Q2. There were then concerns about whether that can continue forward. Hopefully, this has finally put that thing to bed. And what you have is you're beginning to see what this model can do. And what this model can do is double-digit top line, double-digit earnings growth while also absorbing almost 10 percentage points of growth rate from normalizing in losses. Said differently, if we're guiding to 12% in a normal -- in the environment that wouldn't have been normalizing, we would have done over 20%. So that's what the model can do. We're very happy with it. 
And finally, on the share repurchase side, I think we've done around $700 million so far. And corporate leverage ratio remains quite manageable at less than 3x. Again, Charles hates when I use -- when I round up or round down. But in general, you've got about $5 billion of debt. You've got a little under a couple of billion of EBITDA. And again, the EBITDA is measured for our covenants and indentures across the entire enterprise. So you're talking well under 3x, and that we feel is a very manageable level. So we're good there. And then for the first time since we started the company, we are, in fact, establishing a quarterly dividend at 1%. And that is to provide a sort of a more balanced return to shareholders. So you're going to see both dividends and you're going to see share repurchases. 
We are a growth company. And that's something that's frankly I have debated for years and years and years. The tide certainly has swung in favor of let's do a combo platter of both dividend and share repurchase. That's what we're doing. And being a growth company, one of the nice things is you have a dividend that's going to grow quite nicely in the coming years as we continue to grow at a rapid clip. So it's sort of a nice thing to have out there and it's also not significant enough to our cash flow that it hampers our flexibility when it comes to either buybacks or M&A or additional growth in our card business. 
Speaking of which, let's go to our card business. Another heck of a quarter portfolio growth, over 20% for both the quarter and the full year. And that's great news for me. Why? More pleased with frankly is the fact that our tender share, which again is defined as the amount of sales at a retailer that flow through our card versus other forms of payments. Basically, it means that more and more of the dollars that are being spent at retailers are flowing through our card. And that either means that we're bringing on more and more folks, perhaps they're folks with of lesser credit quality. That's always been a question out there. And as we look at it, we continue to see that's not the case. And in fact, that 85% of the additional tender share or growth that's coming on our cards are coming from accounts that have been with us for 3 years or more. 
So it means that the personalized data-driven marketing stuff, so to speak, works. We've had tender share gains of between 150 basis points and 180 basis points. What does that mean? It basically means if the retailer is doing a couple of points of sales growth, well, we're going to do somewhere between 5 to 8 points higher than that. That's how important this tender share growth is, and that's why it's so important, especially coming from those nice mature accounts.  
Gross yields, Charles talked about. Again, that was a huge concern of folks at the beginning of the year when year-over-year, we saw yields down over 200 basis points. We felt comfortable that, that was going to clean itself up as the year progressed. And sure enough, by Q2, it was only down 80 and Q3, we're almost back to flat. So that's one big concern that we can check the box on. 
Finally, delinquency rates and principal loss rates are tracking around the 50 basis points for the full year. We talked about Q3 loss rate was below sort of our guidance of almost a year ago and Q4 loss rate will make up the difference. But overall, you're going to slosh around and come in right around where we want it to be for the year. The other huge thing that sort of got lost this year was the fact that this was, by far, the best year in our history in terms of signing high-quality clients. And it was, by far, the biggest vintage we've ever signed, vintage, meaning that most of these folks are starting from scratch. We ramped them up over the process of 3 years. And when fully ramped up, they should be adding north of $2 billion of portfolio growth. And if you look at the clients, Boscov's and Hot Topic, Forever 21, The Children’s Place, Bed Bath & Beyond, Williams-Sonoma, Century 21 and ULTA, you're talking about by far the best vintage in terms of size and quality that we've ever had, which suggests the market is still quite robust. 
All right. Let's go on to the next page, talk a little bit about Epsilon/Conversant. As Bryan talked about, I would say if there was something that was a bit of a disappointment so far this year, it would have to be our top line at Epsilon. Frankly, we were hoping that we could pull off the cost restructuring in the whole India initiative while at the same time not losing any momentum on the revenue side. I think our appetite was a bit too large on that one. 
So the revenue growth is still choppy. It was down 2% in Q1. It was up 5% in Q2. It was up 2% in Q3. That's not our model. That's not what we're shooting for. We want to get into a very solid mid-single-digit growth run rate on top line and actually have a very consistent flow-through with some leverage to the bottom line. And in order to do that, as Bryan talked about, we needed to completely revamp our cost structure, essentially trying to mitigate the cost of the high skills with perhaps potentially some better leverage on the labor side. And that was the whole India initiative, where we have our office today and are very happy with how that thing is ramping up. 
So from, I guess, a longer-term perspective, from my perspective, from Bryan's perspective, we believe we have the cost structure fixed. And you can see that it's beginning to actually show results with your EBITDA year-over-year going from a mines 22% decline to minus 9% to flat. And I expect this thing up 5% in Q4, and then we exit the year and hopefully put this thing behind us. We'll have the cost structure in shape so that we can now go after the top line, knowing what our costs are. So it's been a long process and somewhat painful at times. But nonetheless, we're done with it. 
We turn now to LoyaltyOne, which comprises our European-based BrandLoyalty business. What can you say there? They're continuing to track double-digit growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA for the year. The thing seems to be a machine. The Canadian rollout has been very successful. And we're looking at $45 million or so in revs just from that, and that's only a year or so old. And then we had a big announcement of our first client in the United States. And that rollout is beginning to takeoff. And with that, hopefully we'll have many more announcements moving on from there. Obviously, with the U.S. being 10x the size of Canada, the opportunity there is quite large. 
Looking at AIR MILES, which is our Canadian loyalty business. We are seeing double-digit growth in revenue, some of that driven by the extra redemption activity that's flowing through. But we are seeing mid-single-digit growth in EBITDA as well. So the program itself is vibrant, it's robust, it's still growing. It is far from sunsetting, that's for sure. And probably the only cautionary that we have there is we are working very hard to make sure that the brand does not get scarred with some of the drama around the expiration of 20 years' worth of miles. It's happening. It's going to happen. It's one and done for us. Financially, we don't think there's much risk there. However, we are being very cautious in terms of making sure we put as many resources as we can against this thing from people, et cetera, et cetera, to make sure that the consumer experience is as good as possible, even though it is a little bit crazy right now. So that's where we are. 
And let's now talk about the 2017 outlook again at a very high level. As we usually do this time of year, we give a base case. And the base case is plus 10%, plus 10%. We expect also nicely growing cash flow, free cash flow to go along with that, which you'll tend to get with our type of business model. So that's the base. It doesn't assume any meaningful share repurchases, any meaningful M&A. And it also factors in what we believe is the final drag from the Card Services loss rate normalization. So again, you're talking we expect to grow double-double despite absorbing another 10 points of potential earnings growth that's going towards this normalization process. 
And right now, from what we're seeing, it looks pretty good out there. The consumer looks good. And we expect another solid year of double-digit growth. So we started 2016 with a lot of folks skeptical that we could, in fact, hit double-double. And in fact, we're doing quite a bit above that despite absorbing this drag. We expect a similar rollout in 2017. And hopefully, people now feel comfortable that this is the type of model that can absorb this type of normalization. 
On LoyaltyOne, one of the big things we're trying to do, with BrandLoyalty, continue what they're doing. It's pretty straightforward, especially in North America, let's keep going. There's a lot of wood to chop out there, so that's what we're going to be doing. In AIR MILES, we expect to have a solid 2017. That being said, I do believe that we're going to get dinged a little bit on our brand in terms of this whole expiry process. Even though it will be over by the end of the year and will be on a very simple quarterly basis and you won't have the type of noise or drama, the fact is we're going to have to think hard about are we going to have to do something to make sure that our customers still feel loved and respected and that they're getting value out of the program? So we're going to watch very closely what the behavior is, what the reaction is. And we're going to try to mitigate anything that comes out that's somewhat negative.  
On Epsilon, Bryan talked about what we've done this year. It's critical next year that Conversant continue exceptional growth in its CRM business. This is the data-driven business, where we ingest SKU-level information from various clients. We then match up that type of behavior to unique IDs associated with folks out there and reach out to them with very targeted messaging. That business has been growing rapidly, what, 30%, 40%, 50%, something like that?"

You're growing somewhere between $80 million and $100 million a year of revenue. And we expect that to be a big engine going forward. 
What's sort of lost in that is the whole agency piece of Conversant, which again is when -- it's the old ValueClick business, where we used to provide inventory to the big holding companies on Madison Ave. That, of course, has gone the way of the rotary dial phone. And what we are now doing is we have made the decision that this is absolutely a business that can be pivoted towards CRM light or for those clients who don't need the full, heavy-duty CRM. If it's just a list activation-type program, where we're reaching out very quickly for a sale that's coming up in 2 days, this is a perfect way of doing it. So we think we've got a solution there that could also help feed eventually into the big CRM business. On the core, Epsilon core, we need to convert this new cost structure quite frankly into revenue growth. It's time to get going on this thing. We've got the cost structure that we want. We know how the price the deals now. And we expect to get some movement here. 
On Card Services, it's going to be a little bit different in '17. The focus will be laser-like on existing organic growth and making sure this huge book that we signed in 2016 has a very strong startup. So we'll probably be a little bit less on just looking for bulk out there in the marketplace, that is big portfolios to purchase. We're looking more on taking our bread and butter, which is these great names that have never had a program, starting them from scratch, nurturing them and getting them moving and grooving. And we expect that allows us to keep the types of returns that is unique in the marketplace. So that's what we're focused on. 
Also the less of a focus on pure bulk relates to the fact that some of these big files that are out there, frankly the frothiness in the market is such that it's just not attractive to us. So we're going to be very disciplined about it, been here before, we'll do it again. Nonetheless, we expect very solid growth in cards. And we did not forget talking about the final stage, the normalization in credit quality, which should take place this year. I did want to mention very quickly, I've seen a couple of commentaries out there about the '15 vintage and loosening credit and everything else. 
Let me make it very clear. We did not loosen credit at all in any of our vintages. What happened, however, as you get further and further away from coming back from the Great Recession is that the clients that you signed and the cardholders that signed up will tend to skew more towards the lower of our acceptable range. But we did not lower standards at all. But what you have is more folks coming from the lower end of that acceptable range and it's not being balanced out at the higher end. So as we moved into '16 and the '16 vintage, you'll see that we did in fact tried to balance that out a little bit better. And so we did tweak the credit quality to be a little bit higher. And that should balance out nicely. So I wanted to make sure that no one misunderstood that piece of it. 
Okay, appreciate everyone's patience. Let's go to the outlook with the fabulous chart that we have here that says Delinquency and Net Loss Rates. And Charles and I and the folks at Card Services have spent I don't know how much time trying to figure out the easiest way to communicate and to provide comfort that this is not a runaway train and that in fact, this is a normal process that needs to take place after a long period of abnormally low losses following the Great Recession. And we have been through every single possible scenario and have come up with probably the easiest way for people to view this. 
And this is how we run our business, frankly, which is you look at delinquency rates. So an account that is delinquent needs to flow through 180 days of being delinquent before it actually writes off and the write-off results in a charge to the P&L statement. And that means that you have a nice view into what the ultimate loss rate will be. Delinquency rates have been the best predictor that there is in the card business and in our business for sure with a 90% correlation over many, many, many years. 
And so you will see from the first chart here that in 2016, we saw our delinquency rate go from 4.2% to 4.7%. And you saw our corresponding move on the loss rate side. We expect 2017 to be around 5% and stabilize out there going into '18 as well. How did we come up with this stuff we just completed? We go through a portfolio-by-portfolio over 155 clients, vintage-by-vintage in each portfolio, take a look at the aging, and then we lay out what we believe the delinquency flows will be. This is what we're going to use. And we will update this every month. We will provide this in our monthly release. And this is really the best metric that we know that really captures everything. So if you start seeing these delinquency rates start spiking higher, then chances are you're going see losses as well. 
All right. Let's go to our final page, I believe, or second to final page, which is the 2017 [ph] outlook, what we're calling closing the wedge. This is a very simple concept. What you're looking at here are delinquency curves. As fascinating as they are, let's spend a couple of seconds on it. And what you'll see here is it's by month. What you'll also see is how the curves look very similar in how they go up and down, which means there is a great deal of seasonality to delinquencies. And so for example, when we released our recent monthly data and it showed a 5% or something on delinquencies, and I've got a couple of folks say, ""Oh, my gosh, your delinquencies are going up,"" that's seasonality. October, which we haven't released yet, you're going to be in the low 5s, and then November, December, you're going to start dipping below into the 4s. That's just the way the cycle works. So again, this is the best way to look at things. 
And if you look at the orange line, if you can see it, that's 2016. It shows how it is above the red line by about 50 basis points, which was 2015 and fairly consistently so. And that's, right, the good predictor of your loss rate. As we go into '17, this is the critical point, '17 is the dotted blue line. You will see that we will enter '17, we believe, around that 50 or 60 basis point spread versus last year. And then the whole bet comes down to does this gap start to narrow? Does the wedge close? If, in fact, the wedge closes over the next couple of quarters and starts to narrow, then you just know by definition that the eventual losses that are spit out based on those delinquencies will normalize as well. So what this essentially says is the normalization process is nearing its end. We get into Q1. We get through Q2. Q2, it should start to narrow. And by the end of Q3, you're basically on top of where we were this year, which means the losses that come out after that are going to be flat to this year. 
And what does that all mean? It means earnings accelerates from the low double digits to the 20% plus that you're used to. So get used to the wedge, that's what we're going to be talking about. And it also takes a lot of the noise out of the system. And the idea of talking about delinquency flows up and down and master trust and gross losses and net losses and total losses and everything else, frankly the noise level, it's hard to really get the message out there. And so this is how we run our business. If the wedge doesn't close, then you know we have another year that we've got to fight through this thing in 2018. And we do not believe that's the case, but we're trying to be as transparent as possible. 
All right, finishing up. On summary, over the past 15 years, this company has had revenue growth of 16% a year for 15 years. Core EPS has been up 26% each year for 15 years. As we look at '16 and '17, because of the normalization in loss rates, which essentially means, look, the Great Recession washed a bunch of stuff out, you had sort of pristine credit only coming out of the recession and that's beginning to normalize now as people have repaired their credit and we have a more normal consumer mix in our portfolio. It's nothing to get worked up about. It just means things are returning to a level that we had anticipated. But the normalization process has knocked 10 points off of our earnings growth and brought it from the 20s into the 12% we're looking at for '16. Nonetheless, despite this normalization effort, you have a model that's sufficiently diversified and businesses cycling at different times, where we can absorb this hit and still grow double digit as we have this year, top and bottom in double digit in the '17, and then back to the 20% after the wedge closes.  
At the end of the day, I'll finish up finally and say that I think the narrative for this company frankly has been lost this year in terms of the noise that has been out in the marketplace. We expect to regain the narrative, and we will be talking more and more about the strategic positioning of this company, why we believe financially even in a normalization period, we're double-double. When the wedge closes, we go back to 20%. But there's a reason for that. And the reason for that is all of our businesses are benefiting from the secular trends that we're seeing, whereby data and unique data is being used to gain insights to then provide marketing and creative that are then turned into personalized one-to-one communications to our clients' customers. And that's through the various digital channels where we have unique IDs on individuals around the world. And that's a secular trend we expect to continue. It's certainly not going away and it's something that we're very excited about across all of our businesses. And as a result, our time, as long was the wedge is closing and we're on track for our double-double, we will be spending more time trying to explain what really makes the model unique and has been so successful for 15 years. 
So that's it. I'm going to wrap it up and turn it over to Q&A. Operator?"

I think -- I mean, that's something that we look at pretty carefully. There's no question that there are a lot of companies that are playing in this space and have entered this space, from the big Googles and Facebooks of the world that provide solutions to the SaaS players to the big agency holding companies that are scrambling to put together technology and data solutions. When we stand back and look at it, we think that it's still a very vibrant market. We have a particular focus, which is to bring our data-driven solutions together with technology and creative, and then deliver those in kind of a client-intimate way. So we are looking for the segment of the market where clients really value a services-rich sort of delivery. That's not going to be the model that the entire market will chase after, but we think that there's plenty for us. So I think for Epsilon at this point, this is a bit more of a scenario, where our win rate has slowed a bit. That perhaps is because we have been more picky and cautious with all of the focus on cost. And then if you look at our existing client base, we've seen a bit of a pullback in some of our large clients, again perhaps that's a loss of focus. That's something that we better work out. As we move through 2017, we certainly will have a much more intense focus on growth as we roll into the year. So a couple of factors out there but I don't think major drivers for this market."

It takes about 2 years for an account to get what we call mature and less risky. So that '15 will be flowing through by the middle of 2017. And that's why you'll see that wedge close quite appreciably. So I'd say right now that obviously we're looking forward to 12 months, more than 12 months.

Be happy to, Wayne. I think one of the areas that is of concern is the fact that our client base -- although the consumer, right, is doing quite well and is holding up the economy, what we're not seeing is we're not seeing that translate into a lot of good growth at our clients. What we're seeing at our clients probably overall is actually their same-store sales, Wayne, have been down 1% to 2%. And that's not new news to anyone, but soft good apparel, high-end home furnishings, jewelry, stuff like that, you're just not seeing the consumer spending there. The consumer is spending it on autos and things like that, which, of course, benefits our auto business, but -- so the same-store sales are probably minus 1%, minus 2%. And as a result, with the tender share gains, we can get probably plus 5%, plus 6% in sales growth from the core, whereas before, we used to do plus 10% when the clients were doing plus 3%. So you've sort of downshifted little bit in terms of expectations from the core. We still expect to get somewhere between 5 and 8 percentage points above same-store sales of the clients. But right now, we're seeing softness. I know the NRF came out and suggested we're going to have a pretty decent holiday. Hopefully, that is the case. But again, that sort of downshifted. Sort of mitigating that for us has been the fact that the vintage that we did sign for 2016 frankly was well north of what's going to be a $2 billion add to the file. The big growth chains, like an ULTA and the Forever 21s of the world, those are going to do quite well. The other ones are very large clients, the Williams-Sonomas of the world, the Bed Bath & Beyond of the world, they're going to be good-sized files. And so I would say that the weakness on the core client base itself is going to be mitigated by the ramp-up on the organic side from the big 2016 vintage. As we look at big portfolio purchases in '17, frankly we don't see much out there that is hugely attractive. If we do something, it will have to meet some very strict hurdle rates. We are not going to dilute the business. We want to see our yields hold up very firmly through 2017. So we may sacrifice a bit of growth on the portfolio to maintain more robust yields and a better use of capital. So look for '17 to reflect a little less robust growth from the core due to the core itself, the retailers being sort of subpar growth on their sales. But we do expect the tender share gains and very strong '16 contribution."

And then over the course of 3 years, we'll probably get it up to around 30% or so of all sales that, that retailer flowed through our card. And then the real fun stuff kicks in that the longer we have our client, the more SKU-level information we have on the customers of that client, which means the more precise the targeting is when we do all of our targeting to the clients through all the different channels, whether it's point of sale or whether it's through all the various digital channels using Conversant. And we actually have a number of clients who are over 50%. And what we're finding is a huge chunk of the incremental pickup for us, Wayne, is through the online channels. These retailers are using online very effectively. And our online sales are probably close to 40% of total card sales versus the retailers, which are maybe 20%.

But the bigger thing is that the losses -- in the Great Recession, right, you flushed out more than you normally would in a more typical recession. And as a result, what was left over, who was left standing, you had a lot of like super prime coming into the file, which is not really our bread and butter. We're much more in the sort of mid- to upper prime-type range. And what's happened over the course of the number of years the recession is in the rearview mirror, you're having more and more folks who have repaired their credit, who are back in the market, who have jobs again, who are working and they tend to flow into the file. And as a result, what you saw was it's less about losses going up, it's more about losses are beginning to conform more to sort of the type of consumer that we cater to. So that's sort of the big sort of misperception out there of we're not shooting for percent loss rate. That's not how we optimize the file. When you're talking the folks that we want and the people who visit the stores, our loss rate, we believe, is optimized at a higher level. And those are the folks that have been flowing in. Specific to your question, yes, when we saw the '15 vintage and we saw that we were kind of -- it looked like a lot of the prime folks who are at the high end of the pool, there are fewer of those and more folks who still met our credit criteria but was a little bit lower in the overall pecking order. They tended to dominate a little bit more and we needed to tighten up a little bit."

As they start to repair their credit 4 or 5 years thereafter, they start applying for credit, they're hitting the bottom end of your underwriting criteria. So you have a mix shift that you can adjust if it gets beyond a certain spectrum, and that's what we did. '15 moved a little bit quicker than what we thought it would, so we tightened up a little bit in '16 to keep it tracking to the numbers we want."

And whether it's Amazon or the whole online Amazon effect, what it has essentially done is 2 things. First, it has made shoppers much more educated when it comes to where they can get the best price, so whereas before, you had folks had a little bit hit or miss. Now everyone has got their phone. Everyone is comparing prices. And as a result, that's what putting a lot of pressure on our clients, which is really on the pricing side. And so that's why the margins have been so tough at our clients. Obviously, the whole online space makes a lot more convenient for people to work. I do think the retailers in our space are coming back strongly with their online offerings. And we'll make a nice dent on that side of it. But Andrew, I really -- from what we're seeing, it's the pricing side of it, your Amazon has educated the consumer to such a degree that the consumer -- no one pays full price anymore. And as a result, your sales are suffering as much from pricing declines as from just unit declines. And so that's what the retailers are struggling with is what is the new model. What we're trying to do is obviously this flows very nicely into how we run our business, which is you can't just have a $200 million marketing budget and go out and splash it around to everyone. You need to be much more precise, much more effective with how you market to folks down to the one-on-one level. So this impact has been driving quite a bit of thinking on the part of retailers to change what has been for decades their way of going about marketing and moving towards the unique data-driven, personalized approach we do."

And I mean, we strongly believe that, that demand for full service kind of strategic support is still rich in the marketplace. There are certainly alternatives with software as a solution kind of offerings that would allow a client to maybe do something in-house. Over the long haul, our bet is that the kind of skills required to really make that work and to drive results are difficult to create within a client's organization. So I think from a market perspective, having watched us for 20 years, I don't see that, that's going to change radically. So that's kind of the focus point for our business. In terms of whether there's something structural that goes well beyond that, we'll watch that quarter-to-quarter. But we really believe strongly, and this is coming from the voice of the clients that we serve and the Global 1000 CMO that we're targeting, that, that needed there in the marketplace and that those are skills that they don't have in-house. The focus issue for us and really the reason for putting this foundation in place is the change we did see is a scenario where the kinds of skills that you need to service those relationships aren't always matched up with the client's willingness to continue to pay more for those as cost of living goes up, et cetera.

I mean, part of what we've done historically is position ourselves as kind of a trusted adviser that has the ability to really help a client navigate those decisions, and then actually drive outcomes from their investments. That's a different position than a lot of the other providers, including some of our partners who are a little more focused on a software sale with less accountability and responsibility to really drive results. And part of what we need to do better, I think, is kind of double-down on that bet in terms of educating our clients, and then focusing carefully on the players that really value the sort of services that we bring to the table and not frankly chasing everything. The other side of it from our perspective is when you look at the assets that Conversant brings to the table from a digital execution perspective, from the ability to really have pristine cross-device capabilities, and then incredible ability to reach consumers, when you put that together with our big technology platforms, including Harmony and our database and loyalty platforms, you start to really see, I think, some significant differentiation in terms of what we do versus the rest of the marketplace.

It was a terrific third quarter with double-digit growth in all profitability measures. LoyaltyOne and Card Services came in better than expected for the third quarter while Epsilon lagged a bit on the top line growth expectations but executed",656,"Thanks, Ed. It was a terrific third quarter with double-digit growth in all profitability measures. LoyaltyOne and Card Services came in better than expected for the third quarter while Epsilon lagged a bit on the top line growth expectations but executed the important turn in adjusted EBITDA, which was flat for the third quarter after being down in the first and second quarters. 
As a result of Q3's strong performance, we are raising annual guidance for the second time this year, increasing revenue from $7.15 billion to $7.2 billion and core EPS from $16.85 to $16.90. We did not pass through the full $0.32 beat to third quarter core EPS guidance because a large portion is timing related, whereby some earnings were pulled forward out of Q4 to Q3. 
In particular, for AIR MILES, we expect redemption activity to moderate in Q4 after a run in Q3. Basically, collectors were getting ahead of the upcoming expiry date. And for Card Services, our principal loss rates came in 20 basis points better than guidance in Q3. We expect to give that back in Q4, which will prompt some reserve build. Lastly, I expect tax rates to tick up a bit in Q4. 
Turning to the repurchase program, we've acquired approximately 3.3 million shares under our repurchase program year-to-date and have approximately $300 million of our board authorization left in 2016. You will notice from the slide that we are making a big change in our shareholder return philosophy with our Board of Directors declaring a quarterly dividend yielding 1% with a record date of November 3. Going forward, we expect to use the balance of share repurchases and dividends to return capital to investors. Ed will talk about this some later in the presentation. 
Let's flip over to Page 4 and talk about LoyaltyOne. As previously mentioned, LoyaltyOne exceeded expectations for the third quarter as revenue and adjusted EBITDA increased 28% and 14%, respectively. BrandLoyalty came in as planned with revenue up 5%. AIR MILES revenue greatly exceeded expectations, increasing 43% from the third quarter 2015 due to elevated redemption activity. As you can see from the slide, foreign exchange rates had a nominal impact to the quarter. 
AIR MILES issued increased 6% in the third quarter, rebounding from a 3% decline in the second quarter and is on track for about 3% growth for the full year. AIR MILES redeemed increased 74% compared to the third quarter of 2015 as we saw a spike in activity in front of the 12/31 expiration date. Although expiry was introduced almost 5 years ago, this was the first quarter of elevated redemption activity related to it. We expect that some of the activity is just a pull-forward from Q4 to Q3 and that activity will abate somewhat in Q4, a matter of timing. 
Now the answer -- the question everyone will now be asking me is what does this mean for the accounting assumptions around the AIR MILES program? The answer is it's too early to know. We need to see if the elevated activity continues through Q4 and we need to evaluate which collectors are redeeming as the breakage estimate assumes certain collectors will redeem and certain collectors will not redeem. Only this second group really impacts breakage estimates. 
Fast-forward to the end of the year. If we determine that a breakage adjustment is needed, keep in mind that the accounting assumptions for the program are not evaluated in isolation; rather several other factors in accounting assumptions, such as cost of mile, loss of mile, residual, et cetera, will also need to be reevaluated. These potentially mitigate the impact of lowering breakage rates. 
Moving to BrandLoyalty. We recently signed supermarket chain Lowes Foods, whereby we will manage a promotional campaign in 75 Lowes Foods stores in North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. Overall, we are making solid progress in the U.S. 
Let's move to Epsilon and Bryan Kennedy."

Epsilon's revenue increased to $543 million for the third quarter, up 2% compared to the third quarter of 2015. Importantly, adjusted EBITDA came in at $135 million, which is flat compared to prior year after 2 straight quarter",995,"All right. Thanks, Charles. Epsilon's revenue increased to $543 million for the third quarter, up 2% compared to the third quarter of 2015. Importantly, adjusted EBITDA came in at $135 million, which is flat compared to prior year after 2 straight quarters of decline. 
So to give you an update on our business, let me first discuss the EBITDA results. Our most critical focus at Epsilon for the last several quarters has been to alter the long-term trajectory of the cost structure required to support our business. And a big part of that has been the ramp-up of the investment in our India operations to fuel a global staffing model. I'm pleased that adjusted EBITDA, after a Q1 decline of 22%, followed by a Q2 decline of 9%, has leveled off flat in Q3, even while still carrying substantial duplicative costs. While it's taken perhaps a quarter or 2 longer than we originally anticipated, I think on the cost front we can safely say that our strategy is working, and we expect to see that trend continue to play out positively in Q4. 
So let's turn briefly to the revenue picture and a breakdown of the offerings within the Epsilon segment. I'll start with agency media & services, roughly 25% of the total business. These offerings produced $138 million of revenue for the quarter, a decline of 5% versus prior year. At the beginning of the year, this business line was one of our concern areas, and our objective was quite simply to lower the drag that it was placing on overall growth rates. We've made steady progress with each sequential quarter, from a decline of 23% in Q1 to a decline of 15% in Q2. And in this quarter, as you can see, we've now narrowed that drag to a mid-single-digit decline. 
Two key drivers fueled this. First, after a slow first half, Epsilon's agency offering has generated a number of new wins beginning to fuel back half growth, such as the agency record win we announced this quarter with Del Monte Foods. Second, we've been working to pivot Conversant's agency media offering away from a commoditized offering with a dependence on large holding company agencies. We've got a sound plan in place, and we're progressing each quarter. 
Specifically, we're shifting towards an emphasis on more direct client relationships, on midsized agencies and on a data-driven digital media offering fueled by our unique assets and scale. A central part of this plan involves the consolidation of all of our digital media onto what we call our core platform, which is the engine that fuels Conversant's data-rich, high-growth CRM business. And over the next 2 quarters, we will have substantially migrated the agency business to this core platform. What that does for us is important. It increases the quality and granularity of the audiences we can offer to our clients and it enhances our ability to deliver the metrics that clients are looking for. So we're on a good track to continue the transition of this business. 
All right. Let's turn to the digital & technology platforms business, the other 75% of our revenue. We grew to $405 million of revenue for the quarter, up 5% over the third quarter of 2015. Performance here was lower than expected, driven by 2 key offerings that I'll outline, one on the negative side and one on the positive side. 
First, the negative. Our Epsilon technology platform business, consisting specifically of loyalty and data-based solutions, was soft for the quarter, dampening otherwise healthy growth for this category. This technology platform area in particular has been the focal point of the cost initiatives I described earlier as we've worked to correct this historic issue of being able to produce nice top line growth without demonstrating equal or better profitability growth. Consequentially, at the same time as we've been pulling back to focus internally on reining in costs, we've seen some external market conditions spike up that include price pressure and increased competitive forces. And in turn, we've missed some top line growth opportunities. Although it was critical to get to the cost side of this equation first, now that we're beginning to see it play out, we should be in a better position to return our focus on growth as we move through 2017.  
On the positive side, the second driver for the quarter here was Conversant's CRM business, which continues to perform very well. This offering was up over 50% compared to prior year and really led the growth for this overall category again. We continue to see strong demand with both new client wins and ongoing cross-sell into Epsilon's client portfolio. And as of this quarter, we've closed 36 year-to-date wins and a book of business that already exceeds our 2015 book by over 25% in potential value. 
In summary, if you look in aggregate at the year we've put together so far for Epsilon/Conversant, it hasn't been quite what we'd hoped for, but we have gotten some critical things done and are moving in the right direction. We addressed the cost structure within Epsilon, where the demand by clients for hot skills wasn't matching up with a market willing to let us pass on those costs. And while we might have lost some momentum on the growth front due to that, this was the right priority for our business. And we focused on the ongoing transformation at Conversant while driving successfully the growth of our CRM business. 
We're happy with the progress there. And really that's Phase 1 that we're now wrapping up. Phase 2 will be our focus as we enter and move through 2017, completing the agency pivot at Conversant, expanding our CRM offering, putting our shoulder back into raising the growth profile of our database and loyalty business. We're well-poised for that with our deep, unique assets and an excellent global team to service our clients. 
All right. Back over to you, Charles."

Let's flip over to Page 6 and talk about Card Services. Card Services had a better-than-expected quarter with a revenue of 26% and adjusted EBITDA net of 14% compared to the third quarter of 2015.Now what really drove the overperformance?",381,"Thanks, Bryan. Let's flip over to Page 6 and talk about Card Services. Card Services had a better-than-expected quarter with a revenue of 26% and adjusted EBITDA net of 14% compared to the third quarter of 2015.
Now what really drove the overperformance? And there's really several things I'd point to. First, gross yields came in at 26.8%, 60 basis points better than original guidance and within 10 basis points of last year. Essentially, the cardholder-friendly changes we made mid-2015 have burned in and the related compression has dissipated. 
Second, we continue to drive operating expense leveraging with operating expenses as a percentage of average card receivables dropping 30 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2015. Third, principal loss rates were 20 basis points better than guidance of 4.7%, and trends in delinquency rates are moving consistent with our principal loss rate forecast for 2016. Looking forward, we believe the beat to Q3 loss rate guidance is due to timing from seasonality and that we'll give it back in Q4. 
Conversely, we did see credit sales slow during the quarter. While we increased tender share with our brands by approximately 150 basis points during the third quarter, softness at several of our core brands dropped credit sales growth in our core to 3%, down from 7% growth in the first half of 2016. We expect that softness to continue into the fourth quarter. 
Counterbalancing, we have had a terrific year with new signings: The Childrenâ€™s Place, ULTA Beauty and Williams-Sonoma, to name a few. Two of these brands have launched and we are seeing early and very encouraging results as we welcome new card members to the programs. We have seen healthy applications in the first few weeks, thanks to our new frictionless mobile credit acquisition capability, which reduces the times to apply by 25% and reduces abandonment rates more than 5x. 
Turning back to our solid loss performance. We have a good view into the rest of the year and expect that we will track in line with full year expectations. We also expect that, as vintages mature, we will see delinquencies normalize around the middle of 2017 with losses normalizing thereafter. Ed will talk about this a bit later. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Ed."

If everyone could be on Slide 8 that says Third Quarter and Full Year Outlook. It has a bunch of colored dots on it to make it easy to follow. And this is the commentary I'll give on third quarter, full year, then we'll go into a couple",2657,"Great. All right. If everyone could be on Slide 8 that says Third Quarter and Full Year Outlook. It has a bunch of colored dots on it to make it easy to follow. And this is the commentary I'll give on third quarter, full year, then we'll go into a couple of other items, and then '17.  
And from a consolidated level, third quarter revenue of $1.9 billion, up 19%, and earnings per share of $4.74, up 20%. Obviously, this was the largest quarter we have ever had in our history. And needless to say, very, very pleased at how strong a quarter it was, especially in this environment of low growth for the economy. Obviously, compared to guidance, we exceeded guidance by a lot. And I did want to break out our thinking in terms of how much to pass through or not pass through. We decided to sort of break it up into 3 pieces. 
Clearly, some of it was timing, right? Our loss rate in Q3 was lower than expected, but we expect the loss rate in Q4 to be -- to get that back. And as a result, if you want to call $0.15 or the $0.30 sort of that timing issue between quarters for loss rates, that's just how it goes. So we don't expect to recapture that additional $0.15. 
The second is yes, we're flowing through some of the overperformance into higher guidance. We've raised guidance twice this year. And that's what hopefully we'll continue to do, as is our practice. 
And then finally, the third is little bit of, hey, we need a little bit more flexibility in Q4, specifically as it relates to our AIR MILES business in Canada. 
As Charles talked about, we are now approaching the first time in the program's history where we're looking at actually expiring miles from, I think it was 1992 through 2011. So you've got 20 years about to expire now. Everyone has been informed of this 5 years ago and has been informed since then. However, we did not know exactly what the behavior was going to be as we're approaching the final end date here. And as a result, what we found is there is volumes that have picked up fairly dramatically in terms of people wanting to look at redeeming their miles. 
And as a result, what we found is that it did drive a big spike in redemption activity, which does drive a little bit of profit through to the bottom line as redemptions go up higher than anticipated. And that's what you saw in Q3. However, what we want to do is we want to make sure that the consumer is having a good experience, and it has been challenging. We are putting, therefore, many millions of dollars into customer care. We have hired a ton of folks to work the phones on the redemption side up in Canada. We've got management taking phone calls on the floor. And as a result, we want to make sure that the millions that we're putting into this customer experience effort gives -- that's where we want to have the flexibility in terms of some of the excess from the Q3 overperformance. 
And so will we need it all? Don't know, but it's better to be prudent, it's better that you have a good experience out there. Because frankly we're getting flooded with folks trying to get this stuff in, and our job is to make sure that we don't damage the brand. So bear with us through the rest of the year. We think we're in very good shape, but we do want to have a little bit of flexibility here to make sure we can bulk up those resources as needed. 
So we're raising annual guidance to 11% growth in top line or $7.2 billion and core EPS of $16.90 or 12%. Again, I am reminded of the beginning of the year when we started out, and there were lots and lots of concern about the ability to continue to be a growth company in the face of normalizing credit conditions, followed by, frankly, a very soft Q1 of only about 5% growth. We knew the engine was going to pick up eventually. It did so starting in Q2. There were then concerns about whether that can continue forward. Hopefully, this has finally put that thing to bed. And what you have is you're beginning to see what this model can do. And what this model can do is double-digit top line, double-digit earnings growth while also absorbing almost 10 percentage points of growth rate from normalizing in losses. Said differently, if we're guiding to 12% in a normal -- in the environment that wouldn't have been normalizing, we would have done over 20%. So that's what the model can do. We're very happy with it. 
And finally, on the share repurchase side, I think we've done around $700 million so far. And corporate leverage ratio remains quite manageable at less than 3x. Again, Charles hates when I use -- when I round up or round down. But in general, you've got about $5 billion of debt. You've got a little under a couple of billion of EBITDA. And again, the EBITDA is measured for our covenants and indentures across the entire enterprise. So you're talking well under 3x, and that we feel is a very manageable level. So we're good there. And then for the first time since we started the company we are, in fact, establishing a quarterly dividend at 1%. And that is to provide a sort of a more balanced return to shareholders. So you're going to see both dividends and you're going to see share repurchases. 
We are a growth company. And that's something that, frankly, I have debated for years and years and years. The tide certainly has swung in favor of let's do a combo platter of both dividend and share repurchase. That's what we're doing. And being a growth company, one of the nice things is you have a dividend that's going to grow quite nicely in the coming years as we continue to grow at a rapid clip. So it's sort of a nice thing to have out there. And it's also not significant enough to our cash flow that it hampers our flexibility when it comes to either buybacks or M&A or additional growth in our card business. 
Speaking of which, let's go to our card business. Another heck of a quarter. Portfolio growth over 20% for both the quarter and the full year. And that's great news for me. What I am more pleased with, frankly, is the fact that our tender share -- which again is defined as the amount of sales at a retailer that flow through our card versus other forms of payments. Basically it means that more and more of the dollars that are being spent at retailers are flowing through our card. And that either means that we're bringing on more and more folks, perhaps they're folks with -- of lesser credit quality. That's always been a question out there. And as we look at it, we continue to see that's not the case, and in fact that 85% of the additional tender share or growth that's coming on our cards are coming from accounts that have been with us for 3 years or more. 
So it means that the personalized data-driven marketing stuff, so to speak, works. We've had tender share gains of between 150 basis points and 180 basis points. What does that mean? It basically means if the retailer is doing a couple of points of sales growth, well, we're going to do somewhere between 5 to 8 points higher than that. That's how important this tender share growth is, and that's why it's so important, especially coming from those nice mature accounts.  
Gross yields Charles talked about. Again, that was a huge concern of folks at the beginning of the year, when year-over-year we saw yields down over 200 basis points. We felt comfortable that, that was going to clean itself up as the year progressed. And sure enough, by Q2 it was only down 80 and Q3 we're almost back to flat. So that's one big concern that we can check the box on. 
Finally, delinquency rates and principal loss rates are tracking around the 50 basis points for the full year. We talked about Q3 loss rate was below sort of our guidance of almost a year ago and Q4 loss rate will make up the difference. But overall, you're going to slosh around and come in right around where we want it to be for the year. 
The other huge thing that sort of got lost this year was the fact that this was, by far, the best year in our history in terms of signing high-quality clients. And it was, by far, our biggest vintage we've ever signed, vintage meaning that most of these folks are starting from scratch, we ramp them up over the process of 3 years, and when fully ramped up they should be adding north of $2 billion of portfolio growth. And if you look at the clients -- Boscov's and Hot Topic, Forever 21, Childrenâ€™s Place, Bed Bath & Beyond, Williams-Sonoma, Century 21 and ULTA -- you're talking about by far the best vintage in terms of size and quality that we've ever had, which suggests the market is still quite robust. 
All right. Let's go on to the next page, talk a little bit about Epsilon/Conversant. As Bryan talked about, I would say if there was something that was a bit of a disappointment so far this year, it would have to be our top line at Epsilon. Frankly, we were hoping that we could pull off the cost restructuring in the whole India initiative while at the same time not losing any momentum on the revenue side. I think our appetite was a bit too large on that one. So the revenue growth is still choppy. It was down 2% in Q1. It was up 5% in Q2. It was up 2% in Q3. That's not our model. That's not what we're shooting for. We want to get into a very solid mid-single-digit growth run rate on top line and actually have a very consistent flow-through with some leverage to the bottom line. And in order to do that, as Bryan talked about, we needed to completely revamp our cost structure, essentially trying to mitigate the cost of the high skills with perhaps potentially some better leverage on the labor side. And that was the whole India initiative, where we have our office today and are very happy with how that thing is ramping up. 
So from, I guess, a longer-term perspective, from my perspective, from Bryan's perspective, we believe we have the cost structure fixed. And you can see that it's beginning to actually show results with your EBITDA year-over-year going from a minus 22% decline to minus 9% to flat. And I expect this thing up 5% in Q4, and then we exit the year and hopefully put this thing behind us. We'll have the cost structure in shape so that we can now go after the top line knowing what our costs are. So it's been a long process and somewhat painful at times, but nonetheless, we're done with it. 
We turn now to LoyaltyOne, which comprises our European-based BrandLoyalty business. What can you say there? They're continuing to track double-digit growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA for the year. The thing seems to be a machine. The Canadian rollout has been very successful. And we're looking at $45 million or so in revs just from that, and that's only a year or so old. And then we had a big announcement of our first client in the United States. And that rollout is beginning to take off. And with that, hopefully we'll have many more announcements moving on from there. Obviously, with the U.S. being 10x the size of Canada, the opportunity there is quite large. 
Looking at AIR MILES, which is our Canadian loyalty business. We are seeing double-digit growth in revenue, some of that driven by the extra redemption activity that's flowing through. But we are seeing mid-single-digit growth in EBITDA as well. So the program itself is vibrant, it's robust, it's still growing. It is far from sunsetting, that's for sure. And probably the only cautionary that we have there is we are working very hard to make sure that the brand does not get scarred with some of the drama around the expiration of 20 years' worth of miles. It's happening. It's going to happen. It's one and done for us. Financially, we don't think there's much risk there. However, we are being very cautious in terms of making sure we put as many resources as we can against this thing from people, et cetera, et cetera, to make sure that the consumer experience is as good as possible, even though it is a little bit crazy right now. So that's where we are. 
And let's now talk about the 2017 outlook, again at a very high level. As we usually do this time of year, we give a base case. And the base case is plus 10%, plus 10%. We expect also nicely growing cash flow, free cash flow to go along with that, which you'll tend to get with our type of business model. So that's the base. It doesn't assume any meaningful share repurchases, any meaningful M&A. And it also factors in what we believe is the final drag from the Card Services loss rate normalization. So again, you're talking we expect to grow double-double despite absorbing another 10 points of potential earnings growth that's going towards this normalization process. 
And right now, from what we're seeing, it looks pretty good out there. The consumer looks good. And we expect another solid year of double-digit growth. So we started 2016 with a lot of folks skeptical that we could, in fact, hit double-double. And in fact, we're doing quite a bit above that despite absorbing this drag. We expect a similar rollout in 2017. And hopefully, people now feel comfortable that this is the type of model that can absorb this type of normalization. 
On LoyaltyOne, what are the big things we're trying to do? With BrandLoyalty, continue what they're doing. It's pretty straightforward, especially in North America. Let's keep going. There's a lot of wood to chop out there, so that's what we're going to be doing. In AIR MILES, we expect to have a solid 2017. That being said, I do believe that we're going to get dinged a little bit on our brand in terms of this whole expiry process. Even though it will be over by the end of the year and will be on a very simple quarterly basis and you won't have the type of noise or drama, the fact is we're going to have to think hard about are we going to have to do something to make sure that our customers still feel loved and respected and that they're getting value out of the program. So we're going to watch very closely what the behavior is, what the reaction is. And we're going to try to mitigate anything that comes out that's somewhat negative.  
On Epsilon, Bryan talked about what we've done this year. It's critical next year that Conversant continue exceptional growth in its CRM business. This is the data-driven business where we ingest SKU-level information from various clients. We then match up that type of behavior to unique IDs associated with folks out there and reach out to them with very targeted messaging. That business has been growing rapidly, what, 30%, 40%, 50%, something like that?"

You're growing somewhere between $80 million and $100 million a year of revenue. And we expect that to be a big engine going forward. 
What's sort of lost in that is the whole agency piece of Conversant, which again is when -- it's the old ValueClick business, where we used to provide inventory to the big holding companies on Madison Ave. That, of course, has gone the way of the rotary dial phone. And what we're now doing is we have made the decision that this is absolutely a business that can be pivoted towards CRM light, or for those clients who don't need the full, heavy-duty CRM. If it's just a list activation type program where we're reaching out very quickly for a sale that's coming up in 2 days, this is a perfect way of doing it. So we think we've got a solution there that could also help feed eventually into the big CRM business. 
On the core, Epsilon core, we need to convert this new cost structure, quite frankly, into revenue growth. It's time to get going on this thing. We've got the cost structure that we want. We know how to price the deals now, and we expect to get some movement here. 
On Card Services, it's going to be a little bit different in '17. The focus will be laser-like on existing organic growth and making sure this huge book that we signed in 2016 has a very strong startup. So we'll probably be a little bit less on just looking for bulk out there in the marketplace, that is, big portfolios to purchase. We're looking more on taking our bread and butter, which is these great names that have never had a program, starting them from scratch, nurturing them and getting them moving and grooving. And we expect that allows us to keep the types of returns that is unique in the marketplace. So that's what we're focused on. 
Also the less of a focus on pure bulk relates to the fact that some of these big files that are out there, frankly the frothiness in the market is such that it's just not attractive to us. So we're going to be very disciplined about it. Been here before; we'll do it again. Nonetheless, we expect very solid growth in cards. And we did not forget, talking about the final stage of normalization in credit quality, which should take place this year. 
I did want to mention very quickly, I've seen a couple of commentaries out there about the '15 vintage and loosening credit and everything else. Let me make it very clear. We did not loosen credit at all in any of our vintages. What happens, however, as you get further and further away from coming back from the Great Recession is that the clients that you signed and the cardholders that sign up will tend to skew more towards the lower end of our acceptable range. But we did not lower standards at all. But what you have is more folks coming from the lower end of that acceptable range and it's not being balanced out at the higher end. So as we moved into '16 and the '16 vintage, you'll see that we did in fact try to balance that out a little bit better. And so we did tweak the credit quality to be a little bit higher. And that should balance out nicely. So I wanted to make sure that no one misunderstood that piece of it. 
Okay. I appreciate everyone's patience. Let's go to the outlook with the fabulous chart that we have here that says Delinquency and Net Loss Rates. And Charles and I and the folks at Card Services have spent I don't know how much time trying to figure out the easiest way to communicate and to provide comfort that this is not a runaway train and that in fact this is a normal process that needs to take place after a long period of abnormally low losses following the Great Recession. And we have been through every single possible scenario and have come up with probably the easiest way for people to view this. 
And this is how we run our business, frankly, which is you look at delinquency rates. So an account that is delinquent needs to flow through 180 days of being delinquent before it actually writes off and the write-off results in a charge to the P&L statement. And that means that you have a nice view into what the ultimate loss rate will be. Delinquency rates have been the best predictor that there is in the card business, and in our business for sure, with a 90% correlation over many, many, many years. 
And so you will see from the first chart here that in 2016 we saw our delinquency rates go from 4.2% to 4.7%. And you saw our corresponding move on the loss rate side. We expect 2017 to be around a 5% and stabilize out there going into '18 as well. How did we come up with this stuff we just completed? We go through a portfolio by portfolio, over 155 clients, vintage by vintage in each portfolio, take a look at the aging, and then we lay out what we believe the delinquency flows will be. This is what we're going to use. We will update this every month. We will provide this in our monthly release. And this is really the best metric that we know that really captures everything. So if you start seeing these delinquency rates start spiking higher, then chances are you're going see losses as well. 
All right. Let's go to our final page, I believe, or second to final page, which is the 2017 outlook, what we're calling closing the wedge. This is a very simple concept. What you're looking at here are delinquency curves. As fascinating as they are, let's spend a couple of seconds on it. And what you'll see here is it's by month. What you'll also see is how the curves look very similar in how they go up and down, which means there is a great deal of seasonality to delinquencies. And so for example, when we released our recent monthly data and it showed a 5% or something on delinquencies, and I got a couple of folks saying, ""Oh, my gosh, your delinquencies are going up,"" that's seasonality. October, which we haven't released yet, you're going to be in the low 5s, and then November, December you're going to start dipping below into the 4s. That's just the way the cycle works. So again, this is the best way to look at things. 
And if you look at the orange line, if you can see it, that's 2016. It shows how it is above the red line by about 50 basis points, which was 2015, and fairly consistently so. And that's, right, the good predictor of your loss rate. As we go into '17, this is the critical point, '17 is the dotted blue line. You will see that we will enter '17, we believe, around that 50 or 60 basis point spread versus last year. And then the whole bet comes down to does this gap start to narrow? Does the wedge close? If, in fact, the wedge closes over the next couple of quarters and starts to narrow, then you just know by definition that the eventual losses that are spit out based on those delinquencies will normalize as well. So what this essentially says is the normalization process is nearing its end. We get into Q1. We get through Q2. Q2, it should start to narrow. And by the end of Q3, you're basically on top of where we were this year, which means the losses that come out after that are going to be flat to this year. 
And what does that all mean? It means earnings accelerates from the low double digits to the 20% plus that you're used to. So get used to the wedge. That's what we're going to be talking about. And it also takes a lot of the noise out of the system. And the idea of talking about delinquency flows up and down and master trust and gross losses and net losses and total losses and everything else, frankly, the noise level, it's hard to really get the message out there. And so this is how we run our business. If the wedge doesn't close, then you know we have another year that we've got to fight through this thing in 2018. We do not believe that's the case, but we're trying to be as transparent as possible. 
All right, finishing up. On summary, over the past 15 years, this company has had revenue growth of 16% a year for 15 years. Core EPS has been up 26% each year for 15 years. As we look at '16 and '17, because of the normalization in loss rates, which essentially means, look, the Great Recession washed a bunch of stuff out, you had sort of pristine credit only coming out of the recession and that's beginning to normalize now as people have repaired their credit and we have a more normal consumer mix in our portfolio. It's nothing to get worked up about. It just means things are returning to a level that we had anticipated. But the normalization process has knocked 10 points off of our earnings growth and brought it from the 20s into the 12% we're looking at for '16. Nonetheless, despite this normalization effort, you have a model that's sufficiently diversified and businesses cycling at different times, where we can absorb this hit and still grow double digit as we have this year, top and bottom in double digit in '17, and then back to the 20% after the wedge closes.  
At the end of the day, I'll finish up finally and say that I think the narrative for this company, frankly, has been lost this year in terms of the noise that has been out in the marketplace. We expect to regain the narrative, and we will be talking more and more about the strategic positioning of this company, why we believe financially, even in a normalization period, we're double-double. When the wedge closes, we go back to 20%. But there's a reason for that. And the reason for that is all of our businesses are benefiting from the secular trends that we're seeing, whereby data and unique data is being used to gain insights to then provide marketing and creative that are then turned into personalized one-to-one communications to our clients' customers. And that's through the various digital channels where we have unique IDs on individuals around the world. And that's a secular trend we expect to continue. It's certainly not going away and it's something that we're very excited about across all of our businesses. And as a result, our time, as long as the wedge is closing and we're on track for our double-double, we will be spending more time trying to explain what really makes the model unique and has been so successful for 15 years. 
So that's it. I'm going to wrap it up and turn it over to Q&A. Operator?"

I think -- I mean, that's something that we look at pretty carefully. There's no question that there are a lot of companies that are playing in this space and have entered this space, from the big Googles and Facebooks of the world that provide solutions to the SaaS players to the big agency holding companies that are scrambling to put together technology and data solutions. 
When we stand back and look at it, we think that it's still a very vibrant market. We have a particular focus, which is to bring our data-driven solutions together with technology and creative and then deliver those in kind of a client-intimate way. So we are looking for the segment of the market where clients really value a services-rich sort of delivery. That's not going to be the model that the entire market will chase after, but we think that there's plenty for us. 
So I think for Epsilon at this point, this is a bit more of a scenario where our win rate has slowed a bit. That perhaps is because we've been more picky and cautious with all of the focus on costs. And then if you look at our existing client base, we've seen a bit of a pullback in some of our large clients. Again, perhaps that's a loss of focus. That's something that we've got to work out as we move through 2017. We certainly will have a much more intense focus on growth as we roll into the year. So a couple of factors out there but I don't think major drivers for this market."

It's a portfolio we do expect, as you look at the gap on Page 12, it will be most pronounced in the first 2 quarters, then narrowing in the third and fourth quarter. Going back to what Ed talked about, if you look in the trust, which is not a great illustration, but it's a little bit of a sample, you could see the '15 vintage went quickly to loss. The '16 vintage is going much slower. It takes about 2 years for an account to get what we call mature and less risky. So that '15 will be flowing through by the middle of 2017. And that's why you'll see that wedge close quite appreciably. 
So I'd say right now that obviously we're looking forward 12 months, more than 12 months. We turn the portfolio every 6 months. So we can get pretty good visibility to it and we can make changes to the portfolio as necessary to track to the numbers we're looking for."

Be happy to, Wayne. I think one of the areas that is of concern is the fact that our client base -- although the consumer, right, is doing quite well and is holding up the economy, what we're not seeing is we're not seeing that translate into a lot of good growth at our clients. What we're seeing at our clients probably overall is actually their same-store sales, Wayne, have been down 1% to 2%. And that's not new news to anyone, but soft goods apparel, high-end home furnishings, jewelry, stuff like that, you're just not seeing the consumer spending there. The consumer is spending it on autos and things like that, which, of course, benefits our auto business but -- so the same-store sales are probably minus 1%, minus 2%. And as a result, with the tender share gains, we can get probably plus 5%, plus 6% in sales growth from the core, whereas before we used to do plus 10% when the clients were doing plus 3%. 
So you've sort of downshifted a little bit in terms of expectations from the core. We still expect to get somewhere between 5 and 8 percentage points above same-store sales of the clients. But right now we're seeing softness. I know the NRF came out and suggested we're going to have a pretty decent holiday. Hopefully that is the case. But again, that's sort of downshifted. 
Sort of mitigating that for us has been the fact that the vintage that we did sign for 2016 frankly was well north of what's going to be a $2 billion add to the file. The big growth chains, like an ULTA and the Forever 21s of the world, those are going to do quite well. The other ones are very large clients, the Williams-Sonomas of the world, the Bed Bath & Beyond of the world. They're going to be good-sized files. And so I would say that the weakness on the core client base itself is going to be mitigated by the ramp-up on the organic side from the big 2016 vintage. 
As we look at big portfolio purchases in '17, frankly, we don't see much out there that is hugely attractive. If we do something, it will have to meet some very strict hurdle rates. We are not going to dilute the business. We want to see our yields hold up very firmly through 2017. So we may sacrifice a bit of growth on the portfolio to maintain more robust yields and a better use of capital. So look for '17 to reflect a little less robust growth from the core due to the core itself, the retailers being sort of subpar growth on their sales. But we do expect the tender share gains and very strong '16 contribution."

The first answer to where it is when we start the program, I can even do that without rounding. It's at 0. And then over the course of 3 years we'll probably get it up to around 30% or so of all sales that, that retailer flowed through our card. And then the real fun stuff kicks in, that the longer we have our client, the more SKU-level information we have on the customers of that client, which means the more precise the targeting is when we do all of our targeting to the clients through all the different channels, whether it's point of sale or whether it's through all the various digital channels using Conversant. And we actually have a number of clients who are over 50%. And what we're finding is a huge chunk of the incremental pickup for us, Wayne, is through the online channels. These retailers are using online very effectively. And our online sales are probably close to 40% of total card sales versus the retailers, which are maybe 20%.

But the bigger thing is that the losses -- in the Great Recession, right, you flushed out more than you normally would in a more typical recession. And as a result, what was left over, who was left standing meant that you had a lot of like super prime coming into the file, which is not really our bread and butter. We're much more in the sort of mid- to upper prime type range. And what's happened over the course of the number of years the recession is in the rearview mirror, you're having more and more folks who have repaired their credit, who are back in the market, who have jobs again, who are working, and they tend to flow into the file. And as a result, what you saw was it's less about losses going up; it's more about losses are beginning to conform more to sort of the type of consumer that we cater to. So that's sort of the big sort of misperception out there of we're not shooting for 4% loss rates. That's not how we optimize a file. When you're talking the folks that we want and the people who visit the stores, our loss rate, we believe, is optimized at a higher level. And those are the folks that have been flowing in. 
Specific to your question, yes, when we saw the '15 vintage and we saw that we were kind of -- it looked like a lot of the prime folks who are at the high end of the pool, there are fewer of those and more folks who still met our credit criteria but was a little bit lower in the overall pecking order. They tended to dominate a little bit more and we needed to tighten up a little bit."

As they start to repair their credit 4 or 5 years thereafter, they start applying for credit, they're hitting the bottom end of your underwriting criteria. So you have a mix shift that you then adjust if it gets beyond a certain spectrum, and that's what we did. '15 moved a little bit quicker than what we thought it would, so we tightened up a little bit in '16 to keep it tracking to the numbers we want."

First, it has made shoppers much more educated when it comes to where they can get the best price. So whereas before you had folks a little bit hit or miss. Now everyone has got their phone, everyone is comparing prices. And as a result, that's what putting a lot of pressure on our clients, which is really on the pricing side. And so that's why the margins have been so tough at our clients. Obviously, the whole online space makes it a lot more convenient for people to work. I do think the retailers in our space are coming back strongly with their online offerings and will make a nice dent on that side of it. 
But Andrew, I really -- from what we're seeing, it's the pricing side of it. It is -- your Amazon has educated the consumer to such a degree that the consumer -- no one pays full price anymore. And as a result, your sales are suffering as much from pricing declines as from just unit declines. And so that's what the retailers are struggling with, is what is the new model. What we're trying to do is obviously this flows very nicely into how we run our business, which is you can't just have a $200 million marketing budget and go out and splash it around to everyone. You need to be much more precise, much more effective with how you market to folks down to the one-on-one level. So this impact has been driving quite a bit of thinking on the part of retailers to change what has been for decades their way of going about marketing and moving towards the unique data-driven, personalized approach we do."

I mean, I think from the perspective of existing client relationships, obviously you've got to do an excellent job of serving clients, walking the halls, bringing solutions to them that really meet the needs that they have. And I mean, we strongly believe that, that demand for full service kind of strategic support is still rich in the marketplace. There are certainly alternatives with software as a solution kind of offerings that would allow a client to maybe do something in-house. Over the long haul, our bet is that the kind of skills required to really make that work and to drive results are difficult to create within a client's organization. So I think from a market perspective, having watched us for 20 years, I don't see that that's going to change radically. So that's kind of the focus point for our business. 
In terms of whether there's something structural that goes well beyond that we'll watch that quarter-to-quarter. But we really believe strongly, and this is coming from the voice of the clients that we serve and the Global 1000 CMO that we're targeting, that, that need is there in the marketplace and that those are skills that they don't have in-house. 
The focus issue for us and really the reason for putting this foundation in place is the change we did see is a scenario where the kinds of skills that you need to service those relationships aren't always matched up with a client's willingness to continue to pay more for those as cost of living goes up, et cetera.

I mean, part of what we've done historically is position ourselves as kind of a trusted adviser that has the ability to really help a client navigate those decisions and then actually drive outcomes from their investments. That's a different position than a lot of the other providers, including some of our partners who are a little more focused on a software sale with less accountability and responsibility to really drive results. 
So part of what we need to do better, I think, is kind of double down on that bet in terms of educating our clients and then focusing carefully on the players that really value the sort of services that we bring to the table and not, frankly, chasing everything. 
The other side of it, from our perspective, is when you look at the assets that Conversant brings to the table from a digital execution perspective, from the ability to really have pristine cross-device capabilities, and then incredible ability to reach consumers, when you put that together with our big technology platforms, including Harmony and our database and loyalty platforms, you start to really see, I think, some significant differentiation in terms of what we do versus the rest of the marketplace. We have, frankly, not put our shoulder significantly into that effort. It's part of what we're working on right now. In fact, we have several key pilots with clients that begin to put those capabilities together in a more integrated way. And I think that's going to be a key effort for us as we move through '17 that will start to drive part of what you're asking about."

It was a terrific third quarter with double-digit growth in all profitability measures.

It was a terrific third quarter with double-digit growth in all profitability measures. LoyaltyOne and Card Services came in better than expected for the third quarter while Epsilon lagged a bit on the top line growth expectations but executed the important turn in adjusted EBITDA, which was flat for the third quarter after being down in the first and second quarters. 
As a result of Q3's strong performance, we are raising annual guidance for the second time this year, increasing revenue from $7.15 billion to $7.2 billion and core EPS from $16.85 to $16.90. We did not pass through the full $0.32 beat to third quarter core EPS guidance because a large portion is timing related, whereby some earnings were pulled forward out of Q4 to Q3. 
In particular, for AIR MILES, we expect redemption activity to moderate in Q4 after a run in Q3. Basically, collectors were getting ahead of the upcoming expiry date. And for Card Services, our principal loss rates came in 20 basis points better than guidance in Q3. We expect to give that back in Q4, which will prompt some reserve build. Lastly, I expect tax rates to tick up a bit in Q4. 
Turning to the repurchase program, we've acquired approximately 3.3 million shares under our repurchase program year-to-date and have approximately $300 million of our board authorization left in 2016. You will notice from the slide that we are making a big change in our shareholder return philosophy with our Board of Directors declaring a quarterly dividend yielding 1% with a record date of November 3. Going forward, we expect to use the balance of share repurchases and dividends to return capital to investors. Ed will talk about this some later in the presentation. 
Let's flip over to Page 4 and talk about LoyaltyOne. As previously mentioned, LoyaltyOne exceeded expectations for the third quarter as revenue and adjusted EBITDA increased 28% and 14%, respectively. BrandLoyalty came in as planned with revenue up 5%. AIR MILES revenue greatly exceeded expectations, increasing 43% from the third quarter 2015 due to elevated redemption activity. As you can see from the slide, foreign exchange rates had a nominal impact to the quarter. 
AIR MILES issued increased 6% in the third quarter, rebounding from a 3% decline in the second quarter and is on track for about 3% growth for the full year. AIR MILES redeemed increased 74% compared to the third quarter of 2015 as we saw a spike in activity in front of the 12/31 expiration date. Although expiry was introduced almost 5 years ago, this was the first quarter of elevated redemption activity related to it. We expect that some of the activity is just a pull-forward from Q4 to Q3 and that activity will abate somewhat in Q4, a matter of timing. 
Now the answer -- the question everyone will now be asking me is what does this mean for the accounting assumptions around the AIR MILES program? The answer is it's too early to know. We need to see if the elevated activity continues through Q4 and we need to evaluate which collectors are redeeming as the breakage estimate assumes certain collectors will redeem and certain collectors will not redeem. Only this second group really impacts breakage estimates. 
Fast-forward to the end of the year. If we determine that a breakage adjustment is needed, keep in mind that the accounting assumptions for the program are not evaluated in isolation; rather several other factors in accounting assumptions, such as cost of mile, loss of mile, residual, et cetera, will also need to be reevaluated. These potentially mitigate the impact of lowering breakage rates. 
Moving to BrandLoyalty. We recently signed supermarket chain Lowes Foods, whereby we will manage a promotional campaign in 75 Lowes Foods stores in North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. Overall, we are making solid progress in the U.S. 
Let's move to Epsilon and Bryan Kennedy."

Epsilon's revenue increased to $543 million for the third quarter, up 2% compared to the third quarter of 2015. Importantly, adjusted EBITDA came in at $135 million, which is flat compared to prior year after 2 straight quarter",995,"All right. Thanks, Charles. Epsilon's revenue increased to $543 million for the third quarter, up 2% compared to the third quarter of 2015. Importantly, adjusted EBITDA came in at $135 million, which is flat compared to prior year after 2 straight quarters of decline. 
So to give you an update on our business, let me first discuss the EBITDA results. Our most critical focus at Epsilon for the last several quarters has been to alter the long-term trajectory of the cost structure required to support our business. And a big part of that has been the ramp-up of the investment in our India operations to fuel a global staffing model. I'm pleased that adjusted EBITDA, after a Q1 decline of 22%, followed by a Q2 decline of 9%, has leveled off flat in Q3, even while still carrying substantial duplicative costs. While it's taken perhaps a quarter or 2 longer than we originally anticipated, I think on the cost front we can safely say that our strategy is working, and we expect to see that trend continue to play out positively in Q4. 
So let's turn briefly to the revenue picture and a breakdown of the offerings within the Epsilon segment. I'll start with agency media & services, roughly 25% of the total business. These offerings produced $138 million of revenue for the quarter, a decline of 5% versus prior year. At the beginning of the year, this business line was one of our concern areas, and our objective was quite simply to lower the drag that it was placing on overall growth rates. We've made steady progress with each sequential quarter, from a decline of 23% in Q1 to a decline of 15% in Q2. And in this quarter, as you can see, we've now narrowed that drag to a mid-single-digit decline. 
Two key drivers fueled this. First, after a slow first half, Epsilon's agency offering has generated a number of new wins beginning to fuel back half growth, such as the agency record win we announced this quarter with Del Monte Foods. Second, we've been working to pivot Conversant's agency media offering away from a commoditized offering with a dependence on large holding company agencies. We've got a sound plan in place, and we're progressing each quarter. 
Specifically, we're shifting towards an emphasis on more direct client relationships, on midsized agencies and on a data-driven digital media offering fueled by our unique assets and scale. A central part of this plan involves the consolidation of all of our digital media onto what we call our core platform, which is the engine that fuels Conversant's data-rich, high-growth CRM business. And over the next 2 quarters, we will have substantially migrated the agency business to this core platform. What that does for us is important. It increases the quality and granularity of the audiences we can offer to our clients and it enhances our ability to deliver the metrics that clients are looking for. So we're on a good track to continue the transition of this business. 
All right. Let's turn to the digital & technology platforms business, the other 75% of our revenue. We grew to $405 million of revenue for the quarter, up 5% over the third quarter of 2015. Performance here was lower than expected, driven by 2 key offerings that I'll outline, one on the negative side and one on the positive side. 
First, the negative. Our Epsilon technology platform business, consisting specifically of loyalty and data-based solutions, was soft for the quarter, dampening otherwise healthy growth for this category. This technology platform area in particular has been the focal point of the cost initiatives I described earlier as we've worked to correct this historic issue of being able to produce nice top line growth without demonstrating equal or better profitability growth. Consequentially, at the same time as we've been pulling back to focus internally on reining in costs, we've seen some external market conditions spike up that include price pressure and increased competitive forces. And in turn, we've missed some top line growth opportunities. Although it was critical to get to the cost side of this equation first, now that we're beginning to see it play out, we should be in a better position to return our focus on growth as we move through 2017.  
On the positive side, the second driver for the quarter here was Conversant's CRM business, which continues to perform very well. This offering was up over 50% compared to prior year and really led the growth for this overall category again. We continue to see strong demand with both new client wins and ongoing cross-sell into Epsilon's client portfolio. And as of this quarter, we've closed 36 year-to-date wins and a book of business that already exceeds our 2015 book by over 25% in potential value. 
In summary, if you look in aggregate at the year we've put together so far for Epsilon/Conversant, it hasn't been quite what we'd hoped for, but we have gotten some critical things done and are moving in the right direction. We addressed the cost structure within Epsilon, where the demand by clients for hot skills wasn't matching up with a market willing to let us pass on those costs. And while we might have lost some momentum on the growth front due to that, this was the right priority for our business. And we focused on the ongoing transformation at Conversant while driving successfully the growth of our CRM business. 
We're happy with the progress there. And really that's Phase 1 that we're now wrapping up. Phase 2 will be our focus as we enter and move through 2017, completing the agency pivot at Conversant, expanding our CRM offering, putting our shoulder back into raising the growth profile of our database and loyalty business. We're well-poised for that with our deep, unique assets and an excellent global team to service our clients. 
All right. Back over to you, Charles."

Let's flip over to Page 6 and talk about Card Services. Card Services had a better-than-expected quarter with a revenue of 26% and adjusted EBITDA net of 14% compared to the third quarter of 2015.Now what really drove the overperformance?",381,"Thanks, Bryan. Let's flip over to Page 6 and talk about Card Services. Card Services had a better-than-expected quarter with a revenue of 26% and adjusted EBITDA net of 14% compared to the third quarter of 2015.
Now what really drove the overperformance? And there's really several things I'd point to. First, gross yields came in at 26.8%, 60 basis points better than original guidance and within 10 basis points of last year. Essentially, the cardholder-friendly changes we made mid-2015 have burned in and the related compression has dissipated. 
Second, we continue to drive operating expense leveraging with operating expenses as a percentage of average card receivables dropping 30 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2015. Third, principal loss rates were 20 basis points better than guidance of 4.7%, and trends in delinquency rates are moving consistent with our principal loss rate forecast for 2016. Looking forward, we believe the beat to Q3 loss rate guidance is due to timing from seasonality and that we'll give it back in Q4. 
Conversely, we did see credit sales slow during the quarter. While we increased tender share with our brands by approximately 150 basis points during the third quarter, softness at several of our core brands dropped credit sales growth in our core to 3%, down from 7% growth in the first half of 2016. We expect that softness to continue into the fourth quarter. 
Counterbalancing, we have had a terrific year with new signings: The Childrenâ€™s Place, ULTA Beauty and Williams-Sonoma, to name a few. Two of these brands have launched and we are seeing early and very encouraging results as we welcome new card members to the programs. We have seen healthy applications in the first few weeks, thanks to our new frictionless mobile credit acquisition capability, which reduces the times to apply by 25% and reduces abandonment rates more than 5x. 
Turning back to our solid loss performance. We have a good view into the rest of the year and expect that we will track in line with full year expectations. We also expect that, as vintages mature, we will see delinquencies normalize around the middle of 2017 with losses normalizing thereafter. Ed will talk about this a bit later. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Ed."

And this is the commentary I'll give on third quarter, full year, then we'll go into a couple",2657,"Great. All right. If everyone could be on Slide 8 that says Third Quarter and Full Year Outlook. It has a bunch of colored dots on it to make it easy to follow. And this is the commentary I'll give on third quarter, full year, then we'll go into a couple of other items, and then '17.  
And from a consolidated level, third quarter revenue of $1.9 billion, up 19%, and earnings per share of $4.74, up 20%. Obviously, this was the largest quarter we have ever had in our history. And needless to say, very, very pleased at how strong a quarter it was, especially in this environment of low growth for the economy. Obviously, compared to guidance, we exceeded guidance by a lot. And I did want to break out our thinking in terms of how much to pass through or not pass through. We decided to sort of break it up into 3 pieces. 
Clearly, some of it was timing, right? Our loss rate in Q3 was lower than expected, but we expect the loss rate in Q4 to be -- to get that back. And as a result, if you want to call $0.15 or the $0.30 sort of that timing issue between quarters for loss rates, that's just how it goes. So we don't expect to recapture that additional $0.15. 
The second is yes, we're flowing through some of the overperformance into higher guidance. We've raised guidance twice this year. And that's what hopefully we'll continue to do, as is our practice. 
And then finally, the third is little bit of, hey, we need a little bit more flexibility in Q4, specifically as it relates to our AIR MILES business in Canada. 
As Charles talked about, we are now approaching the first time in the program's history where we're looking at actually expiring miles from, I think it was 1992 through 2011. So you've got 20 years about to expire now. Everyone has been informed of this 5 years ago and has been informed since then. However, we did not know exactly what the behavior was going to be as we're approaching the final end date here. And as a result, what we found is there is volumes that have picked up fairly dramatically in terms of people wanting to look at redeeming their miles. 
And as a result, what we found is that it did drive a big spike in redemption activity, which does drive a little bit of profit through to the bottom line as redemptions go up higher than anticipated. And that's what you saw in Q3. However, what we want to do is we want to make sure that the consumer is having a good experience, and it has been challenging. We are putting, therefore, many millions of dollars into customer care. We have hired a ton of folks to work the phones on the redemption side up in Canada. We've got management taking phone calls on the floor. And as a result, we want to make sure that the millions that we're putting into this customer experience effort gives -- that's where we want to have the flexibility in terms of some of the excess from the Q3 overperformance. 
And so will we need it all? Don't know, but it's better to be prudent, it's better that you have a good experience out there. Because frankly we're getting flooded with folks trying to get this stuff in, and our job is to make sure that we don't damage the brand. So bear with us through the rest of the year. We think we're in very good shape, but we do want to have a little bit of flexibility here to make sure we can bulk up those resources as needed. 
So we're raising annual guidance to 11% growth in top line or $7.2 billion and core EPS of $16.90 or 12%. Again, I am reminded of the beginning of the year when we started out, and there were lots and lots of concern about the ability to continue to be a growth company in the face of normalizing credit conditions, followed by, frankly, a very soft Q1 of only about 5% growth. We knew the engine was going to pick up eventually. It did so starting in Q2. There were then concerns about whether that can continue forward. Hopefully, this has finally put that thing to bed. And what you have is you're beginning to see what this model can do. And what this model can do is double-digit top line, double-digit earnings growth while also absorbing almost 10 percentage points of growth rate from normalizing in losses. Said differently, if we're guiding to 12% in a normal -- in the environment that wouldn't have been normalizing, we would have done over 20%. So that's what the model can do. We're very happy with it. 
And finally, on the share repurchase side, I think we've done around $700 million so far. And corporate leverage ratio remains quite manageable at less than 3x. Again, Charles hates when I use -- when I round up or round down. But in general, you've got about $5 billion of debt. You've got a little under a couple of billion of EBITDA. And again, the EBITDA is measured for our covenants and indentures across the entire enterprise. So you're talking well under 3x, and that we feel is a very manageable level. So we're good there. And then for the first time since we started the company we are, in fact, establishing a quarterly dividend at 1%. And that is to provide a sort of a more balanced return to shareholders. So you're going to see both dividends and you're going to see share repurchases. 
We are a growth company. And that's something that, frankly, I have debated for years and years and years. The tide certainly has swung in favor of let's do a combo platter of both dividend and share repurchase. That's what we're doing. And being a growth company, one of the nice things is you have a dividend that's going to grow quite nicely in the coming years as we continue to grow at a rapid clip. So it's sort of a nice thing to have out there. And it's also not significant enough to our cash flow that it hampers our flexibility when it comes to either buybacks or M&A or additional growth in our card business. 
Speaking of which, let's go to our card business. Another heck of a quarter. Portfolio growth over 20% for both the quarter and the full year. And that's great news for me. What I am more pleased with, frankly, is the fact that our tender share -- which again is defined as the amount of sales at a retailer that flow through our card versus other forms of payments. Basically it means that more and more of the dollars that are being spent at retailers are flowing through our card. And that either means that we're bringing on more and more folks, perhaps they're folks with -- of lesser credit quality. That's always been a question out there. And as we look at it, we continue to see that's not the case, and in fact that 85% of the additional tender share or growth that's coming on our cards are coming from accounts that have been with us for 3 years or more. 
So it means that the personalized data-driven marketing stuff, so to speak, works. We've had tender share gains of between 150 basis points and 180 basis points. What does that mean? It basically means if the retailer is doing a couple of points of sales growth, well, we're going to do somewhere between 5 to 8 points higher than that. That's how important this tender share growth is, and that's why it's so important, especially coming from those nice mature accounts.  
Gross yields Charles talked about. Again, that was a huge concern of folks at the beginning of the year, when year-over-year we saw yields down over 200 basis points. We felt comfortable that, that was going to clean itself up as the year progressed. And sure enough, by Q2 it was only down 80 and Q3 we're almost back to flat. So that's one big concern that we can check the box on. 
Finally, delinquency rates and principal loss rates are tracking around the 50 basis points for the full year. We talked about Q3 loss rate was below sort of our guidance of almost a year ago and Q4 loss rate will make up the difference. But overall, you're going to slosh around and come in right around where we want it to be for the year. 
The other huge thing that sort of got lost this year was the fact that this was, by far, the best year in our history in terms of signing high-quality clients. And it was, by far, our biggest vintage we've ever signed, vintage meaning that most of these folks are starting from scratch, we ramp them up over the process of 3 years, and when fully ramped up they should be adding north of $2 billion of portfolio growth. And if you look at the clients -- Boscov's and Hot Topic, Forever 21, Childrenâ€™s Place, Bed Bath & Beyond, Williams-Sonoma, Century 21 and ULTA -- you're talking about by far the best vintage in terms of size and quality that we've ever had, which suggests the market is still quite robust. 
All right. Let's go on to the next page, talk a little bit about Epsilon/Conversant. As Bryan talked about, I would say if there was something that was a bit of a disappointment so far this year, it would have to be our top line at Epsilon. Frankly, we were hoping that we could pull off the cost restructuring in the whole India initiative while at the same time not losing any momentum on the revenue side. I think our appetite was a bit too large on that one. So the revenue growth is still choppy. It was down 2% in Q1. It was up 5% in Q2. It was up 2% in Q3. That's not our model. That's not what we're shooting for. We want to get into a very solid mid-single-digit growth run rate on top line and actually have a very consistent flow-through with some leverage to the bottom line. And in order to do that, as Bryan talked about, we needed to completely revamp our cost structure, essentially trying to mitigate the cost of the high skills with perhaps potentially some better leverage on the labor side. And that was the whole India initiative, where we have our office today and are very happy with how that thing is ramping up. 
So from, I guess, a longer-term perspective, from my perspective, from Bryan's perspective, we believe we have the cost structure fixed. And you can see that it's beginning to actually show results with your EBITDA year-over-year going from a minus 22% decline to minus 9% to flat. And I expect this thing up 5% in Q4, and then we exit the year and hopefully put this thing behind us. We'll have the cost structure in shape so that we can now go after the top line knowing what our costs are. So it's been a long process and somewhat painful at times, but nonetheless, we're done with it. 
We turn now to LoyaltyOne, which comprises our European-based BrandLoyalty business. What can you say there? They're continuing to track double-digit growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA for the year. The thing seems to be a machine. The Canadian rollout has been very successful. And we're looking at $45 million or so in revs just from that, and that's only a year or so old. And then we had a big announcement of our first client in the United States. And that rollout is beginning to take off. And with that, hopefully we'll have many more announcements moving on from there. Obviously, with the U.S. being 10x the size of Canada, the opportunity there is quite large. 
Looking at AIR MILES, which is our Canadian loyalty business. We are seeing double-digit growth in revenue, some of that driven by the extra redemption activity that's flowing through. But we are seeing mid-single-digit growth in EBITDA as well. So the program itself is vibrant, it's robust, it's still growing. It is far from sunsetting, that's for sure. And probably the only cautionary that we have there is we are working very hard to make sure that the brand does not get scarred with some of the drama around the expiration of 20 years' worth of miles. It's happening. It's going to happen. It's one and done for us. Financially, we don't think there's much risk there. However, we are being very cautious in terms of making sure we put as many resources as we can against this thing from people, et cetera, et cetera, to make sure that the consumer experience is as good as possible, even though it is a little bit crazy right now. So that's where we are. 
And let's now talk about the 2017 outlook, again at a very high level. As we usually do this time of year, we give a base case. And the base case is plus 10%, plus 10%. We expect also nicely growing cash flow, free cash flow to go along with that, which you'll tend to get with our type of business model. So that's the base. It doesn't assume any meaningful share repurchases, any meaningful M&A. And it also factors in what we believe is the final drag from the Card Services loss rate normalization. So again, you're talking we expect to grow double-double despite absorbing another 10 points of potential earnings growth that's going towards this normalization process. 
And right now, from what we're seeing, it looks pretty good out there. The consumer looks good. And we expect another solid year of double-digit growth. So we started 2016 with a lot of folks skeptical that we could, in fact, hit double-double. And in fact, we're doing quite a bit above that despite absorbing this drag. We expect a similar rollout in 2017. And hopefully, people now feel comfortable that this is the type of model that can absorb this type of normalization. 
On LoyaltyOne, what are the big things we're trying to do? With BrandLoyalty, continue what they're doing. It's pretty straightforward, especially in North America. Let's keep going. There's a lot of wood to chop out there, so that's what we're going to be doing. In AIR MILES, we expect to have a solid 2017. That being said, I do believe that we're going to get dinged a little bit on our brand in terms of this whole expiry process. Even though it will be over by the end of the year and will be on a very simple quarterly basis and you won't have the type of noise or drama, the fact is we're going to have to think hard about are we going to have to do something to make sure that our customers still feel loved and respected and that they're getting value out of the program. So we're going to watch very closely what the behavior is, what the reaction is. And we're going to try to mitigate anything that comes out that's somewhat negative.  
On Epsilon, Bryan talked about what we've done this year. It's critical next year that Conversant continue exceptional growth in its CRM business. This is the data-driven business where we ingest SKU-level information from various clients. We then match up that type of behavior to unique IDs associated with folks out there and reach out to them with very targeted messaging. That business has been growing rapidly, what, 30%, 40%, 50%, something like that?"

You're growing somewhere between $80 million and $100 million a year of revenue. And we expect that to be a big engine going forward. 
What's sort of lost in that is the whole agency piece of Conversant, which again is when -- it's the old ValueClick business, where we used to provide inventory to the big holding companies on Madison Ave. That, of course, has gone the way of the rotary dial phone. And what we're now doing is we have made the decision that this is absolutely a business that can be pivoted towards CRM light, or for those clients who don't need the full, heavy-duty CRM. If it's just a list activation type program where we're reaching out very quickly for a sale that's coming up in 2 days, this is a perfect way of doing it. So we think we've got a solution there that could also help feed eventually into the big CRM business. 
On the core, Epsilon core, we need to convert this new cost structure, quite frankly, into revenue growth. It's time to get going on this thing. We've got the cost structure that we want. We know how to price the deals now, and we expect to get some movement here. 
On Card Services, it's going to be a little bit different in '17. The focus will be laser-like on existing organic growth and making sure this huge book that we signed in 2016 has a very strong startup. So we'll probably be a little bit less on just looking for bulk out there in the marketplace, that is, big portfolios to purchase. We're looking more on taking our bread and butter, which is these great names that have never had a program, starting them from scratch, nurturing them and getting them moving and grooving. And we expect that allows us to keep the types of returns that is unique in the marketplace. So that's what we're focused on. 
Also the less of a focus on pure bulk relates to the fact that some of these big files that are out there, frankly the frothiness in the market is such that it's just not attractive to us. So we're going to be very disciplined about it. Been here before; we'll do it again. Nonetheless, we expect very solid growth in cards. And we did not forget, talking about the final stage of normalization in credit quality, which should take place this year. 
I did want to mention very quickly, I've seen a couple of commentaries out there about the '15 vintage and loosening credit and everything else. Let me make it very clear. We did not loosen credit at all in any of our vintages. What happens, however, as you get further and further away from coming back from the Great Recession is that the clients that you signed and the cardholders that sign up will tend to skew more towards the lower end of our acceptable range. But we did not lower standards at all. But what you have is more folks coming from the lower end of that acceptable range and it's not being balanced out at the higher end. So as we moved into '16 and the '16 vintage, you'll see that we did in fact try to balance that out a little bit better. And so we did tweak the credit quality to be a little bit higher. And that should balance out nicely. So I wanted to make sure that no one misunderstood that piece of it. 
Okay. I appreciate everyone's patience. Let's go to the outlook with the fabulous chart that we have here that says Delinquency and Net Loss Rates. And Charles and I and the folks at Card Services have spent I don't know how much time trying to figure out the easiest way to communicate and to provide comfort that this is not a runaway train and that in fact this is a normal process that needs to take place after a long period of abnormally low losses following the Great Recession. And we have been through every single possible scenario and have come up with probably the easiest way for people to view this. 
And this is how we run our business, frankly, which is you look at delinquency rates. So an account that is delinquent needs to flow through 180 days of being delinquent before it actually writes off and the write-off results in a charge to the P&L statement. And that means that you have a nice view into what the ultimate loss rate will be. Delinquency rates have been the best predictor that there is in the card business, and in our business for sure, with a 90% correlation over many, many, many years. 
And so you will see from the first chart here that in 2016 we saw our delinquency rates go from 4.2% to 4.7%. And you saw our corresponding move on the loss rate side. We expect 2017 to be around a 5% and stabilize out there going into '18 as well. How did we come up with this stuff we just completed? We go through a portfolio by portfolio, over 155 clients, vintage by vintage in each portfolio, take a look at the aging, and then we lay out what we believe the delinquency flows will be. This is what we're going to use. We will update this every month. We will provide this in our monthly release. And this is really the best metric that we know that really captures everything. So if you start seeing these delinquency rates start spiking higher, then chances are you're going see losses as well. 
All right. Let's go to our final page, I believe, or second to final page, which is the 2017 outlook, what we're calling closing the wedge. This is a very simple concept. What you're looking at here are delinquency curves. As fascinating as they are, let's spend a couple of seconds on it. And what you'll see here is it's by month. What you'll also see is how the curves look very similar in how they go up and down, which means there is a great deal of seasonality to delinquencies. And so for example, when we released our recent monthly data and it showed a 5% or something on delinquencies, and I got a couple of folks saying, ""Oh, my gosh, your delinquencies are going up,"" that's seasonality. October, which we haven't released yet, you're going to be in the low 5s, and then November, December you're going to start dipping below into the 4s. That's just the way the cycle works. So again, this is the best way to look at things. 
And if you look at the orange line, if you can see it, that's 2016. It shows how it is above the red line by about 50 basis points, which was 2015, and fairly consistently so. And that's, right, the good predictor of your loss rate. As we go into '17, this is the critical point, '17 is the dotted blue line. You will see that we will enter '17, we believe, around that 50 or 60 basis point spread versus last year. And then the whole bet comes down to does this gap start to narrow? Does the wedge close? If, in fact, the wedge closes over the next couple of quarters and starts to narrow, then you just know by definition that the eventual losses that are spit out based on those delinquencies will normalize as well. So what this essentially says is the normalization process is nearing its end. We get into Q1. We get through Q2. Q2, it should start to narrow. And by the end of Q3, you're basically on top of where we were this year, which means the losses that come out after that are going to be flat to this year. 
And what does that all mean? It means earnings accelerates from the low double digits to the 20% plus that you're used to. So get used to the wedge. That's what we're going to be talking about. And it also takes a lot of the noise out of the system. And the idea of talking about delinquency flows up and down and master trust and gross losses and net losses and total losses and everything else, frankly, the noise level, it's hard to really get the message out there. And so this is how we run our business. If the wedge doesn't close, then you know we have another year that we've got to fight through this thing in 2018. We do not believe that's the case, but we're trying to be as transparent as possible. 
All right, finishing up. On summary, over the past 15 years, this company has had revenue growth of 16% a year for 15 years. Core EPS has been up 26% each year for 15 years. As we look at '16 and '17, because of the normalization in loss rates, which essentially means, look, the Great Recession washed a bunch of stuff out, you had sort of pristine credit only coming out of the recession and that's beginning to normalize now as people have repaired their credit and we have a more normal consumer mix in our portfolio. It's nothing to get worked up about. It just means things are returning to a level that we had anticipated. But the normalization process has knocked 10 points off of our earnings growth and brought it from the 20s into the 12% we're looking at for '16. Nonetheless, despite this normalization effort, you have a model that's sufficiently diversified and businesses cycling at different times, where we can absorb this hit and still grow double digit as we have this year, top and bottom in double digit in '17, and then back to the 20% after the wedge closes.  
At the end of the day, I'll finish up finally and say that I think the narrative for this company, frankly, has been lost this year in terms of the noise that has been out in the marketplace. We expect to regain the narrative, and we will be talking more and more about the strategic positioning of this company, why we believe financially, even in a normalization period, we're double-double. When the wedge closes, we go back to 20%. But there's a reason for that. And the reason for that is all of our businesses are benefiting from the secular trends that we're seeing, whereby data and unique data is being used to gain insights to then provide marketing and creative that are then turned into personalized one-to-one communications to our clients' customers. And that's through the various digital channels where we have unique IDs on individuals around the world. And that's a secular trend we expect to continue. It's certainly not going away and it's something that we're very excited about across all of our businesses. And as a result, our time, as long as the wedge is closing and we're on track for our double-double, we will be spending more time trying to explain what really makes the model unique and has been so successful for 15 years. 
So that's it. I'm going to wrap it up and turn it over to Q&A. Operator?"

I think -- I mean, that's something that we look at pretty carefully. There's no question that there are a lot of companies that are playing in this space and have entered this space, from the big Googles and Facebooks of the world that provide solutions to the SaaS players to the big agency holding companies that are scrambling to put together technology and data solutions. 
When we stand back and look at it, we think that it's still a very vibrant market. We have a particular focus, which is to bring our data-driven solutions together with technology and creative and then deliver those in kind of a client-intimate way. So we are looking for the segment of the market where clients really value a services-rich sort of delivery. That's not going to be the model that the entire market will chase after, but we think that there's plenty for us. 
So I think for Epsilon at this point, this is a bit more of a scenario where our win rate has slowed a bit. That perhaps is because we've been more picky and cautious with all of the focus on costs. And then if you look at our existing client base, we've seen a bit of a pullback in some of our large clients. Again, perhaps that's a loss of focus. That's something that we've got to work out as we move through 2017. We certainly will have a much more intense focus on growth as we roll into the year. So a couple of factors out there but I don't think major drivers for this market."

Going back to what Ed talked about, if you look in the trust, which is not a great illustration, but it's a little bit of a sample, you could see the '15 vintage went quickly to loss. The '16 vintage is going much slower. It takes about 2 years for an account to get what we call mature and less risky. So that '15 will be flowing through by the middle of 2017. And that's why you'll see that wedge close quite appreciably. 
So I'd say right now that obviously we're looking forward 12 months, more than 12 months. We turn the portfolio every 6 months. So we can get pretty good visibility to it and we can make changes to the portfolio as necessary to track to the numbers we're looking for."

Be happy to, Wayne. I think one of the areas that is of concern is the fact that our client base -- although the consumer, right, is doing quite well and is holding up the economy, what we're not seeing is we're not seeing that translate into a lot of good growth at our clients. What we're seeing at our clients probably overall is actually their same-store sales, Wayne, have been down 1% to 2%. And that's not new news to anyone, but soft goods apparel, high-end home furnishings, jewelry, stuff like that, you're just not seeing the consumer spending there. The consumer is spending it on autos and things like that, which, of course, benefits our auto business but -- so the same-store sales are probably minus 1%, minus 2%. And as a result, with the tender share gains, we can get probably plus 5%, plus 6% in sales growth from the core, whereas before we used to do plus 10% when the clients were doing plus 3%. 
So you've sort of downshifted a little bit in terms of expectations from the core. We still expect to get somewhere between 5 and 8 percentage points above same-store sales of the clients. But right now we're seeing softness. I know the NRF came out and suggested we're going to have a pretty decent holiday. Hopefully that is the case. But again, that's sort of downshifted. 
Sort of mitigating that for us has been the fact that the vintage that we did sign for 2016 frankly was well north of what's going to be a $2 billion add to the file. The big growth chains, like an ULTA and the Forever 21s of the world, those are going to do quite well. The other ones are very large clients, the Williams-Sonomas of the world, the Bed Bath & Beyond of the world. They're going to be good-sized files. And so I would say that the weakness on the core client base itself is going to be mitigated by the ramp-up on the organic side from the big 2016 vintage. 
As we look at big portfolio purchases in '17, frankly, we don't see much out there that is hugely attractive. If we do something, it will have to meet some very strict hurdle rates. We are not going to dilute the business. We want to see our yields hold up very firmly through 2017. So we may sacrifice a bit of growth on the portfolio to maintain more robust yields and a better use of capital. So look for '17 to reflect a little less robust growth from the core due to the core itself, the retailers being sort of subpar growth on their sales. But we do expect the tender share gains and very strong '16 contribution."

And then over the course of 3 years we'll probably get it up to around 30% or so of all sales that, that retailer flowed through our card. And then the real fun stuff kicks in, that the longer we have our client, the more SKU-level information we have on the customers of that client, which means the more precise the targeting is when we do all of our targeting to the clients through all the different channels, whether it's point of sale or whether it's through all the various digital channels using Conversant. And we actually have a number of clients who are over 50%. And what we're finding is a huge chunk of the incremental pickup for us, Wayne, is through the online channels. These retailers are using online very effectively. And our online sales are probably close to 40% of total card sales versus the retailers, which are maybe 20%.

And as a result, what was left over, who was left standing meant that you had a lot of like super prime coming into the file, which is not really our bread and butter. We're much more in the sort of mid- to upper prime type range. And what's happened over the course of the number of years the recession is in the rearview mirror, you're having more and more folks who have repaired their credit, who are back in the market, who have jobs again, who are working, and they tend to flow into the file. And as a result, what you saw was it's less about losses going up; it's more about losses are beginning to conform more to sort of the type of consumer that we cater to. So that's sort of the big sort of misperception out there of we're not shooting for 4% loss rates. That's not how we optimize a file. When you're talking the folks that we want and the people who visit the stores, our loss rate, we believe, is optimized at a higher level. And those are the folks that have been flowing in. 
Specific to your question, yes, when we saw the '15 vintage and we saw that we were kind of -- it looked like a lot of the prime folks who are at the high end of the pool, there are fewer of those and more folks who still met our credit criteria but was a little bit lower in the overall pecking order. They tended to dominate a little bit more and we needed to tighten up a little bit."

So not a lot I can add to it. It's just purely mix. A higher percentage of your applications in the early part of coming out of the recession are high-quality individuals, super prime, because you basically burned a lot of people out of the market. As they start to repair their credit 4 or 5 years thereafter, they start applying for credit, they're hitting the bottom end of your underwriting criteria. So you have a mix shift that you then adjust if it gets beyond a certain spectrum, and that's what we did. '15 moved a little bit quicker than what we thought it would, so we tightened up a little bit in '16 to keep it tracking to the numbers we want."

First, it has made shoppers much more educated when it comes to where they can get the best price. So whereas before you had folks a little bit hit or miss. Now everyone has got their phone, everyone is comparing prices. And as a result, that's what putting a lot of pressure on our clients, which is really on the pricing side. And so that's why the margins have been so tough at our clients. Obviously, the whole online space makes it a lot more convenient for people to work. I do think the retailers in our space are coming back strongly with their online offerings and will make a nice dent on that side of it. 
But Andrew, I really -- from what we're seeing, it's the pricing side of it. It is -- your Amazon has educated the consumer to such a degree that the consumer -- no one pays full price anymore. And as a result, your sales are suffering as much from pricing declines as from just unit declines. And so that's what the retailers are struggling with, is what is the new model. What we're trying to do is obviously this flows very nicely into how we run our business, which is you can't just have a $200 million marketing budget and go out and splash it around to everyone. You need to be much more precise, much more effective with how you market to folks down to the one-on-one level. So this impact has been driving quite a bit of thinking on the part of retailers to change what has been for decades their way of going about marketing and moving towards the unique data-driven, personalized approach we do."

I mean, I think from the perspective of existing client relationships, obviously you've got to do an excellent job of serving clients, walking the halls, bringing solutions to them that really meet the needs that they have. And I mean, we strongly believe that, that demand for full service kind of strategic support is still rich in the marketplace. There are certainly alternatives with software as a solution kind of offerings that would allow a client to maybe do something in-house. Over the long haul, our bet is that the kind of skills required to really make that work and to drive results are difficult to create within a client's organization. So I think from a market perspective, having watched us for 20 years, I don't see that that's going to change radically. So that's kind of the focus point for our business. 
In terms of whether there's something structural that goes well beyond that we'll watch that quarter-to-quarter. But we really believe strongly, and this is coming from the voice of the clients that we serve and the Global 1000 CMO that we're targeting, that, that need is there in the marketplace and that those are skills that they don't have in-house. 
The focus issue for us and really the reason for putting this foundation in place is the change we did see is a scenario where the kinds of skills that you need to service those relationships aren't always matched up with a client's willingness to continue to pay more for those as cost of living goes up, et cetera. So that's really the driver behind our shift on the cost structure."

Is this -- you traditionally broke up your cash flow into 3 buckets: M&A, funding the receivables, and then share returns.

I mean, no question that right now, given all of the options in the space, it's kind of a complicated decision process for our clients to navigate in terms of thinking through all of those options and then selecting the right choice. I mean, part of what we've done historically is position ourselves as kind of a trusted adviser that has the ability to really help a client navigate those decisions and then actually drive outcomes from their investments. That's a different position than a lot of the other providers, including some of our partners who are a little more focused on a software sale with less accountability and responsibility to really drive results. 
So part of what we need to do better, I think, is kind of double down on that bet in terms of educating our clients and then focusing carefully on the players that really value the sort of services that we bring to the table and not, frankly, chasing everything. 
The other side of it, from our perspective, is when you look at the assets that Conversant brings to the table from a digital execution perspective, from the ability to really have pristine cross-device capabilities, and then incredible ability to reach consumers, when you put that together with our big technology platforms, including Harmony and our database and loyalty platforms, you start to really see, I think, some significant differentiation in terms of what we do versus the rest of the marketplace. We have, frankly, not put our shoulder significantly into that effort. It's part of what we're working on right now. In fact, we have several key pilots with clients that begin to put those capabilities together in a more integrated way. And I think that's going to be a key effort for us as we move through '17 that will start to drive part of what you're asking about."
