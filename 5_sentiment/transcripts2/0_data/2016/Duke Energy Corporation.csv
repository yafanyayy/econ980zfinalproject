Today, we reported 2015 adjusted earnings of $4.54 per share, in line with the year ago. I'm pleased with a solid performance and operational execution of our core regulated businesses despite record mild December weather. These results largely offset challenges throughout the year in our international operations. As a sign of confidence of the future, our board last year doubled the growth rate of the dividend, a key component of our investor value proposition. 
During today's call, we have several objectives. First, I will highlight how we are strategically repositioning the business portfolio and investing for the long term. Then I will discuss our 2015 operational highlights, including our industry-leading safety and environmental performance. Steve will provide a financial update with our outlook for 2016 and beyond.
Turning to Slide 4, I'll begin with a broader discussion of our strategy, which provides an important context for the 5-year financial plan that Steve will cover. Our industry is undergoing transformation with new technologies, evolving customer expectations, increasingly impactful public policies and abundant low cost natural gas. These factors will have a profound impact in our business in the years ahead and are informing our strategic investments. 
We are focusing our long-term strategy on our core domestic regulated businesses and our highly contracted renewables portfolio. We will invest and increasing amount in the electric grid to strengthen reliability and resilience and enable new customer solutions. To advance reliable cost-effective power in a lower-carbon future, we will invest in natural gas generation and infrastructure as well as build on our rapid expansion and renewable technologies. We will also invest to maintain our valuable nuclear and clean coal assets. 
We entered this period of industry transformation with a strong regulated business and with demonstrated strengths in operational excellence, sustainable cost management and regulatory execution. These capabilities will continue to underpin our success in the years ahead. 
An important part of the strategic focus is our decision outlined on Slide 5 to engage advisers and pursue an orderly exit of our Latin American generation business. It is an important part of the Duke Energy portfolio over many years, providing both earnings and cash flows. However, the returns over the last 2 years are inconsistent with our commitment to investors to provide predictable, stable earnings and cash flows. We believe there will be demand for this international portfolio at a reasonable valuation. Because we are early in the process, it is premature to establish a specific time line for a potential transaction. The proceeds will be used to strengthen our balance sheet and help fund the growth in our core businesses. We expect that a sale will be dilutive. Nonetheless, the strategic exit significantly improves our risk profile and enhances our ability to generate more consistent earnings and cash flows over time.
On Slide 6, I will update on our pending acquisition of Piedmont Natural Gas. This investment is also an important element of our focus on natural gas infrastructure and customer solutions. Piedmont is a regulated natural gas and local distribution company in the Carolinas and Tennessee. It operates gas infrastructure that supports our gas-fired generation in the Carolinas and provides valuable natural gas solutions to customers.
We are obtaining a high-quality asset with an excellent management team, exceptional customer service and strong rate base growth prospects. Piedmont's highly regulated gas businesses and constructive regulatory jurisdictions fit well with our strategic direction. We expect that the transaction will be accretive in 2017 with the level of accretion growing over time through our incremental capital investments and integration of Piedmont operations. We've made good progress in obtaining the required approvals. The Federal Trade Commission has created early termination of Hart-Stock-Rodino waiting period, and Piedmont's shareholders have approved the transaction. We are awaiting approvals from the North Carolina and Tennessee Utilities Commissions. We are still targeting to close the transaction by the end of this year. And in the meantime, integration efforts are well underway, so we are ready to hit the ground running immediately after the close.
As outlined on Slide 7, you can see the series of strategic transactions that we have made since 2012 to realign our business portfolio to drive more stable earnings and cash flows. The exit of international and acquisition of Piedmont will complete the transition.  This repositioning provides an outstanding foundation for growth and investment for the remainder of this decade and beyond.
Before I turn the call over to Steve, let me highlight on Slide 8 several important operational achievements and our progress advancing our strategic investments during 2015.  I'm proud of the 28,000 Duke Energy employees who are here day in and day out for our customers. Our customers count on us to provide safe, reliable, environmentally responsible energy every day. We completed 2015 with an industry-leading safety record, significantly reducing OSHA reportable incidents and our total incident case rate. Our work is never complete on this front, but I'm pleased with the focus and alignment throughout the organization on safe event-free operations.
We also significantly reduced the number of reportable environmental events in 2015. We have taken what we learned from the River spill in early 2014 and applied it throughout our organization to strengthen operational discipline and results. We have also built world-class capabilities to accelerate the safe closure of our ash basins and are on track to continue advancing this important work in 2016.  Likewise, our Edwardsport IGCC facility in Indiana continues to improve its operational performance, delivering a third consecutive year of improved output and gasifier availability.
We also made great progress on a number of our strategic growth initiatives during the year. As we mentioned and consistent with our strategy, we are modernizing the electric grid and modernizing the generation portfolio including investing in natural gas and solar. During 2015, we completed the North Carolina Eastern Municipal Power Agency asset acquisition, which strengthens our generation portfolio in the Carolinas. We also announced plans for the Western Carolinas modernization project, which adds new natural gas and solar generation. We made updated filings for grid modernization in Indiana and continued to advance utilities-scale solar investments in the Carolinas and Florida. 
In our commercial portfolio, we continued to grow our renewables business throughout the U.S. In fact, we installed around 600 megawatts of new wind and solar assets in 2015, surpassing our original objective. Our natural gas pipeline investments will supply our customers with low-cost fuel and provide supplier diversity while delivering great returns for investors. This stable pipeline received FERC approval earlier this month, while the Atlantic Coast Pipeline made its formal FERC filing last year. 
In closing, strategic investments that provide value to customers, underpinned by excellent operations will deliver a stable and predictable growth in earnings and dividends for our shareholders for years to come.
Now let me turn the call over to Steve."
267850,322365214,935575,"Duke Energy Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2016",2016-02-18,"Earnings Calls","Duke Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lynn. Today, my comments will focus briefly on 2015, and I will spend the majority of the discussion on 2016 guidance and our long-term growth prospects in our core businesses. We have extended our long-term earnings growth objective from 3 year",2039,"Thanks, Lynn. 
Today, my comments will focus briefly on 2015, and I will spend the majority of the discussion on 2016 guidance and our long-term growth prospects in our core businesses. We have extended our long-term earnings growth objective from 3 years to 5 years through 2020 to better align with our capital forecast, our expected rate case activities and the completion of our portfolio transition.
I'll begin on Slide 9. In 2015, we delivered adjusted diluted earnings of $4.54 per share, slightly below our full year guidance range. Our fourth quarter results were impacted by very mild weather. In fact, weather in the month of December impacted our results by $0.12 as temperatures in the Carolinas averaged around 10 degrees above normal. For the full year, strength in our core businesses, our Regulated Utilities and our commercial portfolio of renewables and gas infrastructure, as well as early execution on a number of strategic initiatives helped us offset weakness in our International business. Our core businesses delivered $4.15 per share on a weather-normal basis, representing an average annual 5.5% growth rate from our base year of 2013. And our International business delivered $0.33 per share.  For more detailed information on our financial performance in 2015, please refer to the supporting materials that accompanied today's press release. 
Our 2016 adjusted earnings guidance range, which we are introducing today, is $4.50 to $4.70 per share. The midpoint of this range assumes a contribution of $4.30 per share from the core businesses, which represent 4% growth over 2015. The midpoint also assumes $0.30 from international, which is down slightly from 2015.
Let me walk you through the key drivers in our businesses from 2015 to 2016. Within the Regulated Utilities, year-over-year weather-normal growth would be primarily driven by the deployment of almost $5 billion in growth capital, retail load growth of 0.5%, the full year impact of our recent acquisition of the NCEMPA assets as well as lower O&M costs. Lower O&M reflects our confidence in continuing to drive costs out of our business. I will review this further in a moment.
Within our commercial portfolio, we plan to invest $1.5 billion in renewables in our pipeline joint ventures. Additionally, we will realize a full year of benefit from the prior year accelerated stock repurchase. 
These growth drivers are partially offset by a regulatory lag in certain jurisdictions as we will not have any significant base rate increases in 2016. The loss of earnings from the Midwest Generation business, which was sold in 2015, will also be a partial offset. 
At international, we expect 2016 earnings of $0.30 per share. In Brazil, reservoir levels have improved during the rainy season, which runs through April. As a result, we are assuming a return to normal dispatch of the hydro generation in Brazil after the rainy season, lowering our purchased power costs. This improvement in the Brazilian hydro operations is expected to be offset by the declining Brazilian exchange rates and low Brent crude oil prices, which impact National Methanol's level of profitability.
Let's shift to discuss the components of our long-term growth. With the pending exit of international, we believe the appropriate focus for a long-term growth discussion should be centered around our core businesses. Through 2020, our core businesses are well situated to grow within 4% to 6%, off of their 2016 base of $4.30 per share.
On Slide 10, we have developed the base plan that will deliver 4% to 5% growth. We have also defined incremental growth opportunities that, if achieved, will deliver toward the higher end of the range or 5% to 6% growth. Our base plan is largely driven by the deployment of between $22 billion and $25 billion of growth capital in our Regulated Utilities and between $3 billion to $5 billion in commercial renewables in our gas pipeline investments. This base plan also assumes weather-normalized retail load growth of 1.5% per year from 2016 to 2020, consistent with the past several years. As a reminder, every 50 basis point improvement in retail load growth provides about 1% earnings per share growth. In order to accommodate modest organic retail sales growth, we are targeting flat O&M cost through 2020. And as you know, our track record in O&M cost management has been very good.
To achieve the high end of our long-term growth rate or 5% to 6%, there are incremental growth opportunities that provide upside potential. They include retail load growth higher than our base plan assumption of 1.5%, supported by strengthening economic conditions in our service territories. More on that in a moment. 
The acquisition of Piedmont Natural Gas, which is expected to be accretive to earnings per share, is additive to our growth rate as we move forward. Other growth opportunities exist in our wholesale business in the form of new contracts. In addition, we also have opportunities to deploy more discretionary growth capital than what we have assumed in our base plan. These investment opportunities include additional commercial and regulated renewables, further modernization of the generation fleet and additional gas infrastructure investments.
Turning now to Slide 11, I'll discuss in more detail our regulated investments over the next 5 years. The combination of these investments supports the growth rate in our regulated earnings base of approximately 5% from 2016 to 2020.
Our capital deployment is directed to the strategic priorities that Lynn discussed: customer-focused grid investments, new gas and renewable generation investments and natural gas infrastructure as demand for gas increases.  We expect to invest nearly $8 billion expanding our regulated electric grid infrastructure including improvements in technology. These investments will enable us to improve the reliability of the grid, reduce outages and restore service faster and provide real-time information to our customers. We also plan to invest around $8 billion in new generation including natural gas and renewable assets, as we continue to build an energy system for the future and reduce emissions even further, while maintaining the service reliability our customers expect.  
Finally, we expect investments of $3 billion for environmental compliance. This amount covers steam requirements and cost to close the initial high priority coal ash basins in the Carolinas.
Our earnings growth from 2016 to 2020 is strong, but not linear due to the timing of capital deployment and subsequent rate recovery. We see earnings growth accelerating in the 2018 to '20 time frame due to several factors. First, grid and customer investments in Ohio and Indiana build over time and a recovery through rate riders later in the 5-year period. Second, our investments in new generation in Florida and the Carolinas as well as our gas pipeline infrastructures projects will begin to accelerate in 2018 through 2020. Third, we will be filing a number of rate cases in this time period across many of our utilities in order to recover our capital investments. We expect to file a rate case in Duke Energy Ohio in 2016 and Duke Energy Kentucky in 2017. We also expect cases in the Carolinas in the back half of the 5-year plan. We continue to fine-tune specific timing based on our capital spending projects such as the lead combined cycle, the Western Carolinas modernization project and coal ash basin remediation.  We have further details of our capital spend and recovery mechanisms by category of investment in our appendix materials.
Moving ahead to Slide 12, I'll discuss some trends we are monitoring related to our retail load. We are planning for modest growth of 1.5% over the next 5 years. However, there are a few developing trends that give us optimism for some upside over the coming years. The labor market continues to strengthen with unemployment in median household incomes improving. Jobs are being created in our service territories as the Carolinas and Florida were among the top 10 in job growth in 2015. We continue to forecast strong growth in the number of customers, particularly in the Carolinas and Florida. Additionally, usage per customer, which declined during 2013 and 2014, has been essentially flat for the past 3 consecutive quarters.  Certain sectors of the industrial class such as construction and automotive remain strong, while the strengthening U.S. dollar has challenged other sectors such as the steel industry. The strength of our service territories is also supported by robust economic development activities attracting new businesses and shops. In 2015, these activities led to the announcement of $3.5 billion in capital investments and over 12,000 new jobs in our 6-state service area.
As we are planning for a period of sustained modest load growth, it is important that we efficiently manage our cost structure. As outlined on Slide 13, we've been successful holding costs down in the past and are targeting to keep our nonfuel O&M costs flat through 2020. 
The Progress Energy merger and integration initiatives focused heavily on the consolidation and optimization of our corporate centers. We made significant investments integrating our IT, HR and financial systems to common platforms. We are now rolling out similar initiatives to the operational parts of the organization in order to achieve our target of flat O&M through 2020.
Slide 14 shows our high level 2016 cash flows and financing plan. As I mentioned in my opening, our strong balance sheet and credit quality are foundational to our overall financial objectives. Our focus on the core businesses creates a better risk profile with more predictable and stable earnings and cash flows. We design our financing plans and target credit metrics with those objectives in mind. 
Our 5-year plan includes $700 million of DRIP equity after 2017, designed to bolster the balance sheet, the continued funding of increasing level of growth investments we expect in the back end of the planning horizon, such as the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and new gas generation. Our financing assumptions outlined on this slide do not include acquisition of Piedmont Natural Gas or the sale of international. We plan to issue between $500 million to $750 million of equity through a forward structure, and we'll finance the remainder with debt at the holding company upon closing.  Proceeds from the sale of international will be used to strengthen our balance sheet, helping to fund growth in our core businesses.
Now I'd like to provide some perspective on the recent 5-year extension of bonus depreciation benefits. This extension will generate cumulative after-tax cash benefits of about $3 billion. However, due to our federal net operating loss tax position, we will see total improved cash flows of around $1 billion, but in the back end of our planning horizon. In the short term, our federal tax position will keep us from recognizing the manufacturing deduction through 2018, impacting our annual earnings by around $0.05 per share.
Moving to Slide 15, let's talk about our dividend. We have proudly paid a quarterly dividend for 90 consecutive years. Last year, our board approved a 4% increase to the dividend, which was double the previous annual growth rate of around 2%. We continue to target annual growth in the dividend consistent with our long term 4% to 6% earnings growth. 
Our dividend is appointed by the strong cash flows from our core businesses. Our Regulated Utilities are distributing between 65% and 70% of their earnings to the parent during the planning horizon, providing strong support to the dividend. Additionally, during the period, we continued to hold the International business. This segment will generate annual cash flows of between $200 million and $300 million to be distributed to the parent. Through 2020, our dividend payout ratio is expected to be between 70% and 75%. We are comfortable with this payout, given the quality of our lower-risk core businesses and their more stable earnings and cash flows.
I'll close with Slide 16, which summarizes our key investor considerations. Duke Energy has tremendous scale, offering an attractive investor value proposition, which includes balanced growth in earnings and dividends over time. We are confident in our ability to grow our core businesses between 4% and 6% through 2020. We will also maintain a strong balance sheet to ensure reliable access to the capital markets while we finance this growth.
With that, let me turn it back over to Lynn for some closing thoughts."

Before we take your questions, I just wanted to underscore a few points that are summarized on Slide 17. We are strategically responding to the transformation that is occurring in our industry. We're simplified our business portfolio to focus on our growing core regulated businesses and our highly contracted renewables portfolio. We're enhancing customer value by investing in the grid to improve reliability and the customer experience. We're also investing in new natural gas and renewable generation resources as we prepare the business for a lower-carbon future. We operate in strong jurisdictions that are positioned for customer growth over the coming years. Our efficient cost structure coupled with lower natural gas prices allows us to make significant investments while maintaining very competitive rates for customers.  Taken together, the predictable stable earnings and cash flows that we are positioned to generate will support attractive earnings and dividend growth for our investors in the years to come.

Today, we reported 2015 adjusted earnings of $4.54 per share, in line with the year ago. I'm pleased with the solid performance and operational execution of our core regulated businesses despite record mild December weather. These results largely offset challenges throughout the year in our International operation. As a sign of confidence in the future, our board, last year, doubled the growth rate of the dividend, a key component of our investor value proposition. 
During today's call, we have several objectives. First, I will highlight how we are strategically positioning the business portfolio and investing for the long term, then I will discuss our 2015 operational highlights, including our industry-leading safety and environmental performance. Steve will provide a financial update with our outlook for 2016 and beyond.
Turning to Slide 4, I'll begin with a broader discussion of our strategy, which provides an important context for the 5-year financial plan that Steve will cover. Our industry is undergoing transformation with new technologies, evolving customer expectations, increasingly impactful public policies and abundant low-cost natural gas. These factors will have a profound impact on our business in the years ahead and are informing our strategic investments. 
We are focusing our long-term strategy on our core domestic regulated businesses and our highly contracted renewables portfolio. We will invest an increasing amount in the electric grid to strengthen reliability and resilience and enable new customer solutions. To advance reliable cost-effective power in a lower-carbon future, we will invest in natural gas generation and infrastructure as well as build on our rapid expansion and renewable technologies. 
We will also invest to maintain our valuable nuclear and clean coal assets. We enter this period of industry transformation with a strong regulated business and with demonstrated strengths in operational excellence, sustainable cost management and regulatory execution. These capabilities will continue to underpin our success in the years ahead. 
An important part of the strategic focus is our decision, outlined on Slide 5, to engage advisers and pursue an orderly exit of our Latin American generation business. This business has been an important part of the Duke Energy portfolio over many years, providing both earnings and cash flows. However, the returns over the last 2 years are inconsistent with our commitment to investors to provide predictable, stable earnings and cash flows. We believe there will be demand for this international portfolio at a reasonable valuation. Because we are early in the process, it is premature to establish a specific time line for a potential transaction. The proceeds will be used to strengthen our balance sheet and help fund the growth in our core businesses. We expect that a sale will be dilutive. Nonetheless, the strategic exit significantly improves our risk profile and enhances our ability to generate more consistent earnings and cash flows over time.
On Slide 6, I will update on our pending acquisition of Piedmont Natural Gas. This investment is also an important element of our focus on natural gas infrastructure and customer solutions. Piedmont is a regulated natural gas infrastructure and local distribution company in the Carolinas and Tennessee. It operates gas infrastructure that supports our gas-fired generation in the Carolinas and provides valuable natural gas solutions to customers.
We are obtaining a high-quality asset with an excellent management team, exceptional customer service and strong rate base growth prospects. Piedmont's highly regulated gas businesses and constructive regulatory jurisdictions fit well with our strategic direction. We expect that the transaction will be accretive in 2017 with a level of accretion growing over time through incremental capital investment and integration of Piedmont operations. We've made good progress in obtaining the required approvals. The Federal Trade Commission has granted early termination of Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period, and Piedmont shareholders have approved the transaction. We are awaiting approvals from the North Carolina and Tennessee utilities commissions. We are still targeting to close the transaction by the end of this year. And in the meantime, merger and integration efforts are well underway, so that we are ready to hit the ground running immediately after the close.
As outlined on Slide 7, you can see the series of strategic transactions that we have made since 2012 to realign our business portfolio to drive more stable earnings and cash flows. The exit of International and acquisition of Piedmont will complete the transition.  This repositioning provides an outstanding foundation for growth and investment for the remainder of this decade and beyond.
Before I turn the call over to Steve, let me highlight on Slide 8 several important operational achievements and our progress advancing our strategic investments during 2015.  I'm proud of the 28,000 Duke Energy employees who are here day in and day out for our customers. Our customers count on us to provide safe, reliable, environmentally responsible energy every day. We completed 2015 with an industry-leading safety record, significantly reducing OSHA reportable incidents and our total incident case rate. Our work is never complete on this front, but I'm pleased with the focus and alignment throughout the organization on safe event-free operations.
We also significantly reduced the number of reportable environmental events in 2015. We have taken what we learned from the Dan River spill in early 2014 and applied it throughout our organization to strengthen operational discipline and results. We have also built world-class capabilities to accelerate the safe closure of our ash basins and are on track to continue advancing this important work in 2016.  Likewise, our Edwardsport IGCC facility in Indiana continues to improve its operational performance, delivering the third consecutive year of improved output and gasifier availability.
We also made great progress on a number of our strategic growth initiatives during the year. As mentioned and consistent with our strategy, we are modernizing the electric grid and modernizing the generation portfolio, including investing in natural gas and utility-scale solar. During 2015, we completed the North Carolina Eastern Municipal Power Agency asset acquisition, which strengthens our generation portfolio in the Carolinas. We also announced plans for the Western Carolinas Modernization Project, which adds new natural gas and solar generation. We made updated filings for grid modernization in Indiana and continued to advance utility-scale solar investments in the Carolinas and Florida. 
In our Commercial Portfolio, we continue to grow our renewables business throughout the U.S. In fact, we installed around 600 megawatts of new wind and solar assets in 2015, surpassing our original objective. Our natural gas pipeline investments will supply our customers with low-cost fuel and provide supply diversity while delivering great returns for investors. The Sabal Trail pipeline received FERC approval earlier this month, while the Atlantic Coast Pipeline made its formal FERC filing last year. 
In closing, strategic investments that provide value to customers, underpinned by excellent operations will deliver stable and predictable growth in earnings and dividends for our shareholders for years to come.
Now let me turn the call over to Steve."
267850,322365214,935910,"Duke Energy Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2016",2016-02-18,"Earnings Calls","Duke Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lynn. Today, my comments will focus briefly on 2015, and I will spend the majority of the discussion on 2016 guidance and our long-term growth prospects in our core businesses. We have extended our long-term earnings growth objective from 3 years",2039,"Thanks, Lynn. Today, my comments will focus briefly on 2015, and I will spend the majority of the discussion on 2016 guidance and our long-term growth prospects in our core businesses. We have extended our long-term earnings growth objective from 3 years to 5 years through 2020 to better align with our capital forecast, our expected rate case activities and the completion of our portfolio transition.
I'll begin on Slide 9. In 2015, we delivered adjusted diluted earnings of $4.54 per share, slightly below our full year guidance range. Our fourth quarter results were impacted by very mild weather. In fact, weather in the month of December impacted our results by $0.12 as temperatures in the Carolinas averaged around 10 degrees above normal. For the full year, strength in our core businesses, our Regulated Utilities and our Commercial Portfolio of renewables and gas infrastructure as well as early execution on a number of strategic initiatives, helped us offset weakness in our International business. Our core businesses delivered $4.15 per share on a weather-normal basis, representing an average annual 5.5% growth rate from our base year of 2013. And our International business delivered $0.33 per share.  For more detailed information on our financial performance in 2015, please refer to the supporting materials that accompany today's press release. 
Our 2016 adjusted earnings guidance range, which we are introducing today, is $4.50 to $4.70 per share. The midpoint of this range assumes a contribution of $4.30 per share from the core businesses, which represent 4% growth over 2015. The midpoint also assumes $0.30 from International, which is down slightly from 2015.
Let me walk you through the key drivers in our businesses from 2015 to 2016. Within the Regulated Utilities, year-over-year weather-normal growth will be primarily driven by the deployment of almost $5 billion in growth capital, retail load growth of 0.5%, the full year impact of our recent acquisition of the NCEMPA assets as well as lower O&M costs. Lower O&M reflects our confidence in continuing to drive costs out of our business. I will review this further in a moment.
Within our Commercial Portfolio, we plan to invest $1.5 billion in renewables in our pipeline joint ventures. Additionally, we will realize a full year of benefit from the prior year accelerated stock repurchase. These growth drivers are partially offset by a regulatory lag in certain jurisdictions as we will not have any significant base rate increases in 2016. The loss of earnings from the Midwest Generation business, which was sold in 2015, will also be a partial offset. 
At International, we expect 2016 earnings of $0.30 per share. In Brazil, reservoir levels have improved during the rainy season, which runs through April. As a result, we are assuming a return to normal dispatch of the hydro generation in Brazil after the rainy season, lowering our purchased power cost. This improvement in the Brazilian hydro operations is expected to be offset by the declining Brazilian exchange rates and low Brent crude oil prices, which impact National Methanol's level of profitability.
Let's shift to discuss the components of our long-term growth. With the pending exit of International, we believe the appropriate focus for a long-term growth discussion should be centered around our core businesses. Through 2020, our core businesses are well situated to grow within 4% to 6% off of their 2016 base of $4.30 per share.
On Slide 10, we have developed a base plan that will deliver 4% to 5% growth. We have also defined incremental growth opportunities that, if achieved, will deliver toward the higher end of the range or 5% to 6% growth. Our base plan is largely driven by the deployment of between $22 billion and $25 billion of growth capital in our Regulated Utilities and between $3 billion to $5 billion in commercial renewables in our gas pipeline investments. This base plan also assumes weather-normalized retail load growth of 0.5% per year from 2016 to 2020, consistent with the past several years. As a reminder, every 50 basis point improvement in retail load growth provides about 1% earnings per share growth. In order to accommodate modest organic retail sales growth, we are targeting flat O&M cost through 2020. And as you know, our track record in O&M cost management has been very good.
To achieve the high end of our long-term growth rate or 5% to 6%, there are incremental growth opportunities that provide upside potential. They include retail load growth higher than our base plan assumption of 1.5%, supported by strengthening economic conditions in our service territories. More on that in a moment. 
The acquisition of Piedmont Natural Gas, which is expected to be accretive to earnings per share, is additive to our growth rate as we move forward. Other growth opportunities exist in our wholesale business in the form of new contracts. In addition, we also have opportunities to deploy more discretionary growth capital than what we have assumed in our base plan. Those investment opportunities include additional commercial and regulated renewables, further modernization of the generation fleet and additional gas infrastructure investments.
Turning now to Slide 11. I'll discuss in more detail our regulated investments over the next 5 years. The combination of these investments supports the growth rate in our regulated earnings base of approximately 5% from 2016 through 2020. Our capital deployment is directed to the strategic priorities that Lynn discussed: customer-focused grid investments, new gas and renewable generation investments and natural gas 
infrastructure as demand for gas increases.  
We expect to invest nearly $8 billion, expanding our regulated electric grid infrastructure, including improvements in technology. These investments will enable us to improve the reliability of the grid, reduce outages and restore service faster and provide real-time information to our customers. We also plan to invest around $8 billion in new generation, including natural gas and renewable assets, as we continue to build an energy system for the future and reduce emissions even further while maintaining the service reliability our customers expect.  
Finally, we expect investments of $3 billion for environmental compliance. This amount covers steam affluent requirements and cost to close the initial high priority coal ash basins in the Carolinas.
Our earnings growth from 2016 to 2020 is strong but not linear due to the timing of capital deployment and subsequent rate recovery. We see earnings growth accelerating in the 2018 to '20 time frame due to several factors. First, grid and customer investments in Ohio and Indiana build over time and are recovered through rate riders later in the 5-year period. 
Second, our investments in new generation in Florida and the Carolinas as well as our gas pipeline infrastructures projects will begin to accelerate in 2018 through 2020. 
Third, we will be filing a number of rate cases in this time period across many of our utilities in order to recover our capital investments. We expect to file a rate case in Duke Energy Ohio in 2016 and Duke Energy Kentucky in 2017. We also expect cases in the Carolinas in the back half of the 5-year plan. We continue to fine-tune specific timing based on our capital spending projects, such as the Lee Combined Cycle, the Western Carolinas Modernization Project and coal ash basin remediation.  We have further details of our capital spend and recovery mechanisms by category of investment in our appendix materials.
Moving ahead to Slide 12, I'll discuss some trends we are monitoring related to our retail load. We are planning for modest growth of 1.5% over the next 5 years, however, there are a few developing trends that give us optimism for some upside over the coming years. The labor market continues to strengthen with unemployment and median household incomes improving. Jobs are being created in our service territories as the Carolinas and Florida were among the top 10 in job growth in 2015. We continue to forecast strong growth in a number of customers, particularly in the Carolinas and Florida. Additionally, usage per customer, which declined during 2013 and 2014, has been essentially flat for the past 3 consecutive quarters.  Certain sectors of the industrial class, such as construction and automotive, remained strong, while the strengthening U.S. dollar has challenged other sectors such as the steel industry. The strength of our service territories is also supported by robust economic development activities attracting new businesses and jobs. In 2015, these activities led to the announcement of $3.5 billion in capital investments and over 12,000 new jobs in our 6-state service area.
As we are planning for a period of sustained modest load growth, it is important that we efficiently manage our cost structure. As outlined on Slide 13, we've been successful holding costs down in the past and are targeting to keep our nonfuel O&M costs flat through 2020. 
The Progress Energy merger and integration initiatives focused heavily on the consolidation and optimization of our corporate centers. We've made significant investments integrating our IT, HR and financial systems to common platforms. We are now rolling out similar initiatives to the operational parts of the organization in order to achieve our target of flat O&M through 2020.
Slide 14 shows our high-level 2016 cash flows and financing plan. As I mentioned in my opening, our strong balance sheet and credit quality are foundational to our overall financial objectives. Our focus on the core businesses creates a better risk profile with more predictable and stable earnings and cash flows. We design our financing plans and target credit metrics with those objectives in mind. 
Our 5-year plan includes $700 million of DRIP equity after 2017, designed to bolster the balance sheet, to continue funding the increasing level of growth investments we expect in the back end of the planning horizon, such as the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and new gas generation. 
Our financing assumptions outlined on this slide do not include the acquisition of Piedmont Natural Gas or the sale of International. We plan to issue between $500 million to $750 million of equity through a forward structure, and we'll finance the remainder with debt at the holding company upon closing.  Proceeds from the sale of International will be used to strengthen our balance sheet, helping to fund growth in our core businesses.
Now I'd like to provide some perspective on the recent 5-year extension of bonus depreciation benefits. This extension will generate cumulative after-tax cash benefits of about $3 billion. However, due to our federal net operating loss tax position, we will see total improved cash flows of around $1 billion but in the back end of our planning horizon. In the short term, our federal tax position will keep us from recognizing the manufacturing deduction through 2018, impacting our annual earnings by around $0.05 per share.
Moving to Slide 15, let's talk about our dividend. We have proudly paid a quarterly dividend for 90 consecutive years. Last year, our board approved a 4% increase to the dividend, which was double the previous annual growth rate of around 2%. We continue to target annual growth in the dividend consistent with our long-term 4% to 6% earnings growth. Our dividend is supported by the strong cash flows from our core businesses. Our Regulated Utilities are distributing between 65% and 70% of their earnings to the parent during the planning horizon, providing strong support to the dividend. Additionally, during the period, we continue to hold the International business. This segment will generate annual cash flows of between $200 million and $300 million to be distributed to the parent. Through 2020, our dividend payout ratio is expected to be between 70% and 75%. We are comfortable with this payout, given the quality of our lower-risk core businesses and their more stable earnings and cash flows.
I'll close with Slide 16, which summarizes our key investor considerations. Duke Energy has tremendous scale, offering an attractive investor value proposition, which includes balanced growth in earnings and dividends over time. We are confident in our ability to grow our core businesses between 4% and 6% through 2020. We will also maintain a strong balance sheet to ensure reliable access to the capital markets while we finance this growth.
With that, let me turn it back over to Lynn for some closing thoughts."

We are strategically responding to the transformation that is occurring in our industry. We're simplifying our business portfolio to focus on our growing core regulated businesses and our highly contracted renewables portfolio. We're enhancing customer value by investing in the grid to improve reliability and the customer experience. We're also investing in new natural gas and renewable generation resources as we prepare the business for a lower-carbon future. We operate in strong jurisdictions that are positioned for customer growth over the coming years. Our efficient cost structure, coupled with low natural gas prices, allows us to make significant investments while maintaining very competitive rates for customers.  Taken together, the predictable stable earnings and cash flows that we are positioned to generate will support attractive earnings and dividend growth for our investors in the years to come.

If you look back at our track record of the last 5 years, we have been consistently moving toward lower-carbon sources of generation, and we see that continuing. So as I look at this 5-year plan, whether this would stay a Clean power Plan or not, we believe the plan that we're on is one that makes sense for our customers and our communities and our states. I think the clarity that will come from this legal review will be helpful but more helpful to set pace and timing of decisions in the next decade, so in the 2020s and forward. So I would say our states are still grappling with this, understanding it, thinking through their processes. We will be closely working with them. We're trying to find solutions that make the most sense for our customers and communities. But I think for the near term, the strategy will be to watch the litigation and then execute the plan that we already have in front of us in terms of modernizing our system."

The proceeds for International you should think about is being an acceleration of repatriation, and that repatriation was already in the plan. And that we believe the remaining amount would be appropriate for delevering because the International business has provided a source of FFO in our metrics or credit metrics. And so as we take those out, we believe it's important for us to delever in connection with the rest of those proceeds. So if you look at the whole thing together, we believe we can execute the capital that's included, the acquisition of Piedmont, the divestiture of International and have a very strong balance sheet and growth rate coming out of that 5-year period."

Today, we reported 2015 adjusted earnings of $4.54 per share, in line with the year ago. I'm pleased with the solid performance and operational execution of our core regulated businesses despite record mild December weather. These results largely offset challenges throughout the year in our International operation. As a sign of confidence in the future, our board, last year, doubled the growth rate of the dividend, a key component of our investor value proposition. 
During today's call, we have several objectives. First, I will highlight how we are strategically positioning the business portfolio and investing for the long term, then I will discuss our 2015 operational highlights, including our industry-leading safety and environmental performance. Steve will provide a financial update with our outlook for 2016 and beyond.
Turning to Slide 4, I'll begin with a broader discussion of our strategy, which provides an important context for the 5-year financial plan that Steve will cover. Our industry is undergoing transformation with new technologies, evolving customer expectations, increasingly impactful public policies and abundant low-cost natural gas. These factors will have a profound impact on our business in the years ahead and are informing our strategic investments. 
We are focusing our long-term strategy on our core domestic regulated businesses and our highly contracted renewables portfolio. We will invest an increasing amount in the electric grid to strengthen reliability and resilience and enable new customer solutions. To advance reliable cost-effective power in a lower-carbon future, we will invest in natural gas generation and infrastructure as well as build on our rapid expansion and renewable technologies. 
We will also invest to maintain our valuable nuclear and clean coal assets. We enter this period of industry transformation with a strong regulated business and with demonstrated strengths in operational excellence, sustainable cost management and regulatory execution. These capabilities will continue to underpin our success in the years ahead. 
An important part of the strategic focus is our decision, outlined on Slide 5, to engage advisers and pursue an orderly exit of our Latin American generation business. This business has been an important part of the Duke Energy portfolio over many years, providing both earnings and cash flows. However, the returns over the last 2 years are inconsistent with our commitment to investors to provide predictable, stable earnings and cash flows. We believe there will be demand for this international portfolio at a reasonable valuation. Because we are early in the process, it is premature to establish a specific time line for a potential transaction. The proceeds will be used to strengthen our balance sheet and help fund the growth in our core businesses. We expect that a sale will be dilutive. Nonetheless, the strategic exit significantly improves our risk profile and enhances our ability to generate more consistent earnings and cash flows over time.
On Slide 6, I will update on our pending acquisition of Piedmont Natural Gas. This investment is also an important element of our focus on natural gas infrastructure and customer solutions. Piedmont is a regulated natural gas infrastructure and local distribution company in the Carolinas and Tennessee. It operates gas infrastructure that supports our gas-fired generation in the Carolinas and provides valuable natural gas solutions to customers.
We are obtaining a high-quality asset with an excellent management team, exceptional customer service and strong rate base growth prospects. Piedmont's highly regulated gas businesses and constructive regulatory jurisdictions fit well with our strategic direction. We expect that the transaction will be accretive in 2017 with a level of accretion growing over time through incremental capital investment and integration of Piedmont operations. We've made good progress in obtaining the required approvals. The Federal Trade Commission has granted early termination of the Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period, and Piedmont shareholders have approved the transaction. We are awaiting approvals from the North Carolina and Tennessee utilities commissions. We are still targeting to close the transaction by the end of this year. And in the meantime, merger and integration efforts are well underway, so that we are ready to hit the ground running immediately after the close.
As outlined on Slide 7, you can see the series of strategic transactions that we have made since 2012 to realign our business portfolio to drive more stable earnings and cash flows. The exit of International and acquisition of Piedmont will complete the transition.  This repositioning provides an outstanding foundation for growth and investment for the remainder of this decade and beyond.
Before I turn the call over to Steve, let me highlight on Slide 8 several important operational achievements and our progress advancing our strategic investments during 2015. I'm proud of the 28,000 Duke Energy employees who are here day in and day out for our customers. Our customers count on us to provide safe, reliable, environmentally responsible energy every day. We completed 2015 with an industry-leading safety record, significantly reducing OSHA reportable incidents and our total incident case rate. Our work is never complete on this front, but I'm pleased with the focus and alignment throughout the organization on safe event-free operations.
We also significantly reduced the number of reportable environmental events in 2015. We have taken what we learned from the Dan River spill in early 2014 and applied it throughout our organization to strengthen operational discipline and results. We have also built world-class capabilities to accelerate the safe closure of our ash basins and are on track to continue advancing this important work in 2016. Likewise, our Edwardsport IGCC facility in Indiana continues to improve its operational performance, delivering the third consecutive year of improved output and gasifier availability.
We also made great progress on a number of our strategic growth initiatives during the year. As we mentioned and consistent with our strategy, we are modernizing the electric grid and modernizing the generation portfolio, including investing in natural gas and utility-scale solar. During 2015, we completed the North Carolina Eastern Municipal Power Agency asset acquisition, which strengthens our generation portfolio in the Carolinas. We also announced plans for the Western Carolinas Modernization Project, which adds new natural gas and solar generation. We made updated filings for grid modernization in Indiana and continued to advance utility-scale solar investments in the Carolinas and Florida. 
In our Commercial Portfolio, we continue to grow our renewables business throughout the U.S. In fact, we installed around 600 megawatts of new wind and solar assets in 2015, surpassing our original objective. Our natural gas pipeline investments will supply our customers with low-cost fuel and provide supply diversity while delivering great returns for investors. The Sabal Trail pipeline received FERC approval earlier this month, while the Atlantic Coast Pipeline made its formal FERC filing last year. 
In closing, strategic investments that provide value to customers, underpinned by excellent operations, will deliver stable and predictable growth in earnings and dividends for our shareholders for years to come.
Now let me turn the call over to Steve."

Today, my comments will focus briefly on 2015, and I will spend the majority of the discussion on 2016 guidance and our long-term growth prospects in our core businesses. We have extended our long-term earnings growth objective from 3 years",2039,"Thanks, Lynn. Today, my comments will focus briefly on 2015, and I will spend the majority of the discussion on 2016 guidance and our long-term growth prospects in our core businesses. We have extended our long-term earnings growth objective from 3 years to 5 years through 2020 to better align with our capital forecast, our expected rate case activities and the completion of our portfolio transition.
I'll begin on Slide 9. In 2015, we delivered adjusted diluted earnings of $4.54 per share, slightly below our full year guidance range. Our fourth quarter results were impacted by very mild weather. In fact, weather in the month of December impacted our results by $0.12 as temperatures in the Carolinas averaged around 10 degrees above normal. For the full year, strength in our core businesses, our Regulated Utilities and our Commercial Portfolio of renewables and gas infrastructure as well as early execution on a number of strategic initiatives, helped us offset weakness in our International business. Our core businesses delivered $4.15 per share on a weather-normal basis, representing an average annual 5.5% growth rate from our base year of 2013. And our International business delivered $0.33 per share.  For more detailed information on our financial performance in 2015, please refer to the supporting materials that accompany today's press release. 
Our 2016 adjusted earnings guidance range, which we are introducing today, is $4.50 to $4.70 per share. The midpoint of this range assumes a contribution of $4.30 per share from the core businesses, which represent 4% growth over 2015. The midpoint also assumes $0.30 from International, which is down slightly from 2015.
Let me walk you through the key drivers in our businesses from 2015 to 2016. Within the Regulated Utilities, year-over-year weather-normal growth will be primarily driven by the deployment of almost $5 billion in growth capital, retail load growth of 0.5%, the full year impact of our recent acquisition of the NCEMPA assets as well as lower O&M costs. Lower O&M reflects our confidence in continuing to drive costs out of our business. I will review this further in a moment.
Within our Commercial Portfolio, we plan to invest $1.5 billion in renewables in our pipeline joint ventures. Additionally, we will realize a full year of benefit from the prior year accelerated stock repurchase. These growth drivers are partially offset by a regulatory lag in certain jurisdictions as we will not have any significant base rate increases in 2016. The loss of earnings from the Midwest Generation business, which was sold in 2015, will also be a partial offset. 
At International, we expect 2016 earnings of $0.30 per share. In Brazil, reservoir levels have improved during the rainy season, which runs through April. As a result, we are assuming a return to normal dispatch of the hydro generation in Brazil after the rainy season, lowering our purchased power cost. This improvement in the Brazilian hydro operations is expected to be offset by the declining Brazilian exchange rates and low Brent crude oil prices, which impact National Methanol's level of profitability.
Let's shift to discuss the components of our long-term growth. With the pending exit of International, we believe the appropriate focus for a long-term growth discussion should be centered around our core businesses. Through 2020, our core businesses are well situated to grow within 4% to 6% off of their 2016 base of $4.30 per share.
On Slide 10, we have developed a base plan that will deliver 4% to 5% growth. We have also defined incremental growth opportunities that, if achieved, will deliver toward the higher end of the range or 5% to 6% growth. Our base plan is largely driven by the deployment of between $22 billion and $25 billion of growth capital in our Regulated Utilities and between $3 billion to $5 billion in commercial renewables in our gas pipeline investments. This base plan also assumes weather-normalized retail load growth of 0.5% per year from 2016 to 2020, consistent with the past several years. As a reminder, every 50 basis point improvement in retail load growth provides about 1% earnings per share growth. In order to accommodate modest organic retail sales growth, we are targeting flat O&M cost through 2020. And as you know, our track record in O&M cost management has been very good.
To achieve the high end of our long-term growth rate, or 5% to 6%, there are incremental growth opportunities that provide upside potential. They include retail load growth higher than our base plan assumption of 0.5%, supported by strengthening economic conditions in our service territories. More on that in a moment. 
The acquisition of Piedmont Natural Gas, which is expected to be accretive to earnings per share, is additive to our growth rate as we move forward. Other growth opportunities exist in our wholesale business in the form of new contracts. In addition, we also have opportunities to deploy more discretionary growth capital than what we have assumed in our base plan. Those investment opportunities include additional commercial and regulated renewables, further modernization of the generation fleet and additional gas infrastructure investments.
Turning now to Slide 11. I'll discuss in more detail our regulated investments over the next 5 years. The combination of these investments supports the growth rate in our regulated earnings base of approximately 5% from 2016 through 2020. Our capital deployment is directed to the strategic priorities that Lynn discussed: customer-focused grid investments, new gas and renewable generation investments and natural gas 
infrastructure as demand for gas increases.  
We expect to invest nearly $8 billion, expanding our regulated electric grid infrastructure, including improvements in technology. These investments will enable us to improve the reliability of the grid, reduce outages and restore service faster and provide real-time information to our customers. We also plan to invest around $8 billion in new generation, including natural gas and renewable assets, as we continue to build an energy system for the future and reduce emissions even further while maintaining the service reliability our customers expect.  
Finally, we expect investments of $3 billion for environmental compliance. This amount covers steam affluent requirements and cost to close the initial high priority coal ash basins in the Carolinas.
Our earnings growth from 2016 to 2020 is strong but not linear due to the timing of capital deployment and subsequent rate recovery. We see earnings growth accelerating in the 2018 to '20 time frame due to several factors. First, grid and customer investments in Ohio and Indiana build over time and are recovered through rate riders later in the 5-year period. 
Second, our investments in new generation in Florida and the Carolinas as well as our gas pipeline infrastructures projects will begin to accelerate in 2018 through 2020. 
Third, we will be filing a number of rate cases in this time period across many of our utilities in order to recover our capital investments. We expect to file a rate case in Duke Energy Ohio in 2016 and Duke Energy Kentucky in 2017. We also expect cases in the Carolinas in the back half of the 5-year plan. We continue to fine-tune specific timing based on our capital spending projects, such as the Lee Combined Cycle, the Western Carolinas Modernization Project and coal ash basin remediation. We have further details of our capital spend and recovery mechanisms by category of investment in our appendix materials.
Moving ahead to Slide 12, I'll discuss some trends we are monitoring related to our retail load. We are planning for modest growth of 0.5% over the next 5 years, however, there are a few developing trends that give us optimism for some upside over the coming years. The labor market continues to strengthen with unemployment and median household incomes improving. Jobs are being created in our service territories as the Carolinas and Florida were among the top 10 in job growth in 2015. We continue to forecast strong growth in a number of customers, particularly in the Carolinas and Florida. Additionally, usage per customer, which declined during 2013 and 2014, has been essentially flat for the past 3 consecutive quarters. Certain sectors of the industrial class, such as construction and automotive, remain strong, while the strengthening U.S. dollar has challenged other sectors such as the steel industry. The strength of our service territories is also supported by robust economic development activities attracting new businesses and jobs. In 2015, these activities led to the announcement of $3.5 billion in capital investments and over 12,000 new jobs in our 6-state service area.
As we are planning for a period of sustained modest load growth, it is important that we efficiently manage our cost structure. As outlined on Slide 13, we've been successful holding costs down in the past and are targeting to keep our nonfuel O&M costs flat through 2020. 
The Progress Energy merger and integration initiatives focused heavily on the consolidation and optimization of our corporate centers. We've made significant investments integrating our IT, HR and financial systems to common platforms. We are now rolling out similar initiatives to the operational parts of the organization in order to achieve our target of flat O&M through 2020.
Slide 14 shows our high-level 2016 cash flows and financing plan. As I mentioned in my opening, our strong balance sheet and credit quality are foundational to our overall financial objectives. Our focus on the core businesses creates a better risk profile with more predictable and stable earnings and cash flows. We design our financing plans and target credit metrics with those objectives in mind. 
Our 5-year plan includes $700 million of DRIP equity after 2017, designed to bolster the balance sheet, to continue funding the increasing level of growth investments we expect in the back end of the planning horizon, such as the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and new gas generation. 
Our financing assumptions outlined on this slide do not include the acquisition of Piedmont Natural Gas or the sale of International. We plan to issue between $500 million to $750 million of equity through a forward structure, and we'll finance the remainder with debt at the holding company upon closing. Proceeds from the sale of International will be used to strengthen our balance sheet, helping to fund growth in our core businesses.
Now I'd like to provide some perspective on the recent 5-year extension of bonus depreciation benefits. This extension will generate cumulative after-tax cash benefits of about $3 billion. However, due to our federal net operating loss tax position, we will see total improved cash flows of around $1 billion but in the back end of our planning horizon. In the short term, our federal tax position will keep us from recognizing the manufacturing deduction through 2018, impacting our annual earnings by around $0.05 per share.
Moving to Slide 15, let's talk about our dividend. We have proudly paid a quarterly dividend for 90 consecutive years. Last year, our board approved a 4% increase to the dividend, which was double the previous annual growth rate of around 2%. We continue to target annual growth in the dividend consistent with our long-term 4% to 6% earnings growth. Our dividend is supported by the strong cash flows from our core businesses. Our Regulated Utilities are distributing between 65% and 70% of their earnings to the parent during the planning horizon, providing strong support to the dividend. Additionally, during the period we continue to hold the International business. This segment will generate annual cash flows of between $200 million and $300 million to be distributed to the parent. Through 2020, our dividend payout ratio is expected to be between 70% and 75%. We are comfortable with this payout, given the quality of our lower-risk core businesses and their more stable earnings and cash flows.
I'll close with Slide 16, which summarizes our key investor considerations. Duke Energy has tremendous scale, offering an attractive investor value proposition, which includes balanced growth in earnings and dividends over time. We are confident in our ability to grow our core businesses between 4% and 6% through 2020. We will also maintain a strong balance sheet to ensure reliable access to the capital markets while we finance this growth.
With that, let me turn it back over to Lynn for some closing thoughts."

We are strategically responding to the transformation that is occurring in our industry. We're simplifying our business portfolio to focus on our growing core regulated businesses and our highly contracted renewables portfolio. We're enhancing customer value by investing in the grid to improve reliability and the customer experience. We're also investing in new natural gas and renewable generation resources as we prepare the business for a lower-carbon future. We operate in strong jurisdictions that are positioned for customer growth over the coming years. Our efficient cost structure, coupled with low natural gas prices, allows us to make significant investments while maintaining very competitive rates for customers.  Taken together, the predictable stable earnings and cash flows that we are positioned to generate will support attractive earnings and dividend growth for our investors in the years to come.

We have not had the DRIP on since 2010. And we believe with the level of capital spending in our core businesses that, that is an important approach. The proceeds for International you should think about as being an acceleration of repatriation, and that repatriation was already in the plan. And that we believe the remaining amount would be appropriate for delevering because the International business has provided a source of FFO in our metrics or credit metrics. And so as we take those out, we believe it's important for us to delever in connection with the rest of those proceeds. So if you look at the whole thing together, we believe we can execute the capital that's included, the acquisition of Piedmont, the divestiture of International and have a very strong balance sheet and growth rate coming out of that 5-year period."

But Ohio has strong growth in that it has mechanisms put in place to efficiently turn grid investments into earnings. Indiana is looking strong as we implement the Senate Bill 560, the TDSIC rider that will allow us to make investments in that area. Florida is solid with the Citrus County, Hines and Osprey facilities coming into play. The Carolinas look at growth in the earnings between rate cases as being a bit more challenging. And then you see a big jump in the rate cases as the investments then get turned into earnings. And there's a number of good investments there that are coming with the Lee Combined Cycle in and the Western Carolinas Modernization. That's later in the period there."

I'm very pleased with our solid first quarter financial results, our continued focus on operational performance and the progress we've made on our strategic portfolio transition and important growth initiatives.",1519,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm very pleased with our solid first quarter financial results, our continued focus on operational performance and the progress we've made on our strategic portfolio transition and important growth initiatives. I'll provide an update on our progress on these initiatives in just a moment.
First, let me begin with a few financial and operational highlights of the first quarter as summarized on Slide 4. This morning, we announced first quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $1.13. Results for our Regulated Utilities were modestly below our internal plan as a result of significant storm costs in the Carolinas, mild weather and weaker than expected customer volumes. We continue to see strong customer growth and our 12 month rolling average volumes continue to track consistently with our expectations. Operating results for our International business were in line with our expectations as hydrology began to return to more normal levels in Brazil. We also recognize tax adjustments at international during the quarter, which Steve will review in a moment.
As we look to the balance of the year, we are reaffirming our full year 2016 guidance range of $4.50 to $4.70 per share. Daily operational excellence continues to underpin our commitment to our customers, communities and investors. Second inventory starts with our focus on safety. For 2015, Duke Energy's employee safety record received the top rank among large utilities as recognized by EEI. Our generation fleet also performed well during the quarter. Our nuclear fleet achieved a 95% capacity factor building on its record-breaking performance in 2015. In Indiana, our Edwardsport IGCC facility continues to improve its operational performance. In February, the gasifiers achieved 100% availability, our best month ever.
Our growing natural gas fleet is also benefiting customers and the environment taking advantage of low natural gas prices. In March of this year, our gas-fired plant set a record for monthly natural gas consumption, surpassing the record set last June. This is indicative of the strategic coal to gas shift in our generation portfolio, which has enabled us to reduce carbon emissions by 28% since 2005.
Our organization responded well to weather challenges in the first quarter. In January, winter storm Jonas, struck the Carolinas causing approximately 600,000 customer outages. There were also ice and wind storms in February, impacting more than 500,000 customers in the Carolinas. Our teams performed admirably during these events, continuing to provide customers with a level of service they'd come to expect.
Next, on the update here on our coal ash base and closure activities in the Carolinas. We continue to make outstanding progress with closure activities underway at 6 sites. For each of our basins, the North Carolina Department of environmental quality is required by statute to recommend risk classifications. Preliminary classifications were released at the end of January followed by a public comment period. We expect DEQ to finalize their classification shortly. The risk classifications will impact basin closure methods, timing and costs. Based on our comprehensive engineering analysis of our basins, we believe the majority of the remaining unclassified basins meet the requirements for a low classification, allowing 15 years and closer methods, which include storing the ash in place. We are committed to safe basin closure in a way that protects our communities and the environment while minimizing cost to customers. We will keep you informed as the regulatory review process continues to advance.
Turning to Slide 5, I'll highlight several recent milestones and our important growth initiatives. Our 5-year capital plans for 2020 includes the deployment of between $25 billion and $30 billion in growth capital and new natural gas-fired generation, grid investments, commercial and regulated renewables and gas pipeline infrastructure. These investments are directed at improving customer service, modernizing our generation fleet and the electric grid as well as investing in natural gas infrastructure that's complementary to our system. These investments support our transition to its businesses that provide stable long-term growth in earnings and the dividend.
During the quarter, we received approval from the North Carolina Utilities Commission for our $1 billion Western Carolinas modernization project in Asheville. This allows us to move forward with retiring the Asheville coal plant by 2020 and replacing it with 2 highly efficient natural gas combined cycle units. In South Carolina, construction of our $700 million W.S. Lee natural gas combined cycle plant is well underway. The project is on budget and on target for a November 2017 end service date. We also broke ground on our $1.5 billion natural gas fired Citrus County combined cycle plant in Florida, staying on track for a 2018 in-service date. We're building on our success in growing our commercial and regulated renewable assets. In our Commercial Portfolio, our 2 200-megawatt wind project 4 and frontier are on target to come online later this year.
Since the beginning of the year, we've announced the acquisition of 9 new solar projects including 8 in North Carolina. In our Regulated Utilities, we've announced 100 megawatts of planned store installations for 2016 in the Carolinas, Florida and Indiana. That's all ready. About 75% of what we achieved in 2015, which was a very strong year for solar investment. In fact, Duke Energy Progress was ranked third among all utilities in 2015 for bringing new solar capacity online. Additionally, a picture on this slide, we recently completed an iconic solar farm to serve the power needs of Walt Disney World resort in Orlando.
In the first quarter, we also made good progress in our grid modernization efforts. In March, we announced the settlement agreement with nearly all intervenors including key consumer groups on our 7 year Indiana T&D infrastructure investment program. The $1.4 billion plan will provide much-needed technology and infrastructure upgrades that will benefit customers, providing improved reliability and safety, fewer and shorter power outages, better information and overall energy savings.
In addition, the settlement allows us to continue evaluating the installation of smart meters in our Indiana service territory, which will be eligible for recovery in a future rate case. The grid modernization hearings with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission began yesterday, and we expect a decision around midyear.
Our 2 commercial natural gas pipeline infrastructure project, Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Sabal Trail, continue moving forward. Sabal Trail received FERC approval in February and the pipeline is on target to begin construction in the second quarter and be in operation in 2017. Atlantic Coast Pipeline is also progressing and has adopted several alternate routes, increasing the link to the pipeline from about 550 miles to just under 600 miles. The project partners recently submitted updated information related to these alternative grids as well as responses to all of FERC's outstanding environmental information requests. We're confident that FERC will soon be able to issue its draft environmental impact statement, the next important project milestone. And in fact, I believe that statement was issued this morning.
The Project partners have devoted significant time and resources to ensure that the environmental issues have been fully addressed, and as a result, we've adjusted our expectation for receipt at the FERC certificate to mid-2017. We are still planning for a late 2018 and service date for the project.
Turning to Slide 6, I will address recent activities around the strategic transition of our overall business portfolio for the regulated and contracted electric and gas infrastructure businesses. The 2 strategic transactions highlighted on this slide will complete the realignment of our portfolio to focus entirely on domestic businesses, to drive more stable earnings and cash flows.
Let's start with our pending acquisition of Piedmont Natural Gas. In March, we received approval from the Tennessee Regulatory Authority for a change in control of an acquisition by Duke Energy. The final remaining approval was with the North Carolina Utilities Commission, which has scheduled hearings for July 18. We remain confident in closing the transaction before the end of this year. Additionally, at the end of February, we successfully priced the common stock offering to fund the equity portion of the Piedmont acquisition. The $766 million offering was well received by our investors. As a reminder, the shares were offered in a forward structure. This means we will not issue the shares until the forward is settled at the time the Piedmont transaction closes.
We are also progressing on the planned exit of our Latin American generation business. We've begun initial steps in marketing the assets including signing nondisclosure agreements and providing information to interested parties. This business includes high quality assets, which we believe will attract significant entrants for potential buyers. We will keep you updated on this important strategic transition.
In conclusion, I'm pleased with our financial results for the quarter and our progress in advancing our growth investments. We're also maintaining a sharp focus on operational excellence, which includes our commitment to safety and cost efficiency. Our business portfolio transition positions Duke as an industry leading domestic infrastructure business with stable transparent earnings and cash flows. We're looking forward to continuing our progress on this transition throughout 2016.
Now let me turn it over to Steve."

He is also had extensive experience in treasury, financial planning and analysis and Investor Relations. We're delighted he's returning to IR to lead the team where he will continue our efforts to serve our shareholders and investors.
Today, I'll focus on 4 primary areas. First, I'll discuss the major drivers of our first quarter results and provide an update to our full year adjusted EPS guidance range for 2016. I'll discuss our retail volume trends and economic conditions within our service territories. I'll spend a few moments on the continued cost management efforts underway, then I will close with a review of our key investor considerations.
Let's start with the quarterly results. I will cover the highlights on Slide 7. For more detailed information on segment variances versus last year, please refer to the supporting materials that accompany today's press release.
First quarter adjusted diluted earnings were $1.13 per share compared to $1.24 in the first quarter of 2015. The lower results and the current year reflect milder winter weather in 2016 and the absence of Midwest Generation results due to the successful sale of the business in April 2015. Additionally, in 2016, we incurred significant winter storm costs and somewhat softer retail volumes, which were offset by a tax adjustment at international.
On a reported basis, 2016 first quarter earnings per share were $1.01 compared to $1.22 last year. Let me briefly review key quarterly earnings drivers at each of our business segments. On an adjusted basis, Regulated Utilities results declined by $0.11 per share, principally driven by the milder weather in the Carolinas and Midwest. Higher revenues from pricing in lighters in the Carolinas and Ohio were mostly offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense due to additional plant in service, including the acquisition of an NCEMPA assets in July 2015.
Additionally, we incurred higher O&M expense during the quarter as a result of winter storm costs in the Carolinas, which were higher than our planning assumptions by $0.05. Offsetting emergent storm expenses were lower outage costs and increased cost efficiencies throughout the organization. As expected, our Commercial Portfolio declined by $0.11 per share in the first quarter of 2016, primarily due to the absence of Midwest Generation business, which was sold in April of 2015. Our commercial renewables benefited from improved levels of wind production this quarter and growth from renewable projects. Other was down $0.06 per share, primarily due to prior year tax adjustments and higher interest expense in the quarter.
Moving to international operational performance. In particular in Brazil strengthened during the quarter. Hydrology in Brazil has improved significantly during the recent rainy season. Reservoir levels in Southeast Brazil are approximately 60% compared to around 30% this time last year.
This improvement has resulted in increased Hydro production throughout Brazil and lower purchase power costs to meet our contractual commitments. We also have $0.11 of favorable tax related items associated with the international segment during the quarter, which represents the impact of several events.
You'll recall in the fourth quarter of 2014, we declared a $2.7 billion dividend at international in order to efficiently bring funds back to the U.S. In early 2016, we announced our intent to exit the International business. This decision, combined with the extension of bonus depreciation by Congress in late 2015, allows us to more efficiently utilize foreign tax credits and reduce our U.S. income taxes. As a result of our intent to exit the International business, we will recognize additional U.S. income taxes for international up until the point of sale.
Overall, in our first quarter results, we remain on track to achieve our 2016 guidance range of between $4.50 to $4.70 per share.
Moving on to Slide 8, I'll now discuss our retail customer volume trends. On a rolling 12 month basis, weather normalized retail loan growth was 0.7% through the first quarter. For the first quarter, our retail loan growth trends were soft. Within the residential sector, we continue to experience strong growth in the number of new customers, approximately 1.3% over the recent 12 months. However, after moderating for most of 2015, residential customer usage trends have declined during the quarter, due to the slow economic recovery and adoption of energy efficiency initiatives. Employment and wage growth trends continue to be favorable for the residential sector, along with the improving housing sector. The commercial and industrial classes continue to grow -- to show growth of 0.2% and 1.1%, respectively, over the rolling 12 months. The commercial sector continues to be supported by office vacancy rate declines and job creation remains strong. Offsetting this growth is the governmental sector. As many agencies face tighter budgets, elimination of jobs and adoption of energy efficiency measures.
As for the industrial sector, construction, automotive's and textiles continued to show strength in the Carolinas and Midwest. Other industrial companies continue to reduce production as they work through unusually high inventory levels accumulated in 2015. However, the softer global economies and the stronger dollar still impacting companies to compete globally such as steel and metals.
Our 12 month trends continue to track to our planning assumptions despite a weak first quarter. We will continue to closely monitor customer usage patterns as we progress through the year.
Moving to Slide 9. As we continue to position our company for a low load growth environment, I'd like to spend just a moment discussing the progress that we made in managing costs across the organizations. So far this year, absent the emerging storm costs, O&M is tracking favorable through the prior year, which is consistent with our expectations. We are focused on standardization of our operational processes in systems to manage our business much more efficiently. We are also continuing to take advantage of the flexibility and cost savings associated with the transition of our generation portfolio from coal to natural gas. Also within our nuclear and fossil generation fleets, we are making changes in how we plan and execute our plant outages and how we utilize resources across our fleet. Although the nuclear promise is an industrywide approach to controlling costs, activities are already underway within our nuclear fleet to drive out costs and place more discipline on capital allocation.
In our transmission and distribution businesses, we continue to pursue technology. They not only provides greater reliability and information for our customers, but also helps control work volumes, metering costs and contractor needs.
I'll close with Slide 10, which summarizes our key investor considerations. Duke Energy has tremendous scale, offering an attractive investor value proposition, which includes balanced growth in earnings and dividends over time. As Lynn mentioned, we are making excellent progress on the acquisition of Piedmont and the exit of the International business. After the completion of this strategic transition, we will operate a portfolio that provides lower risk and higher quality earnings and cash flows to support growth in both earnings and the dividend. Our strong capital plan includes the transition toward a lower carbon future as we retire coal and build new efficient combined cycle natural gas and renewable resources.
We are excited about the growth opportunities for natural gas infrastructure across our service territories, particularly in the Southeast. Our electric grid investments allow us to deliver higher levels of reliability and offer new innovative products and services to our customers. Our dividend is very important to us. We continue to target annual growth in the dividend consistent with our long-term 4% to 6% earnings growth objective. Strong cash flows from our core businesses support our dividend. We're only 1 quarter into the year but remain on track to achieve the $4.50 to $4.70 adjusted earnings per share guidance range for 2016.
With that, let's open the line for your questions."

So coming into this year, we had the extension of bonus depreciation and then the planned announcement of the exit of international, put us in a position where we could relook at the tax consequences of a sale of the business. And we are going to be in a position to utilize more of our foreign tax credits, which is real economic benefit from the combination of the extension of bonus and the decision to exit. And so that economic benefit is being reflected in the first quarter. It does put us ahead of our first quarter plan on international as a result of that. But also, as we indicated in the script, we will begin recognizing tax expense because we will no longer be making the assertion that the proceeds do not come onshore, and that tax expense will be reflected over the balance of the year.

I would say that -- I always want to say this. When you're looking at a quarter in particular, short periods of time, you have to be careful about weather normalized data. I think the first quarter of 2016 was mild, particularly March. And I don't know whether we pulled all of the weather impacts out appropriately in the first quarter of 2016. Correspondingly, the first quarter 2015 was very, very cold, and all of the weather was pulled out of that quarter as well, so you're comparing these to weather normalized periods, and it shows that the weather impact may not have been that significant. I suspect that it may not have been more mild than what we showed in the first quarter here, but I don't try to guess what that could be, so we just roll with the data. I'd like to look at the 12 months rolling more critically they are. We did, as we acknowledged it, it was a bit of a soft quarter, but I think a 12 month rolling numbers are in line with what we've been forecasting, and I would want to emphasize that in response to a relatively weak load, we have aggressively pursued our cost structure to offset that.

I'm very pleased with our solid first quarter financial results, our continued focus on operational performance and the progress we've made on our strategic portfolio transition and important growth initiatives.",1512,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm very pleased with our solid first quarter financial results, our continued focus on operational performance and the progress we've made on our strategic portfolio transition and important growth initiatives. I'll provide an update on our progress on these initiatives in just a moment.
First, let me begin with a few financial and operational highlights of the first quarter as summarized on Slide 4. This morning, we announced first quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $1.13. Results for our Regulated Utilities were modestly below our internal plan as a result of significant storm costs in the Carolinas, mild weather and weaker-than-expected customer volumes. We continue to see strong customer growth, and our 12month rolling average volumes continue to track consistently with our expectations. Operating results for our international business were in line with our expectations as hydrology began to return to more normal levels in Brazil. We also recognize tax adjustments at international during the quarter, which Steve will review in a moment.
As we look to the balance of the year, we are affirming our full year 2016 guidance range of $4.50 to $4.70 per share. Daily operational excellence continues to underpin our commitment to our customers, communities and investors. That commitment starts with our focus on safety. For 2015, Duke Energy's employee safety record received the top rank among large utilities as recognized by EEI. Our generation fleet also performed well during the quarter. Our nuclear fleet achieved a 95% capacity factor, building on its record-breaking performance in 2015. In Indiana, our Edwardsport IGCC facility continues to improve its operational performance. In February, the gasifiers achieved 100% availability, our best month ever.
Our growing natural gas fleet is also benefiting customers and the environment, taking advantage of low natural gas prices. In March of this year, our gas-fired plant set a record for monthly natural gas consumption, surpassing the record set last June. This is indicative of the strategic coal to gas shift in our generation portfolio, which has enabled us to reduce carbon emissions by 28% since 2005.
Our organization responded well to weather challenges in the first quarter. In January, winter storm Jonas, struck the Carolinas, causing approximately 600,000 customer outages. There were also ice and wind storms in February, impacting more than 500,000 customers in the Carolinas. Our teams performed admirably during these events, continuing to provide customers with the level of service they've come to expect.
Next, let me update you on our coal ash base and closure activities in the Carolinas. We continue to make outstanding progress, with closure activities underway at 6 sites. For each of our basins, the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality is required by statute to recommend risk classifications. Preliminary classifications were released at the end of January, followed by a public comment period. We expect DEQ to finalize their classification shortly. The risk classifications will impact basin closure methods, timing and costs. Based on our comprehensive engineering analysis of our basins, we believe the majority of the remaining unclassified basins meet the requirements for a low classification, allowing 15 years and closer methods, which include storing the ash in place. We are committed to safe basin closure in a way that protects our communities and the environment while minimizing cost to customers. We will keep you informed as the regulatory review process continues to advance.
Turning to Slide 5, I'll highlight several recent milestones and our important growth initiatives. Our 5-year capital plans for 2020 includes the deployment of between $25 billion and $30 billion in growth capital and new natural gas-fired generation, grid investments, commercial and regulated renewables and gas pipeline infrastructure. These investments are directed at improving customer service, modernizing our generation fleet and the electric grid as well as investing in natural gas infrastructure that is complementary to our system. These investments support our transition toward businesses that provide stable long-term growth in earnings and the dividend.
During the quarter, we received approval from the North Carolina Utilities Commission for our $1 billion Western Carolinas modernization project in Asheville. This allows us to move forward with retiring the Asheville coal plant by 2020 and replacing it with 2 highly efficient natural gas combined cycle units. In South Carolina, construction of our $700 million W.S. Lee natural gas combined cycle plant is well underway. The project is on budget and on target for a November 2017 in-service date. We also broke ground on our $1.5 billion natural gas-fired Citrus County combined cycle plant in Florida, staying on track for a 2018 in-service date. We're building on our success in growing our commercial and regulated renewable assets. In our Commercial portfolio, our 2 200-megawatt wind project, Los Vientos IV and Frontier, are on target to come online later this year.
Since the beginning of the year, we've announced the acquisition of 9 new solar projects, including 8 in North Carolina. In our Regulated Utilities, we've announced 100 megawatts of planned store installations for 2016 in the Carolinas, Florida and Indiana. That's all ready about 75% of what we achieved in 2015, which was a very strong year for solar investment. In fact, Duke Energy Progress was ranked third among all utilities in 2015 for bringing new solar capacity online. Additionally, as pictured on this slide, we recently completed an iconic solar farm to serve the power needs of Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando.
In the first quarter, we also made good progress in our grid modernization efforts. In March, we announced the settlement agreement with nearly all intervenors, including key consumer groups on our 7-year Indiana T&D infrastructure investment program. The $1.4 billion plan will provide much-needed technology and infrastructure upgrades that will benefit customers, providing improved reliability and safety, fewer and shorter power outages, better information and overall energy savings.
In addition, the settlement allows us to continue evaluating the installation of smart meters in our Indiana service territory, which would be eligible for recovery in a future rate case. The grid modernization hearings with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission began yesterday, and we expect a decision around midyear.
Our 2 commercial natural gas pipeline infrastructure projects, Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Sabal Trail, continue moving forward. Sabal Trail received FERC approval in February, and the pipeline is on-target to begin construction in the second quarter and be in operation in 2017. Atlantic Coast Pipeline is also progressing and has adopted several alternate routes, increasing the link to the pipeline from about 550 miles to just under 600 miles. The project partners recently submitted updated information related to these alternative grids as well as responses to all of FERC's outstanding environmental information requests. We're confident that FERC will soon be able to issue its draft environmental impact statement, the next important project milestone. And in fact, I believe that statement was issued this morning.
The project partners have devoted significant time and resources to ensure that the environmental issues have been fully addressed, and as a result, we've adjusted our expectation for receipt of the FERC's certificate to mid-2017. We are still planning for a late 2018 in-service date for the project.
Turning to Slide 6, I will address recent activities around the strategic transition of our overall business portfolio for the regulated and contracted electric and gas infrastructure businesses. The 2 strategic transactions highlighted on this slide will complete the realignment of our portfolio to focus entirely on domestic businesses, to drive more stable earnings and cash flows.
Let's start with our pending acquisition of Piedmont Natural Gas. In March, we received approval from the Tennessee Regulatory Authority for a change in control of an acquisition by Duke Energy. The final remaining approval was with the North Carolina Utilities Commission, which has scheduled hearings for July 18. We remain confident of closing the transaction before the end of this year. Additionally, at the end of February, we've successfully priced the common stock offering to fund the equity portion of the Piedmont acquisition. The $766 million offering was well received by our investors. As a reminder, the shares were offered in a forward structure. This means we will not issue the shares until the forward is settled at the time that Piedmont transaction closes.
We are also progressing on the planned exit of our Latin American generation business. We've begun initial steps in marketing the assets, including signing non-disclosure agreements and providing information to interested parties. This business includes high-quality assets, which we believe will attract significant interest for potential buyers. We will keep you updated on this important strategic transition.
In conclusion, I'm pleased with our financial results for the quarter and our progress in advancing our growth investments. We're also maintaining a sharp focus on operational excellence, which includes our commitment to safety and cost efficiency. Our business portfolio transition positions Duke as an industry leading domestic infrastructure business with stable transparent earnings and cash flows. We're looking forward to continuing our progress on this transition throughout 2016.
Now let me turn it over to Steve."

Before I begin, I'd like to take a moment to thank Bill Currens for his 7 years as a leader with the Investor Relations team. Bill's tireless commitment to delivering accurate transparent information to our analysts and investors has been outstanding. I will look forward to continuing to work with him in his new role as our Senior Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller. As many of you know, Mike Callahan is succeeding Bill as Vice President of Investor Relations. Currently, Mike serves as Director of Regulated Utilities Forecasting. He has also had extensive experience in treasury, financial planning and analysis and investor relations. We're delighted he's returning to IR to lead the team, where he will continue our efforts to serve our shareholders and investors.
Today, I'll focus on 4 primary areas. First, I'll discuss the major drivers of our first quarter results and provide an update to our full year adjusted EPS guidance range for 2016. I'll discuss our retail volume trends and the economic conditions within our service territories. I'll spend a few moments on the continued cost management efforts underway, and then I will close with a review of our key investor considerations.
Let's start with the quarterly results. I will cover the highlights on Slide 7. For more detailed information on segment variances versus last year, please refer to the supporting materials that accompany today's press release.
First quarter adjusted diluted earnings were $1.13 per share compared to $1.24 in the first quarter of 2015. The lower results in the current year reflect milder winter weather in 2016 and the absence of Midwest Generation results due to the successful sale of the business in April 2015. Additionally, in 2016, we incurred significant winter storm costs and somewhat softer retail volumes, which were offset by a tax adjustment at international.
On a reported basis, 2016 first quarter earnings per share were $1.01 compared to $1.22 last year. Let me briefly review key quarterly earnings drivers at each of our business segments. On an adjusted basis, Regulated Utilities results declined by $0.11 per share, principally driven by the milder weather in the Carolinas and Midwest. Higher revenues from pricing and riders in the Carolinas and Ohio were mostly offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense due to additional plant in service, including the acquisition of the NCEMPA assets in July 2015.
Additionally, we incurred higher O&M expense during the quarter as a result of winter storm costs in the Carolinas, which were higher than our planning assumptions by $0.05. Offsetting emergent storm expenses were lower outage costs and increased cost efficiencies throughout the organization. As expected, our Commercial portfolio declined by $0.11 per share in the first quarter of 2016, primarily due to the absence of the Midwest Generation business, which was sold in April of 2015. Our commercial renewables benefited from the improved levels of wind production this quarter and growth from new renewable projects. Other was down $0.06 per share, primarily due to prior year tax adjustments and higher interest expense in the quarter.
Moving to international. Operational performance, in particular in Brazil, strengthened during the quarter. Hydrology in Brazil has improved significantly during the recent rainy season. Reservoir levels in Southeast Brazil are approximately 60% compared to around 30% this time last year.
This improvement has resulted in increased hydro production throughout Brazil and lower purchase power costs to meet our contractual commitments. We also have $0.11 of favorable tax-related items associated with the international segment during the quarter, which represents the impact of several events.
You will recall in the fourth quarter of 2014, we declared a $2.7 billion dividend at international in order to efficiently bring funds back to the U.S. In early 2016, we announced our intent to exit the international business. This decision, combined with the extension of bonus depreciation by Congress in late 2015, allows us to more efficiently utilize foreign tax credits and reduce our U.S. income taxes. As a result of our intent to exit the international business, we will recognize additional U.S. income taxes for international up until the point of sale.
Overall, with our first quarter results, we remain on track to achieve our 2016 guidance range of between $4.50 to $4.70 per share.
Moving on to Slide 8, I'll now discuss our retail customer volume trends. On a rolling 12-month basis, weather-normalized retail loan growth was 0.7% through the first quarter. For the first quarter, our retail load growth trends were soft. Within the residential sector, we continue to experience strong growth in the number of new customers, approximately 1.3% over the recent 12 months. However, after moderating for most of 2015, residential customer usage trends have declined during the quarter due to the slow economic recovery and adoption of energy efficiency initiatives. Employment and wage growth trends continue to be favorable for the residential sector, along with the improving housing sector. The commercial and industrial classes continue to grow -- to show growth of 0.2% and 1.1%, respectively, over the rolling 12 months. The commercial sector continues to be supported by office vacancy rate declines, and job creation remains strong. Offsetting this growth is the governmental sector as many agencies face tighter budgets, elimination of jobs and adoption of energy efficiency measures.
As for the industrial sector, construction, automotives and textiles continued to show strength in the Carolinas and Midwest. Other industrial companies continue to reduce production as they work through unusually high inventory levels accumulated in 2015. However, the softer global economies and the stronger dollar is still impacting companies to compete globally such as steel and metals.
Our 12-month trends continue to track to our planning assumptions despite a weak first quarter. We will continue to closely monitor customer usage patterns as we progress through the year.
Moving to Slide 9. As we continue to position our company for a low load growth environment, I'd like to spend just a moment discussing the progress that we made in managing costs across the organizations. So far this year, absent the emerging storm costs, O&M is tracking favorable through the prior year, which is consistent with our expectations. We are focused on standardization of our operational processes in systems to manage our business much more efficiently. We are also continuing to take advantage of the flexibility and cost savings associated with the transition of our generation portfolio from coal to natural gas. Also, within our nuclear and fossil generation fleets, we are making changes in how we plan and execute our plant outages and how we utilize resources across our fleet. Although the nuclear promise is an industry-wide approach to controlling costs, activities are already underway within our nuclear fleet to drive out costs and place more discipline on capital allocation.
In our transmission and distribution businesses, we continue to pursue technology that not only provides greater reliability and information for our customers, but also helps control work volumes, metering costs and contractor needs.
I'll close with Slide 10, which summarizes our key investor considerations. Duke Energy has tremendous scale, offering an attractive investor value proposition, which includes balanced growth in earnings and dividends over time. As Lynn mentioned, we are making excellent progress on the acquisition of Piedmont and the exit of the international business. After the completion of this strategic transition, we will operate a portfolio that provides lower risk and higher-quality earnings and cash flows to support growth in both earnings and the dividend. Our strong capital plan includes the transition toward a lower-carbon future as we retire coal and build new efficient combined cycle natural gas and renewable resources.
We are excited about the growth opportunities for natural gas infrastructure across our service territories, particularly in the Southeast. Our electric grid investments allow us to deliver higher levels of reliability and offer new innovative products and services to our customers. Our dividend is very important to us. We continue to target annual growth in the dividend consistent with our long-term 4% to 6% earnings growth objective. Strong cash flows from our core businesses support our dividend. We are only one quarter into the year, but remain on track to achieve the $4.50 to $4.70, an adjusted earnings-per-share guidance range for 2016.
With that, let's open the line for your questions."

And we are going to be in a position to utilize more of our foreign tax credits, which is real economic benefit from the combination of the extension of bonus and the decision to exit. And so that economic benefit is being reflected in the first quarter. It does put us ahead of our first quarter plan on international as a result of that. But also, as we indicated in the script, we will begin recognizing tax expense because we will no longer be making the assertion that the proceeds do not come onshore, and that tax expense will be reflected over the balance of the year.

I commented on trackers in Indiana and Florida, but at some point, we'll address -- updating those rates as well.

Typically, outages from storms do not affect volumes very significantly, as one, point to make there when you're looking at the whole breadth of things. I would say that -- I always want to say this, when you're looking at a quarter, in particular, short periods of time, you have to be careful about weather-normalized data. I think the first quarter of 2016 was mild, particularly March. And I don't know whether we pulled all of the weather impacts out appropriately in the first quarter of 2016. Correspondingly, the first quarter of 2015 was very, very cold, and all of the weather was pulled out of that quarter as well, so you're comparing these 2 weather-normalized periods, and it shows that the weather impact may not have been that significant. I suspect that it may have been more mild than what we showed in the first quarter here, but I don't try to guess what that could be, so we just roll with the data. I'd like to look at the 12 months rolling more critically there are. We did, as we acknowledged it, it was a bit of a soft quarter, but I think the 12-month rolling numbers are in line with what we've been forecasting. And I would want to emphasize that in response to a relatively weak load, we have aggressively pursued our cost structure to offset that. That's part of our long-term plans."

And what Steve is commenting on is that standard methods can be impacted in periods where there's extreme temperatures, so extreme cold or extreme warm weather that we experienced in March. So that all leads us to look at longer time periods, so that we don't have those anomalies that could exist in any quarter. And that is really what has led us to this 12-month rolling average discussion on load because we think that is more indicative of trends we're experiencing.

I'm very pleased with our solid first quarter financial results, our continued focus on operational performance and the progress we've made on our strategic portfolio transition and important growth initiatives.",1510,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm very pleased with our solid first quarter financial results, our continued focus on operational performance and the progress we've made on our strategic portfolio transition and important growth initiatives. I'll provide an update on our progress on these initiatives in just a moment.
First, let me begin with a few financial and operational highlights of the first quarter as summarized on Slide 4. This morning, we announced first quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $1.13. Results for our Regulated Utilities were modestly below our internal plan as a result of significant storm costs in the Carolinas, mild weather and weaker-than-expected customer volumes. We continue to see strong customer growth, and our 12-month rolling average volumes continue to track consistently with our expectations. Operating results for our international business were in line with our expectations as hydrology began to return to more normal levels in Brazil. We also recognize tax adjustments at international during the quarter, which Steve will review in a moment.
As we look to the balance of the year, we are affirming our full year 2016 guidance range of $4.50 to $4.70 per share. Daily operational excellence continues to underpin our commitment to our customers, communities and investors. That commitment starts with our focus on safety. For 2015, Duke Energy's employee safety record received the top rank among large utilities as recognized by EEI. Our generation fleet also performed well during the quarter. Our nuclear fleet achieved a 95% capacity factor, building on its record-breaking performance in 2015. In Indiana, our Edwardsport IGCC facility continues to improve its operational performance. In February, the gasifiers achieved 100% availability, our best month ever.
Our growing natural gas fleet is also benefiting customers and the environment, taking advantage of low natural gas prices. In March of this year, our gas-fired plant set a record for monthly natural gas consumption, surpassing the record set last June. This is indicative of the strategic coal to gas shift in our generation portfolio, which has enabled us to reduce carbon emissions by 28% since 2005.
Our organization responded well to weather challenges in the first quarter. In January, winter storm Jonas, struck the Carolinas, causing approximately 600,000 customer outages. There were also ice and wind storms in February, impacting more than 500,000 customers in the Carolinas. Our teams performed admirably during these events, continuing to provide customers with the level of service they've come to expect.
Next, let me update you on our coal ash base and closure activities in the Carolinas. We continue to make outstanding progress, with closure activities underway at 6 sites. For each of our basins, the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality is required by statute to recommend risk classifications. Preliminary classifications were released at the end of January, followed by a public comment period. We expect DEQ to finalize their classification shortly. The risk classifications will impact basin closure methods, timing and costs. Based on our comprehensive engineering analysis of our basins, we believe the majority of the remaining unclassified basins meet the requirements for a low classification, allowing 15 years and closer methods, which include storing the ash in place. We are committed to safe basin closure in a way that protects our communities and the environment while minimizing cost to customers. We will keep you informed as the regulatory review process continues to advance.
Turning to Slide 5, I'll highlight several recent milestones in our important growth initiatives. Our 5-year capital plan through 2020 includes the deployment of between $25 billion and $30 billion in growth capital in new natural gas-fired generation, grid investments, commercial and regulated renewables and gas pipeline infrastructure. These investments are directed at improving customer service, modernizing our generation fleet and the electric grid as well as investing in natural gas infrastructure that is complementary to our system. These investments support our transition toward businesses that provide stable long-term growth in earnings and the dividend.
During the quarter, we received approval from the North Carolina Utilities Commission for our $1 billion Western Carolinas modernization project in Asheville. This allows us to move forward with retiring the Asheville coal plant by 2020 and replacing it with 2 highly efficient natural gas combined cycle units. In South Carolina, construction of our $700 million W.S. Lee natural gas combined cycle plant is well underway. The project is on budget and on target for a November 2017 in-service date. We also broke ground on our $1.5 billion natural gas-fired Citrus County combined cycle plant in Florida, staying on track for a 2018 in-service date. We're building on our success in growing our commercial and regulated renewable assets. In our Commercial portfolio, our 2 200-megawatt wind projects, Los Vientos IV and Frontier, are on target to come online later this year.
Since the beginning of the year, we've announced the acquisition of 9 new solar projects, including 8 in North Carolina. In our Regulated Utilities, we've announced 100 megawatts of planned solar installations for 2016 in the Carolinas, Florida and Indiana. That's already about 75% of what we achieved in 2015, which was a very strong year for solar investment. In fact, Duke Energy Progress was ranked third among all utilities in 2015 for bringing new solar capacity online. Additionally, as pictured on this slide, we recently completed an iconic solar farm to serve the power needs of Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando.
In the first quarter, we also made good progress in our grid modernization efforts. In March, we announced the settlement agreement with nearly all intervenors, including key consumer groups on our 7-year Indiana T&D infrastructure investment program. The $1.4 billion plan will provide much-needed technology and infrastructure upgrades that will benefit customers, providing improved reliability and safety, fewer and shorter power outages, better information and overall energy savings.
In addition, the settlement allows us to continue evaluating the installation of smart meters in our Indiana service territory, which would be eligible for recovery in a future rate case. The grid modernization hearings with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission began yesterday, and we expect a decision around midyear.
Our 2 commercial natural gas pipeline infrastructure projects, Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Sabal Trail, continue moving forward. Sabal Trail received FERC approval in February, and the pipeline is on-target to begin construction in the second quarter and be in operation in 2017. Atlantic Coast Pipeline is also progressing and has adopted several alternate routes, increasing the length to the pipeline from about 550 miles to just under 600 miles. The project partners recently submitted updated information related to these alternative routes as well as responses to all of FERC's outstanding environmental information requests. We're confident that FERC will soon be able to issue its draft environmental impact statement, the next important project milestone. And in fact, I believe that statement was issued this morning.
The project partners have devoted significant time and resources to ensure that the environmental issues have been fully addressed, and as a result, we've adjusted our expectation for receipt of the FERC's certificate to mid-2017. We are still planning for a late 2018 in-service date for the project.
Turning to Slide 6, I will address recent activities around the strategic transition of our overall business portfolio for the regulated and contracted electric and gas infrastructure businesses. The 2 strategic transactions highlighted on this slide will complete the realignment of our portfolio to focus entirely on domestic businesses, to drive more stable earnings and cash flows.
Let's start with our pending acquisition of Piedmont Natural Gas. In March, we received approval from the Tennessee Regulatory Authority for a change in control upon acquisition by Duke Energy. The final remaining approval was with the North Carolina Utilities Commission, which has scheduled hearings for July 18. We remain confident of closing the transaction before the end of this year. Additionally, at the end of February, we've successfully priced a common stock offering to fund the equity portion of the Piedmont acquisition. The $766 million offering was well received by our investors. As a reminder, the shares were offered in a forward structure. This means we will not issue the shares until the forward is settled at the time that Piedmont transaction closes.
We are also progressing on the planned exit of our Latin American generation business. We've begun initial steps in marketing the assets, including signing non-disclosure agreements and providing information to interested parties. This business includes high-quality assets, which we believe will attract significant interest from potential buyers. We will keep you updated on this important strategic transition.
In conclusion, I'm pleased with our financial results for the quarter and our progress in advancing our growth investments. We're also maintaining a sharp focus on operational excellence, which includes our commitment to safety and cost efficiency. Our business portfolio transition positions Duke as an industry leading domestic infrastructure business with stable transparent earnings and cash flows. We're looking forward to continuing our progress on this transition throughout 2016.
Now let me turn it over to Steve."

Before I begin, I'd like to take a moment to thank Bill Currens for his 7 years as a leader with the Investor Relations team. Bill's tireless commitment to delivering accurate transparent information to our analysts and investors has been outstanding. I will look forward to continuing to work with him in his new role as our Senior Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller. As many of you know, Mike Callahan is succeeding Bill as Vice President of Investor Relations. Currently, Mike serves as Director of Regulated Utilities Forecasting. He has also had extensive experience in treasury, financial planning and analysis and investor relations. We're delighted he's returning to IR to lead the team, where he will continue our efforts to serve our shareholders and investors.
Today, I'll focus on 4 primary areas. First, I'll discuss the major drivers of our first quarter results and provide an update to our full year adjusted EPS guidance range for 2016. I'll discuss our retail volume trends and the economic conditions within our service territories. I'll spend a few moments on the continued cost management efforts underway, and then I will close with a review of our key investor considerations.
Let's start with the quarterly results. I will cover the highlights on Slide 7. For more detailed information on segment variances versus last year, please refer to the supporting materials that accompany today's press release.
First quarter adjusted diluted earnings were $1.13 per share compared to $1.24 in the first quarter of 2015. The lower results in the current year reflect milder winter weather in 2016 and the absence of Midwest Generation results due to the successful sale of the business in April 2015. Additionally, in 2016, we incurred significant winter storm costs and somewhat softer retail volumes, which were offset by a tax adjustment at international.
On a reported basis, 2016 first quarter earnings per share were $1.01 compared to $1.22 last year. Let me briefly review key quarterly earnings drivers at each of our business segments. On an adjusted basis, Regulated Utilities results declined by $0.11 per share, principally driven by the milder weather in the Carolinas and Midwest. Higher revenues from pricing and riders in the Carolinas and Ohio were mostly offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense due to additional plant in-service, including the acquisition of the NCEMPA assets in July 2015.
Additionally, we incurred higher O&M expense during the quarter as a result of winter storm costs in the Carolinas, which were higher than our planning assumptions by $0.05. Offsetting emergent storm expenses were lower outage costs and increased cost efficiencies throughout the organization. As expected, our Commercial portfolio declined by $0.11 per share in the first quarter of 2016, primarily due to the absence of the Midwest Generation business, which was sold in April of 2015. Our commercial renewables benefited from improved levels of wind production this quarter and growth from new renewable projects. Other was down $0.06 per share, primarily due to prior year tax adjustments and higher interest expense in the quarter.
Moving to international. Operational performance, in particular in Brazil, strengthened during the quarter. Hydrology in Brazil has improved significantly during the recent rainy season. Reservoir levels in Southeast Brazil are approximately 60% compared to around 30% this time last year.
This improvement has resulted in increased hydro production throughout Brazil and lower purchase power costs to meet our contractual commitments. We also have $0.11 of favorable tax-related items associated with the international segment during the quarter, which represents the impact of several events.
You will recall in the fourth quarter of 2014, we declared a $2.7 billion dividend at international in order to efficiently bring funds back to the U.S. In early 2016, we announced our intent to exit the international business. This decision, combined with the extension of bonus depreciation by Congress in late 2015, allows us to more efficiently utilize foreign tax credits and reduce our U.S. income taxes. As a result of our intent to exit the international business, we will recognize additional U.S. income taxes for international up until the point of sale.
Overall, with our first quarter results, we remain on track to achieve our 2016 guidance range of between $4.50 to $4.70 per share.
Moving on to Slide 8, I'll now discuss our retail customer volume trends. On a rolling 12-month basis, weather-normalized retail load growth was 0.7% through the first quarter. For the first quarter, our retail load growth trends were soft. Within the residential sector, we continue to experience strong growth in the number of new customers, approximately 1.3% over the recent 12 months. However, after moderating for most of 2015, residential customer usage trends have declined during the quarter due to the slow economic recovery and adoption of energy efficiency initiatives. Employment and wage growth trends continue to be favorable for the residential sector, along with the improving housing sector. The commercial and industrial classes continue to grow -- to show growth of 0.2% and 1.1%, respectively, over the rolling 12 months. The commercial sector continues to be supported by office vacancy rate declines, and job creation remains strong. Offsetting this growth is the governmental sector as many agencies face tighter budgets, elimination of jobs and adoption of energy efficiency measures.
As for the industrial sector, construction, automotives and textiles continued to show strength in the Carolinas and Midwest. Other industrial companies continue to reduce production as they work through unusually high inventory levels accumulated in 2015. However, the softer global economies and the stronger dollar is still impacting companies that compete globally such as steel and metals.
Our 12-month trends continue to track to our planning assumptions despite a weak first quarter. We will continue to closely monitor customer usage patterns as we progress through the year.
Moving to Slide 9. As we continue to position our company for a low load growth environment, I'd like to spend just a moment discussing the progress that we made in managing costs across the organization. So far this year, absent the emerging storm costs, O&M is tracking favorable to the prior year, which is consistent with our expectations. We are focused on standardization of our operational processes and systems to manage our business much more efficiently. We are also continuing to take advantage of the flexibility and cost savings associated with the transition of our generation portfolio from coal to natural gas. Also, within our nuclear and fossil generation fleets, we are making changes in how we plan and execute our plant outages and how we utilize resources across our fleet. Although the nuclear promise is an industry-wide approach to controlling costs, activities are already underway within our nuclear fleet to drive out costs and place more discipline on capital allocation.
In our transmission and distribution businesses, we continue to pursue technology that not only provides greater reliability and information for our customers, but also helps control work volumes, metering costs and contractor needs.
I'll close with Slide 10, which summarizes our key investor considerations. Duke Energy has tremendous scale, offering an attractive investor value proposition, which includes balanced growth in earnings and dividends over time. As Lynn mentioned, we are making excellent progress on the acquisition of Piedmont and the exit of the international business. After the completion of this strategic transition, we will operate a portfolio that provides lower risk and higher-quality earnings and cash flows to support growth in both earnings and the dividend. Our strong capital plan includes the transition toward a lower-carbon future as we retire coal and build new efficient combined cycle natural gas and renewable resources.
We are excited about the growth opportunities for natural gas infrastructure across our service territories, particularly in the Southeast. Our electric grid investments allow us to deliver higher levels of reliability and offer new innovative products and services to our customers. Our dividend is very important to us. We continue to target annual growth in the dividend consistent with our long-term 4% to 6% earnings growth objective. Strong cash flows from our core businesses support our dividend. We are only one quarter into the year but  remain on track to achieve the $4.50 to $4.70, an adjusted earnings-per-share guidance range for 2016.
With that, let's open the line for your questions."

And we are going to be in a position to utilize more of our foreign tax credits, which is real economic benefit from the combination of the extension of bonus and the decision to exit. And so that economic benefit is being reflected in the first quarter. It does put us ahead of our first quarter plan on international as a result of that. But also, as we indicated in the script, we will begin recognizing tax expense because we will no longer be making the assertion that the proceeds do not come onshore, and that tax expense will be reflected over the balance of the year.

Typically, outages from storms do not affect volumes very significantly, as one point to make there, when you're looking at the whole breadth of things. I would say that -- I always want to say this, when you're looking at a quarter, in particular, short periods of time, you have to be careful about weather-normalized data. I think the first quarter of 2016 was mild, particularly March. And I don't know whether we pulled all of the weather impacts out appropriately in the first quarter of 2016. Correspondingly, the first quarter of 2015 was very, very cold, and I don't know whether all of the weather was pulled out of that quarter as well, so you're comparing these 2 weather-normalized periods, and it shows that the weather impact may not have been that significant. I suspect that it may have been more mild than what we showed in the first quarter here, but I don't try to guess at what that could be, so we just roll with the data. I'd like to look at the 12 months rolling more critically there. We did, as we acknowledged it, it was a bit of a soft quarter, but I think the 12-month rolling numbers are in line with what we've been forecasting. And I would want to emphasize that in response to a relatively weak load, we have aggressively pursued our cost structure to offset that. That's part of our long-term plans."

267850,330241154,971817,"Duke Energy Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 03, 2016",2016-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Duke Energy Corporation","Executives","Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm very pleased with our solid first quarter financial results, our continued focus on operational performance and the progress we've made on our strategic portfolio transition and important growth initiatives.",1510,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm very pleased with our solid first quarter financial results, our continued focus on operational performance and the progress we've made on our strategic portfolio transition and important growth initiatives. I'll provide an update on our progress on these initiatives in just a moment.
First, let me begin with a few financial and operational highlights of the first quarter as summarized on Slide 4. This morning, we announced first quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $1.13. Results for our Regulated Utilities were modestly below our internal plan as a result of significant storm costs in the Carolinas, mild weather and weaker-than-expected customer volumes. We continue to see strong customer growth, and our 12-month rolling average volumes continue to track consistently with our expectations. Operating results for our international business were in line with our expectations as hydrology began to return to more normal levels in Brazil. We also recognize tax adjustments at international during the quarter, which Steve will review in a moment.
As we look to the balance of the year, we are affirming our full year 2016 guidance range of $4.50 to $4.70 per share. Daily operational excellence continues to underpin our commitment to our customers, communities and investors. That commitment starts with our focus on safety. For 2015, Duke Energy's employee safety record received the top rank among large utilities as recognized by EEI. Our generation fleet also performed well during the quarter. Our nuclear fleet achieved a 95% capacity factor, building on its record-breaking performance in 2015. In Indiana, our Edwardsport IGCC facility continues to improve its operational performance. In February, the gasifiers achieved 100% availability, our best month ever.
Our growing natural gas fleet is also benefiting customers and the environment, taking advantage of low natural gas prices. In March of this year, our gas-fired plant set a record for monthly natural gas consumption, surpassing the record set last June. This is indicative of the strategic coal to gas shift in our generation portfolio, which has enabled us to reduce carbon emissions by 28% since 2005.
Our organization responded well to weather challenges in the first quarter. In January, winter storm Jonas, struck the Carolinas, causing approximately 600,000 customer outages. There were also ice and wind storms in February, impacting more than 500,000 customers in the Carolinas. Our teams performed admirably during these events, continuing to provide customers with the level of service they've come to expect.
Next, let me update you on our coal ash base and closure activities in the Carolinas. We continue to make outstanding progress, with closure activities underway at 6 sites. For each of our basins, the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality is required by statute to recommend risk classifications. Preliminary classifications were released at the end of January, followed by a public comment period. We expect DEQ to finalize their classification shortly. The risk classifications will impact basin closure methods, timing and costs. Based on our comprehensive engineering analysis of our basins, we believe the majority of the remaining unclassified basins meet the requirements for a low classification, allowing 15 years and closer methods, which include storing the ash in place. We are committed to safe basin closure in a way that protects our communities and the environment while minimizing cost to customers. We will keep you informed as the regulatory review process continues to advance.
Turning to Slide 5, I'll highlight several recent milestones in our important growth initiatives. Our 5-year capital plan through 2020 includes the deployment of between $25 billion and $30 billion in growth capital in new natural gas-fired generation, grid investments, commercial and regulated renewables and gas pipeline infrastructure. These investments are directed at improving customer service, modernizing our generation fleet and the electric grid as well as investing in natural gas infrastructure that is complementary to our system. These investments support our transition toward businesses that provide stable long-term growth in earnings and the dividend.
During the quarter, we received approval from the North Carolina Utilities Commission for our $1 billion Western Carolinas modernization project in Asheville. This allows us to move forward with retiring the Asheville coal plant by 2020 and replacing it with 2 highly efficient natural gas combined cycle units. In South Carolina, construction of our $700 million W.S. Lee natural gas combined cycle plant is well underway. The project is on budget and on target for a November 2017 in-service date. We also broke ground on our $1.5 billion natural gas-fired Citrus County combined cycle plant in Florida, staying on track for a 2018 in-service date. We're building on our success in growing our commercial and regulated renewable assets. In our Commercial portfolio, our 2 200-megawatt wind projects, Los Vientos IV and Frontier, are on target to come online later this year.
Since the beginning of the year, we've announced the acquisition of 9 new solar projects, including 8 in North Carolina. In our Regulated Utilities, we've announced 100 megawatts of planned solar installations for 2016 in the Carolinas, Florida and Indiana. That's already about 75% of what we achieved in 2015, which was a very strong year for solar investment. In fact, Duke Energy Progress was ranked third among all utilities in 2015 for bringing new solar capacity online. Additionally, as pictured on this slide, we recently completed an iconic solar farm to serve the power needs of Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando.
In the first quarter, we also made good progress in our grid modernization efforts. In March, we announced the settlement agreement with nearly all intervenors, including key consumer groups on our 7-year Indiana T&D infrastructure investment program. The $1.4 billion plan will provide much-needed technology and infrastructure upgrades that will benefit customers, providing improved reliability and safety, fewer and shorter power outages, better information and overall energy savings.
In addition, the settlement allows us to continue evaluating the installation of smart meters in our Indiana service territory, which would be eligible for recovery in a future rate case. The grid modernization hearings with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission began yesterday, and we expect a decision around midyear.
Our 2 commercial natural gas pipeline infrastructure projects, Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Sabal Trail, continue moving forward. Sabal Trail received FERC approval in February, and the pipeline is on-target to begin construction in the second quarter and be in operation in 2017. Atlantic Coast Pipeline is also progressing and has adopted several alternate routes, increasing the length to the pipeline from about 550 miles to just under 600 miles. The project partners recently submitted updated information related to these alternative routes as well as responses to all of FERC's outstanding environmental information requests. We're confident that FERC will soon be able to issue its draft environmental impact statement, the next important project milestone. And in fact, I believe that statement was issued this morning.
The project partners have devoted significant time and resources to ensure that the environmental issues have been fully addressed, and as a result, we've adjusted our expectation for receipt of the FERC's certificate to mid-2017. We are still planning for a late 2018 in-service date for the project.
Turning to Slide 6, I will address recent activities around the strategic transition of our overall business portfolio for the regulated and contracted electric and gas infrastructure businesses. The 2 strategic transactions highlighted on this slide will complete the realignment of our portfolio to focus entirely on domestic businesses, to drive more stable earnings and cash flows.
Let's start with our pending acquisition of Piedmont Natural Gas. In March, we received approval from the Tennessee Regulatory Authority for a change in control upon acquisition by Duke Energy. The final remaining approval was with the North Carolina Utilities Commission, which has scheduled hearings for July 18. We remain confident of closing the transaction before the end of this year. Additionally, at the end of February, we've successfully priced a common stock offering to fund the equity portion of the Piedmont acquisition. The $766 million offering was well received by our investors. As a reminder, the shares were offered in a forward structure. This means we will not issue the shares until the forward is settled at the time that Piedmont transaction closes.
We are also progressing on the planned exit of our Latin American generation business. We've begun initial steps in marketing the assets, including signing non-disclosure agreements and providing information to interested parties. This business includes high-quality assets, which we believe will attract significant interest from potential buyers. We will keep you updated on this important strategic transition.
In conclusion, I'm pleased with our financial results for the quarter and our progress in advancing our growth investments. We're also maintaining a sharp focus on operational excellence, which includes our commitment to safety and cost efficiency. Our business portfolio transition positions Duke as an industry leading domestic infrastructure business with stable transparent earnings and cash flows. We're looking forward to continuing our progress on this transition throughout 2016.
Now let me turn it over to Steve."

Before I begin, I'd like to take a moment to thank Bill Currens for his 7 years as a leader with the Investor Relations team. Bill's tireless commitment to delivering accurate transparent information to our analysts and investors has been outstanding. I will look forward to continuing to work with him in his new role as our Senior Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller. As many of you know, Mike Callahan is succeeding Bill as Vice President of Investor Relations. Currently, Mike serves as Director of Regulated Utilities Forecasting. He has also had extensive experience in treasury, financial planning and analysis and investor relations. We're delighted he's returning to IR to lead the team, where he will continue our efforts to serve our shareholders and investors.
Today, I'll focus on 4 primary areas. First, I'll discuss the major drivers of our first quarter results and provide an update to our full year adjusted EPS guidance range for 2016. I'll discuss our retail volume trends and the economic conditions within our service territories. I'll spend a few moments on the continued cost management efforts underway, and then I will close with a review of our key investor considerations.
Let's start with the quarterly results. I will cover the highlights on Slide 7. For more detailed information on segment variances versus last year, please refer to the supporting materials that accompany today's press release.
First quarter adjusted diluted earnings were $1.13 per share compared to $1.24 in the first quarter of 2015. The lower results in the current year reflect milder winter weather in 2016 and the absence of Midwest Generation results due to the successful sale of the business in April 2015. Additionally, in 2016, we incurred significant winter storm costs and somewhat softer retail volumes, which were offset by a tax adjustment at international.
On a reported basis, 2016 first quarter earnings per share were $1.01 compared to $1.22 last year. Let me briefly review key quarterly earnings drivers at each of our business segments. On an adjusted basis, Regulated Utilities results declined by $0.11 per share, principally driven by the milder weather in the Carolinas and Midwest. Higher revenues from pricing and riders in the Carolinas and Ohio were mostly offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense due to additional plant in-service, including the acquisition of the NCEMPA assets in July 2015.
Additionally, we incurred higher O&M expense during the quarter as a result of winter storm costs in the Carolinas, which were higher than our planning assumptions by $0.05. Offsetting emergent storm expenses were lower outage costs and increased cost efficiencies throughout the organization. As expected, our Commercial portfolio declined by $0.11 per share in the first quarter of 2016, primarily due to the absence of the Midwest Generation business, which was sold in April of 2015. Our commercial renewables benefited from improved levels of wind production this quarter and growth from new renewable projects. Other was down $0.06 per share, primarily due to prior year tax adjustments and higher interest expense in the quarter.
Moving to international. Operational performance, in particular in Brazil, strengthened during the quarter. Hydrology in Brazil has improved significantly during the recent rainy season. Reservoir levels in Southeast Brazil are approximately 60% compared to around 30% this time last year.
This improvement has resulted in increased hydro production throughout Brazil and lower purchase power costs to meet our contractual commitments. We also have $0.11 of favorable tax-related items associated with the international segment during the quarter, which represents the impact of several events.
You will recall in the fourth quarter of 2014, we declared a $2.7 billion dividend at international in order to efficiently bring funds back to the U.S. In early 2016, we announced our intent to exit the international business. This decision, combined with the extension of bonus depreciation by Congress in late 2015, allows us to more efficiently utilize foreign tax credits and reduce our U.S. income taxes. As a result of our intent to exit the international business, we will recognize additional U.S. income taxes for international up until the point of sale.
Overall, with our first quarter results, we remain on track to achieve our 2016 guidance range of between $4.50 to $4.70 per share.
Moving on to Slide 8, I'll now discuss our retail customer volume trends. On a rolling 12-month basis, weather-normalized retail load growth was 0.7% through the first quarter. For the first quarter, our retail load growth trends were soft. Within the residential sector, we continue to experience strong growth in the number of new customers, approximately 1.3% over the recent 12 months. However, after moderating for most of 2015, residential customer usage trends have declined during the quarter due to the slow economic recovery and adoption of energy efficiency initiatives. Employment and wage growth trends continue to be favorable for the residential sector, along with the improving housing sector. The commercial and industrial classes continue to grow -- to show growth of 0.2% and 1.1%, respectively, over the rolling 12 months. The commercial sector continues to be supported by office vacancy rate declines, and job creation remains strong. Offsetting this growth is the governmental sector as many agencies face tighter budgets, elimination of jobs and adoption of energy efficiency measures.
As for the industrial sector, construction, automotives and textiles continued to show strength in the Carolinas and Midwest. Other industrial companies continue to reduce production as they work through unusually high inventory levels accumulated in 2015. However, the softer global economies and the stronger dollar is still impacting companies that compete globally such as steel and metals.
Our 12-month trends continue to track to our planning assumptions despite a weak first quarter. We will continue to closely monitor customer usage patterns as we progress through the year.
Moving to Slide 9. As we continue to position our company for a low load growth environment, I'd like to spend just a moment discussing the progress that we made in managing costs across the organization. So far this year, absent the emerging storm costs, O&M is tracking favorable to the prior year, which is consistent with our expectations. We are focused on standardization of our operational processes and systems to manage our business much more efficiently. We are also continuing to take advantage of the flexibility and cost savings associated with the transition of our generation portfolio from coal to natural gas. Also, within our nuclear and fossil generation fleets, we are making changes in how we plan and execute our plant outages and how we utilize resources across our fleet. Although the nuclear promise is an industry-wide approach to controlling costs, activities are already underway within our nuclear fleet to drive out costs and place more discipline on capital allocation.
In our transmission and distribution businesses, we continue to pursue technology that not only provides greater reliability and information for our customers, but also helps control work volumes, metering costs and contractor needs.
I'll close with Slide 10, which summarizes our key investor considerations. Duke Energy has tremendous scale, offering an attractive investor value proposition, which includes balanced growth in earnings and dividends over time. As Lynn mentioned, we are making excellent progress on the acquisition of Piedmont and the exit of the international business. After the completion of this strategic transition, we will operate a portfolio that provides lower risk and higher-quality earnings and cash flows to support growth in both earnings and the dividend. Our strong capital plan includes the transition toward a lower-carbon future as we retire coal and build new efficient combined cycle natural gas and renewable resources.
We are excited about the growth opportunities for natural gas infrastructure across our service territories, particularly in the Southeast. Our electric grid investments allow us to deliver higher levels of reliability and offer new innovative products and services to our customers. Our dividend is very important to us. We continue to target annual growth in the dividend consistent with our long-term 4% to 6% earnings growth objective. Strong cash flows from our core businesses support our dividend. We are only one quarter into the year but remain on track to achieve the $4.50 to $4.70, an adjusted earnings-per-share guidance range for 2016.
With that, let's open the line for your questions."

So coming into this year, we had the extension of bonus depreciation and then the planned announcement of the exit of international, put us in a position where we could relook at the tax consequences of a sale of the business. And we are going to be in a position to utilize more of our foreign tax credits, which is real economic benefit from the combination of the extension of bonus and the decision to exit. And so that economic benefit is being reflected in the first quarter. It does put us ahead of our first quarter plan on international as a result of that. But also, as we indicated in the script, we will begin recognizing tax expense because we will no longer be making the assertion that the proceeds do not come onshore, and that tax expense will be reflected over the balance of the year. So ahead of plan, through the first quarter, good economic benefit from the tax planning that the team has accomplished here, and I'll turn it to Steve to talk about effective tax rate."

Typically, outages from storms do not affect volumes very significantly, as one point to make there, when you're looking at the whole breadth of things. I would say that -- I always want to say this, when you're looking at a quarter, in particular, short periods of time, you have to be careful about weather-normalized data. I think the first quarter of 2016 was mild, particularly March. And I don't know whether we pulled all of the weather impacts out appropriately in the first quarter of 2016. Correspondingly, the first quarter of 2015 was very, very cold, and I don't know whether all of the weather was pulled out of that quarter as well, so you're comparing these 2 weather-normalized periods, and it shows that the weather impact may not have been that significant. I suspect that it may have been more mild than what we showed in the first quarter here, but I don't try to guess at what that could be, so we just roll with the data. I'd like to look at the 12 months rolling more critically there. We did, as we acknowledged it, it was a bit of a soft quarter, but I think the 12-month rolling numbers are in line with what we've been forecasting. And I would want to emphasize that in response to a relatively weak load, we have aggressively pursued our cost structure to offset that. That's part of our long-term plans."

So that all leads us to look at longer time periods, so that we don't have those anomalies that could exist in any quarter. And that is really what has led us to this 12-month rolling average discussion on load because we think that is more indicative of trends we're experiencing. And as you can imagine, we watch this really closely and manage the business for a low load growth environment."

Let me start on Slide 4 and express how pleased I am with our financial results this quarter.  This morning, we announced second quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $1.07, an increase of $0.12 from the prior year. We generated higher adjusted earnings with strong results at our Regulated Utilities, which gives us confidence to reaffirm our full year guidance for 2016. 
We also demonstrated our confidence in the strength of our core businesses with the recent increase in our dividend. We have consistently paid a dividend for 90 years, which extends our commitment to this key part of our total shareholder return proposition. 
We accomplished strong results this quarter, while continuing to build our domestic energy infrastructure business, as you can see on Slide 5. Let's start with our pending acquisition of Piedmont Natural Gas. This acquisition and expansion of our natural gas infrastructure platform supports our transition to a lower carbon future. In June, Duke Energy and Piedmont reached constructive settlement agreements with the North Carolina Public staff and other key intervenors. The settlement provide clear benefits to customers and communities. In July, the North Carolina Utilities Commission held a hearing to review the proposed acquisition. The acquisition review will be fully briefed on August 25 when proposed orders are due from all parties. There is no statutory time frame for the commission to act, and we won't speculate on their timing. However, integration efforts are going well, and we will be opportunistic with our remaining acquisition financing, such that we are prepared to close the transaction when all closing conditions are met. We remain confident of closing the transaction by the end of this year and possibly earlier.
In addition, we are proceeding as planned with our process to exit the Latin American generation business. We've received strong interest from a variety of parties. We have since invited a select group of bidders to participate in detailed due diligence, including management presentations and site visits for the purpose of providing final bids. We will continue to provide updates as we move through this process.
Turning to Slide 6, I'll provide you with a brief update on our progress executing our $30 billion strategic growth capital plan. Our vision is to invest capital and smarter energy solutions that generate cleaner energy and modernize the grid, creating value for our customers and delivering earnings and dividend growth for our shareholders. 
Our major generation projects continued to move forward as planned, remaining on time and on budget. In South Carolina, construction of our $600 million natural gas combined cycle plant is progressing well toward a November 2017 in-service date. In Florida, construction has begun in our $1.5 billion Citrus County combined cycle plant. And our uprates at Heinz are on target for an October 1 in-service date. 
In addition, we continued to add solar to our regulated generation portfolio. In May, the NCUC approved 2 new solar projects totaling 5 megawatts in our Duke Energy Carolinas service territory. Both of these projects are expected to be online in the first quarter of 2017.
In Indiana, the regulatory commission approved our 70-megawatt solar plant at the Crane Naval Station, the second largest solar power plant in the state. Per Indiana statute, we will recover 100% of the cost of the project by a clean energy investment rider. 
We also had several positive developments regarding our grid modernization efforts. On June 29, the Indiana Commission approved our previously filed settlement agreement for our 7-year $1.4 billion plan to build a smarter energy infrastructure, which is now underway. In Kentucky, we filed a request to deploy smart meters in our service territory; while in South Carolina, we received an accounting order from the commission allowing Duke Energy Carolinas to defer the costs smart meter investments until the next rate case. These programs will provide much-needed technology and infrastructure update. They build up on our progress in investing in the energy grid and will benefit customers with improved reliability and safety, fewer and shorter power outages and overall energy savings.
Shifting to our commercial portfolio, we continued to advance our 2 natural gas pipeline projects, Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Sabal Trail. expect to receive FERC's notice of scheduled for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline soon. We still anticipate a FERC order allowing construction to begin by mid-2017, keeping the project on target for a late 2018 in-service date. Meanwhile, you might recall that Sabal Trail got FERC approval on February this year. Preconstruction work is underway with construction expected to begin in late summer. The project remains on target to be in operation in mid-2017.
We also had success this quarter growing our commercial renewables fleet. Our 200-megawatt Los Vientos IV wind project achieved commercial operation in July, a month ahead of schedule. Our 200-megawatt Frontier wind project remains on target to begin serving customers later this year. With the acquisition of 55 megawatts of new solar projects, we have 2 additional projects in North Carolina and our first in New Mexico. By year-end, we expect our commercial renewable footprint to be approximately 3,000 megawatts.
Turning to Slide 7, let me update you on the significant progress we made during the quarter on coal ash basin closure. As we have previously discussed, our work is underway to close basins at 7 sites in the Carolinas, including 2 sites in South Carolina. For our remaining North Carolina basins in the second quarter, we received updated rankings from the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality. The rankings establish closure methods, time frames and ultimately costs. They also highlighted the need for additional time to complete ongoing dam improvement activities and collect additional scientific and engineering data to appropriately rank and safely close the basin. 
In response, North Carolina adopted House Bill 630 to strengthen the 2014 Coal Ash Management Act. The legislation provides important clarifications, keeping final authority for coal ash oversight with the state environmental regulators and outlining a path to low classifications for many of our basins, which allows for a range of closure options, including capping the material in place. It also requires the completion of the dam improvement activities and providing access to a permanent alternative drinking water supply for residents. This removes any concerns for plant neighbors about potential impacts to their surrounding private drinking wells. 
In addition, the legislation directs the construction of ash reprocessing facilities at 3 sites to make the material suitable for use in concrete. We support recycling ash, which is the only way to avoid permanent storage of this useful construction material. 
time frames outlined in new legislation are generally consistent with the requirements of the federal coal combustion residual or CCR rule. And work is underway to meet the requirements in the CCR rule and the North Carolina legislation. new law in North Carolina does not materially affect our current estimated costs for basin closure, and we remain committed to save sustainable long-term solutions for coal ash across all of our jurisdictions.
Moving to Indiana, we filed a testimony in June to support our first petition to recover approximately $400 million in costs associated with the federal CCR rule. Our petition requests that these costs to drive bottom ash conversion projects be recovered under the Indiana federal mandate statute. This statute provides for 80% recovery of project costs through a rider and 20% deferred until the next rate case. Hearings are scheduled for November, and we could receive an order by mid-2017.
Finally, in July we filed a request in Kentucky for a certificate of public convenience and necessity to construct a $23 million dry bottom ash handling system at our station. 
Before I turn it over to Steve, I'd like to highlight on Slide 8 several of our recent operational accomplishments made possible by the dedication of our employees. Our strong generation fleet performance has persisted through the second quarter. Year-to-date, our nuclear fleet has achieved a 96% capacity factor. in the Carolinas, our team set a new record for shortest outage time, an improvement of 10% over the prior period. In June, the company was recognized by EII with the association's Emergency Recovery Award for our outstanding power restoration efforts in the Carolinas following winter storm Jonas earlier this year. These efforts were again on display in response to the approximately 550,000 outages caused by tropical storm Colin in Florida in June and storms in the Midwest and Carolinas in June and early July. In each of these storms, our teams worked diligently and safely, both day and night, to restore service as quickly as possible, and I commend their commitments to meeting our customers' needs 24/7.
Also, in June we exceeded $687 million guaranteed fuel dispatch merger savings, providing a significant benefit to our Carolinas customers as a result of the 2012 Duke and Progress Energy merger. The efforts of our team allowed us to get this important milestone a full year ahead of our original commitment.
In conclusion, I'm pleased with our financial results for the quarter and our progress in advancing our strategic initiatives, as we invest in cleaner and smarter energy solutions for our customers and deliver growth for our investors. We are maintaining a sharp focus in operational excellence, which includes our commitment to safety and cost efficiency. Our portfolio transition enhances Duke's position as the industry-leading domestic infrastructure business with stable transparent earnings and cash flows. We look forward to completing this transaction. 
Now let me turn it over to Steve."
267850,373717172,1024888,"Duke Energy Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Duke Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lynn. As Lynn mentioned, we are pleased with our strong quarter.

L",1543,"Thanks, Lynn. As Lynn mentioned, we are pleased with our strong quarter. Given the results through the first half of the year, we remain on track to achieve and today have reaffirmed our full year 2016 guidance range of between $4.50 to $4.70 per share. Let me walk you through some of the key drivers for the quarter as well as provide updates on retail volume trends within our service territories and regulatory activity underway in our jurisdictions.
I'll start with the quarterly results on Slide 9. For more detailed information on segment variances versus last year and a reconciliation of reported results to adjusted results, please refer to the supporting materials that accompany today's press release and presentation. 
On a reported our GAAP basis, 2016 second quarter earnings per share were $0.74 compared to $0.78 last year and were impacted by an impairment in Central America. Due to the continued advancement of our process to exit the Latin American generation business and the increased probability of sale, we evaluated the carrying value of the asset groups within International Energy. We determined that certain assets in Central America were impaired. And as a result, we recognized a pretax charge of $194 million. In addition to this impairment, costs related to mergers and savings initiatives were also special items that have been excluded from our adjusted EPS results. 
Let me now discuss our adjusted quarterly earnings in key drivers at each of our business segments.  Second quarter adjusted diluted earnings were $1.07 per share compared to $0.95 in the second quarter of 2015. Regulated Utilities quarterly adjusted results increased by $0.13 per share despite less favorable weather. This was primarily driven by higher pricing and riders. We also realized higher wholesale margins, primarily due to the long-term contract associated with the NCEMPA acquisition in the prior year. In addition, reduced outage costs and ongoing cost management efforts enabled us to further reduce our O&M in the quarter. Even with 6 cents in higher storm-related costs year-to-date, our focus on operational efficiencies and cost savings initiatives position us to achieve our full year O&M reduction target and helps us -- helps position us to maintain a flat O&M cost structure through 2020. 
Commercial Portfolio results increased by $0.01 per share in the second quarter. The higher results were largely driven by increased investments in our share of the Atlantic Coast and Sabal Trail pipelines.  Our renewables portfolio was flat compared to the prior year quarter, as weaker-than-expected wind resources were lower than historical averages, a trend similar to last year. On a year-to-date basis, our Commercial Portfolio is slightly behind our original expectations for the first half of the year. We will continue to monitor this trend throughout the remainder of the year.
Moving on, other was flat for the quarter, as a favorable income tax adjustment resulting from a completed IRS audit was offset by higher interest expense. 
International's quarterly earnings declined by $0.02 over last year. Lower earnings at National Methanol were driven by the completion of planned maintenance and lower MTBE prices. Looking ahead, the expansion of the new Palm facility at National Methanol has been delayed and is now expected to come online in the second quarter of 2017. As a reminder, once in service, this expansion will reduce our ownership percentage from 25% to 17.5%. 
international's results were also impacted by higher income tax expense. Because of our announcement in early 2016 of our intent to exit our Latin American operations, we no longer expect to permanently reinvest earnings in that business. As a result, we will continue to recognize additional U.S. income taxes up to the point of sale. Stronger results in Brazil, due to improved hydrology, more than offset weaker foreign currency exchange rates. Overall, it was a solid quarter, and we are pleased with our results.
Moving on to Slide 10, let's review our retail customer volume trends. On a rolling 12-month basis, weather-normalized retail load growth was 0.3% through the second quarter and continues to track our long-term expectations of approximately 0.5% load growth. We are particularly pleased with the strength of our Residential volume trends, which continue to grow at 0.8% over the last 12 months. Growth has been bolstered by a 1.4% increase in the number of customers. This is more than compensated for the usage reduction in our Residential customers due to their increased adoption of energy efficiency and general housing trends. For the first time since the recession, we are beginning to see single-family housing starts reaching the level of multifamily starts. At a macro level, employment and wage growth were also trending favorably for the Residential class.
Moving to the commercial class, we experienced a decline of 0.2% over the rolling 12 months. Commercial continues to grow in our Carolinas and Florida jurisdictions, led by gains in nonmanufacturing employment and declining office vacancies. However, in the Midwest, we see continued declines in the government sector related to the impacts of budget cuts. 
In our Industrial class, we continue to see growth of 0.4% on a rolling 12-month basis. Industries that support construction and automotives remains strong, and we are seeing positive signs once again in the chemicals, rubber and plastics industries. A few large industrial customers in the Midwest completed production outages during the quarter, which we believe temporarily impacted growth. Meanwhile, the softer global economy and strength of the U.S. dollar are still impacting companies influenced by exports. 
Of note this quarter, we saw renewed strength in sales in the metals sector. In particular, Indiana showed growth in this sector, as tariffs on imports have resulted in increased domestic metal production that is critical to the Midwest Industrial base. We will continue to closely monitor economic conditions and our customer usage patterns throughout the remainder of the year.
Moving to Slide 11, the company recently submitted regulatory filings in South Carolina and Florida. On July 1, we filed a request with the public service commission of South Carolina to increase revenues by about $79 million for Duke Energy Progress, our first rate case in this jurisdiction since 1988. We've made significant investments to build new energy infrastructure to meet the needs of growing customer base and environmental regulations at both the state and federal levels. These investments allow us to provide affordable, reliable and increasingly cleaner energy to customers. There are key drivers for the proposed increase, which will allow us to recover the costs associated with assets we have placed into service in recent years. These include our H.F. Lee, Smith and Sutton natural gas-fired combined cycle facilities. They also include the South Carolina retail share of costs from the NCEMPA acquisition, in addition to renewables investments. the hearing will begin on October 31, and if approved, new rates could go into effect in January 2017.
We have also filed 2 separate petitions with a Florida Public Service Commission on the the Generation Base Rate Adjustment mechanism to increase revenues by approximately $70 million. The first petition includes the Heinz energy air units, which will provide approximately 220 megawatts of additional capacity to the current plant. The second petition was filed to recover the total revenue requirement associated with the previously approved acquisition of the Osprey generating facility from Kal Pine. We expect this acquisition to be completed in early 2017. 
Also in Florida, I'm pleased to announce we recently completed the  securitization of costs associated with our retired Crystal River 3 nuclear plant. By issuing bonds at very attractive interest rates, this transaction will save our Florida customers nearly $800 million over the next 12 years. This financing represents a win-win solution that allows us to continue making investments in Florida to provide cleaner energy solutions for our customers, and at the same time, help manage the impact on our customers' bills. I'm proud of our team that worked diligently to create significant value for our customers through this transaction.
I'll close with Slide 12. Duke Energy has tremendous scale, offering an attractive investor value proposition, which includes balanced growth in earnings and reliable dividends over time. As Lynn mentioned, we are making good progress on the exit of the Latin American generation business and preparing for the integration of Piedmont. After completion of these strategic transactions, we will operate a portfolio that provides low risk and high quality earnings and cash flows to support stable earnings and dividend growth. We are making significant strides in executing on our capital plan, including investing in cleaner energy resources and technologies that modernize our energy grid to provide the enhanced services that our customers expect. And we are excited about the growth opportunities for natural gas infrastructure across our service territories, particularly in the southeast. 
Our dividend is very important to us. The strength of cash flows generated by our operating companies allows us to continue to target annual growth in the dividend consistent with our long-term 4% to 6% earnings growth objective. 
We had a good first half of the year and are looking ahead to the third quarter, traditionally our strongest. This gives us confidence to reaffirm our $4.50 to $4.70 adjusted earnings per share guidance range for 2016. 
With that, let's open the lines for your questions."

Over the last 3 years, we've turned greater attention to regulated renewables and have made a number of solar investment in the Carolinas.

We'll see where that goes through the third quarter. Our O&M savings have been quite significant year-to-date, $0.10 savings. That's been offset by about 6 cents of storm, but still some very strong year-to-date O&M savings that helped us there.

So the ITC impact on solar for the commercial can have a more heavily weighted near-term impact when it comes in over the 10-year PTC period.

If you go back to 2008, '09, '10, the Carolina companies had very little generation coming from natural gas. That today is in the range of 25% to 30% of our energy is coming from natural gas. So we made an investment in the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, $2 billion investment to bring more infrastructure into the state to provide infrastructure for further development of generation and also services to customers. we made investment in Sabal Trail, which is important to Florida, which is already a very gas-heavy area. And then we added Piedmont, which is the interstate pipeline in the Carolinas, which we believe has great growth opportunity, not only for the customers they serve, but for increasing power generation. So we believe that gas infrastructure fits with Duke. The returns, the regulated returns, the cash flows in support of our dividend are important.

As we think about commercial, we look at both and in fact, this year, we are going to install more megawatts of wind than solar just based on the opportunistic nature of what we've developed, the returns we've delivered and what we believe to be the highest-quality projects. So we'll be more opportunistic in the commercial business, looking at a complement of wind and solar. We like the profile of PTC. And so there might be a slight bias toward wind.

Let me start on Slide 4 and express how pleased I am with our financial results this quarter. This morning, we announced second quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $1.07, an increase of $",1614,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Let me start on Slide 4 and express how pleased I am with our financial results this quarter. This morning, we announced second quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $1.07, an increase of $0.12 from the prior year. We generated higher adjusted earnings with strong results at our Regulated Utilities, which gives us confidence to reaffirm our full year guidance for 2016.
We also demonstrated our confidence in the strength of our core businesses with the recent increase in our dividend. We have consistently paid a dividend for 90 years, which extends our commitment to this key part of our total shareholder return proposition.
We accomplished strong results this quarter, while continuing to build our domestic energy infrastructure business, as you can see on Slide 5. Let's start with our pending acquisition of Piedmont Natural Gas. This acquisition and the expansion of our natural gas infrastructure platform supports our transition to a lower carbon future. In June, Duke Energy and Piedmont reached constructive settlement agreements with the North Carolina Public staff and other key intervenors. The settlement provide clear benefits to customers and communities. 
In July, the North Carolina Utilities Commission held a hearing to review the proposed acquisition. The acquisition review will be fully briefed on August 25, when proposed orders are due from all parties. There is no statutory time frame for the commission to act, and we won't speculate on their timing. However, integration efforts are going well, and we will be opportunistic with our remaining acquisition financing, such that we are prepared to close the transaction when all closing conditions are met. We remain confident of closing the transaction by the end of this year and possibly earlier.
In addition, we're proceeding as planned with our process to exit the Latin American generation business. We've received strong interest from a variety of parties. We have since invited a select group of bidders to participate in detailed due diligence, including management presentations and site visits for the purpose of providing final bids. We will continue to provide updates as we move through this process.
Turning to Slide 6, I'll provide you with a brief update on our progress executing our $30 billion strategic growth capital plan. Our vision is to invest capital and smarter energy solutions that generate cleaner energy and modernize the grid, creating value for our customers and delivering earnings and dividend growth for our shareholders. 
Our major generation projects continued to move forward as planned, remaining on time and on budget. In South Carolina, construction of our $600 million lean natural gas combined cycle plant is progressing well toward a November 2017 in-service date. In Florida, construction has begun on our $1.5 billion Citrus County combined cycle plant. And our uprates at Heinz are on target for an October 1 in-service date. 
In addition, we continue to add solar to our regulated generation portfolio. In May, the NCUC approved 2 new solar projects totaling 65 megawatts in our Duke Energy Carolinas service territory. Both of these projects are expected to be online in the first quarter of 2017.
In Indiana, the state regulatory commission approved our 70-megawatt solar plant at the Crane Naval Station, the second largest solar power plant in the state. Per Indiana statute, we will recover 100% of the cost of the project via a clean energy investment rider.
We also had several positive developments regarding our grid modernization efforts. On June 29, the Indiana Commission approved our previously filed settlement agreement for our 7-year $1.4 billion plan to build a smarter energy infrastructure, which is now underway. In Kentucky, we filed a request to deploy smart meters in our service territory; while in South Carolina, we received an accounting order from the commission allowing Duke Energy Carolinas to defer the costs of smart meter investments until the next rate case. These programs will provide much-needed technology and infrastructure upgrades. They build upon our progress in investing in the energy grid and will benefit customers with improved reliability and safety, fewer and shorter power outages and overall energy savings.
Shifting to our commercial portfolio, we continued to advance our 2 natural gas pipeline projects, Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Sabal Trail. We expect to receive FERC's notice of scheduled for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline soon. We still anticipate a FERC order allowing construction to begin by mid-2017, keeping the project on target for a late 2018 in-service date. Meanwhile, you might recall that Sabal Trail received FERC approval in February this year. Preconstruction work is underway, with construction expected to begin in late summer. The project remains on target to be in operation in mid-2017.
We also had success this quarter growing our commercial renewables fleet. Our 200-megawatt Los Vientos IV wind project achieved commercial operation in July, a month ahead of schedule. Our 200-megawatt Frontier wind project remains on target to begin serving customers later this year. With the acquisition of 55 megawatts of new solar projects, we now have 2 additional projects in North Carolina and our first in New Mexico. By year-end, we expect our commercial renewables footprint to be approximately 3,000 megawatts.
Turning to Slide 7, let me update you on the significant progress we made during the quarter on coal ash basin closure. As we have previously discussed, our work is underway to close basins at 7 sites in the Carolinas, including 2 sites in South Carolina. For our remaining North Carolina basins in the second quarter, we received updated rankings from the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality. The rankings establish closure methods, time frames, and ultimately, costs. They also highlighted the need for additional time to complete ongoing dam improvement activities and collect additional scientific and engineering data to appropriately rank and safely close the basin. 
In response, North Carolina adopted House Bill 630 to strengthen the 2014 Coal Ash Management Act. The legislation provides important clarifications, keeping final authority for coal ash oversight with the state environmental regulator and outlining a path to low classifications for many of our basins, which allows for a range of closure options, including capping the material in place. It also requires the completion of the dam improvement activities and providing access to a permanent alternative drinking water supply for residents. This removes any concerns for plant neighbors about potential impacts to their surrounding private drinking wells. 
In addition, the legislation directs the construction of ash reprocessing facilities at 3 sites to make the material suitable for use in concrete. We support recycling ash, which is the only way to avoid permanent storage of this useful construction material. 
The time frames outlined in the new legislation are generally consistent, with the requirements of the federal coal combustion residual or CCR rule, and work is underway to meet the requirements in the CCR rule and the North Carolina legislation. The new law in North Carolina does not materially affect our current estimated costs for basin closure, and we remain committed to save sustainable long-term solutions for coal ash across all of our jurisdictions.
Moving to Indiana, we filed testimony in June to support our first petition to recover approximately $400 million in costs associated with the federal CCR rule. Our petition requests that these costs for dry bottom ash conversion projects be recovered under the Indiana federal mandate statute. This statute provides for 80% recovery of project costs through a rider and 20% deferred until the next rate case. Hearings are scheduled for November, and we could receive an order by mid-2017.
Finally, in July we filed a request in Kentucky for a certificate of public convenience and necessity to construct a $23 million dry bottom ash handling system at our East Bend Station. 
Before I turn it over to Steve, I'd like to highlight on Slide 8 several of our recent operational accomplishments made possible by the dedication of our employees. Our strong generation fleet performance has persisted through the second quarter. Year-to-date, our nuclear fleet has achieved a 96% capacity factor. At our Coney Unit 3 [ph] in the Carolinas, our team set a new record for shortest outage time, an improvement of 10% over the prior period. 
In June, the company was recognized by EEI with the association's Emergency Recovery Award for our outstanding power restoration efforts in the Carolinas following Winter Storm Jonas earlier this year. These efforts were again on display in response to the approximately 550,000 outages caused by Tropical Storm Colin in Florida in June and powerful wind storms in the Midwest and Carolinas in June and early July. In each of these storms, our teams worked diligently and safely, both day and night, to restore service as quickly as possible, and I commend their commitments to meeting our customers' needs 24/7.
Also, in June we exceeded the $687 million guaranteed fuel and joint dispatch merger savings, providing a significant benefit to our Carolinas customers as a result of the 2012 Duke and Progress Energy merger. The dedicated efforts of our teams allowed us to complete this important milestone a full year ahead of our original commitment.
In conclusion, I'm pleased with our financial results for the quarter and our progress in advancing our strategic initiatives, as we invest in cleaner and smarter energy solutions for our customers and deliver growth for our investors. We are maintaining a sharp focus in operational excellence, which includes our commitment to safety and cost efficiency. Our portfolio transition enhances Duke's position as an industry-leading domestic infrastructure business, with stable transparent earnings and cash flows. We look forward to completing this transition. 
Now let me turn it over to Steve."

As Lynn mentioned, we are pleased with our strong quarter. Given the results through the first half of the year, we remain on track to achieve and today have reaffirmed our full year 2016 guidance range of between $4.50 to $4.70 per share. L",1546,"Thanks, Lynn. As Lynn mentioned, we are pleased with our strong quarter. Given the results through the first half of the year, we remain on track to achieve and today have reaffirmed our full year 2016 guidance range of between $4.50 to $4.70 per share. Let me walk you through some of the key drivers from the quarter as well as provide updates on current retail volume trends within our service territories and regulatory activity underway in our jurisdictions.
I'll start with the quarterly results on Slide 9. For more detailed information on segment variances versus last year and a reconciliation of reported results to adjusted results, please refer to the supporting materials that accompany today's press release and presentation. 
On a reported or GAAP basis, 2016 second quarter earnings per share were $0.74 compared to $0.78 last year and were impacted by an impairment in Central America. Due to the continued advancement of our process to exit the Latin American generation business and the increased probability of sale, we evaluated the carrying value of the asset groups within International Energy. We determined that certain assets in Central America were impaired. And as a result, we recognized a pretax charge of $194 million. In addition to this impairment, costs related to mergers and savings initiatives were also special items that have been excluded from our adjusted EPS results. 
Let me now discuss our adjusted quarterly earnings in key drivers at each of our business segments. Second quarter adjusted diluted earnings were $1.07 per share compared to $0.95 in the second quarter of 2015. Regulated Utilities quarterly adjusted results increased by $0.13 per share despite less favorable weather. This was primarily driven by higher pricing in riders. We also realized higher wholesale margins, primarily due to the long-term contract associated with the NCEMPA acquisition in the prior year. In addition, reduced outage costs and ongoing cost management efforts enabled us to further reduce our O&M in the quarter. Even with $0.06 in higher storm-related costs year-to-date, our focus on operational efficiencies and cost savings initiatives position us to achieve our full year O&M reduction target and helps us -- helps position us to maintain a flat O&M cost structure through 2020. 
Commercial Portfolio results increased by $0.01 per share in the second quarter. The higher results were largely driven by increased investments in our share of the Atlantic Coast and Sabal Trail pipelines. Our renewables portfolio was flat compared to the prior year quarter, as weaker-than-expected wind resources were lower than historical averages, a trend similar to last year. On a year-to-date basis, our Commercial Portfolio is slightly behind our original expectations for the first half of the year. We will continue to monitor this trend throughout the remainder of the year.
Moving on, other was flat for the quarter, as a favorable income tax adjustment resulting from a completed IRS audit was offset by higher interest expense. 
International's quarterly earnings declined by $0.02 over last year. Lower earnings at National Methanol were driven by the completion of planned maintenance and lower MTBE prices. Looking ahead, the expansion of the new Palm facility at National Methanol has been delayed and is now expected to come online in the second quarter of 2017. As a reminder, once in service, this expansion will reduce our ownership percentage from 25% to 17.5%. 
International's results were also impacted by higher income tax expense. Because of our announcement in early 2016 of our intent to exit our Latin American operations, we no longer expect to permanently reinvest earnings in that business. As a result, we will continue to recognize additional U.S. income taxes up to the point of sale. Stronger results in Brazil, due to improved hydrology, more than offset weaker foreign currency exchange rates. Overall, it was a solid quarter, and we are pleased with our results.
Moving on to Slide 10, let's review our retail customer volume trends. On a rolling 12-month basis, weather-normalized retail load growth was 0.3% through the second quarter and continues to track our long-term expectations of approximately 0.5% load growth. We are particularly pleased with the strength of our Residential volume trends, which continue to grow at 0.8% over the last 12 months. Growth has been bolstered by a 1.4% increase in the number of customers. This is more than compensated for the usage reduction by our Residential customers due to their increased adoption of energy efficiency and general housing trends. For the first time since the recession, we are beginning to witness single-family housing starts reaching the level of multifamily starts. At a macro level, employment and wage growth were also trending favorably for the Residential class.
Moving to the commercial class, we experienced a decline of 0.2% over the rolling 12 months. Commercial continues to grow in our Carolinas and Florida jurisdictions, led by gains in nonmanufacturing employment and declining office vacancies. However, in the Midwest, we see continued declines in the government sector related to the impacts of budget cuts. 
In our Industrial class, we continue to see growth of 0.4% on a rolling 12-month basis. Industries that support construction and automotives remains strong, and we are seeing positive signs once again in the chemicals, rubber and plastics industries. A few large industrial customers in the Midwest completed production outages during the quarter, which we believe temporarily impacted growth. Meanwhile, the softer global economy and strength of the U.S. dollar are still impacting companies influenced by exports. 
Of note this quarter, we saw renewed strength in sales in the metals sector. In particular, Indiana showed growth in this sector, as tariffs on imports have resulted in increased domestic metal production that is critical to the Midwest Industrial base. We will continue to closely monitor economic conditions and our customer usage patterns throughout the remainder of the year.
Moving to Slide 11, the company recently submitted regulatory filings in South Carolina and Florida. On July 1, we filed a request with the public service commission of South Carolina to increase revenues by about $79 million for Duke Energy Progress, our first rate case in this jurisdiction since 1988. We've made significant investments to build new energy infrastructure to meet the needs of a growing customer base and comply with environmental regulations at both the state and federal levels. These investments allow us to provide affordable, reliable and increasingly cleaner energy to customers. 
There are key drivers for the proposed increase, which will allow us to recover the costs associated with assets we have placed into service in recent years. These include our H.F. Lee, Smith and Sutton natural gas-fired combined cycle facilities. They also include the South Carolina retail share of costs from the NCEMPA acquisition, in addition to renewables investments. The hearing will begin on October 31, and if approved, new rates could go into effect in January 2017.
We have also filed 2 separate petitions with the Florida Public Service Commission under the Generation Base Rate Adjustment mechanism to increase revenues by approximately $70 million. The first petition includes the Heinz energy inlet chilling air units, which will provide approximately 220 megawatts of additional capacity to the current plant. The second petition was filed to recover the total revenue requirements associated with the previously approved acquisition of the Osprey generating facility from Calpine. We expect this acquisition to be completed in early 2017. 
Also in Florida, I am pleased to announce that we recently completed the securitization of cost associated with our retired Crystal River 3 nuclear plant. By issuing bonds at very attractive interest rates, this transaction will save our Florida customers nearly $800 million over the next 20 years. This financing represents a win-win solution that allows us to continue making investments in Florida to provide cleaner energy solutions for our customers, and at the same time, help manage the impact to our customers' bills. I'm proud of our team that worked diligently to create significant value for our customers through this transaction.
I'll close with Slide 12. Duke Energy has tremendous scale, offering an attractive investor value proposition, which includes balanced growth in earnings and reliable dividends over time. As Lynn mentioned, we are making good progress on the exit of the Latin American generation business and preparing for the integration of Piedmont. After completion of these strategic transactions, we will operate a portfolio that provides low-risk and high-quality earnings and cash flows to support stable earnings and dividend growth. We are making significant strides in executing on our capital plan, including investing in cleaner energy resources and technologies that modernize our energy grid to provide the enhanced services that our customers expect. And we are excited about the growth opportunities for natural gas infrastructure across our service territories, particularly in the southeast. 
Our dividend is very important to us. The strength of cash flows generated by our operating companies allows us to continue to target annual growth in the dividend consistent with our long-term 4% to 6% earnings growth objective. 
We had a good first half of the year and are looking ahead to the third quarter, traditionally our strongest. This gives us confidence to reaffirm our $4.50 to $4.70 adjusted earnings per share guidance range for 2016. 
With that, let's open the lines for your questions."

Over the last 3 years, we've turned greater attention to regulated renewables and have made a number of solar investments in the Carolinas.

So we continue -- we will see that continue to build. I wouldn't see it as a step change necessarily, but continued growth consistent with what makes sense for customers. On the commercial side, we have a combination of wind and solar. Our portfolio today is more heavily allocated to wind. And we look for opportunistic opportunities to bring assets into the portfolio that makes sense, given our return expectations.

We've done a great job in the second quarter of coming back, weather's picked up a bit in June and certainly in July. We'll see where that goes through the third quarter. Our O&M savings have been quite significant year-to-date, $0.10 savings. That's been offset by about $0.06 of storm, but still some very strong year-to-date O&M savings that help us there. We've gotten good top line revenue growth from energy efficiency riders and some infrastructure riders in the Midwest that has helped and continues there.

So we don't look at it as a specific metric of revenue or EBIT per megawatt hour, whether it's wind or solar. The profile as you indicated is different. So the ITC impact of solar for the commercial can have a more heavily weighted near-term impact when it comes in over the 10-year PTC period. What's influencing results for us in the first half is just the wind not blowing as much. So we had relatively weaker wind in the quarter relative to plan.

So if you go back to 2008, '09, '10, the Carolina companies had very little generation coming from natural gas. That today is in the range of 25% to 30% of our energy is coming from natural gas. So we made an investment in the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, $2 billion investment to bring more infrastructure into the state to provide infrastructure for further development of generation and also services to customers. We made an investment in Sabal Trail, which is important to Florida, which is already a very gas-heavy area. And then we added Piedmont, which is the interstate pipeline in the Carolinas, which we believe has great growth opportunity, not only for the customers they serve, but for increasing power generation. So we believe that gas infrastructure fits with Duke. The returns, the regulated returns, the cash flows in support of our dividend are important. And we will look for ways to continue to add to that portfolio as we go forward.

A couple of things about our pension plan, it's fully funded, over 100% funded, and it's a closed pension plan. And we have derisked it -- we're in the process of derisking it. And so we're not quite as volatile as maybe some folks might be regarding swings there. Most of our jurisdictions have that as part of cost of service in our service territories.

You certainly do see different characteristics across our service territories, which is one of the benefits of that type of diversity. When you look at the Midwest, you'll see less residential population growth than the Southeast, but you do see some very solid industrial growth. When you look over the past several years, we've seen a lot of the automotive and metals in the Midwest kind of carry our growth during 2012 through '15. What we're seeing now is that the residential growth in the southeast is picking up as some of our industrial growth has declined a bit. But we have jurisdictional leadership that is very well attuned to the business climates in all of our jurisdictions, and they do vary. Florida has a little industrial and has a lot of residential. The Midwest has a lot of industrial. So we -- we're well in tune and manage all of those jurisdictions accordingly."

And so I think about the Carolinas with the focus on renewable portfolio standards and the increased interest in solar in South Carolina. We are taking advantage of that interest and making investments in that way. In Indiana, it's been a jurisdiction that has very much been interested in infrastructure investment. The support for the grid investment of $1.5 billion isn't something that moved through the legislature. And then, we've been able to put a plan in front of the Indiana commission that they've approved. And so the point you're making about tailoring what we do, both in terms of regulatory strategy and legislative strategy to each state, is something that our jurisdictional teams are focused on. And I think that's one of the strengths of our portfolio is we have the opportunity to take advantage of the interest in each state."

Let me start on Slide 4 and express how pleased I am with our financial results this quarter. This morning, we announced second quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $1.07, an increase of $",1615,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Let me start on Slide 4 and express how pleased I am with our financial results this quarter. This morning, we announced second quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $1.07, an increase of $0.12 from the prior year. We generated higher adjusted earnings with strong results at our Regulated Utilities, which gives us confidence to reaffirm our full year guidance for 2016.
We also demonstrated our confidence in the strength of our core businesses with the recent increase in our dividend. We have consistently paid a dividend for 90 years, which extends our commitment to this key part of our total shareholder return proposition.
We accomplished strong results this quarter, while continuing to build our domestic energy infrastructure business, as you can see on Slide 5. Let's start with our pending acquisition of Piedmont Natural Gas. This acquisition and the expansion of our natural gas infrastructure platform supports our transition to a lower carbon future. In June, Duke Energy and Piedmont reached constructive settlement agreements with the North Carolina Public staff and other key intervenors. The settlement provide clear benefits to customers and communities. 
In July, the North Carolina Utilities Commission held a hearing to review the proposed acquisition. The acquisition review will be fully briefed on August 25, when proposed orders are due from all parties. There is no statutory time frame for the commission to act, and we won't speculate on their timing. However, integration efforts are going well, and we will be opportunistic with our remaining acquisition financing, such that we are prepared to close the transaction when all closing conditions are met. We remain confident of closing the transaction by the end of this year and possibly earlier.
In addition, we're proceeding as planned with our process to exit the Latin American generation business. We've received strong interest from a variety of parties. We have since invited a select group of bidders to participate in detailed due diligence, including management presentations and site visits for the purpose of providing final bids. We will continue to provide updates as we move through this process.
Turning to Slide 6, I'll provide you with a brief update on our progress executing our $30 billion strategic growth capital plan. Our vision is to invest capital and smarter energy solutions that generate cleaner energy and modernize the grid, creating value for our customers and delivering earnings and dividend growth for our shareholders. 
Our major generation projects continued to move forward as planned, remaining on time and on budget. In South Carolina, construction of our $600 million lean natural gas combined cycle plant is progressing well toward a November 2017 in-service date. In Florida, construction has begun on our $1.5 billion Citrus County combined cycle plant. And our uprates at Heinz are on target for an October 1 in-service date. 
In addition, we continue to add solar to our regulated generation portfolio. In May, the NCUC approved 2 new solar projects totaling 65 megawatts in our Duke Energy Carolinas service territory. Both of these projects are expected to be online in the first quarter of 2017.
In Indiana, the state regulatory commission approved our 70-megawatt solar plant at the Crane Naval Station, the second largest solar power plant in the state. Per Indiana statute, we will recover 100% of the cost of the project via a clean energy investment rider.
We also had several positive developments regarding our grid modernization efforts. On June 29, the Indiana Commission approved our previously filed settlement agreement for our 7-year $1.4 billion plan to build a smarter energy infrastructure, which is now underway. In Kentucky, we filed a request to deploy smart meters in our service territory; while in South Carolina, we received an accounting order from the commission allowing Duke Energy Carolinas to defer the costs of smart meter investments until the next rate case. These programs will provide much-needed technology and infrastructure upgrades. They build upon our progress in investing in the energy grid and will benefit customers with improved reliability and safety, fewer and shorter power outages and overall energy savings.
Shifting to our commercial portfolio, we continued to advance our 2 natural gas pipeline projects, Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Sabal Trail. We expect to receive FERC's notice of scheduled for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline soon. We still anticipate a FERC order allowing construction to begin by mid-2017, keeping the project on target for a late 2018 in-service date. Meanwhile, you might recall that Sabal Trail received FERC approval in February this year. Preconstruction work is underway, with construction expected to begin in late summer. The project remains on target to be in operation in mid-2017.
We also had success this quarter growing our commercial renewables fleet. Our 200-megawatt Los Vientos IV wind project achieved commercial operation in July, a month ahead of schedule. Our 200-megawatt Frontier wind project remains on target to begin serving customers later this year. With the acquisition of 55 megawatts of new solar projects, we now have 2 additional projects in North Carolina and our first in New Mexico. By year-end, we expect our commercial renewables footprint to be approximately 3,000 megawatts.
Turning to Slide 7, let me update you on the significant progress we made during the quarter on coal ash basin closure. As we have previously discussed, our work is underway to close basins at 7 sites in the Carolinas, including 2 sites in South Carolina. For our remaining North Carolina basins in the second quarter, we received updated rankings from the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality. The rankings establish closure methods, time frames, and ultimately, costs. They also highlighted the need for additional time to complete ongoing dam improvement activities and collect additional scientific and engineering data to appropriately rank and safely close the basin. 
In response, North Carolina adopted House Bill 630 to strengthen the 2014 Coal Ash Management Act. The legislation provides important clarifications, keeping final authority for coal ash oversight with the state environmental regulator and outlining a path to low classifications for many of our basins, which allows for a range of closure options, including capping the material in place. It also requires the completion of the dam improvement activities and providing access to a permanent alternative drinking water supply for certain residents. This removes any concerns for plant neighbors about potential impacts to their surrounding private drinking wells. 
In addition, the legislation directs the construction of ash reprocessing facilities at 3 sites to make the material suitable for use in concrete. We support recycling ash, which is the only way to avoid permanent storage of this useful construction material. 
The time frames outlined in the new legislation are generally consistent, with the requirements of the federal coal combustion residual or CCR rule, and work is underway to meet the requirements in the CCR rule and the North Carolina legislation. The new law in North Carolina does not materially affect our current estimated costs for basin closures, and we remain committed to save sustainable long-term solutions for coal ash across all of our jurisdictions.
Moving to Indiana, we filed testimony in June to support our first petition to recover approximately $400 million in costs associated with the federal CCR rule. Our petition requests that these costs for dry bottom ash conversion projects be recovered under the Indiana federal mandate statute. This statute provides for 80% recovery of project costs through a rider and 20% deferred until the next rate case. Hearings are scheduled for November, and we could receive an order by mid-2017.
Finally, in July we filed a request in Kentucky for a certificate of public convenience and necessity to construct a $23 million dry bottom ash handling system at our East Bend Station. 
Before I turn it over to Steve, I'd like to highlight on Slide 8 several of our recent operational accomplishments made possible by the dedication of our employees. Our strong generation fleet performance has persisted through the second quarter. Year-to-date, our nuclear fleet has achieved a 96% capacity factor. At our Coney Unit 3 [ph] in the Carolinas, our team set a new record for shortest outage time, an improvement of 10% over the prior period. 
In June, the company was recognized by EEI with the association's Emergency Recovery Award for our outstanding power restoration efforts in the Carolinas following Winter Storm Jonas earlier this year. These efforts were again on display in response to the approximately 550,000 outages caused by Tropical Storm Colin in Florida in June and powerful wind storms in the Midwest and Carolinas in June and early July. In each of these storms, our teams worked diligently and safely, both day and night, to restore service as quickly as possible, and I commend their commitments to meeting our customers' needs 24/7.
Also, in June we exceeded the $687 million guaranteed fuel and joint dispatch merger savings, providing a significant benefit to our Carolinas customers as a result of the 2012 Duke and Progress Energy merger. The dedicated efforts of our teams allowed us to complete this important milestone a full year ahead of our original commitment.
In conclusion, I'm pleased with our financial results for the quarter and our progress in advancing our strategic initiatives, as we invest in cleaner and smarter energy solutions for our customers and deliver growth for our investors. We are maintaining a sharp focus on operational excellence, which includes our commitment to safety and cost efficiency. Our portfolio transition enhances Duke's position as an industry-leading domestic infrastructure business, with stable transparent earnings and cash flows. We look forward to completing this transition. 
Now let me turn it over to Steve."
267850,373717172,1025961,"Duke Energy Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Duke Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lynn. As Lynn mentioned, we are pleased with our strong quarter. Given the results through the first half of the year, we remain on track to achieve and today have reaffirmed our full year 2016 guidance range of between $4.50 to $4.70 per share. L",1547,"Thanks, Lynn. As Lynn mentioned, we are pleased with our strong quarter. Given the results through the first half of the year, we remain on track to achieve and today have reaffirmed our full year 2016 guidance range of between $4.50 to $4.70 per share. Let me walk you through some of the key drivers from the quarter as well as provide updates on current retail volume trends within our service territories and regulatory activity underway in our jurisdictions.
I'll start with the quarterly results on Slide 9. For more detailed information on segment variances versus last year and a reconciliation of reported results to adjusted results, please refer to the supporting materials that accompany today's press release and presentation. 
On a reported or GAAP basis, 2016 second quarter earnings per share were $0.74 compared to $0.78 last year and were impacted by an impairment in Central America. Due to the continued advancement of our process to exit the Latin American generation business and the increased probability of sale, we evaluated the carrying value of the asset groups within International Energy. We determined that certain assets in Central America were impaired. And as a result, we recognized a pretax charge of $194 million. In addition to this impairment, costs related to mergers and savings initiatives were also special items that have been excluded from our adjusted EPS results. 
Let me now discuss our adjusted quarterly earnings in key drivers at each of our business segments. Second quarter adjusted diluted earnings were $1.07 per share compared to $0.95 in the second quarter of 2015. Regulated Utilities quarterly adjusted results increased by $0.13 per share despite less favorable weather. This was primarily driven by higher pricing in riders. We also realized higher wholesale margins, primarily due to the long-term contract associated with the NCEMPA acquisition in the prior year. In addition, reduced outage costs and ongoing cost management efforts enabled us to further reduce our O&M in the quarter. Even with $0.06 in higher storm-related costs year-to-date, our focus on operational efficiencies and cost savings initiatives position us to achieve our full year O&M reduction target and helps us -- helps position us to maintain a flat O&M cost structure through 2020. 
Commercial Portfolio results increased by $0.01 per share in the second quarter. The higher results were largely driven by increased investments in our share of the Atlantic Coast and Sabal Trail pipelines. Our renewables portfolio was flat compared to the prior year quarter, as weaker-than-expected wind resources were lower than historical averages, a trend similar to last year. On a year-to-date basis, our Commercial Portfolio is slightly behind our original expectations for the first half of the year. We will continue to monitor this trend throughout the remainder of the year.
Moving on, other was flat for the quarter, as a favorable income tax adjustment resulting from a completed IRS audit was offset by higher interest expense. 
International's quarterly earnings declined by $0.02 over last year. Lower earnings at National Methanol were driven by the completion of planned maintenance and lower MTBE prices. Looking ahead, the expansion of the new Palm facility at National Methanol has been delayed and is now expected to come online in the second quarter of 2017. As a reminder, once in service, this expansion will reduce our ownership percentage from 25% to 17.5%. 
International's results were also impacted by higher income tax expense. Because of our announcement in early 2016 of our intent to exit our Latin American operations, we no longer expect to permanently reinvest earnings in that business. As a result, we will continue to recognize additional U.S. income taxes up to the point of sale. Stronger results in Brazil, due to improved hydrology, more than offset weaker foreign currency exchange rates. Overall, it was a solid quarter, and we are pleased with our results.
Moving on to Slide 10, let's review our retail customer volume trends. On a rolling 12-month basis, weather-normalized retail load growth was 0.3% through the second quarter and continues to track our long-term expectations of approximately 0.5% load growth. We are particularly pleased with the strength of our Residential volume trends, which continue to grow at 0.8% over the last 12 months. Growth has been bolstered by a 1.4% increase in the number of customers. This is more than compensated for the usage reduction by our Residential customers due to their increased adoption of energy efficiency and general housing trends. For the first time since the recession, we are beginning to witness single-family housing starts reaching the level of multifamily starts. At a macro level, employment and wage growth were also trending favorably for the Residential class.
Moving to the commercial class, we experienced a decline of 0.2% over the rolling 12 months. Commercial continues to grow in our Carolinas and Florida jurisdictions, led by gains in nonmanufacturing employment and declining office vacancies. However, in the Midwest, we see continued declines in the government sector related to the impacts of budget cuts. 
In our Industrial class, we continue to see growth of 0.4% on a rolling 12-month basis. Industries that support construction and automotives remains strong, and we are seeing positive signs once again in the chemicals, rubber and plastics industries. A few large industrial customers in the Midwest completed production outages during the quarter, which we believe temporarily impacted growth. Meanwhile, the softer global economy and strength of the U.S. dollar are still impacting companies influenced by exports. 
Of note this quarter, we saw the renewed strength in sales in the metals sector. In particular, Indiana showed growth in this sector, as tariffs on imports have resulted in increased domestic metal production that is critical to the Midwest Industrial base. We will continue to closely monitor economic conditions and our customer usage patterns throughout the remainder of the year.
Moving to Slide 11, the company recently submitted regulatory filings in South Carolina and Florida. On July 1, we filed a request with the public service commission of South Carolina to increase revenues by about $79 million for Duke Energy Progress, our first rate case in this jurisdiction since 1988. We've made significant investments to build new energy infrastructure to meet the needs of a growing customer base and comply with environmental regulations at both the state and federal levels. These investments allow us to provide affordable, reliable and increasingly cleaner energy to customers. 
There are key drivers for the proposed increase, which will allow us to recover the costs associated with assets we have placed into service in recent years. These include our H.F. Lee, Smith and Sutton natural gas-fired combined cycle facilities. They also include the South Carolina retail share of costs from the NCEMPA acquisition, in addition to renewables investments. The hearing will begin on October 31, and if approved, new rates could go into effect in January 2017.
We have also filed 2 separate petitions with the Florida Public Service Commission under the Generation Base Rate Adjustment mechanism to increase revenues by approximately $70 million. The first petition includes the Heinz energy inlet chilling air units, which will provide approximately 220 megawatts of additional capacity to the current plant. The second petition was filed to recover the total revenue requirements associated with the previously approved acquisition of the Osprey generating facility from Calpine. We expect this acquisition to be completed in early 2017. 
Also in Florida, I am pleased to announce that we recently completed the securitization of cost associated with our retired Crystal River 3 nuclear plant. By issuing bonds at very attractive interest rates, this transaction will save our Florida customers nearly $800 million over the next 20 years. This financing represents a win-win solution that allows us to continue making investments in Florida to provide cleaner energy solutions for our customers, and at the same time, help manage the impact to our customers' bills. I'm proud of our team that worked diligently to create significant value for our customers through this transaction.
I'll close with Slide 12. Duke Energy has tremendous scale, offering an attractive investor value proposition, which includes balanced growth in earnings and reliable dividends over time. As Lynn mentioned, we are making good progress on the exit of the Latin American generation business and preparing for the integration of Piedmont. After completion of these strategic transactions, we will operate a portfolio that provides low-risk and high-quality earnings and cash flows to support stable earnings and dividend growth. We are making significant strides in executing on our capital plan, including investing in cleaner energy resources and technologies that modernize our energy grid to provide the enhanced services that our customers expect. And we are excited about the growth opportunities for natural gas infrastructure across our service territories, particularly in the southeast. 
Our dividend is very important to us. The strength of cash flows generated by our operating companies allows us to continue to target annual growth in the dividend consistent with our long-term 4% to 6% earnings growth objective. 
We had a good first half of the year and are looking ahead to the third quarter, traditionally our strongest. This gives us confidence to reaffirm our $4.50 to $4.70 adjusted earnings per share guidance range for 2016. 
With that, let's open the lines for your questions."

So we have about 3,000 megawatts of a combination of wind and solar. Some of it has been green field developed, some of it has been acquired. And we've been in the business of not only building, constructing, operating, but also acquiring assets for a long period of time. We continue to put capital to work in a disciplined way in that business. The returns are heavily impacted by tax incentives. And so ensuring that we're delivering an appropriate return is always an area of focus in that business. Over the last 3 years, we've turned greater attention to regulated renewables and have made a number of solar investments in the Carolinas. We announced one in Indiana, and we've had a number in Florida as well. And that team has delivered probably between 250 and 300 megawatts of owned renewables in all of our jurisdictions. We believe that's going to be increasingly important as we go forward. So there's been a lot of development in both areas of our business over the last several years. And I believe we have a strong team to continue to pursue growth in those areas."

We have renewable standards in some. We have solar legislation in some. In Florida, we have a site plan that has 500 megawatts under development over the next 10 years. And we are constantly looking for what is the lowest-cost resource that we can bring in, that makes sense for customers, and really use that as part of a planning assumption for integrated resources. So we continue -- we will see that continue to build. I wouldn't see it as a step change necessarily, but continued growth consistent with what makes sense for customers. On the commercial side, we have a combination of wind and solar. Our portfolio today is more heavily allocated to wind. And we look for opportunistic opportunities to bring assets into the portfolio that makes sense, given our return expectations. So I would -- if you look at our capital plan, you'd see $500 million to $1 billion of annual spend looking for the right opportunities.

International had a large favorable tax item that we booked in Q1. Some of that will come back over the remainder of the year, but that's been helpful to their results certainly for us. On the regulated side, we started out the year with mild weather and storms and some weak weather-normal volumes. We've done a great job in the second quarter of coming back, weather's picked up a bit in June and certainly in July. We'll see where that goes through the third quarter. Our O&M savings have been quite significant year-to-date, $0.10 savings. That's been offset by about $0.06 of storm, but still some very strong year-to-date O&M savings that help us there. We've gotten good top line revenue growth from energy efficiency riders and some infrastructure riders in the Midwest that has helped and continues there. We'll see how load -- whether normal load picks up in the second half. We're optimistic about the Residential side of things.

So we don't look at it as a specific metric of revenue or EBIT per megawatt hour, whether it's wind or solar. The profile as you indicated is different. So the ITC impact of solar for the commercial can have a more heavily weighted near-term impact when it comes in over the 10-year PTC period. What's influencing results for us in the first half is just the wind not blowing as much. So we had relatively weaker wind in the quarter relative to plan. But it's really consistent with what we saw last year with weaker wind, so not much of a year-over-year delta. Hopefully that clarifies it."

And that is really building on the transition in our generation portfolio toward more natural gas. So if you go back to 2008, '09, '10, the Carolina companies had very little generation coming from natural gas. That today is in the range of 25% to 30% of our energy is coming from natural gas. So we made an investment in the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, $2 billion investment to bring more infrastructure into the state to provide infrastructure for further development of generation and also services to customers. We made an investment in Sabal Trail, which is important to Florida, which is already a very gas-heavy area. And then we added Piedmont, which is the interstate pipeline in the Carolinas, which we believe has great growth opportunity, not only for the customers they serve, but for increasing power generation. So we believe that gas infrastructure fits with Duke. The returns, the regulated returns, the cash flows in support of our dividend are important. And we will look for ways to continue to add to that portfolio as we go forward. At the same time as you know, we're also adding to our electric business with the grid investment renewables, gas generation. And we'll continue with those investments as well, always looking for ways we can add additional value to customers and/or investors."

And so that's something that we look closely at. I think we've disclosed that we are in an NOL position. And so our appetite for immediate monetization is limited.

But I look at it today as being a very small investment that produces strong cash flows that we're able to bring in and use to support the dividend.

Let me start on Slide 4 and express how pleased I am with our financial results this quarter. This morning, we announced second quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $1.07, an increase of $0.12 from the prior year. We generated higher adjusted earnings with strong results at our Regulated Utilities, which gives us confidence to reaffirm our full year guidance for 2016.
We also demonstrated our confidence in the strength of our core businesses with the recent increase in our dividend. We have consistently paid a dividend for 90 years, which extends our commitment to this key part of our total shareholder return proposition.
We accomplished strong results this quarter, while continuing to build our domestic energy infrastructure business, as you can see on Slide 5. Let's start with our pending acquisition of Piedmont Natural Gas. This acquisition and the expansion of our natural gas infrastructure platform supports our transition to a lower carbon future. In June, Duke Energy and Piedmont reached constructive settlement agreements with the North Carolina Public staff and other key intervenors. The settlement provide clear benefits to customers and communities. 
In July, the North Carolina Utilities Commission held a hearing to review the proposed acquisition. The acquisition review will be fully briefed on August 25, when proposed orders are due from all parties. There is no statutory time frame for the commission to act, and we won't speculate on their timing. However, integration efforts are going well, and we will be opportunistic with our remaining acquisition financing, such that we are prepared to close the transaction when all closing conditions are met. We remain confident of closing the transaction by the end of this year and possibly earlier.
In addition, we're proceeding as planned with our process to exit the Latin American generation business. We've received strong interest from a variety of parties. We have since invited a select group of bidders to participate in detailed due diligence, including management presentations and site visits for the purpose of providing final bids. We will continue to provide updates as we move through this process.
Turning to Slide 6, I'll provide you with a brief update on our progress executing our $30 billion strategic growth capital plan. Our vision is to invest capital and smarter energy solutions that generate cleaner energy and modernize the grid, creating value for our customers and delivering earnings and dividend growth for our shareholders. 
Our major generation projects continued to move forward as planned, remaining on time and on budget. In South Carolina, construction of our $600 million lean natural gas combined cycle plant is progressing well toward a November 2017 in-service date. In Florida, construction has begun on our $1.5 billion Citrus County combined cycle plant. And our uprates at Heinz are on target for an October 1 in-service date. 
In addition, we continue to add solar to our regulated generation portfolio. In May, the NCUC approved 2 new solar projects totaling 65 megawatts in our Duke Energy Carolinas service territory. Both of these projects are expected to be online in the first quarter of 2017.
In Indiana, the state regulatory commission approved our 70-megawatt solar plant at the Crane Naval Station, the second largest solar power plant in the state. Per Indiana statute, we will recover 100% of the cost of the project via a clean energy investment rider.
We also had several positive developments regarding our grid modernization efforts. On June 29, the Indiana Commission approved our previously filed settlement agreement for our 7-year $1.4 billion plan to build a smarter energy infrastructure, which is now underway. In Kentucky, we filed a request to deploy smart meters in our service territory; while in South Carolina, we received an accounting order from the commission allowing Duke Energy Carolinas to defer the costs of smart meter investments until the next rate case. These programs will provide much-needed technology and infrastructure upgrades. They build upon our progress in investing in the energy grid and will benefit customers with improved reliability and safety, fewer and shorter power outages and overall energy savings.
Shifting to our commercial portfolio, we continued to advance our 2 natural gas pipeline projects, Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Sabal Trail. We expect to receive FERC's notice of scheduled for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline soon. We still anticipate a FERC order allowing construction to begin by mid-2017, keeping the project on target for a late 2018 in-service date. Meanwhile, you might recall that Sabal Trail received FERC approval in February this year. Preconstruction work is underway, with construction expected to begin in late summer. The project remains on target to be in operation in mid-2017.
We also had success this quarter growing our commercial renewables fleet. Our 200-megawatt Los Vientos IV wind project achieved commercial operation in July, a month ahead of schedule. Our 200-megawatt Frontier wind project remains on target to begin serving customers later this year. With the acquisition of 55 megawatts of new solar projects, we now have 2 additional projects in North Carolina and our first in New Mexico. By year-end, we expect our commercial renewables footprint to be approximately 3,000 megawatts.
Turning to Slide 7, let me update you on the significant progress we made during the quarter on coal ash basin closure. As we have previously discussed, our work is underway to close basins at 7 sites in the Carolinas, including 2 sites in South Carolina. For our remaining North Carolina basins in the second quarter, we received updated rankings from the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality. The rankings establish closure methods, time frames, and ultimately, costs. They also highlighted the need for additional time to complete ongoing dam improvement activities and collect additional scientific and engineering data to appropriately rank and safely close the basin. 
In response, North Carolina adopted House Bill 630 to strengthen the 2014 Coal Ash Management Act. The legislation provides important clarifications, keeping final authority for coal ash oversight with the state environmental regulator and outlining a path to low classifications for many of our basins, which allows for a range of closure options, including capping the material in place. It also requires the completion of the dam improvement activities and providing access to a permanent alternative drinking water supply for certain residents. This removes any concerns for plant neighbors about potential impacts to their surrounding private drinking wells. 
In addition, the legislation directs the construction of ash reprocessing facilities at 3 sites to make the material suitable for use in concrete. We support recycling ash, which is the only way to avoid permanent storage of this useful construction material. 
The time frames outlined in the new legislation are generally consistent, with the requirements of the federal coal combustion residual or CCR rule, and work is underway to meet the requirements in the CCR rule and the North Carolina legislation. The new law in North Carolina does not materially affect our current estimated costs for basin closures, and we remain committed to save sustainable long-term solutions for coal ash across all of our jurisdictions.
Moving to Indiana, we filed testimony in June to support our first petition to recover approximately $400 million in costs associated with the federal CCR rule. Our petition requests that these costs for dry bottom ash conversion projects be recovered under the Indiana federal mandate statute. This statute provides for 80% recovery of project costs through a rider and 20% deferred until the next rate case. Hearings are scheduled for November, and we could receive an order by mid-2017.
Finally, in July we filed a request in Kentucky for a certificate of public convenience and necessity to construct a $23 million dry bottom ash handling system at our East Bend Station. 
Before I turn it over to Steve, I'd like to highlight on Slide 8 several of our recent operational accomplishments made possible by the dedication of our employees. Our strong generation fleet performance has persisted through the second quarter. Year-to-date, our nuclear fleet has achieved a 96% capacity factor. At our Coney Unit 3 [ph] in the Carolinas, our team set a new record for shortest outage time, an improvement of 10% over the prior period. 
In June, the company was recognized by EEI with the association's Emergency Recovery Award for our outstanding power restoration efforts in the Carolinas following Winter Storm Jonas earlier this year. These efforts were again on display in response to the approximately 550,000 outages caused by Tropical Storm Colin in Florida in June and powerful wind storms in the Midwest and Carolinas in June and early July. In each of these storms, our teams worked diligently and safely, both day and night, to restore service as quickly as possible, and I commend their commitments to meeting our customers' needs 24/7.
Also, in June we exceeded the $687 million guaranteed fuel and joint dispatch merger savings, providing a significant benefit to our Carolinas customers as a result of the 2012 Duke and Progress Energy merger. The dedicated efforts of our teams allowed us to complete this important milestone a full year ahead of our original commitment.
In conclusion, I'm pleased with our financial results for the quarter and our progress in advancing our strategic initiatives, as we invest in cleaner and smarter energy solutions for our customers and deliver growth for our investors. We are maintaining a sharp focus on operational excellence, which includes our commitment to safety and cost efficiency. Our portfolio transition enhances Duke's position as an industry-leading domestic infrastructure business, with stable transparent earnings and cash flows. We look forward to completing this transition. 
Now let me turn it over to Steve."
267850,373717172,1026442,"Duke Energy Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Duke Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lynn. As Lynn mentioned, we are pleased with our strong quarter. Given the results through the first half of the year, we remain on track to achieve and today have reaffirmed our full year 2016 guidance range of between $4.50 to $4.70 per share. L",1547,"Thanks, Lynn. As Lynn mentioned, we are pleased with our strong quarter. Given the results through the first half of the year, we remain on track to achieve and today have reaffirmed our full year 2016 guidance range of between $4.50 to $4.70 per share. Let me walk you through some of the key drivers from the quarter as well as provide updates on current retail volume trends within our service territories and regulatory activity underway in our jurisdictions.
I'll start with the quarterly results on Slide 9. For more detailed information on segment variances versus last year and a reconciliation of reported results to adjusted results, please refer to the supporting materials that accompany today's press release and presentation. 
On a reported or GAAP basis, 2016 second quarter earnings per share were $0.74 compared to $0.78 last year and were impacted by an impairment in Central America. Due to the continued advancement of our process to exit the Latin American generation business and the increased probability of sale, we evaluated the carrying value of the asset groups within International Energy. We determined that certain assets in Central America were impaired. And as a result, we recognized a pretax charge of $194 million. In addition to this impairment, costs related to mergers and savings initiatives were also special items that have been excluded from our adjusted EPS results. 
Let me now discuss our adjusted quarterly earnings in key drivers at each of our business segments. Second quarter adjusted diluted earnings were $1.07 per share compared to $0.95 in the second quarter of 2015. Regulated Utilities quarterly adjusted results increased by $0.13 per share despite less favorable weather. This was primarily driven by higher pricing in riders. We also realized higher wholesale margins, primarily due to the long-term contract associated with the NCEMPA acquisition in the prior year. In addition, reduced outage costs and ongoing cost management efforts enabled us to further reduce our O&M in the quarter. Even with $0.06 in higher storm-related costs year-to-date, our focus on operational efficiencies and cost savings initiatives position us to achieve our full year O&M reduction target and helps us -- helps position us to maintain a flat O&M cost structure through 2020. 
Commercial Portfolio results increased by $0.01 per share in the second quarter. The higher results were largely driven by increased investments in our share of the Atlantic Coast and Sabal Trail pipelines. Our renewables portfolio was flat compared to the prior year quarter, as weaker-than-expected wind resources were lower than historical averages, a trend similar to last year. On a year-to-date basis, our Commercial Portfolio is slightly behind our original expectations for the first half of the year. We will continue to monitor this trend throughout the remainder of the year.
Moving on, other was flat for the quarter, as a favorable income tax adjustment resulting from a completed IRS audit was offset by higher interest expense. 
International's quarterly earnings declined by $0.02 over last year. Lower earnings at National Methanol were driven by the completion of planned maintenance and lower MTBE prices. Looking ahead, the expansion of the new Palm facility at National Methanol has been delayed and is now expected to come online in the second quarter of 2017. As a reminder, once in service, this expansion will reduce our ownership percentage from 25% to 17.5%. 
International's results were also impacted by higher income tax expense. Because of our announcement in early 2016 of our intent to exit our Latin American operations, we no longer expect to permanently reinvest earnings in that business. As a result, we will continue to recognize additional U.S. income taxes up to the point of sale. Stronger results in Brazil, due to improved hydrology, more than offset weaker foreign currency exchange rates. Overall, it was a solid quarter, and we are pleased with our results.
Moving on to Slide 10, let's review our retail customer volume trends. On a rolling 12-month basis, weather-normalized retail load growth was 0.3% through the second quarter and continues to track our long-term expectations of approximately 0.5% load growth. We are particularly pleased with the strength of our Residential volume trends, which continue to grow at 0.8% over the last 12 months. Growth has been bolstered by a 1.4% increase in the number of customers. This is more than compensated for the usage reduction by our Residential customers due to their increased adoption of energy efficiency and general housing trends. For the first time since the recession, we are beginning to witness single-family housing starts reaching the level of multifamily starts. At a macro level, employment and wage growth were also trending favorably for the Residential class.
Moving to the commercial class, we experienced a decline of 0.2% over the rolling 12 months. Commercial continues to grow in our Carolinas and Florida jurisdictions, led by gains in nonmanufacturing employment and declining office vacancies. However, in the Midwest, we see continued declines in the government sector related to the impacts of budget cuts. 
In our Industrial class, we continue to see growth of 0.4% on a rolling 12-month basis. Industries that support construction and automotives remains strong, and we are seeing positive signs once again in the chemicals, rubber and plastics industries. A few large industrial customers in the Midwest completed production outages during the quarter, which we believe temporarily impacted growth. Meanwhile, the softer global economy and strength of the U.S. dollar are still impacting companies influenced by exports. 
Of note this quarter, we saw the renewed strength in sales in the metals sector. In particular, Indiana showed growth in this sector, as tariffs on imports have resulted in increased domestic metal production that is critical to the Midwest Industrial base. We will continue to closely monitor economic conditions and our customer usage patterns throughout the remainder of the year.
Moving to Slide 11, the company recently submitted regulatory filings in South Carolina and Florida. On July 1, we filed a request with the public service commission of South Carolina to increase revenues by about $79 million for Duke Energy Progress, our first rate case in this jurisdiction since 1988. We've made significant investments to build new energy infrastructure to meet the needs of a growing customer base and comply with environmental regulations at both the state and federal levels. These investments allow us to provide affordable, reliable and increasingly cleaner energy to customers. 
There are key drivers for the proposed increase, which will allow us to recover the costs associated with assets we have placed into service in recent years. These include our H.F. Lee, Smith and Sutton natural gas-fired combined cycle facilities. They also include the South Carolina retail share of costs from the NCEMPA acquisition, in addition to renewables investments. The hearing will begin on October 31, and if approved, new rates could go into effect in January 2017.
We have also filed 2 separate petitions with the Florida Public Service Commission under the Generation Base Rate Adjustment mechanism to increase revenues by approximately $70 million. The first petition includes the Heinz energy inlet chilling air units, which will provide approximately 220 megawatts of additional capacity to the current plant. The second petition was filed to recover the total revenue requirements associated with the previously approved acquisition of the Osprey generating facility from Calpine. We expect this acquisition to be completed in early 2017. 
Also in Florida, I am pleased to announce that we recently completed the securitization of cost associated with our retired Crystal River 3 nuclear plant. By issuing bonds at very attractive interest rates, this transaction will save our Florida customers nearly $800 million over the next 20 years. This financing represents a win-win solution that allows us to continue making investments in Florida to provide cleaner energy solutions for our customers, and at the same time, help manage the impact to our customers' bills. I'm proud of our team that worked diligently to create significant value for our customers through this transaction.
I'll close with Slide 12. Duke Energy has tremendous scale, offering an attractive investor value proposition, which includes balanced growth in earnings and reliable dividends over time. As Lynn mentioned, we are making good progress on the exit of the Latin American generation business and preparing for the integration of Piedmont. After completion of these strategic transactions, we will operate a portfolio that provides low-risk and high-quality earnings and cash flows to support stable earnings and dividend growth. We are making significant strides in executing on our capital plan, including investing in cleaner energy resources and technologies that modernize our energy grid to provide the enhanced services that our customers expect. And we are excited about the growth opportunities for natural gas infrastructure across our service territories, particularly in the southeast. 
Our dividend is very important to us. The strength of cash flows generated by our operating companies allows us to continue to target annual growth in the dividend consistent with our long-term 4% to 6% earnings growth objective. 
We had a good first half of the year and are looking ahead to the third quarter, traditionally our strongest. This gives us confidence to reaffirm our $4.50 to $4.70 adjusted earnings per share guidance range for 2016. 
With that, let's open the lines for your questions."

And so ensuring that we're delivering an appropriate return is always an area of focus in that business. Over the last 3 years, we've turned greater attention to regulated renewables and have made a number of solar investments in the Carolinas. We announced one in Indiana, and we've had a number in Florida as well. And that team has delivered probably between 250 and 300 megawatts of owned renewables in all of our jurisdictions.

So we continue -- we will see that continue to build. I wouldn't see it as a step change necessarily, but continued growth consistent with what makes sense for customers. On the commercial side, we have a combination of wind and solar. Our portfolio today is more heavily allocated to wind. And we look for opportunistic opportunities to bring assets into the portfolio that makes sense, given our return expectations.

International had a large favorable tax item that we booked in Q1. Some of that will come back over the remainder of the year, but that's been helpful to their results certainly for us. On the regulated side, we started out the year with mild weather and storms and some weak weather-normal volumes. We've done a great job in the second quarter of coming back, weather's picked up a bit in June and certainly in July. We'll see where that goes through the third quarter. Our O&M savings have been quite significant year-to-date, $0.10 savings. That's been offset by about $0.06 of storm, but still some very strong year-to-date O&M savings that help us there. We've gotten good top line revenue growth from energy efficiency riders and some infrastructure riders in the Midwest that has helped and continues there. We'll see how load -- whether normal load picks up in the second half. We're optimistic about the Residential side of things.

So we don't look at it as a specific metric of revenue or EBIT per megawatt hour, whether it's wind or solar. The profile as you indicated is different. So the ITC impact of solar for the commercial can have a more heavily weighted near-term impact when it comes in over the 10-year PTC period. What's influencing results for us in the first half is just the wind not blowing as much. So we had relatively weaker wind in the quarter relative to plan. But it's really consistent with what we saw last year with weaker wind, so not much of a year-over-year delta. Hopefully that clarifies it."

And that is really building on the transition in our generation portfolio toward more natural gas. So if you go back to 2008, '09, '10, the Carolina companies had very little generation coming from natural gas. That today is in the range of 25% to 30% of our energy is coming from natural gas. So we made an investment in the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, $2 billion investment to bring more infrastructure into the state to provide infrastructure for further development of generation and also services to customers. We made an investment in Sabal Trail, which is important to Florida, which is already a very gas-heavy area. And then we added Piedmont, which is the interstate pipeline in the Carolinas, which we believe has great growth opportunity, not only for the customers they serve, but for increasing power generation. So we believe that gas infrastructure fits with Duke. The returns, the regulated returns, the cash flows in support of our dividend are important. And we will look for ways to continue to add to that portfolio as we go forward. At the same time as you know, we're also adding to our electric business with the grid investment renewables, gas generation. And we'll continue with those investments as well, always looking for ways we can add additional value to customers and/or investors."

And we ended up with a very attractive net present value on that investment where you get another 15 years or so of earnings with no additional capital investment. And we thought that was a prudent thing to do, because the value of selling it at that point of renegotiation was inferior to the extension profile. And so at any point, I guess we could enter into discussions with our partners about an exit. But I look at it today as being a very small investment that produces strong cash flows that we're able to bring in and use to support the dividend. And in the scheme of all of Duke, it's relatively modest, right? We're talking about less than $100 million of net income. So that's the history I would share with you, and it's been a good contributor over time, as you know."

We had a strong third quarter at Duke Energy, delivering very solid financial results and demonstrating significant progress in the execution of our business portfolio transition. We closed the Piedmont Natural Gas acquisition, and we also announced the sale of our Latin American assets. This transition of our business portfolio strengthens our franchise of high-quality, stable and growing energy infrastructure business.
Starting on Slide 4, let me begin with our business portfolio transition. On October 3, we closed the Piedmont Natural Gas acquisition following approval by the North Carolina Utilities Commission. We're delighted to bring Piedmont's industry-leading expertise into our company as we expand our natural gas platform, supporting our transition to a lower-carbon future and growing investments in important natural gas infrastructure. We've worked with and admired Piedmont for many years, and our post-closing integration efforts are well underway. 
In addition, on October 10, we announced agreements with China Three Gorges Corporation and I Squared Capital to sell our Latin American generation assets. China Three Gorges will buy our assets in Brazil for approximately $1.2 billion, including the assumption of debt. We expect to complete the transaction in 2 to 4 months once we receive required approvals in Brazil and China. We're making good progress. In fact, this morning, the Brazilian Antitrust Agency preliminarily approved the transaction without any restrictions. This begins a 15-day statutory objection period, and if no objections are filed, the approval will become final.
I Squared Capital will buy our remaining assets in South and Central America in a separate transaction also valued at approximately $1.2 billion. We expect to close this transaction within the next 3 to 5 months. The proceeds available will be used to reduce Duke Energy holding company debt. Steve will discuss additional implications from the transaction in a moment. Both of these announcements demonstrate our commitment to deliver more projectable growth in earnings and cash flows. 
I'm proud of our team for the extensive work on these transactions as well as the continued dedication of our employees at Duke Energy International, who have managed the business very well throughout the process. We look forward to a timing -- timely close as we exit our Latin American generation business, and we're pleased to welcome the Piedmont employees to Duke Energy.
Turning to Slide 5. Consistent with the transition of the portfolios, today, we are announcing the realignment of our financial reporting segment structure beginning with our fourth quarter results. Prospectively, we will discuss performance for 3 primary business segments: Electric Utilities & Infrastructure, Gas Utilities & Infrastructure and Commercial Renewables. Electric Utilities & Infrastructure will be comprised of our regulated electric utilities in the Carolinas, Florida and the Midwest. This segment will also include our commercial transmission investments. As previously noted, Frank Yoho will lead our Gas Utilities & Infrastructure business, which will contain: Piedmont; our local gas distribution companies in Ohio and Kentucky; and our gas pipeline investments, such as Atlantic Coast Pipeline, Sabal Trail, Constitution and Piedmont's existing joint venture investments. With the realignment of our business, Commercial Renewables will become its own segment. Meanwhile, Other will continue to include holding company interest expense and our captive insurance results. Other will also begin to include our National Methanol equity investment in the fourth quarter. 
With the divestiture of the Latin American generation business, the balance of the international segment will be classified as discontinued operations starting in the fourth quarter of 2016. We will continue to report the earnings of this business and adjusted earnings per share until closing.
Turning to Slide 6, let me update on our strong financial results for the quarter. We announced third quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $1.68, an increase of $0.21 from the prior year. We generated higher adjusted earnings with strong results in our Regulated Utilities due to warmer summer weather and our continued commitment to cost management and operational excellence. As a result of the strong results through the first 3 quarters of the year, we are trending toward the high end of our original 2016 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $4.50 to $4.70 per share. This includes costs associated with Hurricane Matthew.
Turning to Slide 7, we're continuing to move forward and deliver strong results in our $30 billion growth capital plan. This plan aligns with our vision to invest capital in smarter energy solutions that generate cleaner energy and modernize the grid, creating value for customers and delivering earnings and dividend growth for our shareholders. Here are a few updates.
Site preparation activities are underway in our nearly $1 billion Western Carolinas Modernization Project, with plant construction anticipated to begin in early 2017. This project allows us to retire our Asheville coal units early, build cleaner natural gas units and install renewable energy on the site. The project is on track to be completed by late 2019. 
In September, we worked with the Indiana Office of the Utility Consumer Council to develop a plan to modernize and upgrade the Markland Hydro Station. This multiyear effort will increase the output of the nearly 50-year-old facility, producing low-cost carbon-free electricity for Indiana residents for years to come. Per the agreement, the approximately $150 million investment and related expenses will be recovered through the recently approved renewable energy rider. 
Lastly, we issued an RFP for 400 megawatts of renewable energy in our Duke Energy Carolinas service territory. This furthers our efforts to provide renewable energy to our customers. projects must be in operation by December 31, 2018. 
Also in North Carolina, we recently filed for a Certificate Of Public Necessity or CPCN for our Duke University combined heat and power project. The projects will consist of a natural gas volume generator that also provides steam service to the campus and lower the university's carbon dioxide emissions by 25%. Combined heat and power projects represented an attractive energy solutions that could benefit many of our universities and other large industrial customers in the years to come.
Shifting to our natural gas infrastructure investments, we continue to make investments in integrity management programs within our local distribution companies in advanced construction of our pipeline projects. Let me briefly update you on Sabal Trail, Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Constitution.
Construction on the Sabal Trail pipeline began in August, and the project remains on track for a June 2017 in-service date. 
Since our last earnings call, we received FERC's notice of schedule for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. Based on the schedule, we expect to receive the final FERC certificate and begin construction in the third or fourth quarter of 2017. This schedule moves our expected in-service date to the second half of 2019. In September, the project partners announced the selection of Spring Ridge Constructors [ph] as lead construction contractor, representing a significant milestone for the pipeline. This firm is a joint venture, a forward leading U.S  natural gas construction company with extensive experience in similar projects. 
As you recall, we have now added Piedmont's 24% stake in the Constitution pipeline to our portfolio. FERC approved this project in December of 2014. However, in April of 2016, the New York Department of Environmental Conservation, DEC, refused to grant the project's water quality certificate. In response, the project filed lawsuits with the U.S. Court of Appeals Second Circuit and the U.S. District Court of Northern New York, seeking to overreturn DEC's actions. Both of these lawsuits continue to progress with oral arguments before the U.S. Court of Appeals scheduled for November 16, and we expect a decision in this case by mid-2017. We continue to believe that the business case for this pipeline is compelling as the northeast lacks adequate access to low-cost supplies of natural gas that this pipeline provides.
Before I turn it over to Steve, I'd like to highlight on Slide 8 several of our recent operational accomplishments made possible by the dedication of our employees. As many of you know, we managed through 2 major hurricanes this fall. After Hurricane Hermione [ph] hit the southeast in September, our team restored power quickly and safely for more than 200,000 Florida customers and 150,000 Carolinas customers. Then Hurricane Matthew, a historic storm, swept through our Florida and Carolinas service territories in October. The storm tragically resulted in multiple fatalities and widespread flooding, impacting many of our customers across the Carolinas. The flooding, wind and rain caused extensive damage to our energy system, leaving more than 1.7 million customers without power. Piedmont's infrastructure experienced minimal damage.
In terms of customer outages, Hurricane Matthew is the fifth worst storm to hit the combined Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress service area with damage similar in scale to Hurricane Floyd in 1999 and Hurricane Hugo in 1989. In response, we mobilized more than 10,000 workers to rebuild the system and restore power for our customers. We continue to work with the hardest hit areas as they look to recover and rebuild. I'm extremely proud of our employees and their unwavering commitment to serving our communities.
Given the magnitude of the storm, we intend to request a deferral of incremental costs, and we'll ask that they be considered as part of our next base rate cases for Duke Energy Progress for the majority of the damage occurred. Our current estimate of incremental costs is approximately $200 million. We are still in the process of refining this preliminary cost estimate.
Moving to our generation fleet results in the quarter, our fleet responded well to the hot summer weather. Our nuclear units in Catawba and Maguire set new generation records. And our Edwardsport plant set a new station record for generation in the quarter. 
Also in the third quarter, Duke Energy was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index for the 11th consecutive year. This consistent run demonstrates the effectiveness of our sustainability, economic, environmental and social efforts. This is a significant achievement current the entire company.  In addition, we named in Site [ph] Selection Magazine's annual list of top 10 utilities in economic development for the 12th consecutive year, another example of our focus on developing our communities and growing our customer base. Through September, our economic development and efforts have yielded almost $3 billion of investment and more than 10,000 jobs across our service territories.
In conclusion, I am very pleased with our progress on the transition of the portfolio and in delivering strong financial results in the quarter and building momentum for a strong finish to 2016. We are advancing our strategic capital investments and maintaining our focus in operational excellence and value to our customers. Our portfolio of businesses is well positioned to deliver strong, predicable earnings and cash flows to our investors.
Now let me turn to fall over to Steve."
267850,404012791,1073896,"Duke Energy Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2016",2016-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Duke Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lynn. Today, I'll walk you through the key drivers from the third quarter as well as provide updates on the current retail volume trends within our service territories and regulatory activity underway in our jurisdiction. I'll close with a look ah",1459,"Thanks, Lynn. Today, I'll walk you through the key drivers from the third quarter as well as provide updates on the current retail volume trends within our service territories and regulatory activity underway in our jurisdiction. I'll close with a look ahead to 2017 and our key investor considerations. 
I'll start with the quarterly results on Slide 9 and discuss our adjusted earnings per share variances compared to the prior year quarter. For more detailed information on segment variances versus last year and a reconciliation of reported results to adjusted results, please refer to the supporting materials that accompany today's press release and presentation.  As a reminder, this is the last quarter for our existing segment structure. We begin managing the business under new segments at the beginning of the fourth quarter upon the completion of the Piedmont acquisition. 
On a reported or GAAP basis, 2016 third quarter earnings per share were $1.70 compared to $1.35 last year. Third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.68 compared to $1.47 in the third quarter of 2015. Regulated Utilities quarterly adjusted results increased by $0.34 per share quarter-over-quarter. This strong performance was primarily driven by warmer weather across all of our service territories, which added $0.14. We also recognized a lower effective tax rate primarily due to prior year tax adjustments, which contributed to an $0.08 increase. Higher revenues from energy efficiency riders in the Carolinas and grid investment riders in Ohio continued to be favorable drivers of earnings, adding $0.05 to results for the quarter. Weather-normal retail volumes also added $0.04, with growth primarily in the Carolinas and Florida. I'll discuss those details in a moment.
Finally our cost management efforts across the business provided a $0.02 uplift, despite additional storm costs in the third quarter. Our ongoing commitment to managing O&M costs and finding efficiencies throughout our business positions us to achieve our goal of maintaining a flat O&M cost structure through 2020.
Commercial Portfolio results increased by $0.02 per share in the third quarter. The higher results were largely driven by additional wind and solar facilities online this year and more favorable wind resources throughout the summer months.
Moving on, other was down $0.14 for the quarter, largely driven by a higher effective tax rate due to prior year tax benefits and a current year unfavorable audit settlement. These unfavorable tax items offset the favorable tax variance in the regulated utilities segment. For the year, we continue to expect total company adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 31% compared to our original expectation of 32% to 33%. This is primarily due to the favorable tax benefit realized at international in the first quarter.
Our first 3 quarters have been strong, reflecting favorable weather and strong execution on the part of our team. As we look to the fourth quarter, I would like to share a few considerations. 
First, Piedmont will contribute $0.03 to $0.05 in the fourth quarter. In Regulated Utilities, we have taken the opportunity to replan some of our O&M work, including advancing a fossil plant outage and some distribution projects into the fourth quarter. In addition, the prior year results included a favorable Ohio regulatory settlement. 
Meanwhile, at commercial renewables, we expect a relatively flat quarter compared to the prior year and for the segment to finish below original expectations for the full year. Market returns continue to decline, and we remain disciplined on renewables capital deployment. 
With our strong year-to-date results through the third quarter and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we are trending toward the high end of our original guidance range, excluding costs associated with Hurricane Matthew.
Moving on to Slide 10, let's review our retail customer volume trends. On a rolling 12-month basis, weather-normalized retail load was 0.6% through the third quarter and continues to track our long-term expectations for approximately 0.5% load growth. Overall, we are pleased with the strength of our Residential volumes, which continue to grow at 1.1% over the last 12 months. A strong 1.4% annual increase in the number of new customers drives this growth. Utilities sponsored energy efficiency programs and more efficient building codes and standards continually -- continue to partially offset this customer growth. Recently, we have seen the decline in usage per customer begin to level out a bit. Looking forward, positive trends and new job and wage growth as well as a recovery in housing are positive signs for continued residential growth.
Moving to the customer class, we experienced an increase of 0.4% over the rolling 12 months, an improvement compared to last quarter. Commercial usage is slowly improving across our jurisdictions as nonmanufacturing employment improves and office vacancies continued to decline even with new office space be added. These improvements are somewhat offset by commercial businesses supporting manufacturing. In addition, we continue to see declines in the government and education sectors, especially in the Midwest. 
In the industrial class, we see growth of 0.2% on a rolling 12-month basis. Industries that support construction and automotive continue to show resilience. However, the metals industry is once again experiencing declines.  We will closely monitor economic conditions in our customer usage patterns throughout the remainder of the year and into 2017.
Moving to Slide 11, let me take a moment to discuss the status of the DEP South Carolina rate case. In October, we reached a constructive settlement with the Office of Regulatory Staff and other key intervening parties. The settlement was reviewed by the Public Service Commission of South Carolina during a hearing earlier this week. The major components of the settlement were largely consistent with our initial filing. We requested a $79 million increase with an allowed ROE of 10.75% and equity structure of 53% and a rate base of $1.3 billion. Our significant energy infrastructure investments were key drivers for the proposed increase. The settlement provides for a $56 million revenue increase and an allowed ROE of 10.1%. We also agreed to a 53% equity structure and a $1.3 billion rate base. 
If the settlement is approved as filed, new rates are expected to be effective in January 2017. Customer rates will be implemented over a 2-year period. In year 1, customer bills will increase by $38 million and step up to $56 million in year 2. The DEP will reduce its cost of removed [ph] reliability by $18 million in year 1 to provide a neutral earnings impact to the company in the first year of rate implementation. Based on the settlement, coal ash costs that we had incurred will be recovered with a return over a 15-year amortization period. And we agreed to defer any future rate cases to 2019. This settlement is an important milestone, and we expect an order from the commission in the coming weeks.
With the transition in our business portfolio, I want to provide you some broad parameters for 2017 on Slide 12. Consistent with past practice, we will provide guidance for 2017, including our 5-year capital plans during our February earnings call. We anticipate growth in the core businesses, electric and gas infrastructure and commercial renewables, of about 5% off of the $4.30 midpoint of our 2016 adjusted earnings per share guidance range. Accretion from Piedmont is expected to be $0.08 to $0.10 per share in 2017, a strong first year, reflecting the benefits of early innovation. We will provide additional perspective on growth capital in all of our segments in February. 
International results through closing, use of sales proceeds and National Methanol are expected to contribute between $0.10 and $0.15 per share in 2017. National Methanol will move to other and contribute $0.05 per share based on prevailing Brent oil prices and our ongoing ownership percentage, which is expected to step down in 2017.
The use of proceeds from the sale of our Latin American generation assets of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion will displace future financings at the holding company and also contribute about $0.05 per share based on current interest rates. 
We estimate first quarter operating results from International business could also add up to $0.05 per share of earnings, depending upon the timing of the close. We look forward to further discussion of 2017 and beyond in February.
I'll close with Slide 13. Duke Energy has tremendous scale, offering an attractive investor value proposition, which includes balanced growth in earnings and reliable dividends over time. Within months, we expect to complete our multiyear portfolio transition, affirming our commitment to provide low-risk, high-quality earnings and cash flows and supporting our long-term growth projections. We will continue to invest in cleaner energy resources, modernize the energy grid and build our natural gas platform and provide enhanced services for our customers.
With that, let's open the lines for your questions."

So you see commercial has delivered about $65 million of net income against original expectations of $140 million. We are not expecting that we'll deliver $140 million for '16. Some of that shortfall will be the result of lesser capital deployment. As Steve mentioned, returns have been very market-driven, so great for customers, but low for investors. And then we continue to expect to be slightly behind on wind and solar resources as a result of what we've seen in weather patterns. So those are the 2 things I'd point to."

We had a strong third quarter at Duke Energy, delivering very solid financial results and demonstrating significant progress in the execution of our business portfolio transition. We closed the P",1799,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We had a strong third quarter at Duke Energy, delivering very solid financial results and demonstrating significant progress in the execution of our business portfolio transition. We closed the Piedmont Natural Gas acquisition, and we also announced the sale of our Latin American assets. This transition of our business portfolio strengthens our franchise of high-quality, stable and growing energy infrastructure business.
Starting on Slide 4, let me begin with our business portfolio transition. On October 3, we closed the Piedmont Natural Gas acquisition following approval by the North Carolina Utilities Commission. We're delighted to bring Piedmont's industry-leading expertise into our company as we expand our natural gas platform, supporting our transition to a lower-carbon future and growing investments in important natural gas infrastructure. We've worked with and admired Piedmont for many years, and our post-closing integration efforts are well underway. 
In addition, on October 10, we announced agreements with China Three Gorges Corporation and I Squared Capital to sell our Latin American generation assets. China Three Gorges will buy our assets in Brazil for approximately $1.2 billion, including the assumption of debt. We expect to complete the transaction in 2 to 4 months once we receive required approvals in Brazil and China. We're making good progress. In fact, this morning, the Brazilian Antitrust Agency preliminarily approved the transaction without any restrictions. This begins a 15-day statutory objection period, and if no objections are filed, the approval will become final.
I Squared Capital will buy our remaining assets in South and Central America in a separate transaction also valued at approximately $1.2 billion. We expect to close this transaction within the next 3 to 5 months. The proceeds available will be used to reduce Duke Energy holding company debt. Steve will discuss additional implications from the transaction in a moment. Both of these announcements demonstrate our commitment to deliver more projectable growth in earnings and cash flows. 
I'm proud of our team for the extensive work on these transactions as well as the continued dedication of our employees at Duke Energy International, who have managed the business very well throughout the process. We look forward to a timing -- timely close as we exit our Latin American generation business, and we're pleased to welcome the Piedmont employees to Duke Energy.
Turning to Slide 5. Consistent with the transition of the portfolio, today, we are announcing the realignment of our financial reporting segment structure beginning with our fourth quarter results. Prospectively, we will discuss performance for 3 primary business segments: Electric Utilities & Infrastructure, Gas Utilities & Infrastructure and Commercial Renewables. 
Electric Utilities & Infrastructure will be comprised of our regulated electric utilities in the Carolinas, Florida and the Midwest. This segment will also include our commercial transmission investments. As previously noted, Frank Yoho will lead our Gas Utilities & Infrastructure business, which will contain: Piedmont; our local gas distribution companies in Ohio and Kentucky; and our gas pipeline investments, such as Atlantic Coast Pipeline, Sabal Trail, Constitution and Piedmont's existing joint venture investments. With the realignment of our business, Commercial Renewables will become its own segment. Meanwhile, Other will continue to include holding company interest expense and our captive insurance results. Other will also begin to include our National Methanol equity investment in the fourth quarter. With the divestiture of the Latin American generation business, the balance of the International segment will be classified as discontinued operations starting in the fourth quarter of 2016. We will continue to report the earnings of this business and adjusted earnings per share until closing.
Turning to Slide 6, let me update you on our strong financial results for the quarter. We announced third quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $1.68, an increase of $0.21 from the prior year. We generated higher adjusted earnings with strong results in our Regulated Utilities due to warmer summer weather and our continued commitment to cost management and operational excellence. As a result of the strong results through the first 3 quarters of the year, we are trending toward the high end of our original 2016 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $4.50 to $4.70 per share. This excludes costs associated with Hurricane Matthew.
Turning to Slide 7. We're continuing to move forward and deliver strong results in our $30 billion growth capital plan. This plan aligns with our vision to invest capital in smarter energy solutions that generate cleaner energy and modernize the grid, creating value for customers and delivering earnings and dividend growth for our shareholders. 
Here are a few updates. Site preparation activities are underway in our nearly $1 billion Western Carolinas Modernization Project with plant construction anticipated to begin in early 2017. This project allows us to retire our Asheville coal units early, build cleaner natural gas units and install renewable energy on the site. The project is on track to be completed by late 2019. 
In September, we worked with the Indiana Office of the Utility Consumer Council to develop a plan to modernize and upgrade the Markland Hydro Station. This multiyear effort will increase the output of the nearly 50-year-old facility, producing low-cost, carbon-free electricity for Indiana residents for years to come. Per the agreement, the approximately $150 million investment and related expenses will be recovered through the recently approved renewable energy rider. 
Last week, we reissued an RFP for 400 megawatts of renewable energy in our Duke Energy Carolinas service territory. This furthers our efforts to provide renewable energy to our customers. Proposed projects must be in operation by December 31, 2018. 
Also in North Carolina, we recently filed for a Certificate Of Public Convenience and Necessity, or CPCN, for our Duke University combined heat-and-power project. The projects will consist of a natural gas volume generator that also provides steam service to the campus and lowers the university's carbon dioxide emissions by 25%. Combined heat-and-power projects represented an attractive energy solution that could benefit many of our universities and other large industrial customers in the years to come.
Shifting to our natural gas infrastructure investments, we continue to make investments in integrity management programs within our local distribution companies in advanced construction of our pipeline projects. 
Let me briefly update you on Sabal Trail, Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Constitution. Construction on the Sabal Trail pipeline began in August, and the project remains on track for a June 2017 in-service date. Since our last earnings call, we received FERC's Notice of Schedule for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. Based on the schedule, we expect to receive the final FERC certificate and begin construction in the third or fourth quarter of 2017. This schedule moves our expected in-service date to the second half of 2019. 
In September, the project partners announced the selection of Spring Ridge Constructors as the lead construction contractor, representing a significant milestone for the pipeline. This firm is a joint venture, a forward-leading U.S  natural gas pipeline construction company with extensive experience in similar projects. 
As you recall, we have now added Piedmont's 24% stake in the Constitution pipeline to our portfolio. FERC approved this project in December of 2014. However, in April of 2016, the New York Department of Environmental Conservation, DEC, refused to grant the project's water quality certificate. In response, the project filed lawsuits, with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and the U.S. District Court of Northern New York, seeking to overturn DEC's action. Both of these lawsuits continue to progress with oral arguments before the U.S. Court of Appeals scheduled for November 16, and we expect a decision in this case by mid-2017. We continue to believe that the business case for this pipeline is compelling as the northeast lacks adequate access to low-cost supplies of natural gas that this pipeline provides.
Before I turn it over to Steve, I'd like to highlight on Slide 8 several of our recent operational accomplishments made possible by the dedication of our employees. As many of you know, we managed through 2 major hurricanes this fall. After Hurricane Hermine hit the southeast in early September, our team restored power quickly and safely for more than 200,000 Florida customers and 150,000 Carolinas customers. Then Hurricane Matthew, a historic storm, swept through our Florida and Carolinas service territories in October. The storm tragically resulted in multiple fatalities and widespread flooding, impacting many of our customers across the Carolinas. The flooding, wind and rain caused extensive damage to our energy system, leaving more than 1.7 million customers without power. Piedmont's infrastructure experienced minimal damage.
In terms of customer outages, Hurricane Matthew is the fifth worst storm to hit the combined Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress service area with damage similar in scale to Hurricane Floyd in 1999 and Hurricane Hugo in 1989. In response, we mobilized more than 10,000 workers to rebuild the system and restore power for our customers. We continue to work with the hardest hit areas as they look to recover and rebuild. I'm extremely proud of our employees and their unwavering commitment to serving our communities.
Given the magnitude of the storm, we intend to request a deferral of incremental costs, and we'll ask that they be considered as part of our next base rate cases for Duke Energy Progress, where the majority of damage occurred. Our current estimate of incremental costs is approximately $200 million. We're still in the process of refining this preliminary cost estimate.
Moving to our generation fleet results in the quarter. Our fleet responded well to the hot summer weather. Our nuclear units at Catawba and McGuire set new generation records, and our Edwardsport plant set a new station record for generation in the quarter. 
Also in the third quarter, Duke Energy was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index for the 11th consecutive year. This consistent run demonstrates the effectiveness of our sustainability, economic, environmental and social efforts. This is a significant achievement earned by the entire company.  
In addition, we were named at Site Selection Magazine's annual list of Top 10 Utilities in Economic Development for the 12th consecutive year, another example of our focus on developing our communities and growing our customer base. Through September, our economic development efforts have yielded almost $3 billion of investment and more than 10,000 jobs across our service territories.
In conclusion, I'm very pleased with our progress on the transition of the portfolio and in delivering strong financial results in the quarter and building momentum for a strong finish to 2016. We're advancing our strategic capital investments and maintaining our focus on operational excellence and value to our customers. Our portfolio of businesses is well positioned to deliver strong, predictable earnings and cash flows to our investors.
Now let me turn to fall over to Steve."

Today, I will walk you through the key drivers from the third quarter as well as provide updates on the current retail volume trends within our service territories and regulatory activity underway in our jurisdictions. I'll close with a look",1460,"Thanks, Lynn. Today, I will walk you through the key drivers from the third quarter as well as provide updates on the current retail volume trends within our service territories and regulatory activity underway in our jurisdictions. I'll close with a look ahead to 2017 and our key investor considerations. 
I'll start with the quarterly results on Slide 9 and discuss our adjusted earnings per share variances compared to the prior year quarter. For more detailed information on segment variances versus last year and a reconciliation of reported results to adjusted results, please refer to the supporting materials that accompany today's press release and presentation. As a reminder, this is the last quarter for our existing segment structure. We begin managing the business under new segments at the beginning of the fourth quarter upon the completion of the Piedmont acquisition. 
On a reported or GAAP basis, 2016 third quarter earnings per share were $1.70 compared to $1.35 last year. Third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.68 compared to $1.47 in the third quarter of 2015. 
Regulated Utilities quarterly adjusted results increased by $0.34 per share quarter-over-quarter. This strong performance was primarily driven by warmer weather across all of our service territories, which added $0.14. We also recognized a lower effective tax rate primarily due to prior year tax adjustments, which contributed to an $0.08 increase. 
Higher revenues from energy efficiency riders in the Carolinas and grid investment riders in Ohio continue to be favorable drivers of earnings, adding $0.05 to results for the quarter. Weather-normal retail volumes also added $0.04, with growth primarily in the Carolinas and Florida. I'll discuss those details in a moment. 
Finally our cost management efforts across the business provided a $0.02 uplift despite additional storm costs in the third quarter. Our ongoing commitment to managing O&M costs and finding efficiencies throughout our business positions us to achieve our goal of maintaining a flat O&M cost structure through 2020.
Commercial Portfolio results increased by $0.02 per share in the third quarter. The higher results were largely driven by additional wind and solar facilities placed online this year and more favorable wind resources throughout the summer months.
Moving on, Other was down $0.14 for the quarter largely driven by a higher effective tax rate due to prior year tax benefits and a current year unfavorable audit settlement. These unfavorable tax items offset the favorable tax variance in the Regulated Utilities segment. For the year, we continue to expect total company adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 31% compared to our original expectation of 32% to 33%. This is primarily due to the favorable tax benefit realized at international in the first quarter.
Our first 3 quarters have been strong, reflecting favorable weather and strong execution on the part of our team. As we look to the fourth quarter, I would like to share a few considerations. First, Piedmont will contribute $0.03 to $0.05 in the fourth quarter. In Regulated Utilities, we have taken the opportunity to replan some of our O&M work, including advancing a fossil plant outage and some distribution projects into the fourth quarter. In addition, the prior year results included a favorable Ohio regulatory settlement. 
Meanwhile, at Commercial Renewables, we expect a relatively flat quarter compared to the prior year and for the segment to finish below original expectations for the full year. Market returns continue to decline, and we remain disciplined on renewables capital deployment. With our strong year-to-date results through the third quarter and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we're trending toward the high end of our original guidance range, excluding costs associated with Hurricane Matthew.
Moving on to Slide 10, let's review our retail customer volume trends. On a rolling 12-month basis, weather-normalized retail load was 0.6% through the third quarter and continues to track our long-term expectations for approximately 0.5% load growth. Overall, we are pleased with the strength of our residential volumes, which continue to grow at 1.1% over the last 12 months. A strong 1.4% annual increase in the number of new customers drives this growth. Utility-sponsored energy efficiency programs and more efficient building codes and standards continually -- continue to partially offset this customer growth. Recently, we have seen the decline in usage per customer begin to level out a bit. Looking forward, positive trends and new job and wage growth as well as a recovery in housing are positive signs for continued residential growth. Moving to the customer class. We experienced an increase of 0.4% over the rolling 12 months, an improvement compared to last quarter. 
Commercial usage is slowly improving across our jurisdictions as nonmanufacturing employment improves and office vacancies continue to decline even with new office space being added. These improvements are somewhat offset by commercial businesses supporting manufacturing. In addition, we continue to see declines in the government and education sectors, especially in the Midwest. 
In the industrial class, we see growth of 0.2% on a rolling 12-month basis. Industries that support construction and automotive continue to show resilience. However, the metals industry is once again experiencing declines.  We will closely monitor economic conditions and our customer usage patterns throughout the remainder of the year and into 2017.
Moving to Slide 11, let me take a moment to discuss the status of the DEP South Carolina rate case. In October, we reached a constructive settlement with the Office of Regulatory Staff and other key intervening parties. The settlement was reviewed by the Public Service Commission of South Carolina during a hearing earlier this week. The major components of the settlement were largely consistent with our initial filing. We requested a $79 million increase with an allowed ROE of 10.75% and equity structure of 53% and a rate base of $1.3 billion. Our significant energy infrastructure investments were the key drivers for the proposed increase. 
The settlement provides for a $56 million revenue increase and an allowed ROE of 10.1%. We also agreed to a 53% equity structure and a $1.3 billion rate base. If the settlement is approved as filed, new rates are expected to be effective in January 2017. Customer rates will be implemented over a 2-year period. In year 1, customer bills will increase by $38 million and step up to $56 million in year 2. DEP will reduce its cost of removal liability by $18 million in year 1 to provide a neutral earnings impact to the company in the first year of rate implementation. Based on the settlement, coal ash costs that we had incurred will be recovered with a return over a 15-year amortization period, and we agreed to defer any future rate cases to 2019. This settlement is an important milestone, and we expect an order from the commission in the coming weeks.
With the transition in our business portfolio, I want to provide you some broad parameters for 2017 on Slide 12. Consistent with past practice, we will provide guidance for 2017, including 5-year capital plans during our February earnings call. We anticipate growth in the core businesses, Electric and Gas Infrastructure and Commercial Renewables, of about 5% off of the $4.30 midpoint of our 2016 adjusted earnings per share guidance range. Accretion from Piedmont is expected to be $0.08 to $0.10 per share in 2017, a strong first year, reflecting the benefits of early integration. We will provide additional perspective on growth capital in all of our segments in February. 
International results, through closing, use of sales proceeds and National Methanol, are expected to contribute between $0.10 and $0.15 per share in 2017. National Methanol will move to Other and contribute $0.05 per share based on prevailing Brent crude oil prices and our ongoing ownership percentage, which is expected to step down in 2017. The use of proceeds from the sale of our Latin American generation assets of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion will displace future financings at the holding company and will also contribute about $0.05 per share based on current interest rates. We estimate first quarter operating results from our International business could also add up to $0.05 per share of earnings, depending upon the timing of the close. We look forward to further discussion of 2017 and beyond in February.
I'll close with Slide 13. Duke Energy has tremendous scale, offering an attractive investor value proposition, which includes balanced growth in earnings and reliable dividends over time. Within months, we expect to complete our multiyear portfolio transition, affirming our commitment to provide low-risk, high-quality earnings and cash flows and supporting our long-term growth projections. We will continue to invest in cleaner energy resources, modernize the energy grid and build our natural gas platform and provide enhanced services for our customers.
With that, let's open the lines for your questions."

So you see Commercial has delivered about $65 million of net income against our original expectations of $140 million. We are not expecting that we'll deliver $140 million for '16. Some of that shortfall will be the result of lesser capital deployment. As Steve mentioned, returns have been very market-driven, so great for customers, but low for investors. And then we continue to expect to be slightly behind on wind and solar resources as a result of what we've seen in weather patterns. So those are the 2 things I'd point to."

We had a strong third quarter at Duke Energy, delivering very solid financial results and demonstrating significant progress in the execution of our business portfolio transition. We closed the Piedmont Natural Gas acquisition, and we also announced the sale of our Latin American assets. This transition of our business portfolio strengthens our franchise of high-quality, stable and growing energy infrastructure business.
Starting on Slide 4, let me begin with our business portfolio transition. On October 3, we closed the Piedmont Natural Gas acquisition following approval by the North Carolina Utilities Commission. We're delighted to bring Piedmont's industry-leading expertise into our company as we expand our natural gas platform, supporting our transition to a lower-carbon future and growing investments in important natural gas infrastructure. We've worked with and admired Piedmont for many years, and our post-closing integration efforts are well underway. 
In addition, on October 10, we announced agreements with China Three Gorges Corporation and I Squared Capital to sell our Latin American generation assets. China Three Gorges will buy our assets in Brazil for approximately $1.2 billion, including the assumption of debt. We expect to complete the transaction in 2 to 4 months once we receive required approvals in Brazil and China. We're making good progress. In fact, this morning, the Brazilian Antitrust Agency preliminarily approved the transaction without any restrictions. This begins a 15-day statutory objection period, and if no objections are filed, the approval will become final.
I Squared Capital will buy our remaining assets in South and Central America in a separate transaction also valued at approximately $1.2 billion. We expect to close this transaction within the next 3 to 5 months. The proceeds available will be used to reduce Duke Energy holding company debt. Steve will discuss additional implications from the transaction in a moment. Both of these announcements demonstrate our commitment to deliver more projectable growth in earnings and cash flows. 
I'm proud of our team for the extensive work on these transactions as well as the continued dedication of our employees at Duke Energy International, who have managed the business very well throughout the process. We look forward to a timing -- timely close as we exit our Latin American generation business, and we're pleased to welcome the Piedmont employees to Duke Energy.
Turning to Slide 5. Consistent with the transition of the portfolio, today, we are announcing the realignment of our financial reporting segment structure beginning with our fourth quarter results. Prospectively, we will discuss performance for 3 primary business segments: Electric Utilities & Infrastructure, Gas Utilities & Infrastructure and Commercial Renewables. 
Electric Utilities & Infrastructure will be comprised of our regulated electric utilities in the Carolinas, Florida and the Midwest. This segment will also include our commercial transmission investments. As previously noted, Frank Yoho will lead our Gas Utilities & Infrastructure business, which will contain: Piedmont; our local gas distribution companies in Ohio and Kentucky; and our gas pipeline investments, such as Atlantic Coast Pipeline, Sabal Trail, Constitution and Piedmont's existing joint venture investments. With the realignment of our business, Commercial Renewables will become its own segment. Meanwhile, Other will continue to include holding company interest expense and our captive insurance results. Other will also begin to include our National Methanol equity investment in the fourth quarter. With the divestiture of the Latin American generation business, the balance of the International segment will be classified as discontinued operations starting in the fourth quarter of 2016. We will continue to report the earnings of this business and adjusted earnings per share until closing.
Turning to Slide 6, let me update you on our strong financial results for the quarter. We announced third quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $1.68, an increase of $0.21 from the prior year. We generated higher adjusted earnings with strong results in our Regulated Utilities due to warmer summer weather and our continued commitment to cost management and operational excellence. As a result of the strong results through the first 3 quarters of the year, we are trending toward the high end of our original 2016 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $4.50 to $4.70 per share. This excludes costs associated with Hurricane Matthew.
Turning to Slide 7. We're continuing to move forward and deliver strong results in our $30 billion growth capital plan. This plan aligns with our vision to invest capital in smarter energy solutions that generate cleaner energy and modernize the grid, creating value for customers and delivering earnings and dividend growth for our shareholders. 
Here are a few updates. Site preparation activities are underway in our nearly $1 billion Western Carolinas Modernization Project with plant construction anticipated to begin in early 2017. This project allows us to retire our Asheville coal units early, build cleaner natural gas units and install renewable energy on the site. The project is on track to be completed by late 2019. 
In September, we worked with the Indiana Office of the Utility Consumer Council to develop a plan to modernize and upgrade the Markland Hydro Station. This multiyear effort will increase the output of the nearly 50-year-old facility, producing low-cost, carbon-free electricity for Indiana residents for years to come. Per the agreement, the approximately $150 million investment and related expenses will be recovered through the recently approved renewable energy rider. 
Last week, we reissued an RFP for 400 megawatts of renewable energy in our Duke Energy Carolinas service territory. This furthers our efforts to provide renewable energy to our customers. Proposed projects must be in operation by December 31, 2018. 
Also in North Carolina, we recently filed for a Certificate Of Public Convenience and Necessity, or CPCN, for our Duke University combined heat-and-power project. The projects will consist of a natural gas volume generator that also provides steam service to the campus and lowers the university's carbon dioxide emissions by 25%. Combined heat-and-power projects represent an attractive energy solution that could benefit many of our universities and other large industrial customers in the years to come.
Shifting to our natural gas infrastructure investments, we continue to make investments in integrity management programs within our local distribution companies in advanced construction of our pipeline projects. 
Let me briefly update you on Sabal Trail, Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Constitution. Construction on the Sabal Trail pipeline began in August, and the project remains on track for a June 2017 in-service date. Since our last earnings call, we received FERC's Notice of Schedule for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. Based on the schedule, we expect to receive the final FERC certificate and begin construction in the third or fourth quarter of 2017. This schedule moves our expected in-service date to the second half of 2019. 
In September, the project partners announced the selection of Spring Ridge Constructors as the lead construction contractor, representing a significant milestone for the pipeline. This firm is a joint venture, a forward-leading U.S  natural gas pipeline construction company with extensive experience in similar projects. 
As you recall, we have now added Piedmont's 24% stake in the Constitution pipeline to our portfolio. FERC approved this project in December of 2014. However, in April of 2016, the New York Department of Environmental Conservation, DEC, refused to grant the project's water quality certificate. In response, the project filed lawsuits, with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and the U.S. District Court of Northern New York, seeking to overturn DEC's action. Both of these lawsuits continue to progress with oral arguments before the U.S. Court of Appeals scheduled for November 16, and we expect a decision in this case by mid-2017. We continue to believe that the business case for this pipeline is compelling as the northeast lacks adequate access to low-cost supplies of natural gas that this pipeline provides.
Before I turn it over to Steve, I'd like to highlight on Slide 8 several of our recent operational accomplishments made possible by the dedication of our employees. As many of you know, we managed through 2 major hurricanes this fall. After Hurricane Hermine hit the southeast in early September, our team restored power quickly and safely for more than 200,000 Florida customers and 150,000 Carolinas customers. Then Hurricane Matthew, a historic storm, swept through our Florida and Carolinas service territories in October. The storm tragically resulted in multiple fatalities and widespread flooding, impacting many of our customers across the Carolinas. The flooding, wind and rain caused extensive damage to our energy system, leaving more than 1.7 million customers without power. Piedmont's infrastructure experienced minimal damage.
In terms of customer outages, Hurricane Matthew is the fifth worst storm to hit the combined Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress service area with damage similar in scale to Hurricane Floyd in 1999 and Hurricane Hugo in 1989. In response, we mobilized more than 10,000 workers to rebuild the system and restore power for our customers. We continue to work with the hardest hit areas as they look to recover and rebuild. I'm extremely proud of our employees and their unwavering commitment to serving our communities.
Given the magnitude of the storm, we intend to request a deferral of incremental costs and we'll ask that they be considered as part of our next base rate cases for Duke Energy Progress, where the majority of damage occurred. Our current estimate of incremental costs is approximately $200 million. We're still in the process of refining this preliminary cost estimate.
Moving to our generation fleet results in the quarter. Our fleet responded well to the hot summer weather. Our nuclear units at Catawba and McGuire set new generation records, and our Edwardsport plant set a new station record for generation in the quarter. 
Also in the third quarter, Duke Energy was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index for the 11th consecutive year. This consistent run demonstrates the effectiveness of our sustainability, economic, environmental and social efforts. This is a significant achievement earned by the entire company.  
In addition, we were named on Site Selection Magazine's annual list of Top 10 Utilities in Economic Development for the 12th consecutive year, another example of our focus on developing our communities and growing our customer base. Through September, our economic development efforts have yielded almost $3 billion of investment and more than 10,000 jobs across our service territories.
In conclusion, I'm very pleased with our progress on the transition of the portfolio and in delivering strong financial results in the quarter and building momentum for a strong finish to 2016. We're advancing our strategic capital investments and maintaining our focus on operational excellence and value to our customers. Our portfolio of businesses is well positioned to deliver strong, predictable earnings and cash flows to our investors.
Now let me turn to call over to Steve."
267850,404012791,1074367,"Duke Energy Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2016",2016-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Duke Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lynn. Today, I will walk you through the key drivers from the third quarter as well as provide updates on the current retail volume trends within our service territories and regulatory activity underway in our jurisdictions. I'll close with a look",1464,"Thanks, Lynn. Today, I will walk you through the key drivers from the third quarter as well as provide updates on the current retail volume trends within our service territories and regulatory activity underway in our jurisdictions. I'll close with a look ahead to 2017 and our key investor considerations. 
I'll start with the quarterly results on Slide 9 and discuss our adjusted earnings per share variances compared to the prior year quarter. For more detailed information on segment variances versus last year and a reconciliation of reported results to adjusted results, please refer to the supporting materials that accompany today's press release and presentation. As a reminder, this is the last quarter for our existing segment structure. We begin managing the business under new segments at the beginning of the fourth quarter upon the completion of the Piedmont acquisition. 
On a reported or GAAP basis, 2016 third quarter earnings per share were $1.70 compared to $1.35 last year. Third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.68 compared to $1.47 in the third quarter of 2015. 
Regulated Utilities quarterly adjusted results increased by $0.34 per share quarter-over-quarter. This strong performance was primarily driven by warmer weather across all of our service territories, which added $0.14. We also recognized a lower effective tax rate primarily due to prior year tax adjustments, which contributed to an $0.08 increase. 
Higher revenues from energy efficiency riders in the Carolinas and grid investment riders in Ohio continue to be favorable drivers of earnings, adding $0.05 to results for the quarter. Weather-normal retail volumes also added $0.04, with growth primarily in the Carolinas and Florida. I'll discuss those details in a moment. 
Finally our cost management efforts across the business provided a $0.02 uplift despite additional storm costs in the third quarter. Our ongoing commitment to managing O&M costs and finding efficiencies throughout our business positions us to achieve our goal of maintaining a flat O&M cost structure through 2020.
Commercial Portfolio results increased by $0.02 per share in the third quarter. The higher results were largely driven by additional wind and solar facilities placed online this year and more favorable wind resources throughout the summer months.
Moving on, Other was down $0.14 for the quarter largely driven by a higher effective tax rate due to prior year tax benefits and a current year unfavorable audit settlement. These unfavorable tax items offset the favorable tax variance in the Regulated Utilities segment. For the year, we continue to expect a total company adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 31% compared to our original expectation of 32% to 33%. This is primarily due to the favorable tax benefit realized at international in the first quarter.
Our first 3 quarters have been strong, reflecting favorable weather and strong execution on the part of our team. As we look to the fourth quarter, I would like to share a few considerations. First, Piedmont will contribute $0.03 to $0.05 in the fourth quarter. In Regulated Utilities, we have taken the opportunity to replan some of our O&M work, including advancing a fossil plant outage and some distribution projects into the fourth quarter. In addition, the prior year results included a favorable Ohio regulatory settlement. 
Meanwhile, at Commercial Renewables, we expect a relatively flat quarter compared to the prior year and for the segment to finish below original expectations for the full year. Market returns continue to decline, and we remain disciplined on renewables capital deployment. With our strong year-to-date results through the third quarter and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we're trending toward the high end of our original guidance range, excluding costs associated with Hurricane Matthew.
Moving on to Slide 10, let's review our retail customer volume trends. On a rolling 12-month basis, weather-normalized retail load was 0.6% through the third quarter and continues to track our long-term expectations for approximately 0.5% load growth. Overall, we are pleased with the strength of our residential volumes, which continue to grow at 1.1% over the last 12 months. A strong 1.4% annual increase in the number of new customers drives this growth. Utility-sponsored energy efficiency programs and more efficient building codes and standards continually -- continue to partially offset this customer growth. Recently, we have seen the decline in usage per customer begin to level out a bit. Looking forward, positive trends and new job and wage growth as well as a recovery in housing are positive signs for continued residential growth. Moving to the customer class, we experienced an increase of 0.4% over the rolling 12 months, an improvement compared to last quarter. 
Commercial usage is slowly improving across our jurisdictions as nonmanufacturing employment improves and office vacancies continue to decline even with new office space being added. These improvements are somewhat offset by commercial businesses supporting manufacturing. In addition, we continue to see declines in the government and education sectors, especially in the Midwest. 
In the industrial class, we see growth of 0.2% on a rolling 12-month basis. Industries that support construction and automotive continue to show resilience. However, the metals industry is once again experiencing declines.  We will closely monitor economic conditions and our customer usage patterns throughout the remainder of the year and into 2017.
Moving to Slide 11, let me take a moment to discuss the status of the DEP South Carolina rate case. In October, we reached a constructive settlement with the Office of Regulatory Staff and other key intervening parties. The settlement was reviewed by the Public Service Commission of South Carolina during a hearing earlier this week. The major components of the settlement were largely consistent with our initial filing. We requested a $79 million increase with an allowed ROE of 10.75% and equity structure of 53% and a rate base of $1.3 billion. Our significant energy infrastructure investments were the key drivers for the proposed increase. 
The settlement provides for a $56 million revenue increase and an allowed ROE of 10.1%. We also agreed to a 53% equity structure and a $1.3 billion rate base. If the settlement is approved as filed, new rates are expected to be effective in January 2017. Customer rates will be implemented over a 2-year period. In year 1, customer bills will increase by $38 million and step up to $56 million in year 2. DEP will reduce its cost of removal liability by $18 million in year 1 to provide a neutral earnings impact to the company in the first year of rate implementation. Based on the settlement, coal ash costs that we had incurred will be recovered with a return over a 15-year amortization period, and we agreed to defer any future rate cases to 2019. This settlement is an important milestone, and we expect a [audio gap] order from the commission in the coming weeks.
With the transition in our business portfolio, I want to provide you some broad parameters for 2017 on Slide 12. Consistent with past practice, we will provide guidance for 2017, including our 5-year capital plans during our February earnings call. We anticipate growth in the core businesses, Electric and Gas Infrastructure and Commercial Renewables, of about 5% off of the $4.30 midpoint of our 2016 adjusted earnings per share guidance range. Accretion from Piedmont is expected to be $0.08 to $0.10 per share in 2017, a strong first year, reflecting the benefits of early integration. We will provide additional perspective on growth capital in all of our segments in February. 
International results, through closing, use of sales proceeds and National Methanol, are expected to contribute between $0.10 and $0.15 per share in 2017. National Methanol will move to Other and contribute $0.05 per share based on prevailing Brent crude oil prices and our ongoing ownership percentage, which is expected to step down in 2017. The use of proceeds from the sale of our Latin American generation assets of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion will displace future financings at the holding company and will also contribute about $0.05 per share based on current interest rates. We estimate first quarter operating results from our International business could also add up to $0.05 per share of earnings, depending upon the timing of the close. We look forward to further discussion of 2017 and beyond in February.
I'll close with Slide 13. Duke Energy has tremendous scale, offering an attractive investor value proposition, which includes balanced growth in earnings and reliable dividends over time. Within months, we expect to complete our multiyear portfolio transition, affirming our commitment to provide low-risk, high-quality earnings and cash flows and supporting our long-term growth projections. We will continue to invest in cleaner energy resources, modernize the energy grid and build our natural gas platform and provide enhanced services for our customers.
With that, let's open the line for your questions."

We had a strong third quarter at Duke Energy, delivering very solid financial results and demonstrating significant progress in the execution of our business portfolio transition. We closed the Piedmont Natural Gas acquisition, and we also announced the sale of our Latin American assets. This transition of our business portfolio strengthens our franchise of high-quality, stable and growing energy infrastructure business.
Starting on Slide 4, let me begin with our business portfolio transition. On October 3, we closed the Piedmont Natural Gas acquisition following approval by the North Carolina Utilities Commission. We're delighted to bring Piedmont's industry-leading expertise into our company as we expand our natural gas platform, supporting our transition to a lower-carbon future and growing investments in important natural gas infrastructure. We've worked with and admired Piedmont for many years, and our post-closing integration efforts are well underway. 
In addition, on October 10, we announced agreements with China Three Gorges Corporation and I Squared Capital to sell our Latin American generation assets. China Three Gorges will buy our assets in Brazil for approximately $1.2 billion, including the assumption of debt. We expect to complete the transaction in 2 to 4 months once we receive required approvals in Brazil and China. We're making good progress. In fact, this morning, the Brazilian Antitrust Agency preliminarily approved the transaction without any restrictions. This begins a 15-day statutory objection period, and if no objections are filed, the approval will become final.
I Squared Capital will buy our remaining assets in South and Central America in a separate transaction also valued at approximately $1.2 billion. We expect to close this transaction within the next 3 to 5 months. The proceeds available will be used to reduce Duke Energy holding company debt. Steve will discuss additional implications from the transaction in a moment. Both of these announcements demonstrate our commitment to deliver more projectable growth in earnings and cash flows. 
I'm proud of our team for the extensive work on these transactions as well as the continued dedication of our employees at Duke Energy International, who have managed the business very well throughout the process. We look forward to a timing -- timely close as we exit our Latin American generation business, and we're pleased to welcome the Piedmont employees to Duke Energy.
Turning to Slide 5. Consistent with the transition of the portfolio, today, we are announcing the realignment of our financial reporting segment structure beginning with our fourth quarter results. Prospectively, we will discuss performance for 3 primary business segments: Electric Utilities & Infrastructure, Gas Utilities & Infrastructure and Commercial Renewables. 
Electric Utilities & Infrastructure will be comprised of our regulated electric utilities in the Carolinas, Florida and the Midwest. This segment will also include our commercial transmission investments. As previously noted, Frank Yoho will lead our Gas Utilities & Infrastructure business, which will contain: Piedmont; our local gas distribution companies in Ohio and Kentucky; and our gas pipeline investments, such as Atlantic Coast Pipeline, Sabal Trail, Constitution and Piedmont's existing joint venture investments. With the realignment of our business, Commercial Renewables will become its own segment. Meanwhile, Other will continue to include holding company interest expense and our captive insurance results. Other will also begin to include our National Methanol equity investment in the fourth quarter. With the divestiture of the Latin American generation business, the balance of the International segment will be classified as discontinued operations starting in the fourth quarter of 2016. We will continue to report the earnings of this business and adjusted earnings per share until closing.
Turning to Slide 6, let me update you on our strong financial results for the quarter. We announced third quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $1.68, an increase of $0.21 from the prior year. We generated higher adjusted earnings with strong results in our Regulated Utilities due to warmer summer weather and our continued commitment to cost management and operational excellence. As a result of the strong results through the first 3 quarters of the year, we are trending toward the high end of our original 2016 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $4.50 to $4.70 per share. This excludes costs associated with Hurricane Matthew.
Turning to Slide 7. We're continuing to move forward and deliver strong results in our $30 billion growth capital plan. This plan aligns with our vision to invest capital in smarter energy solutions that generate cleaner energy and modernize the grid, creating value for customers and delivering earnings and dividend growth for our shareholders. 
Here are a few updates. Site preparation activities are underway in our nearly $1 billion Western Carolinas Modernization Project with plant construction anticipated to begin in early 2017. This project allows us to retire our Asheville coal units early, build cleaner natural gas units and install renewable energy on the site. The project is on track to be completed by late 2019. 
In September, we worked with the Indiana Office of the Utility Consumer Council to develop a plan to modernize and upgrade the Markland Hydro Station. This multiyear effort will increase the output of the nearly 50-year-old facility, producing low-cost, carbon-free electricity for Indiana residents for years to come. Per the agreement, the approximately $150 million investment and related expenses will be recovered through the recently approved renewable energy rider. 
Last week, we reissued an RFP for 400 megawatts of renewable energy in our Duke Energy Carolinas service territory. This furthers our efforts to provide renewable energy to our customers. Proposed projects must be in operation by December 31, 2018. 
Also in North Carolina, we recently filed for a Certificate Of Public Convenience and Necessity, or CPCN, for our Duke University combined heat-and-power project. The projects will consist of a natural gas volume generator that also provides steam service to the campus and lowers the university's carbon dioxide emissions by 25%. Combined heat-and-power projects represent an attractive energy solution that could benefit many of our universities and other large industrial customers in the years to come.
Shifting to our natural gas infrastructure investments, we continue to make investments in integrity management programs within our local distribution companies in advanced construction of our pipeline projects. 
Let me briefly update you on Sabal Trail, Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Constitution. Construction on the Sabal Trail pipeline began in August, and the project remains on track for a June 2017 in-service date. Since our last earnings call, we received FERC's Notice of Schedule for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. Based on the schedule, we expect to receive the final FERC certificate and begin construction in the third or fourth quarter of 2017. This schedule moves our expected in-service date to the second half of 2019. 
In September, the project partners announced the selection of Spring Ridge Constructors as the lead construction contractor, representing a significant milestone for the pipeline. This firm is a joint venture, a forward-leading U.S  natural gas pipeline construction company with extensive experience in similar projects. 
As you recall, we have now added Piedmont's 24% stake in the Constitution pipeline to our portfolio. FERC approved this project in December of 2014. However, in April of 2016, the New York Department of Environmental Conservation, DEC, refused to grant the project's water quality certificate. In response, the project filed lawsuits, with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and the U.S. District Court of Northern New York, seeking to overturn DEC's action. Both of these lawsuits continue to progress with oral arguments before the U.S. Court of Appeals scheduled for November 16, and we expect a decision in this case by mid-2017. We continue to believe that the business case for this pipeline is compelling as the northeast lacks adequate access to low-cost supplies of natural gas that this pipeline provides.
Before I turn it over to Steve, I'd like to highlight on Slide 8 several of our recent operational accomplishments made possible by the dedication of our employees. As many of you know, we managed through 2 major hurricanes this fall. After Hurricane Hermine hit the southeast in early September, our team restored power quickly and safely for more than 200,000 Florida customers and 150,000 Carolinas customers. Then Hurricane Matthew, a historic storm, swept through our Florida and Carolinas service territories in October. The storm tragically resulted in multiple fatalities and widespread flooding, impacting many of our customers across the Carolinas. The flooding, wind and rain caused extensive damage to our energy system, leaving more than 1.7 million customers without power. Piedmont's infrastructure experienced minimal damage.
In terms of customer outages, Hurricane Matthew is the fifth worst storm to hit the combined Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress service area with damage similar in scale to Hurricane Floyd in 1999 and Hurricane Hugo in 1989. In response, we mobilized more than 10,000 workers to rebuild the system and restore power for our customers. We continue to work with the hardest hit areas as they look to recover and rebuild. I'm extremely proud of our employees and their unwavering commitment to serving our communities.
Given the magnitude of the storm, we intend to request a deferral of incremental costs and we'll ask that they be considered as part of our next base rate cases for Duke Energy Progress, where the majority of damage occurred. Our current estimate of incremental costs is approximately $200 million. We're still in the process of refining this preliminary cost estimate.
Moving to our generation fleet results in the quarter. Our fleet responded well to the hot summer weather. Our nuclear units at Catawba and McGuire set new generation records, and our Edwardsport plant set a new station record for generation in the quarter. 
Also in the third quarter, Duke Energy was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index for the 11th consecutive year. This consistent run demonstrates the effectiveness of our sustainability, economic, environmental and social efforts. This is a significant achievement earned by the entire company.  
In addition, we were named on Site Selection Magazine's annual list of Top 10 Utilities in Economic Development for the 12th consecutive year, another example of our focus on developing our communities and growing our customer base. Through September, our economic development efforts have yielded almost $3 billion of investment and more than 10,000 jobs across our service territories.
In conclusion, I'm very pleased with our progress on the transition of the portfolio and in delivering strong financial results in the quarter and building momentum for a strong finish to 2016. We're advancing our strategic capital investments and maintaining our focus on operational excellence and value to our customers. Our portfolio of businesses is well positioned to deliver strong, predictable earnings and cash flows to our investors.
Now let me turn to call over to Steve."

I'll close with a look",1464,"Thanks, Lynn. Today, I will walk you through the key drivers from the third quarter as well as provide updates on the current retail volume trends within our service territories and regulatory activity underway in our jurisdictions. I'll close with a look ahead to 2017 and our key investor considerations. 
I'll start with the quarterly results on Slide 9 and discuss our adjusted earnings per share variances compared to the prior year quarter. For more detailed information on segment variances versus last year and a reconciliation of reported results to adjusted results, please refer to the supporting materials that accompany today's press release and presentation. As a reminder, this is the last quarter for our existing segment structure. We begin managing the business under new segments at the beginning of the fourth quarter upon the completion of the Piedmont acquisition. 
On a reported or GAAP basis, 2016 third quarter earnings per share were $1.70 compared to $1.35 last year. Third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.68 compared to $1.47 in the third quarter of 2015. 
Regulated Utilities quarterly adjusted results increased by $0.34 per share quarter-over-quarter. This strong performance was primarily driven by warmer weather across all of our service territories, which added $0.14. We also recognized a lower effective tax rate primarily due to prior year tax adjustments, which contributed to an $0.08 increase. 
Higher revenues from energy efficiency riders in the Carolinas and grid investment riders in Ohio continue to be favorable drivers of earnings, adding $0.05 to results for the quarter. Weather-normal retail volumes also added $0.04, with growth primarily in the Carolinas and Florida. I'll discuss those details in a moment. 
Finally our cost management efforts across the business provided a $0.02 uplift despite additional storm costs in the third quarter. Our ongoing commitment to managing O&M costs and finding efficiencies throughout our business positions us to achieve our goal of maintaining a flat O&M cost structure through 2020.
Commercial Portfolio results increased by $0.02 per share in the third quarter. The higher results were largely driven by additional wind and solar facilities placed online this year and more favorable wind resources throughout the summer months.
Moving on, Other was down $0.14 for the quarter largely driven by a higher effective tax rate due to prior year tax benefits and a current year unfavorable audit settlement. These unfavorable tax items offset the favorable tax variance in the Regulated Utilities segment. For the year, we continue to expect a total company adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 31% compared to our original expectation of 32% to 33%. This is primarily due to the favorable tax benefit realized at international in the first quarter.
Our first 3 quarters have been strong, reflecting favorable weather and strong execution on the part of our team. As we look to the fourth quarter, I would like to share a few considerations. First, Piedmont will contribute $0.03 to $0.05 in the fourth quarter. In Regulated Utilities, we have taken the opportunity to replan some of our O&M work, including advancing a fossil plant outage and some distribution projects into the fourth quarter. In addition, the prior year results included a favorable Ohio regulatory settlement. 
Meanwhile, at Commercial Renewables, we expect a relatively flat quarter compared to the prior year and for the segment to finish below original expectations for the full year. Market returns continue to decline, and we remain disciplined on renewables capital deployment. With our strong year-to-date results through the third quarter and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we're trending toward the high end of our original guidance range, excluding costs associated with Hurricane Matthew.
Moving on to Slide 10, let's review our retail customer volume trends. On a rolling 12-month basis, weather-normalized retail load was 0.6% through the third quarter and continues to track our long-term expectations for approximately 0.5% load growth. Overall, we are pleased with the strength of our residential volumes, which continue to grow at 1.1% over the last 12 months. A strong 1.4% annual increase in the number of new customers drives this growth. Utility-sponsored energy efficiency programs and more efficient building codes and standards continually -- continue to partially offset this customer growth. Recently, we have seen the decline in usage per customer begin to level out a bit. Looking forward, positive trends and new job and wage growth as well as a recovery in housing are positive signs for continued residential growth. Moving to the customer class, we experienced an increase of 0.4% over the rolling 12 months, an improvement compared to last quarter. 
Commercial usage is slowly improving across our jurisdictions as nonmanufacturing employment improves and office vacancies continue to decline even with new office space being added. These improvements are somewhat offset by commercial businesses supporting manufacturing. In addition, we continue to see declines in the government and education sectors, especially in the Midwest. 
In the industrial class, we see growth of 0.2% on a rolling 12-month basis. Industries that support construction and automotive continue to show resilience. However, the metals industry is once again experiencing declines.  We will closely monitor economic conditions and our customer usage patterns throughout the remainder of the year and into 2017.
Moving to Slide 11, let me take a moment to discuss the status of the DEP South Carolina rate case. In October, we reached a constructive settlement with the Office of Regulatory Staff and other key intervening parties. The settlement was reviewed by the Public Service Commission of South Carolina during a hearing earlier this week. The major components of the settlement were largely consistent with our initial filing. We requested a $79 million increase with an allowed ROE of 10.75% and equity structure of 53% and a rate base of $1.3 billion. Our significant energy infrastructure investments were the key drivers for the proposed increase. 
The settlement provides for a $56 million revenue increase and an allowed ROE of 10.1%. We also agreed to a 53% equity structure and a $1.3 billion rate base. If the settlement is approved as filed, new rates are expected to be effective in January 2017. Customer rates will be implemented over a 2-year period. In year 1, customer bills will increase by $38 million and step up to $56 million in year 2. DEP will reduce its cost of removal liability by $18 million in year 1 to provide a neutral earnings impact to the company in the first year of rate implementation. Based on the settlement, coal ash costs that we had incurred will be recovered with a return over a 15-year amortization period, and we agreed to defer any future rate cases to 2019. This settlement is an important milestone, and we expect a [audio gap] order from the commission in the coming weeks.
With the transition in our business portfolio, I want to provide you some broad parameters for 2017 on Slide 12. Consistent with past practice, we will provide guidance for 2017, including our 5-year capital plans during our February earnings call. We anticipate growth in the core businesses, Electric and Gas Infrastructure and Commercial Renewables, of about 5% off of the $4.30 midpoint of our 2016 adjusted earnings per share guidance range. Accretion from Piedmont is expected to be $0.08 to $0.10 per share in 2017, a strong first year, reflecting the benefits of early integration. We will provide additional perspective on growth capital in all of our segments in February. 
International results, through closing, use of sales proceeds and National Methanol, are expected to contribute between $0.10 and $0.15 per share in 2017. National Methanol will move to Other and contribute $0.05 per share based on prevailing Brent crude oil prices and our ongoing ownership percentage, which is expected to step down in 2017. The use of proceeds from the sale of our Latin American generation assets of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion will displace future financings at the holding company and will also contribute about $0.05 per share based on current interest rates. We estimate first quarter operating results from our International business could also add up to $0.05 per share of earnings, depending upon the timing of the close. We look forward to further discussion of 2017 and beyond in February.
I'll close with Slide 13. Duke Energy has tremendous scale, offering an attractive investor value proposition, which includes balanced growth in earnings and reliable dividends over time. Within months, we expect to complete our multiyear portfolio transition, affirming our commitment to provide low-risk, high-quality earnings and cash flows and supporting our long-term growth projections. We will continue to invest in cleaner energy resources, modernize the energy grid and build our natural gas platform and provide enhanced services for our customers.
With that, let's open the line for your questions."

Michael, I would direct you to Slide 16 of the deck, which gives you a comparison of where we are for year-to-date results against original expectations. So you see Commercial has delivered about $65 million of net income against our original expectations of $140 million. We are not expecting that we'll deliver $140 million for '16. Some of that shortfall will be the result of lesser capital deployment. As Steve mentioned, returns have been very market-driven, so great for customers, but low for investors. And then we continue to expect to be slightly behind on wind and solar resources as a result of what we've seen in weather patterns. So those are the 2 things I'd point to."
