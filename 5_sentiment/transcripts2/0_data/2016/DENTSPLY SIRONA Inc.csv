Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our year-end call. I will start with a few overview comments, and then I've asked Jim to comment on our new product pipeline and our growth investments, those growth investments being funded by our efficiency program. And Chris will close with a deeper dive into the financial results. 
Before we start, I have a few comments on our historic merger with Sirona Dental Systems, which was first announced back on September 15 last year. As of today, we've improved -- we've received approval from both sets of shareholders, from the U.S. antitrust authorities and also from the Ukraine. We saw a couple of hurdles to clear, including the EU. We continue to believe that the merger is on track and will close this quarter. Our team remains very enthusiastic about the possibilities presented by the merger, and we're looking forward to clearing these last hurdles and completing the transaction. Beyond this brief update, today's call will be focused on the results of DENTSPLY's business stand-alone. And also, as the merger is spending, we will not be providing 2016 guidance at this time, but rather, we will provide that after the close of the transaction in due course. 
So starting with our markets. This quarter, the U.S. market continued the trends we saw earlier in the year with consistent growth in demand. It is clear the U.S. dentists continue to invest in their practice and remain highly interested in new and innovative ways to improve patient care and their workflows. In the EU, we continue to see mix market development. Overall, we saw some slowing, particularly in the north, while there were some improvement in Southern Europe in the quarter. As far as the Rest of World, currency is creating some headwinds, particularly for imported products in the many markets, however. For the most part, we see steady demand trends on a local level. 
Moving on to our results for the fourth quarter. Top line growth was once again hit pretty hard by the currency devaluation around the globe. Total growth, ex PM, was down 6.5% on an 8% negative currency impact. Constant-currency growth was up 1.5%, of which 1.0% was internal growth and 0.5% was net acquisitions. So we had both acquisitions and divestitures in that number, none of which are individually significantly. Regionally, the U.S. was up 3.1%, Europe was down 2.1% and Rest of World was up 4.6%. The global internal growth rate this closed year includes about a 1% drag or headwind from the discontinued products that we discussed in our last call. In the U.S., the strongest categories were chair-side consumables, dental specialties in our health care business, while lab was negative in the mid- to high single digits. The discontinued products reduced the U.S. growth rate by 120 basis points in the quarter. And of course, that's in the lab segment that I just mentioned. Both the U.S. and European growth rates were impacted by the discontinued products in the quarter, and I'll let Chris provide you more details on that. In Europe, we came up against a strong baseline, where we grew almost 4% last year in the fourth quarter. In that region, each of chair-side consumables, dental specialties and our other category, which includes medical, were essentially flat, while lab was down double digits, and again, that's driven heavily by the discontinued products in that segment. The other factor that continues to hurts us here is CIS, which was down high single digits in the quarter. The currency devaluation happening in that region as well as the economic situation in the CIS continues to negatively impact the dental market and our results as noted here. Rest of World, as mentioned, was up mid-single digits internally, was led by Pacific Rim, Middle East, Australia and Latin America. 
Staying with the fourth quarter. Our operating margin expanded 220 basis points on an adjusted basis in the quarter, and adjusted EPS was up 8% despite a net 8% drag on the bottom line from currency. So currency neutral, it would have been much stronger, of course. This brought us to adjusted earnings for all of 2015 to $2.62. That's up 4.8% or about 11% on a currency-neutral basis. This 2015 results a couple of cents above the high end of the range that we provided at the beginning of the year, and that's despite additional headwinds coming from currency as we move throughout the year. 
So let's take a step back and look at these results in context. As you know, we've been very focused on improving the efficiency of our business over the past 2 years. In early 2014, we established a public target to attain a 20% operating margin by 2017, and that was off a 17.6% baseline at the time. In addition, we targeted improvements and asset turns. And as a result, meaningful improvement in ROIC. In 2014, we boosted operating margins by 80 basis points to 18.4%. And this year, we boosted them another 180 basis points to 20.2%. So for the full year 2015, we've achieved the target we had set out for 2017 only a couple of years in advance of the target date. At the same time, we're able to improve the asset turns, accelerate cash flow and grew our ROIC from the 8% range at the end of 2011, back firmly into our target zone of 12% to 15%, where we exited 2015. This improvement happened without a lot of leverage from market growth, particularly in the EU. This required a lot of hard work and creativity on the part of our employees, and I want to thank them for all their efforts to put forth -- they put forth to accomplish this result. We do feel pretty good about these results, although we acknowledge there's been some inconsistency on the top line and in part that does reflect some distraction and some disruption from the global efficiency program that we've implemented. As we move into 2016, we're now implementing growth investments designed to accelerate internal growth. These investments will be funded from further savings from the efficiency program, which is now entering its third year. And of course, this is the exciting part of the program and our employees are highly engaged and energized by the opportunity to reinvest and grow at a faster pace on the top line. 
Before passing the call on for additional remarks from Jim and Chris, I'd like to add that our balance sheet is now in very good shape. In 2015, we effectively paid down another $240 million on a net debt basis, and our net debt-to-cap ratio is now in the 27% range, and the leverage ratio is below 1.5x. Said another way, believe we're in very good shape to use our balance sheet more aggressively as we move forward. 
So overall, we feel like we're in very good place, and we should build our future with Sirona. I would add that we are very excited and highly engaged in preparing for our future together with the Sirona employees and executive team. Our pending merger has very high potential. And together, we believe we can advance dentistry at a much faster pace. From single-digit -- single-visit dentistry to new and improved packet solution and workflows, we truly believe that the new DENTSPLY SIRONA will set the bar very high and be able to drive additional advancements for dentists and patients, increase opportunities for our employees, and of course, provide a compelling value proposition for our shareholders. 
And with that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Jim."

I'd like to provide an overview of our R&D efforts, update the status of the global efficiency initiatives and outline the resulting reinvestments as part of this initiative. I'll then turn it over to Chris Clark for the financial review. 
From an R&D perspective, Q4 saw the launch of Ceramics Universal, a new universal composite with a unique sphere filler technology, also the Midwest Tradition Plus high-speed handpiece, offering improved liability, power and noise reduction and the new Cavitron Touch ultrasonic scaling unit, providing a smaller footprint, digital user interface and improved ergonomics. In addition, earlier endodontic launches of the Smart IQ and BDW Connect Motor platform and the Pro Taper Gold and WaveOne GOLD endofiles continue to be registered and launched in expanded geographies. Each of these launches exceeded expectations and will carry momentum into 2016. As we look at 2016, new product development will be an area of significant activity. In Q1, we will launch Sure Pro SDR Plus. This will be an advancement of SDR, the #1 bulk fill global composite and will provide higher wear resistance, expanded shapes and increased radiopacity. We will also launch -- [indiscernible] next-generation cement specific for ceramic restorations, including DENTSPLYseltzer ceric block. In addition, our health care business will be entering a new category, ball management, with the launch of [indiscernible  Often patients that utilize self-catheterization due to spinal cord injuries, cancer therapies and MS also have bowel management issues, which [indiscernible] will provide a unique solution. 
As Bret outlined, we made excellent progress on our global efficiency program launched in 2014. During this time, operating margin has moved from 17.6% in 2013 to 2015 full year margin of 20.2%. This initiative has touched every area of the business, inclusive of procurement, supply chain, logistics consolidation, key business restructuring, formation of strategic business units, creation of single country organizations and process and system alignments across most functions. We've made great progress, but we have more to do and we will work in 2016 to meet program objectives. 
While the goal to improve operating margin was a mandate, equally important was the requirement to create funding for investments to drive long-term growth. This is an imperative in what has been a lower-growth dental market. We began these investments in Q3 of this year, but they will accelerate as we enter the 2016 budget year. In 2016, we will expand R&D investment to address a broader range of projects to drive long-term growth. Additional investment in clinical education programs will expand web and e-learning-based program development as well as program curriculum. We have identified sales excellence as a key driver of share gain. Our investment will support development of global sales training programs, tool development and global CRM implementation. Finally, we will invest in sales expansion on a global basis in both developed and emerging markets. In total, we will increase our global sales force by more than 5%, our largest single-year expansion in over a decade. We strongly believe that these investments will improve top line growth trajectory of the business while we seek to further expand the operating margin through the ongoing global efficiency initiatives. 
I'd now like to turn it over to Chris Clark to review the financial results."

Good morning, everyone. I'd like to provide some detail on both our fourth quarter and our full year results by reviewing key elements of our income statement and also by providing some additional color with our balance sheet; and our cash flow. 
For the fourth quarter, sales, excluding precious metals, declined 6.5% compared to prior year, as internal growth of 100 basis points and net impact from acquisitions of 50 basis points were more than fully offset by unfavorable currency translation of 800 basis points. Reported internal growth of 1% was negatively impacted by approximately 110 basis points from product lines that have been discontinued in conjunction with our global efficiency program. 
Gross profit rate on an adjusted basis in the fourth quarter was 58.9% of sales, excluding precious metals, and an improvement of 150 basis points over prior year. This reflects favorable impacts of our global operational improvement efforts, currency and price. 
SG&A expenses on an adjusted basis were 38.9% of sales, excluding precious metals, and that's down 70 basis points compared to our rate in the fourth quarter 2014, also reflecting impacts of the global efficiency improvement initiative. Operating margin for the quarter improved by 220 basis points to 19.9% of sales, excluding precious metals, on an adjusted basis compared to 17.7% in the fourth quarter last year, reflecting the gross profit and the SG&A impacts that I just described. Currency represented a headwind to earnings in the quarter of approximately $0.05 per share. It was approximately $0.015 worse than what we anticipated around the third quarter earnings call. This reflects in particular the of the U.S. dollar versus the euro and the Swedish krona over that period. Our reported tax rate for fourth quarter was 19.1% while operating tax rate 23.2%, which is 110 basis points above our fourth quarter rate last year and about 40 basis points above our average operating tax rate for the first 3 quarters of 2015. This increase in the operating rate for the quarter was primarily the result of unfavorable geographic mix in the period. 
Net income attributable to the DENTSPLY International on an as-reported basis in the fourth quarter was $58.5 million or $0.41 per diluted share, and that compares to $84.7 million or $0.59 per diluted share in the fourth quarter 2014. These results include a number of items which are listed in the schedules in the release. 
On an adjusted basis, net earnings were $92.6 million in the quarter, up nicely from $86.6 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.65, up 8% from $0.60 in last year's fourth quarter. On a constant-currency basis, adjusted earnings per share increased by approximately 16% over last year, and that reflects a significant impact of our global operating efficiency improvement initiatives. We're very pleased with this performance as it -- and as we mentioned, are now focused on driving reinvestments into the growth initiatives that Jim described. 
Transitioning now to the full year 2015. Sales, excluding precious metals, declined by 7.6% compared to prior year. This internal growth of 2% was offset by headwinds from currency translation of 950 basis points and net acquisition divestitures of 10 basis points. Internal growth included a headwind from discontinued products of approximately 50 basis points on a global basis. Internal growth for the year the U.S. was 3.1%, including the impact of approximately 75 basis points from discontinued products. For the year, internal growth in Europe was negative 0.3%, which included about 50 basis points from the discontinued products and a slightly larger headwind from the CIS region. Internal growth for 2015 and the Rest of World region was 4.9%, reflecting internal growth of almost 8% in the emerging markets within that region. For the year, the U.S. comprised 37% of our global sales, while Europe represented 41% and the Rest of World region 22%. 
Operating margin for the year improved by 180 basis points to 22.2% of sales, excluding precious metals and on an adjusted basis, and that compares to 18.4% last year. This reflects the full year impact of our global efficiency program as well as the currency benefit moving through our cash flow hedges. On an adjusted basis, net earnings from the year -- net earnings for the year increased to $373 million from $361 million on -- in 2014, and adjusted earnings per share grew by 5% to $2.62 per diluted share in 2015 from 2,000 -- from $2.50 diluted per share in the prior year. Our results for the year include the negative impact from currency of approximately $0.16, [ph] which is about $0.02 worse than what we anticipated in our initial guidance for the year. On a constant-currency basis, adjusted earnings per share for the year increased by approximately 11% over 2014, and we're very pleased with this operating performance for the year. 
Moving on to cash flow. We're also pleased with our operating cash flow for the year of $497.4 million, although this trailed 2014's record $560.4 million. Our cash flow performance reflects comparative headwinds versus prior year from 4 items: the timing of cash tax payments, payments associated with the restructuring plans, acquisition and merger-related cost and also the prepayment of the long-term bonds that we refinanced in December. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow, less capital expenditures, was $425 million for the year, and our free credit cash flow conversion was 169% of reported net income for the year. 
As of year-end, inventories stood at 110 days, which is down 5 days compared to September and down 3 days compared to December 2014. It was a solid inventory performance in the quarter, although, as a result, we had lower absorption in our plants and slightly higher costs and inventory as we come into the new year. Account receivable days were 54 days at the end of December. That's down 6 days from prior quarter and down 1 day compared to December 2014. And the improvements in net -- in primary networking capital contributed $40 million to cash flow for the year, and that's on top of $38 million contributed in 2014. So as I've indicated on previous calls, we can't -- we believe we can continue to make significant progress over time in net working capital area as a result of the global efficiency improvement efforts. 
Capital expenditures for the year totaled $72 million. Depreciation was $79 million for the year, while amortization was $44 million. We did not execute any share buybacks in the fourth quarter. For the full year, the company repurchased approximately 2.1 million shares at an average price of $52.50 per share. We ended 2015, as Bret mentioned, with a pristine balance sheet, as net debt to capital now stands at 27.1% at year-end compared to 32.3% at the end of 2014. And our leverage ratio of net debt to EBITDA now stands at 1.45 compared to 1.87 at year-end 2014. This obviously provides us tremendous flexibility as we move into 2016 on a combined basis with Sirona. 
As we move into 2016, we are pleased with the operating performance of the business, particularly the traction from the efficiency program and our ability to translate that into growth investments and additional operating margin improvements. A headwind to keep in mind is currency. And while rates are fluctuating rapidly, at current rates, we would anticipate a headwind to earnings of the DENTSPLY stand-alone basis from 2016 of between 5% and 7%. Currency also flips from being a tailwind to operating margin rate in 2015 to becoming a headwind to that ratio in 2016. While, as Bret mentioned, we're not providing guidance at this time, I would state that we would expect positive year-on-year operating margin rate performance in 2016 despite the impacts from the currency and the growth reinvestments that were discussed earlier. 
That completes our prepared remarks. We appreciate your support. We'll now be glad to take any questions that you might have."

We talked -- continued growth in the quarter in Brazil as well. Although we're watching that economy very closely. I'd say, for us, that's a little bit higher risk than the Chinese situation at this point, although we continue to perform pretty well during this most recent quarter. Emerging markets, in general, I would say, are stable. The one exception to that is the CIS region, which is kind of getting hit very hard on 2 sides. One is on the currency and the other is on the economics coming from the dependency on oil. And that market continues to contract, but outside those -- that region, I would say the emerging markets look stable to us and they're growing."

I think oftentimes you're in a situation where you're making investments within a year with the hopes of seeing a return in that year. Those investments, quite frankly, are difficult to find. The global efficiency initiative has allowed us to make those longer-term investments like sales force, like medical education programs. The reality is those things have a pretty significant ramp. We don't see sales reps paying back in less than the year. Sometimes, it takes time for them to get training up to speed. We can expect maybe a little bit of a lift. But overall, it is an operating investment certainly in this year. But obviously, the longer-term prospects are very good, and those are the kind of the investments we need to make."

I will start with a few overview comments, and then, I'll ask Jim to comment on our new product pipeline and our growth investments, those growth investments being funded by our efficiency program. And Chris will close with a deeper dive into the financial results. 
Before we start, I have a few comments on our historic merger with Sirona Dental Systems, which was first announced back on September 15 last year. As of today, we've approved -- we've received approval from both sets of shareholders, from the U.S. antitrust authorities and also from the Ukraine. We saw a couple of hurdles to clear, including the EU. We continue to believe that the merger is on track and will close this quarter. Our team remains very enthusiastic about the possibilities presented by the merger, and we're looking forward to clearing these last hurdles in completing the transaction. Beyond this brief update, today's call will be focused on the results of DENTSPLY's business stand-alone. Also, as the merger is pending, we will not be providing 2016 guidance at this time, but rather, we will provide that after the close of the transaction in due course. 
So starting with our markets. This quarter, the U.S. market continued the trends we saw earlier in the year with consistent growth in demand. It is clear the U.S. dentists continue to invest in their practice and remain highly interested in new and innovative ways to improve patient care and their workflows. In the EU, we continue to see mix market development. Overall, we saw some slowing, particularly in the north, while there is some improvement in Southern Europe in the quarter. As far as the Rest of World, currency is creating some headwinds, particularly for imported products in the many markets. However, for the most part, we see steady demand trends on a local level. 
Moving on to our results for the fourth quarter. Top line growth was once again hit pretty hard by the currency devaluation around the globe. Total growth, ex PM, was down 6.5% on an 8% negative currency impact. Constant-currency growth was up 1.5%, of which 1.0% was internal growth and 0.5% was net acquisitions, and we had both acquisitions and divestitures in that number, none of which were individually significantly. Regionally, the U.S. was up 3.1%, Europe was down 2.1% and Rest of World was up 4.6%. The global internal growth rate disclosed year includes about a 1% drag or headwind from the discontinued products that we discussed on our last call. In the U.S., the strongest categories were chair-side consumables, dental specialties in our health care business, while lab was negative in the mid- to high single digits. The discontinued products reduced the U.S. growth rate by 120 basis points in the quarter, and, of course, that's in the lab segment that I just mentioned. Both the U.S. and European growth rates were impacted by the discontinued products in the quarter, and I'll let Chris provide you more details on that. In Europe, we came up against a strong baseline, where we grew almost 4% last year in the fourth quarter. In that region, each of chair-side consumables, dental specialties and our other category, which includes medical, were essentially flat, while lab was down double digits, and again, that's driven heavily by the discontinued products in that segment. The other factor that continues to hurt us here is CIS, which was down high single digits in the quarter. The currency devaluation happening in that region as well as the economic situation in the CIS continues to negatively impact the dental market and our results as noted here. Rest of World, as mentioned, was up mid-single digits internally, is led by Pacific Rim, Middle East, Australia and Latin America. 
Staying with the fourth quarter. Our operating margin expanded 220 basis points on an adjusted basis in the quarter, and adjusted EPS was up 8% despite a net 8% drag on the bottom line from currency. So currency neutral, it would have been much stronger, of course. This brought us to adjusted earnings for all of 2015 to $2.62. That's up 4.8% or about 11% on a currency-neutral basis. This 2015 results are couple cents above the high end of the range that we provided at the beginning of the year, and that's despite additional headwinds coming from currency as we move throughout the year. 
So let's take a step back and look at these results in context. As you know, we've been very focused on improving the efficiency of our business over the past 2 years. In early 2014, we established a public target to attain a 20% operating margin by 2017, and that was off a 17.6% baseline at the time. In addition, we targeted improvements in asset turns, and as a result, a meaningful improvement in ROIC. In 2014, we boosted operating margins by 80 basis points to 18.4%. And this year, we boosted them another 180 basis points to 20.2%. So for the full year 2015, we've achieved the target we had set out for 2017, only a couple of years in advance of the target date. At the same time, we're able to improve the asset turns, accelerate cash flow and grew our ROIC from the 8% range at the end of 2011, back firmly into our target zone of 12% to 15%, where we exited 2015. This improvement happened without a lot of leverage from market growth, particularly in the EU. This required a lot of hard work and creativity on the part of our employees, and I want to thank them for all their efforts to put forth -- they put forth to accomplish this result. We do feel pretty good about these results, although we acknowledge there's been some inconsistency on the top line and in part that does reflect some distraction and some disruption from the global efficiency program that we've implemented. As we move into 2016, we're now implementing growth investments designed to accelerate internal growth. These investments will be funded from further savings from the efficiency program, which is now entering its third year. And of course, this is the exciting part of the program and our employees are highly engaged and energized by the opportunity to reinvest and grow at a faster pace on the top line. 
Before passing the call on for additional remarks from Jim and Chris, I'd like to add that our balance sheet is now in very good shape. In 2015, we effectively paid down another $240 million on a net debt basis, and our net debt-to-cap ratio is now in the 27% range and the leverage ratio is below 1.5x. Said in another way, I believe we're in very good shape to use our balance sheet more aggressively as we move forward. 
So overall, we feel like we're in very good place, and we should build our future with Sirona. I would add that we are very excited and highly engaged in preparing for our future together with the Sirona employees and executive team. Our pending merger has very high potential. And together, we believe we can advance dentistry at a much faster pace. From single-digit -- single-visit dentistry to new and improved packaged solutions and workflows, we truly believe that the new DENTSPLY SIRONA will set the bar very high and be able to drive additional advancements for dentists and patients, increased opportunities for our employees, and of course, provide a compelling value proposition for our shareholders. 
With that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Jim."

I'd like to provide an overview of our R&D efforts, update the status of the global efficiency initiative and outline the resulting reinvestments as part of this initiative. I'll then turn it over to Chris Clark for the financial review. 
From an R&D perspective, Q4 saw the launch of CeramX Universal, a new universal composite with a unique SphereTEC filler technology, also the Midwest Tradition Plus high-speed handpiece, offering improved liability, power and noise reduction and the new Cavitron Touch ultrasonic scaling unit, providing a smaller footprint, digital user interface and improved ergonomics. In addition, earlier endodontic launches of the X-Smart iQ and VDW.Connect Motor platform and the ProTaper Gold and WaveOne GOLD endo files continued to be registered and launched in expanded geographies. Each of these launches exceeded expectations and will carry momentum into 2016. As we look at 2016, new product development will be an area of significant activity. In Q1, we will launch SureFil SDR Plus. This will be an advancement of SDR, the #1 bulk fill flowable composite and will provide higher wear resistance, expanded shades and increased radiopacity. We will also launch Calibra Ceram, the next-generation cement specific for ceramic restorations, including DENTSPLY CELTRA CEREC block. In addition, our health care business will be entering a new category, bowel management, with the launch of NAVINA. Often patients that utilize self-catheterization due to spinal cord injuries, cancer therapies and MS also have bowel management issues, which NAVINA will provide a unique solution. 
As Bret outlined, we made excellent progress on our global efficiency program launched in 2014. During this time, operating margin has moved from 17.6% in 2013 to a 2015 full year margin of 20.2%. This initiative has touched every area of the business, inclusive of procurement and supply chain, logistic consolidation, key business restructuring, formation of strategic business units, creation of single-country organizations and process and system alignment across most functions. We've made great progress, but we have more to do and we will work in 2016 to meet the program objectives. 
While the goal to improve operating margin was a mandate, equally important was the requirement to create funding for investments to drive long-term growth. This is an imperative in what has been a lower-growth dental market. We began these investments in Q3 of this year, but they will accelerate as we enter the 2016 budget year. In 2016, we will expand R&D investment to address the broader range of projects to drive long-term growth. Additional investment in clinical education programs will expand web and e-learning-based program development as well as program curriculum. We have identified sales excellence as a key driver of share gain. Our investment will support development of global sales training programs, tool development and global CRM implementation. Finally, we will invest in sales expansion on a global basis in both developed and emerging markets. In total, we will increase our global sales force by more than 5%, our largest single-year expansion in over a decade. We strongly believe that these investments will improve top line growth trajectory of the business, while we seek to further expand the operating margin through the ongoing global efficiency initiatives. 
I'd now like to turn it over to Chris Clark to review the financial results."

Good morning, everyone. I'd like to provide some detail on both our fourth quarter and our full year results by reviewing key elements of our income statement and also by providing some additional color on both our balance sheet and our cash flow. 
For the fourth quarter, sales, excluding precious metals, declined 6.5% compared to prior year, as internal growth of 100 basis points and net impact from acquisitions of 50 basis points were more than fully offset by unfavorable currency translation of 800 basis points. Reported internal growth of 1% was negatively impacted by approximately 110 basis points from product lines that have been discontinued in conjunction with our global efficiency program. 
Gross profit rate on an adjusted basis in the fourth quarter was 58.9% of sales, excluding precious metals, and improvement of 150 basis points over prior year. This reflects favorable impacts of our global operational improvement efforts, currency and price. 
SG&A expenses on an adjusted basis were 38.9% of sales, excluding precious metals, and that's down 70 basis points compared to our rate in the fourth quarter of 2014, also reflecting impacts of the global efficiency improvement initiative. Operating margin for the quarter improved by 220 basis points to 19.9% of sales, excluding precious metals, on an adjusted basis compared to 17.7% in the fourth quarter last year, reflecting the gross profit and the SG&A impacts that I just described. Currency represented a headwind to earnings in the quarter of approximately $0.05 per share. It was approximately $0.015 worse than what we anticipated on the third quarter earnings call. This reflects, in particular, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the euro and the Swedish krona over that period. Our reported tax rate for fourth quarter was 19.1%, while our operating tax rate was 23.2%, which was 110 basis points above our fourth quarter rate last year and about 40 basis points above our average operating tax rate for the first 3 quarters of 2015. This increase in the operating rate for the quarter was primarily the result of unfavorable geographic mix in the period. 
Net income attributable to the DENTSPLY International on an as-reported basis in the fourth quarter was $58.5 million or $0.41 per diluted share, and that compares to $84.7 million or $0.59 per diluted share in the fourth quarter 2014. These results include a number of items which are listed in the schedules in the release. 
On an adjusted basis, net earnings were $92.6 million in the quarter, up nicely from $86.6 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.65, up 8% from $0.60 in last year's fourth quarter. On a constant-currency basis, adjusted earnings per share increased by approximately 16% over last year, and that reflects the significant impact of our global operating efficiency improvement initiatives. We're very pleased with this performance, and as we mentioned, are now focused on driving reinvestments into the growth initiatives that Jim described. 
Transitioning now to the full year 2015. Sales, excluding precious metals, declined by 7.6% compared to prior year. This internal growth of 2% was offset by headwinds from currency translation of 950 basis points and net acquisitions, divestitures of 10 basis points. Internal growth included a headwind from discontinued products of approximately 50 basis points on a global basis. Internal growth for the year in the U.S. was 3.1%, including the impact of approximately 75 basis points from discontinued products. For the year, internal growth in Europe was negative 0.3%, which included about 50 basis points from the discontinued products and a slightly larger headwind from the CIS region. Internal growth for 2015 in the Rest of World region was 4.9%, reflecting internal growth of almost 8% in the emerging markets within that region. For the year, the U.S. comprised 37% of our global sales, while Europe represented 41% and the Rest of World region 22%. 
Operating margin for the year improved by 180 basis points to 20.2% of sales, excluding precious metals, on an adjusted basis, and that compares to 18.4% last year. This reflects the full year impact of our global efficiency program as well as the currency benefit moving through our cash flow hedges. On an adjusted basis, net earnings from the year -- net earnings for the year increased to $373 million from $361 million on -- in 2014, and adjusted earnings per share grew by 5%, $2.62 per diluted share in 2015 from 2,000 -- from $2.50 per diluted share in the prior year. Our results for the year include the negative impact from currency of approximately $0.16, which is about $0.02 worse than what we anticipated in our initial guidance for the year. On a constant-currency basis, adjusted earnings per share for the year increased by approximately 11% over 2014, and we're very pleased with this operating performance for the year. 
Moving on to cash flow. We're also pleased with our operating cash flow for the year of $497.4 million, although this trailed 2014's record $560.4 million. Our cash flow performance reflects comparative headwinds versus prior year from 4 items; the timing of cash tax payments, payments associated with the restructuring plans, acquisition and merger-related costs and also the prepayment of the long-term bonds that we refinanced in December. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was $425 million for the year, and our free credit [ph] cash flow conversion was 169% of reported net income for the year. 
As of year-end, inventories stood at 110 days, which is down 5 days compared to September and down 3 days compared to December 2014. This was a pretty solid inventory performance in the quarter, although, as a result, we had lower absorption in our plants and slightly higher costs in the inventory as we [indiscernible] the new year. Account receivable days were 54 days at the end of December. That's down 6 days from prior quarter and down 1 day compared to December 2014. And the improvements in net -- in primary networking capital contributed $40 million to cash flow for the year, and that's on top of $38 million contributed in 2014. So as I've indicated on previous calls, we can't -- we believe we can continue to make significant progress over time in the net working capital area as a result of the global efficiency improvement efforts. 
Capital expenditures for the year totaled $72 million. Depreciation was $79 million for the year, while amortization was $44 million. We did not execute any share buybacks during the fourth quarter. For the full year, the company repurchased approximately 2.1 million shares at an average price of $52.50 per share. We ended 2015, as Bret mentioned, with a pristine balance sheet, as net debt-to-capital now stands at 27.1% at year-end compared to 32.3% at the end of 2014. And our leverage ratio of net debt to EBITDA now stands at 1.45 compared to 1.87 at year-end 2014. This obviously provides us tremendous flexibility as we move into 2016 on a combined basis with Sirona. 
As we move into 2016, we are pleased with the operating performance of the business, particularly, the traction from the efficiency program and our ability to translate that into growth investments and additional operating margin improvements. A headwind to keep in mind is currency. And while rates are fluctuating rapidly, at current rates, we would anticipate a headwind to earnings of the DENTSPLY stand-alone business in 2016 between 5% and 7%. Currency also flips from being a tailwind to operating margin rate in 2015 to becoming a headwind to that ratio in 2016. While, as Bret mentioned, we're not providing guidance at this time, I would state that we would expect positive year-on-year operating margin rate performance in 2016 despite the impacts from the currency and the growth reinvestments that were discussed earlier. 
That completes our prepared remarks. We appreciate your support. We'll now be glad to take any questions that you might have."

The number of people entering the profession is significant. And dentistry is moving from kind of a street-corner profession into a professional environment. So the growth there is still good. We saw continued growth in the quarter in Brazil as well. Although we're watching that economy very closely. I'd say, for us, that's a little bit higher risk than the Chinese situation at this point, although we continue to perform pretty well during this most recent quarter. Emerging markets, in general, I would say, are stable. The one exception to that is the CIS region, which is kind of getting hit very hard on 2 sides; one is on the currency and the other is on the economics coming from the dependency on oil. And that market continues to contract, but outside those -- that region, I would say, the emerging markets still look stable to us and they're growing."

We don't see sales reps paying back in less than a year. Sometimes, it takes time for them to get training up to speed. We can expect maybe a little bit of a lift, but, overall, it is an operating investment certainly in this year. But obviously, the longer-term prospects are very good, and those are the new kind of investments we need to make."

Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our year-end call. I will start with a few overview comments, and then, I'll ask Jim to comment on our new product pipeline and our growth investments, those growth investments being funded by our efficiency program. And Chris will close with a deeper dive into the financial results. 
Before we start, I have a few comments on our historic merger with Sirona Dental Systems, which was first announced back on September 15 last year. As of today, we've approved -- we've received approval from both sets of shareholders, from the U.S. antitrust authorities and also from the Ukraine. We saw a couple of hurdles to clear, including the EU. We continue to believe that the merger is on track and will close this quarter. Our team remains very enthusiastic about the possibilities presented by the merger, and we're looking forward to clearing these last hurdles in completing the transaction. Beyond this brief update, today's call will be focused on the results of DENTSPLY's business stand-alone. Also, as the merger is pending, we will not be providing 2016 guidance at this time, but rather, we will provide that after the close of the transaction in due course. 
So starting with our markets. This quarter, the U.S. market continued the trends we saw earlier in the year with consistent growth in demand. It is clear the U.S. dentists continue to invest in their practice and remain highly interested in new and innovative ways to improve patient care and their workflows. In the EU, we continue to see mix market development. Overall, we saw some slowing, particularly in the north, while there is some improvement in Southern Europe in the quarter. As far as the Rest of World, currency is creating some headwinds, particularly for imported products in the many markets. However, for the most part, we see steady demand trends on a local level. 
Moving on to our results for the fourth quarter. Top line growth was once again hit pretty hard by the currency devaluation around the globe. Total growth, ex PM, was down 6.5% on an 8% negative currency impact. Constant-currency growth was up 1.5%, of which 1.0% was internal growth and 0.5% was net acquisitions, and we had both acquisitions and divestitures in that number, none of which were individually significantly. Regionally, the U.S. was up 3.1%, Europe was down 2.1% and Rest of World was up 4.6%. The global internal growth rate disclosed year includes about a 1% drag or headwind from the discontinued products that we discussed on our last call. In the U.S., the strongest categories were chair-side consumables, dental specialties in our health care business, while lab was negative in the mid- to high single digits. The discontinued products reduced the U.S. growth rate by 120 basis points in the quarter, and, of course, that's in the lab segment that I just mentioned. Both the U.S. and European growth rates were impacted by the discontinued products in the quarter, and I'll let Chris provide you more details on that. In Europe, we came up against a strong baseline, where we grew almost 4% last year in the fourth quarter. In that region, each of chair-side consumables, dental specialties and our other category, which includes medical, were essentially flat, while lab was down double digits, and again, that's driven heavily by the discontinued products in that segment. The other factor that continues to hurt us here is CIS, which was down high single digits in the quarter. The currency devaluation happening in that region as well as the economic situation in the CIS continues to negatively impact the dental market and our results as noted here. Rest of World, as mentioned, was up mid-single digits internally, is led by Pacific Rim, Middle East, Australia and Latin America. 
Staying with the fourth quarter. Our operating margin expanded 220 basis points on an adjusted basis in the quarter, and adjusted EPS was up 8% despite a net 8% drag on the bottom line from currency. So currency neutral, it would have been much stronger, of course. This brought us to adjusted earnings for all of 2015 to $2.62. That's up 4.8% or about 11% on a currency-neutral basis. This 2015 results are couple cents above the high end of the range that we provided at the beginning of the year, and that's despite additional headwinds coming from currency as we move throughout the year. 
So let's take a step back and look at these results in context. As you know, we've been very focused on improving the efficiency of our business over the past 2 years. In early 2014, we established a public target to attain a 20% operating margin by 2017, and that was off a 17.6% baseline at the time. In addition, we targeted improvements in asset turns, and as a result, a meaningful improvement in ROIC. In 2014, we boosted operating margins by 80 basis points to 18.4%. And this year, we boosted them another 180 basis points to 20.2%. So for the full year 2015, we've achieved the target we had set out for 2017, only a couple of years in advance of the target date. At the same time, we're able to improve the asset turns, accelerate cash flow and grew our ROIC from the 8% range at the end of 2011, back firmly into our target zone of 12% to 15%, where we exited 2015. This improvement happened without a lot of leverage from market growth, particularly in the EU. This required a lot of hard work and creativity on the part of our employees, and I want to thank them for all their efforts to put forth -- they put forth to accomplish this result. We do feel pretty good about these results, although we acknowledge there's been some inconsistency on the top line and in part that does reflect some distraction and some disruption from the global efficiency program that we've implemented. As we move into 2016, we're now implementing growth investments designed to accelerate internal growth. These investments will be funded from further savings from the efficiency program, which is now entering its third year. And of course, this is the exciting part of the program and our employees are highly engaged and energized by the opportunity to reinvest and grow at a faster pace on the top line. 
Before passing the call on for additional remarks from Jim and Chris, I'd like to add that our balance sheet is now in very good shape. In 2015, we effectively paid down another $240 million on a net debt basis, and our net debt-to-cap ratio is now in the 27% range and the leverage ratio is below 1.5x. Said in another way, I believe we're in very good shape to use our balance sheet more aggressively as we move forward. 
So overall, we feel like we're in very good place, and we should build our future with Sirona. I would add that we are very excited and highly engaged in preparing for our future together with the Sirona employees and executive team. Our pending merger has very high potential. And together, we believe we can advance dentistry at a much faster pace. From single-digit -- single-visit dentistry to new and improved packaged solutions and workflows, we truly believe that the new DENTSPLY SIRONA will set the bar very high and be able to drive additional advancements for dentists and patients, increased opportunities for our employees, and of course, provide a compelling value proposition for our shareholders. 
With that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Jim."

I'd like to provide an overview of our R&D efforts, update the status of the global efficiency initiative and outline the resulting reinvestments as part of this initiative. I'll then turn it over to Chris Clark for the financial review. 
From an R&D perspective, Q4 saw the launch of CeramX Universal, a new universal composite with a unique SphereTEC filler technology, also the Midwest Tradition Plus high-speed handpiece, offering improved reliability, power and noise reduction and the new Cavitron Touch ultrasonic scaling unit, providing a smaller footprint, digital user interface and improved ergonomics. In addition, earlier endodontic launches of the X-Smart iQ and VDW.Connect Motor platform and the ProTaper Gold and WaveOne GOLD endo files continued to be registered and launched in expanded geographies. Each of these launches exceeded expectations and will carry momentum into 2016. As we look at 2016, new product development will be an area of significant activity. In Q1, we will launch SureFil SDR Plus. This will be an advancement of SDR, the #1 bulk fill flowable composite and will provide higher wear resistance, expanded shades and increased radiopacity. We will also launch Calibra Ceram, the next-generation cement specific for ceramic restorations, including DENTSPLY CELTRA CEREC block. In addition, our health care business will be entering a new category, bowel management, with the launch of NAVINA. Often patients that utilize self-catheterization due to spinal cord injuries, cancer therapies and MS also have bowel management issues, which NAVINA will provide a unique solution. 
As Bret outlined, we made excellent progress on our global efficiency program launched in 2014. During this time, operating margin has moved from 17.6% in 2013 to a 2015 full year margin of 20.2%. This initiative has touched every area of the business, inclusive of procurement and supply chain, logistic consolidation, key business restructuring, formation of strategic business units, creation of single-country organizations and process and system alignment across most functions. We've made great progress, but we have more to do and we will work in 2016 to meet the program objectives. 
While the goal to improve operating margin was a mandate, equally important was the requirement to create funding for investments to drive long-term growth. This is an imperative in what has been a lower-growth dental market. We began these investments in Q3 of this year, but they will accelerate as we enter the 2016 budget year. In 2016, we will expand R&D investment to address the broader range of projects to drive long-term growth. Additional investment in clinical education programs will expand web and e-learning-based program development as well as program curriculum. We have identified sales excellence as a key driver of share gain. Our investment will support development of global sales training programs, tool development and global CRM implementation. Finally, we will invest in sales expansion on a global basis in both developed and emerging markets. In total, we will increase our global sales force by more than 5%, our largest single-year expansion in over a decade. We strongly believe that these investments will improve the top line growth trajectory of the business, while we seek to further expand the operating margin through the ongoing global efficiency initiatives. 
I'd now like to turn it over to Chris Clark to review the financial results."

Good morning, everyone. I'd like to provide some detail on both our fourth quarter and our full year results by reviewing key elements of our income statement and also by providing some additional color on both our balance sheet and our cash flow. 
For the fourth quarter, sales, excluding precious metals, declined 6.5% compared to prior year, as internal growth of 100 basis points and net impact from acquisitions of 50 basis points were more than fully offset by unfavorable currency translation of 800 basis points. Reported internal growth of 1% was negatively impacted by approximately 110 basis points from product lines that have been discontinued in conjunction with our global efficiency program. 
Gross profit rate on an adjusted basis in the fourth quarter was 58.9% of sales, excluding precious metals, an improvement of 150 basis points over prior year. This reflects favorable impacts of our global operational improvement efforts, currency and price. 
SG&A expenses on an adjusted basis were 38.9% of sales, excluding precious metals, and that's down 70 basis points compared to our rate in the fourth quarter of 2014, also reflecting impacts of the global efficiency improvement initiative. Operating margin for the quarter improved by 220 basis points to 19.9% of sales, excluding precious metals, on an adjusted basis compared to 17.7% in the fourth quarter last year, reflecting the gross profit and the SG&A impacts that I just described. Currency represented a headwind to earnings in the quarter of approximately $0.05 per share. It was approximately $0.015 worse than what we anticipated on the third quarter earnings call. This reflects, in particular, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the euro and the Swedish krona over that period. Our reported tax rate for fourth quarter was 19.1%, while our operating tax rate was 23.2%, which was 110 basis points above our fourth quarter rate last year and about 40 basis points above our average operating tax rate for the first 3 quarters of 2015. This increase in the operating rate for the quarter was primarily the result of unfavorable geographic mix in the period. 
Net income attributable to the DENTSPLY International on an as-reported basis in the fourth quarter was $58.5 million or $0.41 per diluted share, and that compares to $84.7 million or $0.59 per diluted share in the fourth quarter 2014. These results include a number of items which are listed in the schedules in the release. 
On an adjusted basis, net earnings were $92.6 million in the quarter, up nicely from $86.6 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.65, up 8% from $0.60 in last year's fourth quarter. On a constant-currency basis, adjusted earnings per share increased by approximately 16% over last year, and that reflects the significant impact of our global operating efficiency improvement initiatives. We're very pleased with this performance, and as we mentioned, are now focused on driving reinvestments into the growth initiatives that Jim described. 
Transitioning now to the full year 2015. Sales, excluding precious metals, declined by 7.6% compared to prior year. This internal growth of 2% was offset by headwinds from currency translation of 950 basis points and net acquisitions, divestitures of 10 basis points. Internal growth included a headwind from discontinued products of approximately 50 basis points on a global basis. Internal growth for the year in the U.S. was 3.1%, including the impact of approximately 75 basis points from discontinued products. For the year, internal growth in Europe was negative 0.3%, which included about 50 basis points from the discontinued products and a slightly larger headwind from the CIS region. Internal growth for 2015 in the Rest of World region was 4.9%, reflecting internal growth of almost 8% in the emerging markets within that region. For the year, the U.S. comprised 37% of our global sales, while Europe represented 41% and the Rest of World region 22%. 
Operating margin for the year improved by 180 basis points to 20.2% of sales, excluding precious metals, on an adjusted basis, and that compares to 18.4% last year. This reflects the full year impact of our global efficiency program as well as the currency benefit moving through our cash flow hedges. On an adjusted basis, net earnings from the year -- net earnings for the year increased to $373 million from $361 million on -- in 2014, and adjusted earnings per share grew by 5%, $2.62 per diluted share in 2015 from 2,000 -- from $2.50 per diluted share in the prior year. Our results for the year include the negative impact from currency of approximately $0.16, which is about $0.02 worse than what we anticipated in our initial guidance for the year. On a constant-currency basis, adjusted earnings per share for the year increased by approximately 11% over 2014, and we're very pleased with this operating performance for the year. 
Moving on to cash flow. We're also pleased with our operating cash flow for the year of $497.4 million, although this trailed 2014's record $560.4 million. Our cash flow performance reflects comparative headwinds versus prior year from 4 items; the timing of cash tax payments, payments associated with the restructuring plans, acquisition and merger-related costs and also the prepayment of the long-term bonds that we refinanced in December. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was $425 million for the year, and our free credit [ph] cash flow conversion was 169% of reported net income for the year. 
As of year-end, inventories stood at 110 days, which is down 5 days compared to September and down 3 days compared to December 2014. This was a pretty solid inventory performance in the quarter, although, as a result, we had lower absorption in our plants and slightly higher costs in the inventory as we come into the new year. Account receivable days were 54 days at the end of December. That's down 6 days from prior quarter and down 1 day compared to December 2014. And the improvements in net -- in primary networking capital contributed $40 million to cash flow for the year, and that's on top of $38 million contributed in 2014. So as I've indicated on previous calls, we can -- we believe we can continue to make significant progress over time in the net working capital area as a result of the global efficiency improvement efforts. 
Capital expenditures for the year totaled $72 million. Depreciation was $79 million for the year, while amortization was $44 million. We did not execute any share buybacks during the fourth quarter. For the full year, the company repurchased approximately 2.1 million shares at an average price of $52.50 per share. We ended 2015, as Bret mentioned, with a pristine balance sheet, as net debt-to-capital now stands at 27.1% at year-end compared to 32.3% at the end of 2014. And our leverage ratio of net debt to EBITDA now stands at 1.45x compared to 1.87x at year-end 2014. This obviously provides us tremendous flexibility as we move into 2016 on a combined basis with Sirona. 
As we move into 2016, we are pleased with the operating performance of the business, particularly, the traction from the efficiency program and our ability to translate that into growth investments and additional operating margin improvements. A headwind to keep in mind is currency. And while rates are fluctuating rapidly, at current rates, we would anticipate a headwind to earnings of the DENTSPLY stand-alone business in 2016 between 5% and 7%. Currency also flips from being a tailwind to operating margin rate in 2015 to becoming a headwind to that ratio in 2016. While, as Bret mentioned, we're not providing guidance at this time, I would state that we would expect positive year-on-year operating margin rate performance in 2016 despite the impacts from the currency and the growth reinvestments that were discussed earlier. 
That completes our prepared remarks. We appreciate your support. We'll now be glad to take any questions that you might have."

The number of people entering the profession is significant. And dentistry is moving from kind of a street-corner profession into a professional environment. So the growth there is still good. We saw continued growth in the quarter in Brazil as well. Although we're watching that economy very closely. I'd say, for us, that's a little bit higher risk than the Chinese situation at this point, although we continue to perform pretty well during this most recent quarter. Emerging markets, in general, I would say, are stable. The one exception to that is the CIS region, which is kind of getting hit very hard on 2 sides; one is on the currency and the other is on the economics coming from the dependency on oil. And that market continues to contract, but outside those -- that region, I would say, the emerging markets still look stable to us and they're growing."

We don't see sales reps paying back in less than a year. Sometimes, it takes time for them to get training up to speed. We can expect maybe a little bit of a lift, but, overall, it is an operating investment certainly in this year.

It is my pleasure to welcome all of you to our first quarter and first-ever conference call as DENTSPLY SIRONA. Also joining us on the call today, Uly Michel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Chris Clark, President and Chief Operating Officer of our Technologies business; and Derek Leckow, Vice President of Investor Relations. I'm delighted to report that our first quarter was a very successful one. We seamlessly completed our merger and began working on the great opportunities ahead of us. Rather than being distracted by the merger, the team came together and was energized to perform. In our first 67 days together, the DENSTPLY SIRONA team has much to be proud of. We've rebranded our company and now start leadership team, created an operating model to help optimize our growth. As you can see on the earnings presentation, we have organized ourselves into 2 segments: Dental and Healthcare Consumables and Technologies. Our Dental and Healthcare Consumables business is comprised or our orthodontics, preventive prosthetics, restorative and instruments division, along with Wellspect, our healthcare business. Our Technologies business is comprised of our implant, CAD/CAM, imaging, treatment center and orthodontic businesses. We've organized these segments to maximize efficiency in product development and cross-selling opportunities. 
In addition to developing new stand-alone products, our segments will introduce integrated solutions to improve workflow and advance patient care. Within Technologies, our loyal installed base of CAD/CAM and Imaging has been expanding to incorporate more specialty procedures. For decades, we have a proven track record of using technology to allow the dentist to advance patient care, both in terms of outcome and treatment times. 
Now we are moving toward integrated solutions, using technology combined with clinical products to provide dentists with end-to-end solutions and advance their own service capabilities. This was first evident in restoratives and is now moving rapidly into implant, orthodontics and These capabilities are further facilitated with DENTSPLY SIRONA's world-class clinical education platform, creates a powerful basis for advanced learnings and clinical settings. Along the same lines, specialists are demanding more high-tech equipment like 3D imaging and digital impressions. Our relationships with these practitioners will help drive adoption of our technologies. 
From a product development standpoint, combining the experience and knowledge of our strategic business units will enable the development of integrated technologies. Furthermore, by collaborating, innovation should come faster and offer more to practitioners than ever before. In consumables, the majority of our revenues are operatory-related and often used in conjunction with one another. We are focusing on offering practitioners end-to-end solutions based on particular procedures. All root canal procedures require multiple tools and are completed with a restoration. DENTSPLY SIRONA is the only manufacturer with RestoDontics strategy, offering all the necessary instruments, equipment and consumables to diagnose and complete a root canal from start to finish. As you can see, the goal of organizing into the segments was to accelerate adoption of all of our products, which would translate into top line growth. By driving growth and increasing productivity of our sales and service infrastructure, we will leverage our sales to deliver strong bottom line growth as well. 
With so many opportunities ahead, we have created an integration management office to work hand-in-hand with senior management to oversee the seamless merging of both companies and cultures. In order to capture our synergies, we have formed multiple teams to actively manage our cost and revenue initiatives. Feedback from these teams have been overwhelmingly positive. Ideas are being shared across organizations and plans are being implemented to ensure these synergies come to fruition. We are confident that we can deliver on our promise of $125 million in synergies by year 3 of our merger. 
Capital allocation will also be an important part of our go-forward strategy. Our company generates a significant amount of free cash flow, and we have a large and flexible balance sheet. As always, our priority is to invest in growth drivers for our business. We will also use our cash flow to make acquisitions, repurchase our stock and support our dividend. During the quarter, we executed on the $500 million share repurchase, consistent with the announcement we made at the time of the merger. We continue to have 3.6 million shares authorized for repurchase. We have flexibility to pursue multiple avenues of capital deployment, all of which will drive value for our shareholders. The opportunity ahead of us is more significant than anything either DENTSPLY or Sirona ever had on a stand-alone basis. We have never been in a better position to grow and deliver shareholder value.
Turning to the first quarter. Uly will explain some of the technicalities on the reported revenue growth. I will focus my comments here on the underlining growth of our 2 combined businesses. Although the merger closed on February 29th, I think it is more meaningful to discuss the performance of our business during the full quarter. We achieved strong results, with our combined businesses growing 6.5% constant currency. Excluding acquisitions, divestitures and discontinued products, internal sales growth was 5.5%. Geographically, we had solid growth across all regions. Rest of World led our growth, delivering 8.4% constant currency, driven by internal sales growth of 7.5%. There continued to be a number of challenging environments around the globe, but we are much better positioned after the merger in these areas. We expect our Rest of World region to be the fastest-growing region this year. 
The U.S. grew 8.8% constant currency, driven by internal growth of 5.7%, led by the Technologies segment. Europe grew 3.1% constant currency, with internal sales growth of 4%, driven by solid growth in both our Technology and Consumables segments. On a segment basis, our technology business led our growth, with 9.6% constant currency growth. Internally generated sales grew 6.8%, led by strong growth in our high-tech products. CAD/CAM was particularly strong ahead of our new product launch. In Q1, Dental and Healthcare Consumables generated internal sales growth of 4.5%. Growth was driven by operatory focus consumables. First quarter adjusted EPS was $0.69, representing 17% growth. We achieved strong financial results while investing in R&D and in our sales and service infrastructure. We will continue to ramp these investments in Q2 to better position our accelerating growth. Innovation and best-in-class customer service will be two key pillars of our new organization. Overall, we reported a very solid first quarter. I'll now turn the call over to Uly, who will review our first quarter financials."

This morning, I will discuss our GAAP results as well as our non-GAAP results, including the sales performance of our combined businesses for the complete 3-month period of the first quarter 2016, as if the busine",1085,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will discuss our GAAP results as well as our non-GAAP results, including the sales performance of our combined businesses for the complete 3-month period of the first quarter 2016, as if the businesses had been consolidated on January 1, 2015. I'll walk through the earnings performance. I will also point out any impacts of merger accounting on earnings. In the first quarter, our reporter revenues increased $116.3 million to $772.6 million, up 17.7% reported. The consolidation of 1 month of Sirona contributed sales of $128.9 million, which were reduced by $8.8 million to $120.1 million as a result of purchase accounting. This reduction from our normal revenue recognition practices results from a one-time treatment of deferred income on service contracts, where any deferred income at the time of the merger is removed from future revenues and income. This onetime treatment reduced revenue by $8.8 million this quarter and will reduce future revenue by about $8 million in the aggregate over the next 6 quarters.
As of March 1st, any new contracts are again being treated as they have been historically. For non-GAAP reporting, we will treat all the contracts existing at the time of the merger under the ongoing policies as if incurred in normal course of business. For the full 3-month period ended March 31, 2016, adjusted sales of our combined businesses, excluding Precious Metals, grew 6.5% on a constant currency basis. Internal growth was 5.5%, excluding 1.7% favorable impact from net acquisition and 70 basis points unfavorable impact from discontinued products. Foreign exchange movements were a headwind to revenue of 2.6%. Jeff already addressed revenue growth by geography and segment. We have provided reconciliation tables for every segment and region that will help you understand how the GAAP reported revenue and internal growth for the complete quarter come together. 
U.S. GAAP gross profit was $418.9 million, up $45.5 million from $373.4 million in 2015. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, excluding precious metal content, decreased by 360 basis points to 55.5%, from 59.1% in the prior year. As you can see on the non-GAAP reconciliation table, the gross profit margin was negatively impacted by about 500 basis points due to the roll off of merger-related fair value adjustments. The company generated benefits from its global efficiency program, which was roughly offset by negative foreign currency impacts. Reported SG&A expenses, which include R&D, was $342.1 million, up $71.8 million versus last year. SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales, excluding precious metal, increased 250 basis points compared to prior year. Merger-related expenses negatively impacted the rate by about 500 basis points, partially offset by savings from the global efficiency program and the consolidation of Sirona. SG&A expenses were favorably impacted by foreign currency translation of approximately 100 basis points. Restructuring expenses were $4.1 million, down $1.3 million from last year. In total, GAAP operating income was $72.7 million, representing 9.6% of sales, excluding precious metals. Excluding the non-GAAP items set forth in our non-GAAP financial measures, the adjusted operating margin was 22.2%, which compares to 18.7% last year. Margins benefited from the positive impacts of the global efficiency program and the consolidation of Sirona. 
Due to the strong performance in March, the benefit from the consolidation is more pronounced. If we consolidated Sirona for the complete 3-month period, our adjusted operating margin would have been approximately 150 basis points lower. We believe this is more representative of the current performance level of our business. Net interest expense for the first quarter was $8.7 million, $1.3 million lower than prior year, largely driven by lower average debt level. Other income in the first quarter was $3.4 million, with the biggest impact coming from a small business divestiture which was removed from adjusted income. 
For the 3 months ended March 31, 2016, income taxes were a net benefit of $57.9 million versus an expense of $18.9 million last year. As part of the merger, we will be able to generate an early synergy by recovering previously reserved tax assets of $76.1 million. This is the single biggest driver of the favorable development, and will be recovered in cash in future periods.  We have removed this benefit from our non-GAAP results. 
As a result, Q1 U.S. GAAP net income attributable to DENTSPLY SIRONA was $125 million, up 95.3% from the prior year. First quarter 2016 diluted GAAP EPS was $0.70 compared to $0.45 in the prior year. Adjusted non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.69, up 16.9% from last year. For a reconciliation of GAAP EPS to non-GAAP adjusted EPS, please see our earnings press release. 
Cash flow from operating activities during the 3-month period ended March 31, 2016, was $0.7 million compared to $65.6 million during the 3-month period ended March 31, 2015. The year-over-year decrease was primarily related to a $56.9 million merger increase in accounts receivable due to stronger revenues in the month of March and payments of approximately $40 million of merger-related transaction fees and integration costs. Cash provided by investing activities was $504 million favorable, which reflects the assumed cash in the merger with Sirona of $522.3 million. These funds were largely used to execute the $500 million share repurchase, which in exchange is the major driver behind the $472.8 million cash used in financing activities. The company's cash and cash equivalents increased by $38.5 million to $323.1 million during the 3 months ended March 31, 2016. 
Now turning to guidance. For fiscal 2016, we expect adjusted non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.70 to $2.80. Our guidance includes the following assumptions. Constant currency sales growth to range from 4% to 6%, excluding precious metals. This includes a 1% benefit from acquisitions, divestitures and discontinued products, and internal growth in the range of 3% to 5%. At current exchange rates, this translates to reported revenues, excluding precious metals, of $3.73 billion to $3.81 billion. Please keep in mind that growth comps get more difficult in Q2 and Q3 related to last year's record International Dental Show and strong performance in our Consumables business. At the current exchange rates, we would expect adjusted operating income margins in the range of 21% to 22%. We anticipate our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 23%. Our EPS range implies a full year share count of 220 million to 225 million fully diluted shares. Our share count will increase to 238 million as we move into Q2. I will now turn the call back to Jeff."

We are in the very early days of our journey as DENTSPLY SIRONA, but we have a lot to be excited about. The key driving force behind our merger was growth. By accelerating the adoption of our products, we can bring about the full impact of digital dentistry in the dental practice. We can integrate equipment and consumables to meet the growing needs for more efficient workflows. We will set new standards of care while meeting the growing demand for end-to-end solutions. At DENTSPLY SIRONA, we are the only company that can further drive these trends and are best positioned to benefit from them. Our installed base of equipment is the largest in the world. Our customers are loyal and supportive. They understand that our products are built to help them become more successful, which is driving our growth. Every day, around 600,000 dental professionals use DENTSPLY SIRONA product. Our reach is unparalleled and our brands are the most well-known in the industry. DENTSPLY SIRONA is associated with quality and innovation. We have the broadest clinical education platform in dentistry. Each year, we train more than 300,000 dental professionals on our products. Training builds loyalty to our company and our products, especially when they make procedures easier or more efficient. 
We also are able to deliver all of our offerings around the globe with the largest sales and service infrastructure in the industry. We are supported by 4,000 sales professionals and around 5,000 distributors around the globe. We are also combining all of our capabilities to create synergy opportunities. From a cost perspective, coming together will create opportunities to leverage our supply chain and cost structure. Building off the legacy DENTSPLY efficiency program, we already have a platform to evaluate opportunities and the team to execute on them. We are evaluating ways to improve our processes and manufacture more efficiently. We have begun cutting redundant corporate expenses and consolidating some of our countries. All of these actions will generate tangible cost savings and create a more leverageable both cost structure. We expect to achieve these savings while continuing to invest in R&D and our sales and service infrastructure. 
With more innovations and farther reach, we can cross-sell to our mutual customers or create bundles that specifically cater to each customer. We have been working closely with our distributors to develop plans that create growth opportunities for ourselves and our partners. Some of these successes involve salespeople coming together to move the combined business forward. We already have a number of stories from the field of reps introducing customers to our expanded portfolio. We have a large sales organization around the globe, and they have been meeting to find more ways to collaborate and accelerate growth while working with and respecting a wide range of distributor relationships that we have in place. 
These are win-win scenarios for DENTSPLY SIRONA and our distribution partners. More significant opportunities will require investment in both R&D and infrastructure. While these take time and will mean that some of our revenue synergies are back-end loaded to our third year, we are extremely confident that we can deliver them and they will be significant. While these integrated solutions are in development, our R&D engine is continuing to innovation to drive penetration of our products. We have recently introduced a number of new meaningful products to the market. Our [indiscernible] SDR plus skills in our revolutionary market-leading composite platform. The product has enhanced radio capacity in inter proximal wear. In our healthcare business, the new novena management system provides a novel approach to irrigation and a rapidly expanding market. Early feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. During the quarter, we launched our CERC package, which was well received by the market. The package includes the new CEREC  our unique high-speed sintering furnace. In combination with the CEREC CAD/CAM system. It allows for single visit dentistry of circling across and small bridges. In the past, using conventional furnaces, Cercon needed about 2 hours per sensory. Therefore, was exclusively processed in the dental lab. CEREC brings centering time to about 15 minutes and opens up the possibility of processing chairside. Zirconia is the most popular ceramic material for crowns in the U.S. Having this material available for CEREC will was substantially expand the addressable market for CEREC. 
In conjunction with our launch, we also introduced CEREC chairside zirconia blocks in our new Libra ceramic cement, the first DENTSPLY SIRONA cement to address CAD/CAM restorations. As part of our launch, we also provided a much aerials and accessory starter kit for all new users of zirconia packages. Combining these new products with our [indiscernible], means that we can now offer dentists the tools and materials for all of our chairside restorations. And to complement this, we have outstanding relationships with our material partners that will continue to build up. We will continue to invest in new CEREC consumables specialists salesforce to work hand-in-hand with our equipment specialists to deliver a full value proposition to dental professionals. They now can source all of their CAD/CAM needs from DENTSPLY SIRONA. Our efforts are already paying off. Our zirconia lines are growing rapidly. This is the first example of DENTSPLY SIRONA's leadership in both equipment and consumables coming together to drive growth globally. We will continue to launch over 30 new products every year. Our new product pipeline is robust. We provide best-in-class equipment and consumables. We can accelerate adoption of technology and drive sales of our entire product portfolio. We have a number of additional opportunities to quickly integrate our technology and consumable offerings. Orthodontists are rapidly adapting 3D imaging and digital impressioning systems. We have the most open orthodontic hammer in the market, and we can benefit from our seamless integration with our own MPN Liner brands. Coupled with our brackets and wires, orthodontists can now treat a patient from diagnosis to treatment. From the initial x-ray to impression and then to treatment, orthodontists can choose from an array of DENTSPLY SIRONA products to effectively treat patients. With CEREC meets 3D, we offer the safest and easiest chairside planning. As I mentioned, our implant sales force is already generating leads for imaging and CAD/CAM and planning joint clinical education events to train doctors on the DENTSPLY SIRONA implant supply. An important part of our preclinical education strategy is partnering with dental schools around the globe. In the U.S., DENTSPLY SIRONA products are in virtually all dental and dental hygiene schools. Our and do business currently partners with 100% of the U.S.  Residency programs. Today, DENTSPLY SIRONA is training the next generation of dentists on product and introducing them to best-in-class solutions. Once they graduate and enter the workforce, they will demand technology and integrated solutions. DENTSPLY SIRONA is the only manufacturer that can meet this growing trend, and we will. To deliver all of our solutions to the market, we'll continue to invest in our sales and service infrastructure. This quarter, we built out our infrastructure in Mexico and continued expanding our presence in China and India. While we will leverage our infrastructure to sell more efficiently, we remain focused on accelerating long-term top line growth. Overall, I am excited to see the DENTSPLY SIRONA team unite and deliver a strong first quarter. As the dental solutions company, DENTSPLY SIRONA will transform the dental market. I'd like to thank our customers for their loyal support, trust and enthusiasm for DENTSPLY SIRONA. We are pleased to recognize our distribution partners for helping us achieve our very successful quarter.

Frankly, one of the nice surprises is to see how talented we are across the globe in sales, marketing, R&D and certainly, our functional areas, HR and finance. It's a big deal when two of the largest companies come together to make sure that you have the right cultural fit. But one thing's for sure that we aligned on is really on our mission, Jeff, which is to empower dental professionals to deliver better, safer and faster dental care. And this idea of end-to-end solutions is where we feel the market is going. So a key fundamental to the merger was growth. So we expect to grow faster in the future. And the reason for that is we're better together to be able to accelerate the adoption of technologies in digital dentistry. Frankly, when we look at what is possible on the synergy side, as you look at our specialty areas as well as our technology, there's a lot of things that we see early days that are just going to continue to play forth. And of course, single visit dentistry is just getting stronger. It's difficult to say if we're at a tipping point yet. But we feel better about that and our ability to work with CAD/CAM and implant and ortho, certainly gives us a strong feel for our ability to mobilize our synergy opportunities.

But somewhere in the neighborhood of 15 million, 16 million more shares from the same earnings and that we issued shares at the same multiple. So this gives you a dilutive impact for the full year of somewhere in the neighborhood of $0.15 to $0.17, say, $0.16 for argument's sake. So that's another 6%. And if you add this up you, look at EPS growth, excluding FX and excluding the difference of the multiple on the issuance of about 15%.

And so that structure also means that when you look at our overall business, that there isn't any business that is really more than 15%. So going down to our smallest, which is instruments. So we're trying to get people focused on technology and consumable. But certainly, we'll deal with the strategic business units within it. You had mentioned imaging.

We only consolidated 1 month of Sirona, pronounced a little the benefit of the merger. So that also helped the gross profit margins. They were probably attacked higher in this is reporting than they would have been on the complete month. I also said this in the remark to operating margins. And the other thing to think about is the exchange rates. We're now at 1.14. The first quarter was a little bit lower. So that will hurt our gross profit margins, especially on the Technologies segment. Literally, almost all of our manufacturing is euros, Swiss franc or Swedish krona-based, right? So for the full year, I would expect them to be quite a bit lower than 60% we saw in Q1, again due to FX and due to the fact that we will not always only have the best months of the quarter in the numbers."

In ortho, it's growing the fastest, I would say, around the globe, but you won't hear from the dental community or distribution a disagreement about chairside becoming the standard of care. We've heard more about digital impression only. But that's typically in ortho. And of course, our zirconia is really a game changer. When you think about this material and the strength of it and also the aesthetics and how it compares to others. Typically, has been something that you would only do through the lab. And of course, our Cercon HT is a product that we're excited about that we'll deliver through the lab as well. From a chair side perspective, you never considered it because it took 2 hours to center. Now with the Speedfire, it's 15 minutes. Why is this so significant? Because is a terrific material for molars and certain bridges, and actually very popular among dentists. And so to be able to have this type of ceramic be available chair side, just truly opens up our addressable market. And by addressable market, we're not talking about adding 2,000, 3,000 more dentists who are interested. We're talking about tens of thousands of dentists that will now take a look at this opportunity where they wouldn't have before. So we believe that's just another reason why CEREC makes sense.

So we're excited about that. I think that we're well-positioned for where this market is headed. And again, I think that really, as we move forward, I would expect that to be one of the key synergies."

It is my pleasure to welcome all of you to our first quarter and first-ever conference call as DENTSPLY SIRONA. Also joining us on the call today: Uly Michel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Chris Clark, President and Chief Operating Officer of our Technologies business; and Derek Leckow, Vice President of Investor Relations. 
I am delighted to report that our first quarter was a very successful one. We seamlessly completed our merger and began working on the great opportunities ahead of us. Rather than being distracted by the merger, the team came together and was energized to perform. In our first 67 days together, DENTSPLY SIRONA team has much to be proud of. We've rebranded our company, announced our leadership team and created an operating model to help optimize our growth. 
As you can see on the earnings presentation, we have organized ourself into 2 segments: Dental and Healthcare Consumables and Technologies. Our Dental and Healthcare Consumables business is comprised of our endodontics, preventive prosthetics, restorative and instruments division, along with Wellspect, our healthcare business. Our Technologies business is comprised of our implant, CAD/CAM, imaging, treatment center and orthodontic businesses. We've organized these segments to maximize efficiency in product development and cross-selling opportunities. 
In addition to developing new stand-alone products, our segments will introduce integrated solutions to improve workflow and advance patient care. Within Technologies, our loyal installed base of CAD/CAM and imaging has been expanding to incorporate more specialty procedures. For decades, we have a proven track record of using technology to allow the dentist to advance patient care, both in terms of outcome and treatment times. Now we are moving toward integrated solutions, using technology, combined with clinical products, to provide dentists with end-to-end solutions and advance their own service capabilities. 
This was first evident in restoratives but is now moving rapidly into implant, orthodontics and endodontics. These capabilities, further facilitated with DENTSPLY SIRONA's world-class clinical education platform, creates a powerful basis for advanced learnings in clinical settings. Along the same lines, specialists are demanding more high-tech equipment, like 3D imaging and digital impressions. Our relationships with these practitioners will help drive adoption of our technologies. 
From a product development standpoint, combining the experience and knowledge of our strategic business units will enable the development of integrated technologies. Furthermore, by collaborating, innovation should come faster and offer more to practitioners than ever before. In consumables, the majority of our revenues are operatory-related and often used in conjunction with one another. We are focusing on offering practitioners end-to-end solutions based on particular procedures. All root canal procedures require multiple tools and are completed with a restoration. DENTSPLY SIRONA is the only manufacturer with RestoDontics strategy, offering all the necessary instruments, equipment and consumables to diagnose and complete a root canal from start to finish. 
As you can see, the goal of organizing into these segments was to accelerate adoption of all of our products, which would translate into top line growth. By driving growth and increasing productivity of our sales and service infrastructure, we will leverage our sales to deliver strong bottom line growth as well.  
With so many opportunities ahead, we have created an integration management office to work hand in hand with senior management to oversee the seamless merging of both companies and cultures. 
In order to capture our synergies, we have formed multiple teams to actively manage our cost and revenue initiatives. Feedback from these teams have been overwhelmingly positive. Ideas are being shared across organizations, and plans are being implemented to ensure these synergies come to fruition. We are confident that we can deliver on our promise of $125 million in synergies by year 3 of our merger. 
Capital allocation will also be important part of our go-forward strategy. Our company generates a significant amount of free cash flow, and we have a large and flexible balance sheet. As always, our priority is to invest in growth drivers for our business. We will also use our cash flow to make acquisitions, repurchase our stock and support our dividend. 
During the quarter, we executed on the $500 million share repurchase, consistent with the announcement we made at the time of the merger. We continue to have 3.6 million shares authorized for repurchase. We have flexibility to pursue multiple avenues of capital deployment, all of which will drive value for our shareholders. The opportunity ahead of us is more significant than anything either DENTSPLY or Sirona ever had on a stand-alone basis. We have never been in a better position to grow and deliver shareholder value.
Turning to the first quarter. Uly will explain some of the technicalities on the reported revenue growth. I will focus my comments here on the underlying growth of our 2 combined businesses. Although the merger closed on February 29, I think it is more meaningful to discuss the performance of our business during the full quarter. 
We achieved strong results, with our combined businesses growing 6.5% constant currency. Excluding acquisitions, divestitures and discontinued products, internal sales growth was 5.5%. Geographically, we had solid growth across all regions. Rest of World led our growth, delivering 8.4% constant currency, driven by internal sales growth of 7.5%. There continue to be a number of challenging environments around the globe, but we are much better positioned after the merger in these areas. We expect our Rest of World region to be the fastest-growing region this year. 
The U.S. grew 8.8% constant currency, driven by internal growth of 5.7%, led by the Technologies segment. Europe grew 3.1% constant currency, with internal sales growth of 4%, driven by solid growth in both our technology and consumable segments. 
On a segment basis, our technology business led our growth, with 9.6% constant currency growth. Internally-generated sales grew 6.8%, led by strong growth in our high-tech products. CAD/CAM was particularly strong, ahead of our new zirconia product launch. In Q1, Dental and Healthcare Consumables generated internal sales growth of 4.5%. Growth was driven by operatory-focused consumables. First quarter adjusted EPS was $0.69, representing 17% growth. 
We achieved strong financial results while investing in R&D and in our sales and service infrastructure. We will continue to ramp these investments in Q2 to better position our accelerating growth. Innovation and best-in-class customer service will be 2 key pillars of our new organization. Overall, we reported a very solid first quarter. 
I'll now turn the call over to Uly, who will review our first quarter financials."

This morning, I will discuss our GAAP results as well as our non-GAAP results, including the sales performance of our combined businesses for the complete 3-month period of the first quarter 2016 as if the busines",1082,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will discuss our GAAP results as well as our non-GAAP results, including the sales performance of our combined businesses for the complete 3-month period of the first quarter 2016 as if the businesses had been consolidated on January 1, 2015. I'll walk through the earnings performance. I will also point out any impacts of merger accounting on earnings. 
In the first quarter, our reported revenues increased $116.3 million to $772.6 million, up 17.7% reported. The consolidation of 1 month of Sirona contributed sales of $128.9 million, which were reduced by $8.8 million to $120.1 million as a result of purchase accounting. This reduction from our normal revenue recognition practices results from a onetime treatment of deferred income on service contracts, where any deferred income at the time of the merger is removed from future revenues and income. This onetime treatment reduced revenue by $8.8 million this quarter and will reduce future revenue by about $8 million in the aggregate over the next 6 quarters.
As of March 1, any new contracts are again being treated as they have been historically. For non-GAAP reporting, we will treat all the contracts existing at the time of the merger under the ongoing policy as if incurred in normal course of business. 
For the full 3-month period ended March 31, 2016, adjusted sales of our combined businesses, excluding precious metals, grew 6.5% on a constant-currency basis. Internal growth was 5.5%, excluding 1.7% favorable impact from net acquisition and 70 basis points unfavorable impact from discontinued products. Foreign exchange movements were a headwind to revenue of 2.6%. 
Jeff already addressed revenue growth by geography and segment. We have provided reconciliation tables for every segment and region that will help you understand how the GAAP reported revenue and internal growth for the complete quarter come together. 
U.S. GAAP gross profit was $418.9 million, up $45.5 million from $373.4 million in 2015. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, excluding precious metal content, decreased by 360 basis points to 55.5% from 59.1% in the prior year. As you can see on the non-GAAP reconciliation tables, the gross profit margin was negatively impacted by about 500 basis points due to the roll-off of merger-related fair value adjustments. The company generated benefits from its global efficiency program, which were largely offset by negative foreign currency impacts. 
Reported SG&A expenses, which include R&D, was $342.1 million, up $71.8 million versus last year. SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales, excluding precious metals, increased 250 basis points compared to prior year. Merger-related expenses negatively impacted the rate by about 500 basis points, partially offset by savings from the global efficiency program and the consolidation of Sirona. SG&A expenses were favorably impacted by foreign currency translation of approximately 100 basis points. Restructuring expenses were $4.1 million, down $1.3 million from last year. 
In total, GAAP operating income was $72.7 million, representing 9.6% of sales, excluding precious metals. Excluding the non-GAAP items set forth in our non-GAAP financial measures, the adjusted operating margin was 22.2%, which compares to 18.7% last year. Margins benefited from the positive impacts of the global  efficiency program and the consolidation of Sirona. 
Due to the strong performance in March, the benefit from the consolidation is more pronounced. If we consolidated Sirona for the complete 3-month period, our adjusted operating margin would have been approximately 150 basis points lower. We believe this is more representative of the current performance level of our business. 
Net interest expense for the first quarter was $8.7 million, $1.3 million lower than prior year, largely driven by lower average debt levels. Other income in the first quarter was $3.4 million, with the biggest impact coming from a small business divestiture which was removed from adjusted income. 
For the 3 months ended March 31, 2016, income taxes were a net benefit of $57.9 million versus an expense of $18.9 million last year. As part of the merger, we will be able to generate an early synergy by recovering previously reserved tax assets of $76.1 million. This is the single biggest driver of the favorable development and will be recovered in cash in future periods. We have removed this benefit from our non-GAAP results. 
As a result, Q1 U.S. GAAP net income attributable to DENTSPLY SIRONA was $125 million, up 95.3% from the prior year. First quarter 2016 diluted GAAP EPS was $0.70 compared to $0.45 in the prior year. Adjusted non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.69, up 16.9% from last year. For a reconciliation of GAAP EPS to non-GAAP adjusted EPS, please see our earnings press release. 
Cash flow from operating activities during the 3-month period ended March 31, 2016, was $0.7 million compared to $65.6 million during the 3-month period ended March 31, 2015. The year-over-year decrease was primarily related to a $56.9 million large increase in accounts receivable due to stronger revenues in the month of March and payments of approximately $40 million of merger-related transaction fees and integration costs. 
Cash provided by investing activities was $504 million favorable, which reflects the assumed cash in the merger with Sirona of $522.3 million. These funds were largely used to execute the $500 million share repurchase, which, in exchange, is the major driver behind the $472.8 million cash used in financing activities. The company's cash and cash equivalents increased by $38.5 million to $323.1 million during the 3 months ended March 31, 2016. 
Now turning to guidance. For fiscal 2016, we expect adjusted non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.70 to $2.80. Our guidance includes the following assumptions: constant-currency sales growth to range from 4% to 6%, excluding precious metals. This includes a 1% benefit from acquisitions, divestitures and discontinued products; and internal growth in the range of 3% to 5%. At current exchange rates, this translates to reported revenues, excluding precious metals, of $3.73 billion to $3.81 billion. Please keep in mind that growth comps get more difficult in Q2 and Q3 related to last year's record International Dental Show and strong performance in our consumables business. 
At the current exchange rates, we would expect adjusted operating income margins in the range of 21% to 22%. We anticipate our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 23%. Our EPS range implies a full year share count of 220 million to 225 million fully diluted shares. Our share count will increase to 238 million as we move into Q2. 
I will now turn the call back to Jeff."

We are in the very early days of our journey as DENTSPLY SIRONA, but we have a lot to be excited about. The key driving force behind our merger was growth. By accelerating the adoption of our products, we can bring about the full impact of digital dentistry to the dental practice. 
We can integrate equipment and consumables to meet the growing need for more efficient workflows. We will set new standards of care while meeting the growing demand for end-to-end solutions. At DENTSPLY SIRONA, we are the only company that can further drive these trends and are best positioned to benefit from them. 
Our installed base of equipment is the largest in the world. Our customers are loyal and supportive. They understand that our products are built to help them become more successful, which is driving our growth. Every day, around 600,000 dental professionals use DENTSPLY SIRONA product. Our reach is unparalleled, and our brands are the most well known in the industry. DENTSPLY SIRONA is associated with quality and innovation. 
We have the broadest clinical education platform in dentistry. Each year, we train more than 300,000 dental professionals on our products. Training builds loyalty to our company and our products, especially when they make procedures easier or more efficient. 
We also are able to deliver all of our offerings around the globe with the largest sales and service infrastructure in the industry. We are supported by 4,000 sales professionals and around 5,000 distributors around the globe. We also are combining all of our capabilities to create synergy opportunities. From a cost perspective, coming together will create opportunities to leverage our supply chain and cost structure. 
Building off the legacy DENTSPLY efficiency program, we already have a platform to evaluate opportunities and a team to execute on them. We are evaluating ways to improve our processes and  manufacture more efficiently. We have begun cutting redundant corporate expenses and consolidating some of our countries. All of these actions will generate tangible cost savings and create a more leverageable cost structure. We expect to achieve these savings while continuing to invest in R&D and our sales and service infrastructure. 
With more innovations and farther reach, we can cross-sell to our mutual customers or create bundles that specifically cater to each customer. We have been working closely with our distributors to develop plans that create growth opportunities for ourselves and our partners. Some of these successes involve salespeople coming together to move the combined business forward. 
We already have a number of stories from the field of reps introducing customers to our expanded portfolio. We have a large sales organization around the globe, and they have been meeting to find more ways to collaborate and accelerate growth while working with and respecting a wide range of distributor relationships that we have in place. These are win-win scenarios for DENTSPLY SIRONA and our distribution partners. 
More significant opportunities will require investment in both R&D and infrastructure. While these take time and will mean that some of our revenue synergies are back-end loaded to our third year, we are extremely confident that we can deliver them and they will be significant. 
While these integrated solutions are in development, our R&D engine is continuing to introduce innovation to drive penetration of our products. We have recently introduced a number of new meaningful products to the market. Our SureFil SDR+ builds on our revolutionary market-leading bulk fill composite platform. The product has enhanced radiopacity and interproximal wear. 
In our healthcare business, the new Navina bowel management system provides a novel approach to irrigation  and a rapidly expanding market. Early feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. 
During the quarter, we launched our CEREC Zirconia package, which was well received by the market. The Zirconia package includes the new CEREC Speed-Fire, our unique high-speed sintering furnace. In combination with the CEREC chair-side CAD/CAM system. It allows for single-visit dentistry of zirconia crowns and small bridges. In the past, using conventional furnaces, zirconia needed about 2 hours per sintering. Therefore, zirconia was exclusively processed in the dental lab. CEREC Speed-Fire brings sintering time down to about 15 minutes and opens up the possibility of processing zirconia chairside. Zirconia is the most popular ceramic material for crowns in the U.S. Having this material available for CEREC will substantially expand the addressable market for CEREC. 
In conjunction with our launch, we also introduced CEREC chairside zirconia blocks and our new Calibra ceramic cement, the first DENTSPLY SIRONA cement to address CAD/CAM restorations. As part of our launch, we also provided a materials and accessory starter kit for all new users of Zirconia packages. Combining these new products with our CELTRA Duo blocks means that we can now offer dentists the tools and materials for all of our chairside restorations. And to complement this, we have outstanding relationships with our material partners that we'll continue to build on. 
We will continue to invest in new CEREC consumables specialists sales force to work hand in hand with our equipment specialists to deliver a full value proposition to dental professionals. They now can source all of their CAD/CAM needs from DENTSPLY SIRONA.  Our efforts are already paying off. Our CELTRA and Zirconia lines are growing rapidly. This is the first example of DENTSPLY SIRONA's leadership in both equipment and consumables coming together to drive growth globally. 
We will continue to launch over 30 new products every year. 
Our new product pipeline is robust. We provide best-in-class equipment and consumables. We can accelerate adoption of technology and drive sales of our entire product portfolio. 
We have a number of additional opportunities to quickly integrate our technology and consumable offerings. Orthodontists are rapidly adopting 3D imaging and digital impressioning systems. We have the most open orthodontic camera on the market, and we can benefit from our seamless integration with our own MTM clear aligner brands. Coupled with our brackets and wires, orthodontists can now treat a patient from diagnosis to treatment. From the initial x-ray to impression and then to treatment, orthodontists can choose from an array of DENTSPLY SIRONA products to effectively treat patients. 
With CEREC meets 3D, we offer the safest and easiest chairside implant planting. As I mentioned, our implant sales force is already generating leads for imaging and CAD/CAM and planning joint clinical education events to train doctors on the DENTSPLY SIRONA implants line. 
An important part of our clinical education strategy is partnering with dental schools around the globe. In the U.S., DENTSPLY SIRONA products are in virtually all dental and dental hygiene schools. Our endo business currently partners with 100% of the U.S. endo residency programs. Today, DENTSPLY SIRONA is training the next generation of dentists on products and introducing them to best-in-class solutions. Once they graduate and enter the workforce, they will demand technology and integrated solutions. DENTSPLY SIRONA is the only manufacturer that can meet this growing trend, and we will. 
To deliver all of our solutions to the market, we'll continue to invest in our sales and service infrastructure. This quarter, we built out our infrastructure in Mexico and continued expanding our presence in China and India. While we will leverage our infrastructure to sell more efficiently, we remain focused on accelerating long-term top line growth. Overall, I am excited to see the DENTSPLY SIRONA team unite and deliver a strong first quarter. As the dental solutions company, DENTSPLY SIRONA will transform the dental market. 
I'd like to thank our customers for their loyal support, trust and enthusiasm for DENTSPLY SIRONA. We are pleased to recognize our distribution partners for helping us achieve our very successful quarter. I'd also like to extend a special thanks to our 15,000 employees who work hard each and every day to improve the lives of dentists and their patients. Together, we will change dentistry for the better.

But one thing's for sure that we aligned on is really on our mission, Jeff, which is to empower dental professionals to deliver better, safer and faster dental care.

Frankly, when we look at what is possible on the synergy side, as you look at our specialty areas as well as our technology, there's a lot of things that we see early days that are just going to continue to play forth. And of course, single-visit dentistry is just getting stronger. It's difficult to say if we're at a tipping point yet, but we feel better about that.

And we take our -- the midpoint of our guidance this year, $2.75. So this would be a $0.13 increase or a 5%, which we probably refer to as low single digits, right? Then I told you that we expect FX headwinds of about $0.10, which would add another 4%. And as you know, we've issued DENTSPLY shares in exchange for Sirona shares. And with the multiple difference, we issued, it depends on if you look at it trailing or forward-looking, but somewhere in the neighborhood of 15 million, 16 million more shares for the same earnings had -- than had we issued the shares at the same multiple. So this gives you a dilutive impact for the full year of in the -- somewhere in the neighborhood of $0.15 to $0.17, say $0.16 for argument's sake. So that's another 6%. And if you add this up, you look at EPS growth, excluding FX and excluding the difference of the multiple on the issuance of about 15%, and if you use this, I think you can back into our earnings growth from there. Does that answer your question?"

And even Brazil, which certainly has its challenges, we were able to do particularly well in the consumables area, which is pleasing for us. We expect the Rest of World to be a growth driver for us for the rest of the year. In Europe, we did well. We haven't seen anything really change over the last 6 months. Frankly, Russia still has some challenges, but I was pleased with how the team was able to perform, especially looking at our pipeline ahead. We have a number of projects there. Southern Europe seems to be picking up for us, albeit it's a low base. Germany performed but did not lead Europe. So -- and then we saw strong growth in both Technologies and Consumables in Europe. But I would caution that our second quarter will be a difficult comp because of IDS last year, and keep in mind that IDS was a record for us. In the U.S., again, very strong growth led by Technologies and also operatory consumables. We feel good about what we were able to accomplish.

We only consolidated 1 month of Sirona, pronounced a little bit the benefit of the merger. So that also helped the gross profit margins. They were probably a tad higher in this reporting than they would have been on the complete month. I also said this on the remarks to operating margins. And the other thing to think about is the exchange rates. We're now at $1.14. The first quarter was a little bit lower, so that will hurt our gross profit margins. You know that -- especially on the Technologies segment. Literally, almost all of our manufacturing is euros, Swiss franc or Swedish krona-based, right?

Cost is easier to identify, and you can go at it a little bit quicker. Certain corporate costs, we've evaluated and come after, insurance, audit fees. The other thing is when you're doing country consolidations, there are overlaps with regard to software and duplication in functionality and functions. And certainly, also from a sourcing perspective, we're at that -- there are some quick wins that we've been able to talk about. But equally, I think we've spent a lot of time with our team -- and in a moment, I'm going to have Chris talk to you a little bit about that because he's been leading the way with revenue synergies. And we're really pleased to see how well the teams have come together to collaborate. Again, keep in mind, it's day 67, but the type of wins that we're talking about that makes sense for the dental practitioner, for our distribution partners, for DENTSPLY SIRONA are really coming up. From a perspective of the 3-year -- the $125 million. Again, it's -- we're not backing away from that. We're very confident about it. But to give more color at this time about what we'll map in as far as year 2 and year 3, I don't think we're -- well, I know we're not going to talk about that today, Steve.

You should think about the work streams really being both within the 2 segments and then across the 2 segments as well. You should think about them being focused on product synergies, again being probably more -- a little -- think of that a little bit more innovation-based or R&D based. There are some that are probably intermediate term, some longer term. But again, those are probably going to be on the tail end, if you will, of the -- or at least back half of the 3-year period, some may be a little bit before that. And a lot of energy going there, again, when we get our scientists together, when we get our marketers together and really think about the possibilities in terms of combined solutions. On the other hand then, in the nearer term, on the commercial synergies, think about, again, our sales and marketers getting together and talking about programmatically what can we do to drive more value with our customers together. And again, you can think about that in terms of promotions, in terms of how we present ourselves to our customers, in terms of, as I mentioned earlier, KOLs, clinical education, et cetera. And so again, there's a lot of energy, many, many work streams here. But again, we're excited about how our people are engaging, and I think that bodes well for the trajectory and where we head, frankly, not just this year but over the 3-year period and beyond."

We are, first and foremost, an innovator, right? And so technology matters. So we're out there, we're looking at businesses that maybe need a larger company infrastructure. They've got something that they're either just finished with or they need more resources to finish that. That's something that's very important, something both companies have done extremely well. And then we take a look at what can we add to our SBUs, what would be an additional add-on that would help growth or the adoption of the technology or sell more of the consumables, certainly. And let's not forget the regional play, which is why I said it's -- we have to look at each country and the stability level there. Certainly, again, we look for the acquisition to be accretive. And if it's not going to be accretive, we've got to be able to explain to you very quickly why this will get there in a fast-enough form that is necessary. ROIC has always been something that is significant to us and then -- and hasn't changed. I think we have a very robust process internally that we go through. Frankly, I wanted to highlight it earlier because I think the team's truly extraordinary. And I -- that was something that I can tell you from a standpoint ""at Sirona, we were good. DENTSPLY, it's great."" And so coming together on that makes a big difference. Also, we've been able to have discussions with our board about that. We recognize that capital allocation is a critical component. And we think that we're one of the few companies that can be a true consolidator in this industry, and so there's a lot of room for that to take place over the years to come. And as you know, like anything, you have to be ready to seize the opportunity when it becomes available, and I think that's the point that we want to stress. Yes, we have to integrate. Yes, we understand that's priority. And our 15,000 know our first and foremost is to them and to our shareholders and stakeholders to make sure our nucleus is strong. But after that, we just see plenty of opportunities. Now we're going to stay disciplined. That doesn't change. But that's part of our road map, and I want to be crystal clear about that."

You're hearing it more and more. In ortho, it's growing the fastest, I would say, around the globe. You won't hear from the dental community or distribution a disagreement about chairside becoming the standard of care. We've heard more about digital impression only, but that's typically in ortho. And of course, our zirconia is really a game changer when you think about this material and the strength of it and also the aesthetics and how it compares to others. Typically, zirconia has been something that you would only do through the lab. And of course, our Cercon ht is a product that we're excited about that we'll deliver through the lab as well. But from a chairside perspective, you never considered it because it took 2 hours to sinter. Now with the Speed-Fire, it's 15 minutes. Why is this so significant? Because zirconia is a terrific material for molars and certain bridges and actually very popular among dentists. And so to be able to have this type of ceramic be available chairside just truly opens up our addressable market. And by addressable market, we're not talking about adding 2,000, 3,000 more dentists who are interested. We're talking about tens of thousands of dentists that will now take a look at this opportunity where they wouldn't have before. So we believe that's just another reason why CEREC makes sense. But the other thing, frankly, is the fact that now everybody's talking about not just restorative, but we're talking about what you can do with CEREC on an implant and ortho side. And I have to say that we were at the AAO. And in a second I'm going to ask Chris to tell you about that flavor. But you just see the appetite for digital impression and what the possibilities are for all types of applications, and I think that was a bit of the story at the AAO."

It is my pleasure to welcome all of you to our first quarter and first-ever conference call as DENTSPLY SIRONA. Also joining us on the call today: Uly Michel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Chris Clark, President and Chief Operating Officer of our Technologies business; and Derek Leckow, Vice President of Investor Relations. 
I am delighted to report that our first quarter was a very successful one. We seamlessly completed our merger and began working on the great opportunities ahead of us. Rather than being distracted by the merger, the team came together and was energized to perform. In our first 67 days together, DENTSPLY SIRONA team has much to be proud of. We've rebranded our company, announced our leadership team and created an operating model to help optimize our growth. 
As you can see on the earnings presentation, we have organized ourself into 2 segments: Dental and Healthcare Consumables; and Technologies. Our Dental and Healthcare Consumables business is comprised of our endodontics, preventive prosthetics, restorative and instruments division, along with Wellspect, our healthcare business. Our Technologies business is comprised of our implant, CAD/CAM, imaging, treatment center and orthodontic businesses. We've organized these segments to maximize efficiency in product development and cross-selling opportunities. 
In addition to developing new stand-alone products, our segments will introduce integrated solutions to improve workflow and advance patient care. Within Technologies, our loyal installed base of CAD/CAM and imaging has been expanding to incorporate more specialty procedures. For decades, we have a proven track record of using technology to allow the dentist to advance patient care, both in terms of outcomes and treatment times. Now we are moving toward integrated solutions, using technology, combined with clinical products, to provide dentists with end-to-end solutions and advance their own service capabilities. 
This was first evident in restoratives but is now moving rapidly into implant, orthodontics and endodontics. These capabilities further facilitated with DENTSPLY SIRONA's world-class clinical education platform, creates a powerful basis for advanced learnings in clinical settings. Along the same lines, specialists are demanding more high-tech equipment, like 3D imaging and digital impressions. Our relationships with these practitioners will help drive adoption of our technologies. 
From a product development standpoint, combining the experience and knowledge of our strategic business units will enable the development of integrated technologies. Furthermore, by collaborating, innovation should come faster and offer more to practitioners than ever before. 
In consumables, the majority of our revenues are operatory-related and often used in conjunction with one another. We are focusing on offering practitioners end-to-end solutions based on particular procedures. All root canal procedures require multiple tools and are completed with a restoration. DENTSPLY SIRONA is the only manufacturer with RestoDontics strategy, offering all the necessary instruments, equipment and consumables to diagnose and complete a root canal from start to finish. 
As you can see, the goal of organizing into these segments was to accelerate adoption of all of our products, which would translate into top line growth. By driving growth and increasing productivity of our sales and service infrastructure, we will leverage our sales to deliver strong bottom line growth as well.  
With so many opportunities ahead, we have created an integration management office to work hand in hand with senior management to oversee the seamless merging of both companies and cultures. In order to capture our synergies, we have formed multiple teams to actively manage our cost and revenue initiatives. Feedback from these teams have been overwhelmingly positive. Ideas are being shared across organizations, and plans are being implemented to ensure these synergies come to fruition. We are confident that we can deliver on our promise of $125 million in synergies by year 3 of our merger. 
Capital allocation will also be important part of our go-forward strategy. Our company generates a significant amount of free cash flow, and we have a large and flexible balance sheet. As always, our priority is to invest in growth drivers for our business. We will also use our cash flow to make acquisitions, repurchase our stock and support our dividend. 
During the quarter, we executed on the $500 million share repurchase, consistent with the announcement we made at the time of the merger. We continue to have 3.6 million shares authorized for repurchase. We have flexibility to pursue multiple avenues of capital deployment, all of which will drive value for our shareholders. The opportunity ahead of us is more significant than anything either DENTSPLY or Sirona ever had on a stand-alone basis. We have never been in a better position to grow and deliver shareholder value.
Turning to the first quarter. Uly will explain some of the technicalities on the reported revenue growth. I will focus my comments here on the underlying growth of our 2 combined businesses. Although the merger closed on February 29, I think it is more meaningful to discuss the performance of our business during the full quarter. 
We achieved strong results, with our combined businesses growing 6.5% constant currency. Excluding acquisitions, divestitures and discontinued products, internal sales growth was 5.5%. Geographically, we had solid growth across all regions. Rest of World led our growth, delivering 8.4% constant currency, driven by internal sales growth of 7.5%. There continue to be a number of challenging environments around the globe, but we are much better positioned after the merger in these areas. We expect our Rest of World region to be the fastest-growing region this year. 
The U.S. grew 8.8% constant currency, driven by internal growth of 5.7%, led by the Technologies segment. Europe grew 3.1% constant currency, with internal sales growth of 4%, driven by solid growth in both our technology and consumable segments. 
On a segment basis, our technology business led our growth, with 9.6% constant-currency growth. Internally-generated sales grew 6.8%, led by strong growth in our high-tech products. CAD/CAM was particularly strong, ahead of our new zirconia product launch. In Q1, Dental and Healthcare Consumables generated internal sales growth of 4.5%. Growth was driven by operatory-focused consumables. First quarter adjusted EPS was $0.69, representing 17% growth. 
We achieved strong financial results while investing in R&D and in our sales and service infrastructure. We will continue to ramp these investments in Q2 to better position our accelerating growth. Innovation and best-in-class customer service will be 2 key pillars of our new organization. Overall, we reported a very solid first quarter. 
I'll now turn the call over to Uly, who will review our first quarter financials."
27504,331319888,975876,"DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 06, 2016",2016-05-06,"Earnings Calls","DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will discuss our GAAP results, as well as our non-GAAP results, including the sales performance of our combined businesses for the complete 3-month period of the first quarter 2016 as if the busine",1082,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will discuss our GAAP results, as well as our non-GAAP results, including the sales performance of our combined businesses for the complete 3-month period of the first quarter 2016 as if the businesses had been consolidated on January 1, 2015. I'll walk through the earnings performance. I will also point out any impacts of merger accounting on earnings. 
In the first quarter, our reported revenues increased $116.3 million to $772.6 million, up 17.7% reported. The consolidation of 1 month of Sirona contributed sales of $128.9 million, which were reduced by $8.8 million to $120.1 million as a result of purchase accounting. This reduction from our normal revenue recognition practices results from a onetime treatment of deferred income on service contracts, where any deferred income at the time of the merger is removed from future revenues and income. This onetime treatment reduced revenue by $8.8 million this quarter and will reduce future revenue by about $8 million in the aggregate over the next 6 quarters.
As of March 1, any new contracts are again being treated as they have been historically. For non-GAAP reporting, we will treat all the contracts existing at the time of the merger under the ongoing policy as if incurred in normal course of business. 
For the full 3-month period ended March 31, 2016, adjusted sales of our combined businesses, excluding precious metals, grew 6.5% on a constant-currency basis. Internal growth was 5.5%, excluding 1.7% favorable impact from net acquisition and 70 basis points unfavorable impact from discontinued products. Foreign exchange movements were a headwind to revenue of 2.6%. 
Jeff already addressed revenue growth by geography and segment. We have provided reconciliation tables for every segment and region that will help you understand how the GAAP reported revenue and internal growth for the complete quarter come together. 
U.S. GAAP gross profit was $418.9 million, up $45.5 million from $373.4 million in 2015. Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, excluding precious metal content, decreased by 360 basis points to 55.5% from 59.1% in the prior year. As you can see on the non-GAAP reconciliation tables, the gross profit margin was negatively impacted by about 500 basis points due to the roll-off of merger-related fair value adjustments. The company generated benefits from its global efficiency program, which were largely offset by negative foreign currency impacts. 
Reported SG&A expenses, which include R&D, was $342.1 million, up $71.8 million versus last year. SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales, excluding precious metals, increased 250 basis points compared to prior year. Merger-related expenses negatively impacted the rate by about 500 basis points, partially offset by savings from the global efficiency program and the consolidation of Sirona. SG&A expenses were favorably impacted by foreign currency translation of approximately 100 basis points. Restructuring expenses were $4.1 million, down $1.3 million from last year. 
In total, GAAP operating income was $72.7 million, representing 9.6% of sales, excluding precious metals. Excluding the non-GAAP items set forth in our non-GAAP financial measures, the adjusted operating margin was 22.2%, which compares to 18.7% last year. Margins benefited from the positive impacts of the global efficiency program and the consolidation of Sirona. 
Due to the strong performance in March, the benefit from the consolidation is more pronounced. Had we consolidated Sirona for the complete 3-month period, our adjusted operating margin would have been approximately 150 basis points lower. We believe this is more representative of the current performance level of our business. 
Net interest expense for the first quarter was $8.7 million, $1.3 million lower than prior year, largely driven by lower average debt levels. Other income in the first quarter was $3.4 million, with the biggest impact coming from a small business divestiture which was removed from adjusted income. 
For the 3 months ended March 31, 2016, income taxes were a net benefit of $57.9 million versus an expense of $18.9 million last year. As part of the merger, we will be able to generate an early synergy by recovering previously reserved tax assets of $76.1 million. This is the single biggest driver of the favorable development and will be recovered in cash in future periods. We have removed this benefit from our non-GAAP results. 
As a result, Q1 U.S. GAAP net income attributable to DENTSPLY SIRONA was $125 million, up 95.3% from the prior year. First quarter 2016 diluted GAAP EPS was $0.70 compared to $0.45 in the prior year. Adjusted non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.69, up 16.9% from last year. For a reconciliation of GAAP EPS to non-GAAP adjusted EPS, please see our earnings press release. 
Cash flow from operating activities during the 3-month period ended March 31, 2016, was $0.7 million compared to $65.6 million during the 3-month period ended March 31, 2015. The year-over-year decrease was primarily related to a $56.9 million larger increase in accounts receivable due to stronger revenues in the month of March and payments of approximately $40 million of merger-related transaction fees and integration cost. 
Cash provided by investing activities was $504 million favorable, which reflects the assumed cash in the merger with Sirona of $522.3 million. These funds were largely used to execute the $500 million share repurchase, which, in exchange, is the major driver behind the $472.8 million cash used in financing activities. The company's cash and cash equivalents increased by $38.5 million to $323.1 million during the 3 months ended March 31, 2016. 
Now turning to guidance. For fiscal 2016, we expect adjusted non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.70 to $2.80. Our guidance includes the following assumptions: constant-currency sales growth to range from 4% to 6%, excluding precious metals. This includes a 1% benefit from acquisitions, divestitures and discontinued products; and internal growth in the range of 3% to 5%. At current exchange rates, this translates to reported revenues, excluding precious metals, of $3.73 billion to $3.81 billion. Please keep in mind that growth comps get more difficult in Q2 and Q3 related to last year's record International Dental Show and strong performance in our consumables business. 
At the current exchange rates, we would expect adjusted operating income margins in the range of 21% to 22%. We anticipate our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 23%. Our EPS range implies a full year share count of 220 million to 225 million fully diluted shares. Our share count will increase to 238 million as we move into Q2. 
I will now turn the call back to Jeff."

We are in the very early days of our journey as DENTSPLY SIRONA, but we have a lot to be excited about. The key driving force behind our merger was growth. By accelerating the adoption of our products, we can bring about the full impact of digital dentistry in the dental practice. 
We can integrate equipment and consumables to meet the growing need for more efficient workflows. We will set new standards of care while meeting the growing demand for end-to-end solutions. At DENTSPLY SIRONA, we are the only company that can further drive these trends and are best positioned to benefit from them. 
Our installed base of equipment is the largest in the world. Our customers are loyal and supportive. They understand that our products are built to help them become more successful, which is driving our growth. Every day, around 600,000 dental professionals use DENTSPLY SIRONA product. Our reach is unparalleled, and our brands are the most well known in the industry. DENTSPLY SIRONA is associated with quality and innovation. 
We have the broadest clinical education platform in dentistry. Each year, we train more than 300,000 dental professionals on our products. Training builds loyalty to our company and our products, especially when they make procedures easier or more efficient. 
We also are able to deliver all of our offerings around the globe with the largest sales and service infrastructure in the industry. We are supported by 4,000 sales professionals and around 5,000 distributors around the globe. We also have heard combining all of our capabilities creates synergy opportunities. From a cost perspective, coming together will create opportunities to leverage our supply chain and cost structure. 
Building off the legacy DENTSPLY efficiency program, we already have a platform to evaluate opportunities and a team to execute on them. We are evaluating ways to improve our processes and manufacture more efficiently. We have begun cutting redundant corporate expenses and consolidating some of our countries. All of these actions will generate tangible cost savings and create a more leverageable cost structure. We expect to achieve these savings while continuing to invest in R&D and our sales and service infrastructure. 
With more innovations and farther reach, we can cross-sell to our mutual customers or create bundles that specifically cater to each customer. We have been working closely with our distributors to develop plans that create growth opportunities for ourselves and our partners. Some of these successes involve salespeople coming together to move the combined business forward. 
We already have a number of stories from the field of reps introducing customers to our expanded portfolio. We have a large sales organization around the globe, and they have been meeting to find more ways to collaborate and accelerate growth while working with and respecting a wide range of distributor relationships that we have in place. These are win-win scenarios for DENTSPLY SIRONA and our distribution partners. 
More significant opportunities will require investment in both R&D and infrastructure. While these take time and will mean that some of our revenue synergies are back-end loaded to our third year, we are extremely confident that we can deliver them and they will be significant. 
While these integrated solutions are in development, our R&D engine is continuing to introduce innovation to drive penetration of our products. We have recently introduced a number of new meaningful products to the market. Our SureFil SDR+ builds on our revolutionary market-leading bulk fill composite platform. The product has enhanced radiopacity and interproximal wear. 
In our healthcare business, the new Navina bowel management system provides a novel approach to irrigation in a rapidly expanding market. Early feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. 
During the quarter, we launched our CEREC Zirconia package, which was well received by the market. The Zirconia package includes the new CEREC Speed-Fire, our unique high-speed sintering furnace. In combination with the CEREC chair-side CAD/CAM system, it allows for single-visit dentistry of zirconia crowns and small bridges. In the past, using conventional furnaces, zirconia needed about 2 hours per sintering. Therefore, zirconia was exclusively processed in the dental lab. CEREC Speed-Fire brings sintering time down to about 15 minutes and opens up the possibility of processing zirconia chairside. Zirconia is the most popular ceramic material for crowns in the U.S. Having this material available for CEREC will substantially expand the addressable market for CEREC. 
In conjunction with our launch, we also introduced CEREC chairside zirconia blocks and our new Calibra ceramic cement, the first DENTSPLY SIRONA cement to address CAD/CAM restorations. As part of our launch, we also provided a materials and accessories starter kit for all new users of zirconia packages. Combining these new products with our CELTRA Duo blocks means that we can now offer dentists the tools and materials for all of our chairside restorations. And to complement this, we have outstanding relationships with our material partners that we continue to build on. 
We will continue to invest in new CEREC consumables specialists sales force to work hand in hand with our equipment specialists to deliver a full value proposition to dental professionals. They now can source all of their CAD/CAM needs from DENTSPLY SIRONA. Our efforts are already paying off. Our CELTRA and zirconia lines are growing rapidly. This is the first example of DENTSPLY SIRONA's leadership in both equipment and consumables coming together to drive growth globally. 
We will continue to launch over 30 new products every year. Our new product pipeline is robust. We provide best-in-class equipment and consumables. We can accelerate adoption of technology and drive sales of our entire product portfolio. 
We have a number of additional opportunities to quickly integrate our technology and consumable offerings. Orthodontists are rapidly adopting 3D imaging and digital impressioning systems. We have the most open orthodontic camera on the market, and we can benefit from our seamless integration with our own MTM clear aligner brands. Coupled with our brackets and wires, orthodontists can now treat a patient from diagnosis to treatment. From the initial x-ray to impression and then to treatment, orthodontists can choose from an array of DENTSPLY SIRONA products to effectively treat patients. 
Where CEREC meets 3D, we offer the safest and easiest chairside implant planting. As I mentioned, our implant sales force is already generating leads for imaging and CAD/CAM, and planning joint clinical education events to train doctors on the DENTSPLY SIRONA implants line. 
An important part of our clinical education strategy is partnering with dental schools around the globe. In the U.S., DENTSPLY SIRONA products are in virtually all dental and dental hygiene schools. Our endo business currently partners with 100% of the U.S. endo residency programs. Today, DENTSPLY SIRONA is training the next generation of dentists on products and introducing them to best-in-class solutions. Once they graduate and enter the workforce, they will demand technology and integrated solutions. DENTSPLY SIRONA is the only manufacturer that can meet this growing trend, and we will. 
To deliver all of our solutions to the market, we'll continue to invest in our sales and service infrastructure. This quarter, we built out our infrastructure in Mexico and continued expanding our presence in China and India. While we will leverage our infrastructure to sell more efficiently, we remain focused on accelerating long-term top line growth. Overall, I am excited to see the DENTSPLY SIRONA team unite and deliver a strong first quarter. As the dental solutions company, DENTSPLY SIRONA will transform the dental market. 
I'd like to thank our customers for their loyal support, trust and enthusiasm for DENTSPLY SIRONA. We are pleased to recognize our distribution partners for helping us achieve our very successful quarter. I'd also like to extend a special thanks to our 15,000 employees who work hard each and every day to improve the lives of dentists and their patients. Together, we will change dentistry for the better. 
We will now address your questions. Operator, please proceed."

Look, I think we've -- First of all, it is early days, and I have to tell you I'm thrilled with what the team's been able to do together. Frankly, one of the nice surprises is to see how talented we are across the globe in sales, marketing, R&D and, certainly, our functional areas, HR and finance. It's a big deal when 2 of the largest companies come together to make sure that you have the right cultural fit. But one thing's for sure that we aligned on is really on our mission, Jeff, which is to empower dental professionals to deliver better, safer and faster dental care. And this idea of end-to-end solutions is where we feel the market is going. So a key fundamental to the merger was growth, so we expect to grow faster in the future. And the reason for that is we're better together to be able to accelerate the adoption of technologies and digital dentistry. Frankly, when we look at what is possible on the synergy side, as you look at our specialty areas as well as our technology, there's a lot of things that we see early days that are just going to continue to play for us. And of course, single-visit dentistry is just getting stronger. It's difficult to say if we're at a tipping point yet, but we feel better about that. And our ability to work with CAD/CAM and implant and ortho certainly gives us a strong feel for our ability to mobilize our synergy opportunities. So there's a lot of genuine excitement here. And I think it's truly great for the dental industry and our distributor partners because we're going to do a lot of great things together."

Then I told you that we expect FX headwinds of about $0.10, which would add another 4%. And as you know, we've issued DENTSPLY shares in exchange for Sirona shares. And with the multiple difference, we issued, it depends on if you look at it trailing or forward-looking, but somewhere in the neighborhood of 15 million, 16 million more shares for the same earnings had -- than had we issued the shares at the same multiple. So this gives you a diluted impact for the full year of in the -- somewhere in the neighborhood of $0.15 to $0.17, say $0.16 for argument's sake. So that's another 6%.

We expect the Rest of World to be a growth driver for us for the rest of the year. In Europe, we did well. We haven't seen anything really change over the last 6 months. Frankly, Russia still has some challenges, but I was pleased with how the team was able to perform, especially looking at our pipeline ahead. We have a number of projects there. Southern Europe seems to be picking up for us, albeit it's a low base. Germany performed but did not lead Europe. So -- and then we saw strong growth in both Technologies and Consumables in Europe. But I would caution that our second quarter will be a difficult comp because of IDS last year, and keep in mind that IDS was a record for us.

I talked a little bit, on the prepared remarks, on the GAAP versus non-GAAP items. So I think what you see on the rec table is a margin a little it was over 60% recorded for the first quarter after these adjustments. I did mention that -- the fact that Sirona had a very strong margin. We only consolidated 1 month of Sirona, pronounced a little bit the benefit of the merger. So that also helped the gross profit margins. They were probably a tad higher in this reporting than they would have been on the complete month. I also said this on the remark to operating margins. And the other thing to think about is the exchange rates. We're now at $1.14. The first quarter was a little bit lower, so that will hurt our gross profit margins. You know that especially on the Technologies segment. Literally, almost all of our manufacturing is euros, Swiss franc or Swedish krona-based, right. So for the full year, I would expect them to be quite a bit lower than the 60% we saw in Q1, again, due to FX and due to the fact that we will not always only have the best months of the quarter in the numbers."

You should think about them being focused on product synergies, again being probably more -- a little -- think of that a little bit more innovation-based or R&D based. There are some that are probably intermediate term, some longer term. But again, those are probably going to be on the tail end, if you will, of the -- or at least back half of the 3-year period, some may be a little bit before then. And a lot of energy going there, again, when we get our scientists together, when we get our marketers together and really think about the possibilities in terms of combined solutions. On the other hand then, in the nearer term, on the commercial synergies, think about, again, our sales and marketers getting together and talking about programmatically what can we do to drive more value with our customers together. And again, you can think about that in terms of promotions, in terms of how we present ourselves to our customers, in terms of, as I mentioned earlier, KOLs, clinical education, et cetera. And so again, there's a lot of energy, many, many work streams here.

They've got something that they're either just finished with or they need more resources to finish that. That's something that's very important, something both companies have done extremely well. And then we take a look at what can we add to our SBUs, what would be a additional add-on that would help growth or the adoption of the technology or sell more of the consumables, certainly. And let's not forget the regional play, which is why I said it's -- we have to look at each country and the stability level there. Certainly, again, we look for the acquisition to be accretive. And if it's not going to be accretive, we've got to be able to explain to you very quickly why this will get there in a fast-enough form that is necessary. ROIC has always been something that is significant to us and then -- and hasn't changed. I think we have a very robust process internally that we go through.

DENTSPLY, it's great."" And so coming together on that makes a big difference. Also, we've been able to have discussions with our board about that. We recognize that capital allocation is a critical component. And we think that we're one of the few companies that can be a true consolidator in this industry, and so there's a lot of room for that to take place over the years to come. And as you know, like anything, you have to be ready to seize the opportunity when it becomes available, and I think that's the point that we want to stress. Yes, we have to integrate. Yes, we understand that's priority. And our 15,000 know our first and foremost is to them and to our shareholders and stakeholders to make sure our nucleus is strong.

You're hearing it more and more. In ortho, it's growing the fastest, I would say, around the globe. You won't hear from the dental community or distribution a disagreement about chairside becoming the standard of care. We've heard more about digital impression only, but that's typically in ortho. And of course, our zirconia is really a game changer when you think about this material and the strength of it and also the aesthetics and how it compares to others. Typically, zirconia has been something that you would only do through the lab. And of course, our Cercon ht is a product that we're excited about that we'll deliver through the lab as well. But from a chairside perspective, you never considered it because it took 2 hours to sinter. Now with the Speed-Fire, it's 15 minutes. Why is this so significant? Because zirconia is a terrific material for molars and certain bridges and actually, very popular among dentists. And so to be able to have this type of ceramic be available chairside just truly opens up our addressable market. And by addressable market, we're not talking about adding 2,000, 3,000 more dentists who are interested; we're talking about tens of thousands of dentists that will now take a look at this opportunity where they wouldn't have before. So we believe that's just another reason why CEREC makes sense. But the other thing, frankly, is the fact that now everybody's talking about not just restorative, but we're talking about what you can do with CEREC on an implant and ortho side. And I have to say that we were at the AAO. And in a second I'm going to ask Chris to tell you about that flavor. But you just see the appetite for digital impression and what the possibilities are for all types of applications, and I think that was a bit of the story at the AAO."

It is my pleasure to welcome you all to our second quarter conference call. Also joining us on the call today Uly Michel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Chris Clark, our President and Chief Operating Officer, Technologies; and Derek Leckow, Vice President of Investor Relations. 
Our second quarter represented our first full quarter as DENTSPLY SIRONA. We are now at day 168 of the merger. And after seeing the progress we've made and the talent we have, I'm even more optimistic today than I was on day 1. 
Our culture remains a top priority for myself and the management team. We are already seeing the benefits of our focus on this priority. We are designating resources to ensure that our people come together as a high-performance organization. 
During the quarter, we selected culture champions and have begun to hold workshops. Our 15,000 employees are embracing our mission, vision and values, which are all aimed at accelerating growth and having a greater impact on the dental community. 
I'm also pleased with the rollout of our new DENTSPLY SIRONA brand. Across the globe, our employees are embracing being one global team. From recruiting, to trade shows, Toronto to Tokyo, our employees are all welcoming the opportunity to put forward a unified brand. We are on track to hit our synergy target of $125 million by the end of our third year. We're beginning to ramp up investments in these opportunities and are confident that they will deliver strong returns. Later on, I will share some early success stories. Integration and synergy capture are high priorities, but we also remain focused on the business at hand. 
Turning to the second quarter. Constant-currency revenue growth of 3.4% was driven by internal growth of 2.4%. Rest of World led with 7.5% internal growth, showing strength in both consumables and technologies. I am particularly pleased to see the strong performance of our team in challenging geographies such as China and Brazil. Our U.S. business grew 3.8% with 1.2% internal growth driven by consumables. Our technologies business came off a strong Q1 while we continue to lead in the digital sensor category with our XIVE brand, our second quarter growth was negatively impacted by lower shipments of epidural sensors. 
In Europe, we managed to grow on top of our 9% growth in Q2 last year. We were pleased to maintain the high level of revenues in this region with consumables offsetting declines in technologies. As a reminder, our equipment business grew strong double digits in Europe last year, associated with a record IDF. 
Turning to our business segments. Dental and Healthcare Consumables delivered constant-currency growth of 3.4% and internal growth of 3.8%. Growth was broad-based across all dental and health care product categories. We are particularly proud of the rebound in our prosthetics business following last year's reorganization. They are energized to take advantage of the opportunities presented to the lab business through the merger. 
Our technology segment grew 3.3% constant-currency with 1% internal growth. As noted earlier, this follows double-digit growth in the prior year and strong growth in Q1. Regionally, growth in Rest of the World offset declines in Europe. 
Adjusted EPS of $0.76 grew 4.1%. Net income growth of 75% offset the impact of additional shares issued in the merger. During the quarter, we also delivered on our commitment to return capital to our shareholders. We bought back an additional 1.6 million shares for $100 million and paid $18 million in dividends. Our balance sheet remains strong and gives us the flexibility to pursue multiple avenues of value creation. In June, we announced the agreement to acquire MIS Implants for $375 million. MIS is a leading value implant manufacturer with a strong brand across the globe. This acquisition represents our entry into the growing $1.5 billion value implant market. MIS will play an important role in many of our dental solution strategies. 
Overall, I am pleased with what we accomplished in a very short period of time both operationally and strategically. 
I will now turn the call over to Uly, who will review our second quarter financials."
27504,377271651,1026659,"DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2016",2016-08-05,"Earnings Calls","DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will discuss our U.S. GAAP results as well as our non-GAAP adjusted results. As I walk through the earnings performance, I will also point out major impacts of merger accounting on our results. I",951,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will discuss our U.S. GAAP results as well as our non-GAAP adjusted results. As I walk through the earnings performance, I will also point out major impacts of merger accounting on our results. 
In the second quarter, our recorded revenue increased $324 million to $1,022,000,000, up 46.4% from last year. Adjusted sales of our combined businesses, excluding precious metals, grew 3.4% on a constant-currency basis. Internal growth was 2.4%, excluding a 1.5% favorable impact from net acquisitions and 50 basis points unfavorable impact from discontinued products. Foreign exchange movements were headwinds to revenue of approximately 70 basis points. As a reminder, these growth percentages reflect the performance of the combined business as if it had been consolidated on January 1, 2015. 
Jeff already addressed revenue growth by geography and segment. We have provided reconciliation tables for every segment and region that will help you understand how the GAAP reported revenue and internal growth come together. 
U.S. GAAP gross profit was $526.9 million, up $127.2 million or 31.8% from 2015. Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, excluding precious metal content, decreased by 680 basis points to 52.4% from 59.2% in the prior year. As you can see on the non-GAAP reconciliation tables, the gross profit margin was negatively impacted by 780 basis points, mostly due to the effects of step-up amortization and other merchant-related items. On an adjusted basis, gross profit margin was 60.2% for the quarter. The company generated benefits from its global efficiency program, which largely offset negative foreign currency impacts. 
Reported SG&A expense, which includes R&D, was $402.1 million, up $127.1 million or 46.2% versus last year. This equates to 40% of sales, excluding precious metals, 80 basis points below prior year. The decrease was primarily the result of Sirona's lower operating expense rate and savings from the global efficiency program, partially offset by increased amortization expense and other costs related to the merger. Adjusted for these non-GAAP items, SG&A expense, as a percentage of sales, excluding precious metals, was 37.1% compared to 39% last year. The ratio was largely unaffected by FX. 
Restructuring expenses were $3.6 million, down from $38.9 million last year. In 2015, the company reorganized portions of its laboratory business and associated manufacturing capabilities within the Dental and Healthcare Consumables segment. 
In total, GAAP operating income was $121.2 million, up $35.4 million or 41.3% from last year. Excluding the non-GAAP items set forth in our non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted operating margin was 23.1%, up 190 basis points compared to 21.2% last year. Margins benefited from the positive impacts of the global efficiency program and the consolidation of Sirona. FX had a negative impact of approximately 80 basis points on the rate. 
Net interest expense for the second quarter was $8.9 million, $200,000 lower than prior year. 
Other income in the second quarter was $11.5 million, up $11.2 million from prior year. During the quarter, there were significant foreign exchange movements which provided a $13 million tailwind to other income. Approximately $9 million of this amount reflects unrealized gains on intercompany balances caused by currency movements following the Brexit vote at quarter-end. 
For the 3 months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded U.S. GAAP income tax expense of $17.9 million versus $24.8 million last year. The 2016 expense is based on a full year adjusted operational tax rate of 23%, in line with last year's rate. 
Q2 U.S. GAAP net income attributable to DENTSPLY SIRONA was $105.4 million, up 139% from the prior year. Second quarter 2016 diluted GAAP EPS was $0.44 compared to $0.31 in the prior year. Adjusted non-GAAP net income grew 74.6% to $180.9 million. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.76, up 4.1% from last year, as net income growth more than offset the impact of additional share issuance related to the merger. For a reconciliation of GAAP EPS to non-GAAP adjusted EPS, please see our earnings press release. 
Cash flow from operating activities during the quarter was $187.4 million compared to $145.6 million last year. Cash used in investing activities was $18.1 million compared to $14.4 million in the prior year. The year-over-year increases were primarily related to the consolidation with Sirona. The sum of operating and investing cash flows resulted in free cash flow of $169.3 million compared to $131.3 million last year. As you can see, we used the free cash flow in Q2 to settle repurchases of shares and to pay dividends to our shareholders. We finished the quarter with a cash balance of $311.6 million. 
Now turning to guidance. We reiterate our previous guidance. For fiscal 2016, we still expect adjusted non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.70 to $2.80. Our guidance includes the following key inputs: constant-currency sales growth to range from 4% to 6%, excluding precious metals. This includes a 1% net benefit from acquisitions, divestitures and discontinued products and internal growth in the range of 3% to 5%. At current exchange rates, this translates to reported revenues, including precious metals, of about $3.73 billion to $3.81 billion. Please keep in mind that we continue to face a challenging comp in Q3 related to last year's record international dental show and strong performance in our consumables business. At the current exchange rates, we would expect adjusted operating income margins in the range of 21% to 22%. We anticipate our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 23%. Our EPS range implies a full year share count of 220 million to 225 million fully diluted shares and FX headwinds up to $0.10. Our guidance does not include the impact of MIS or any other prospective acquisitions. 
I will now turn the call back to Jeff. Jeff?"
27504,377271651,1026659,"DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2016",2016-08-05,"Earnings Calls","DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Uly. With our second quarter behind us, we have even more confidence that DENTSPLY SIRONA is ideally positioned to benefit from 6 megatrends in dentistry. First, positive demographics are driving the need for more dental care around the world. Wit",1099,"Thanks, Uly. With our second quarter behind us, we have even more confidence that DENTSPLY SIRONA is ideally positioned to benefit from 6 megatrends in dentistry. First, positive demographics are driving the need for more dental care around the world. With the broadest portfolio of products and the widest geographical coverage, DENTSPLY SIRONA is in an outstanding position to capitalize on this trend. We are actively driving 2 other megatrends, the adoption of digital dentistry and single-visit dentistry. It is broadly agreed in the industry that both of these will become standard of care. While everyone is trying to jump on the digital wave, just offering a product in a category isn't enough. Brand, technology and service are key differentiators. As the innovator and market leader, DENTSPLY SIRONA uniquely provides the confidence to dental professionals to go digital. We are committed to keep investing in R&D to maintain and extend our leadership position. 
Last week, we saw another good indication that these trends are accelerating. In Berlin, the German Society for Computerized Dentistry opened a digital dental academy. This establishment is the first of its kind in Europe. They chose to partner with DENTSPLY SIRONA for equipment and consumables. This organization will work with leading universities and facilities to privately train on digital workflow. 
Additionally, we see dental labs increasingly partnering up with dentists to assist them in buying our Omnicam. Digital impression is proving to not only be positive for the dentist and the patient, but for the lab as well. 
Another megatrend is the general practitioners are expanding their practice and performing more specialized procedures. To do so, they require technology as well as training and education. DENTSPLY SIRONA has the broadest clinical education platform in the industry. Each year, we train over 300,000 clinicians covering all procedures and treatment categories around the world. We have developed this capability over decades with significant investment resources. We also work with dental schools around the globe to ensure adoption of our best-in-class technology. 
In the U.S., DENTSPLY SIRONA products are in virtually all dental and dental hygiene schools. Our vision to improve oral health around the globe will be driven by the next-generation of practitioners who are learning on our products today. 
During the quarter, we announced a collaboration with NYU College of Dentistry. We are providing a fully equipped endodontic clinical suite. We will employ the most advanced educational and patient care technologies available with equipment and consumables from DENTSPLY SIRONA. This synergy came as a result of the teamwork within our organization and the innovative products we offer. 
Another megatrend is the expansion of group practices. Groups understand the value of efficiency and consistency of care. They are gaining greater appreciation of the competitive advantages associated with single-visit dentistry. Therefore, exceptional technology, training and education are critical when selecting manufacturing partners. As DENTSPLY SIRONA, we are best positioned to meet their needs. 
Last but not least, integrated workflow is another megatrend. One key rationale for our merger was the convergence of consumables and technology to address this trend. Next week, SIROWORLD event will provide thousands of dental professionals their first experience with the power of our integrated solutions. 
With our current product portfolio and commitment to innovation, DENTSPLY SIRONA is the only manufacturer with the ability to offer end-to-end solutions to dental professionals. 
As I promised earlier, let me now share with you some early integration success stories. On the cost side, we are well into the country development process. We're combining organizations in multiple countries to form country and regional teams. This will reduce costs, improve collaboration, cross-selling, leverage customer resources and relationships. We have recently kicked off a major initiative focused on creating a best-in-class support structure. We are currently establishing the appropriate baseline for general and administrative resources to support future growth. Building on our past success in procurement, we have established a global team that is focused on saving opportunities with vendors on both materials and services. 
While becoming more efficient is critical to our success, our merger will be defined by our ability to accelerate growth and drive revenue synergies. With the largest sales and service infrastructure in the industry, we are uniquely positioned to deliver on our offering. Leveraging 4,000 sales professionals and 5,000 distributors around the world, we are introducing commercial strategies to capture revenue synergies. We have established a project management structure to drive execution. 
During the quarter, communication and teamwork between DENTSPLY SIRONA equipment and consumables specialists resulted in us winning an international hospital vendor. Thanks to their teamwork, we offered a much stronger proposition to the hospital. As a result, we ended up selling double the amount of product. 
Another way in which we are driving revenue synergies is through product innovation. During the quarter, we introduced multiple solutions to the marketplace. These products will have impact for years to come. In chairside consumables, we are beginning to launch Aquasil Ultra Plus, a new, best-in-class impression material that makes taking impressions quicker and easier. And Endo, we are rolling out our new -- next-generation endodontic file to do root canals faster and safer. In ortho, we launched our new Omni Plus and Bio Force Plus brackets and wires. We are in the very early stages of transforming this business. These new products, along with others, will help us grow and gain market share. 
One of the unique opportunities for DENTSPLY SIRONA is the collaboration and development of new, fully integrated solutions. As you know, earlier this year, we launched our zirconia package with both equipment and consumables. CEREC Zirconia package is driving robust demand for both equipment and consumables. We continue to expand our materials offering. The ability to do zirconia chairside is opening up new customer base and creating additional interest in CEREC. The large community of zirconia users can now offer single-visit dentistry to their patients. 
Overall, I am pleased with our accomplishments to date. We are all looking forward to SIROWORLD next week. This will be our first major event as DENTSPLY SIRONA. The team is very excited to interact with dental professionals and demonstrate why DENTSPLY SIRONA is The Dental Solutions Company. 
I'd like to thank our customers for their loyal support, trust and enthusiasm for DENTSPLY SIRONA. We are pleased to recognize our distributing partners for their loyal support. I'd also like to extend a special thanks to our employees who daily show their commitment to improve the lives of dental professionals and their patients. Together, we would change dentistry for the better. 
We will now address your questions. Operator, please proceed."

We would say that the market is stable, and we continue to be optimistic about it as we progress through the summer. But keep in mind that there is ebbs and flows in the summer and there can be some spottiness with that. We are excited about the demand we see for our CEREC World event next week, which seem to pick up the attendance in June and July. So we think that that's positive. And certainly, we're announcing a number of new products, which I think is always critical to driving growth. So can't really comment on seeing too much softness, but certainly, in parts of the business, we can understand why that could be said."

With regard to implant, we're seeing some nice bundling opportunities with our 3D there and also on customer abutments. But I would say we're looking to show balance throughout.

So I think Europe fundamentally has not changed since our last call, except for something called Brexit, which certainly adds another level of uncertainty. We had some early benefits that we really highlighted a bit from it, but that would be a change. What I would tell you is that Europe did well for us in general from a perspective that Germany was a drag, right? We could not expect with the extraordinary year we had last year, which was truly a record, that we could grown on that. But I wouldn't see we lost any market share there. And as I look, if you take Germany out of Northern Europe, it was rather solid for us. And certainly, as we look at Southern Europe, very solid and feel good about with what we saw. Growth in France, Italy, Spain. A positive quarter for us in Europe."

Maybe we'll start with the FX impact, right? When we last spoke to you, we said that the guidance implies about a $0.10 headwind in FX. We've had, for the full year, we had a $0.04 headwind in Q1. We've now had all-in $0.01 tailwind in",479,"Yes. Thanks, Jeff. Maybe we'll start with the FX impact, right? When we last spoke to you, we said that the guidance implies about a $0.10 headwind in FX. We've had, for the full year, we had a $0.04 headwind in Q1. We've now had all-in $0.01 tailwind in Q2, but that includes this onetime impact from the Brexit moves. What happened is that we supply out of Europe into South America, Asia, Australia, Eastern Europe, many of these countries products. And we have receivables on our euro books in Brazilian real, in Japanese yen, in Australian dollars, South African rand, you name it. And all these currencies [indiscernible] strengthened to the euro when the Brexit vote happened. And we realized about the -- what we didn't realize, we recorded about a $9 million gain on this in the company receivables. Now who knows whether these will stay or whether the exchange rates will move back. Our guidance does not give, everything else being equal, full credits to these gains. Now if I look at what has happened since quarter-end, we probably lost somewhere between $0.005 to $0.01 on these gains by currency movements. If they stay, that is a positive. Now when we give guidance, we weigh all the pros and cons very carefully. And we try to give you the best estimate and the balanced judgment of what we see. And there is upsides and downsides. And sometimes, we end up being too optimistic. Sometimes, too conservative. Maybe on the FX point, we've taken a bit of a conservative view. But on the other hand, our guidance does not include a deterioration of end markets in the second half of the year. And you've heard one of our biggest customers yesterday express more concerns. We looked at it, as Jeff mentioned, we saw the spottiness and softness in part of the U.S. consumable markets going through the summer as well. But when we look at the big picture, the macroeconomics for North America, very strong. Job creation is good, especially white-collar jobs. So we sit here, when we look fundamentally, we do not really why there should be a major deterioration. So we did not include this in our guidance and in the forecast we had prepared. So if we weigh all this, we do think it is a realistic and weighted guidance that we gave you. There's a range you can apply judgment yourself, if you believe, based on the factors we explained to you, maybe where might end up rather in the upper end or on the lower part. But we try to be transparent with it, and we apply our best judgment we can based on all the facts and circumstances we see and we know. And it was a lengthy answer, but I hope it helps you think some of the things, Jeff."

The aspect of the real uncertainty in the overall macro market has -- it's still out there, right? Russia has not improved. While we're pleased about what we're able to do in Brazil and China, those markets are challenged. Middle East continues to have some difficulties. So we have to put that in the overall perspective. We heard from Shine yesterday what they're viewing. We can't discount it, although we don't see it, but we see it in a little bit in a spotty way. And then we talk about the bigger issues, which is the macro trends and the megatrends, which we talked about earlier in the call, which are all working our way, and plus the ability for our team to come together, which I think is very positive, what I'm seeing. And you can't emphasize enough how good it is to recognize some of our businesses that have taken a little bit of time to get back like lab and ortho starting to progress. Remember, we said Rest of World would be our driver of growth this year. But as we go into the third quarter, remember that's a pretty tough comp, record IDS and CEREC 30 was strong. So we got to keep that all in our consideration, Jeff. And I think that's my perspective of kind of pulling out some of the stuff that Uly was saying. And that's built in into our range. We'll certainly -- are we optimistic that next week's SIROWORLD will be -- sorry, Steve -- will be a very positive event for our organization? Absolutely. Do we -- but we've got to move through the summer and see how we finish up. And we've decided it's appropriate to keep the range that we have given all of those issues. But we don't see a fundamental change in our business proposition that we have.

So very exciting opportunity for us, specifically to get into the value segment, which we know is growing faster than other segments in dental. And $1.5 billion market size is something that's significant when you're talking about a market that's maybe $25 billion overall in dental and the space that we play in. I think when you couple that together with the installed base of customers we have, there's a lot of room. We do see a trend that more and more dentists are having a dual-brand strategy to meeting their implant needs. And from a perspective of making a decision in this category, we thought MIS had the best brand that cut across multiple regions and countries. Most value brands are country-specific. MIS is unusual to that and is an exciting product to add to our portfolio. Chris, let me hand it over to you."

It is my pleasure to welcome you all to our second quarter conference call. Also joining us on the call today: Uly Michel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Chris Clark, our President and Chief Operating Officer, Technologies; and Derek Leckow, Vice President of Investor Relations. 
Our second quarter represented our first full quarter as DENTSPLY SIRONA. We are now at day 168 of the merger. And after seeing the progress we've made and the talent we have, I'm even more optimistic today than I was on day 1. 
Our culture remains a top priority for myself and the management team. We are already seeing the benefits of our focus on this priority. We are designating resources to ensure that our people come together as a high-performance organization. 
During the quarter, we selected culture champions and have begun to hold workshops. Our 15,000 employees are embracing our mission, vision and values, which are all aimed at accelerating growth and having a greater impact on the dental community. 
I'm also pleased with the rollout of our new DENTSPLY SIRONA brand. Across the globe, our employees are embracing being one global team. From recruiting, to trade shows, Toronto to Tokyo, our employees are welcoming the opportunity to put forward a unified brand. We are on track to hit our synergy target of $125 million by the end of our third year. We're beginning to ramp up investments in these opportunities and are confident that they will deliver strong returns. Later on, I will share some early success stories. Integration and synergy capture are high priorities, but we also remain focused on the business at hand. 
Turning to the second quarter. Constant-currency revenue growth of 3.4% was driven by internal growth of 2.4%. Rest of World led with 7.5% internal growth, showing strength in both consumables and technologies. I am particularly pleased to see the strong performance of our team in challenging geographies such as China and Brazil. Our U.S. business grew 3.8% with 1.2% internal growth driven by consumables. Our technologies business came off a strong Q1 while we continue to lead in the digital sensor category with our Schick brand, our second quarter growth was negatively impacted by lower shipments of epidural sensors. 
In Europe, we managed to grow on top of our 9% growth in Q2 last year. We were pleased to maintain the high level of revenues in this region with consumables offsetting declines in technologies. As a reminder, our equipment business grew strong double digits in Europe last year, associated with a record IDF. 
Turning to our business segments. Dental and Healthcare Consumables delivered constant-currency growth of 3.4% and internal growth of 3.8%. Growth was broad-based across all dental and health care product categories. We are particularly proud of the rebound in our prosthetics business following last year's reorganization. They are energized to take advantage of the opportunities presented to the lab business through the merger. 
Our technology segment grew 3.3% constant-currency with 1% internal growth. As noted earlier, this follows double-digit growth in the prior year and strong growth in Q1. Regionally, growth in Rest of the World offset declines in Europe. 
Adjusted EPS of $0.76 grew 4.1%. Net income growth of 75% offset the impact of additional shares issued in the merger. During the quarter, we also delivered on our commitment to return capital to our shareholders. We bought back an additional 1.6 million shares for $100 million and paid $18 million in dividends. Our balance sheet remains strong and gives us the flexibility to pursue multiple avenues of value creation. In June, we announced the agreement to acquire MIS Implants for $375 million. MIS is a leading value implant manufacturer with a strong brand across the globe. This acquisition represents our entry into the growing $1.5 billion value implant market. MIS will play an important role in many of our dental solution strategies. 
Overall, I am pleased with what we accomplished in a very short period of time both operationally and strategically. 
I will now turn the call over to Uly, who will review our second quarter financials."

This morning, I will discuss our U.S. GAAP results as well as our non-GAAP adjusted results. As I walk through the earnings performance, I will also point out major impacts of merger accounting on our results. I",951,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will discuss our U.S. GAAP results as well as our non-GAAP adjusted results. As I walk through the earnings performance, I will also point out major impacts of merger accounting on our results. 
In the second quarter, our recorded revenue increased $324 million to $1,022,000,000, up 46.4% from last year. Adjusted sales of our combined businesses, excluding precious metals, grew 3.4% on a constant-currency basis. Internal growth was 2.4%, excluding a 1.5% favorable impact from net acquisitions and 50 basis points unfavorable impact from discontinued products. Foreign exchange movements were headwinds to revenue of approximately 70 basis points. As a reminder, these growth percentages reflect the performance of the combined business as if it had been consolidated on January 1, 2015. 
Jeff already addressed revenue growth by geography and segment. We have provided reconciliation tables for every segment and region that will help you understand how the GAAP reported revenue and internal growth come together. 
U.S. GAAP gross profit was $526.9 million, up $127.2 million or 31.8% from 2015. Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, excluding precious metal content, decreased by 680 basis points to 52.4% from 59.2% in the prior year. As you can see on the non-GAAP reconciliation tables, the gross profit margin was negatively impacted by 780 basis points, mostly due to the effects of step-up amortization and other merchant-related items. On an adjusted basis, gross profit margin was 60.2% for the quarter. The company generated benefits from its global efficiency program, which largely offset negative foreign currency impacts. 
Reported SG&A expense, which includes R&D, was $402.1 million, up $127.1 million or 46.2% versus last year. This equates to 40% of sales, excluding precious metals, 80 basis points below prior year. The decrease was primarily the result of Sirona's lower operating expense rate and savings from the global efficiency program, partially offset by increased amortization expense and other costs related to the merger. Adjusted for these non-GAAP items, SG&A expense, as a percentage of sales, excluding precious metals, was 37.1% compared to 39% last year. The ratio was largely unaffected by FX. 
Restructuring expenses were $3.6 million, down from $38.9 million last year. In 2015, the company reorganized portions of its laboratory business and associated manufacturing capabilities within the Dental and Healthcare Consumables segments. 
In total, GAAP operating income was $121.2 million, up $35.4 million or 41.3% from last year. Excluding the non-GAAP items set forth in our non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted operating margin was 23.1%, up 190 basis points compared to 21.2% last year. Margins benefited from the positive impacts of the global efficiency program and the consolidation of Sirona. FX had a negative impact of approximately 80 basis points on the rate. 
Net interest expense for the second quarter was $8.9 million, $200,000 lower than prior year. 
Other income in the second quarter was $11.5 million, up $11.2 million from prior year. During the quarter, there were significant foreign exchange movements which provided a $13 million tailwind to other income. Approximately $9 million of this amount reflects unrealized gains on intercompany balances caused by currency movements following the Brexit vote at quarter-end. 
For the 3 months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded U.S. GAAP income tax expense of $17.9 million versus $24.8 million last year. The 2016 expense is based on a full year adjusted operational tax rate of 23%, in line with last year's rate. 
Q2 U.S. GAAP net income attributable to DENTSPLY SIRONA was $105.4 million, up 139% from the prior year. Second quarter 2016 diluted GAAP EPS was $0.44 compared to $0.31 in the prior year. Adjusted non-GAAP net income grew 74.6% to $180.9 million. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.76, up 4.1% from last year, as net income growth more than offset the impact of additional share issuance related to the merger. For a reconciliation of GAAP EPS to non-GAAP adjusted EPS, please see our earnings press release. 
Cash flow from operating activities during the quarter was $187.4 million compared to $145.6 million last year. Cash used in investing activities was $18.1 million compared to $14.4 million in the prior year. The year-over-year increases were primarily related to the consolidation with Sirona. The sum of operating and investing cash flows resulted in free cash flow of $169.3 million compared to $131.3 million last year. As you can see, we used the free cash flow in Q2 to settle repurchases of shares and to pay dividends to our shareholders. We finished the quarter with a cash balance of $311.6 million. 
Now turning to guidance. We reiterate our previous guidance. For fiscal 2016, we still expect adjusted non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.70 to $2.80. Our guidance includes the following key inputs: constant-currency sales growth to range from 4% to 6%, excluding precious metals. This includes a 1% net benefit from acquisitions, divestitures and discontinued products and internal growth in the range of 3% to 5%. At current exchange rates, this translates to reported revenues, including precious metals, of about $3.73 billion to $3.81 billion. Please keep in mind that we continue to face a challenging comp in Q3 related to last year's record international dental show and strong performance in our consumables business. At the current exchange rates, we would expect adjusted operating income margins in the range of 21% to 22%. We anticipate our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 23%. Our EPS range implies a full year share count of 220 million to 225 million fully diluted shares and FX headwinds up to $0.10. Our guidance does not include the impact of MIS or any other prospective acquisitions. 
I will now turn the call back to Jeff. Jeff?"

With our second quarter behind us, we have even more confidence that DENTSPLY SIRONA is ideally positioned to benefit from 6 megatrends in dentistry. First, positive demographics are driving the need for more dental care around the world. Wit",1098,"Thanks, Uly. With our second quarter behind us, we have even more confidence that DENTSPLY SIRONA is ideally positioned to benefit from 6 megatrends in dentistry. First, positive demographics are driving the need for more dental care around the world. With the broadest portfolio of products and the widest geographical coverage, DENTSPLY SIRONA is in an outstanding position to capitalize on this trend. We are actively driving 2 other megatrends, the adoption of digital dentistry and single-visit dentistry. It is broadly agreed in the industry that both of these will become standard of care. While everyone is trying to jump on the digital wave, just offering a product in the category isn't enough. Brand, technology and service are key differentiators. As the innovator and market leader, DENTSPLY SIRONA uniquely provides the confidence to dental professionals to go digital. We are committed to keep investing in R&D to maintain and extend our leadership position. 
Last week, we saw another good indication that these trends are accelerating. In Berlin, the German Society for Computerized Dentistry opened a digital dental academy. This establishment is the first of its kind in Europe. They chose to partner with DENTSPLY SIRONA for equipment and consumables. This organization will work with leading universities and facilities to privately train on digital workflow. 
Additionally, we see dental labs increasingly partnering up with dentists to assist them in buying our Omnicam. Digital impression is proving to not only be positive for the dentist and the patient, but for the lab as well. 
Another megatrend is the general practitioners are expanding their practice and performing more specialized procedures. To do so, they require technology as well as training and education. DENTSPLY SIRONA has the broadest clinical education platform in the industry. Each year, we train over 300,000 clinicians covering all procedures and treatment categories around the world. We have developed this capability over decades with significant investment resources. We also work with dental schools around the globe to ensure adoption of our best-in-class technology. 
In the U.S., DENTSPLY SIRONA products are in virtually all dental and dental hygiene schools. Our vision to improve oral health around the globe will be driven by the next-generation of practitioners who are learning on our products today. 
During the quarter, we announced a collaboration with NYU College of Dentistry. We are providing a fully equipped endodontic clinical suite. We will employ the most advanced educational and patient care technologies available with equipment and consumables from DENTSPLY SIRONA. This synergy came as a result of the teamwork within our organization and the innovative products we offer. 
Another megatrend is the expansion of group practices. Groups understand the value of efficiency and consistency of care. They are gaining greater appreciation of the competitive advantages associated with single-visit dentistry. Therefore, exceptional technology, training and education are critical when selecting manufacturing partners. As DENTSPLY SIRONA, we are best positioned to meet their needs. 
Last but not least, integrated workflow is another megatrend. One key rationale for our merger was the convergence of consumables and technology to address this trend. Next week, SIROWORLD event will provide thousands of dental professionals their first experience with the power of our integrated solutions. 
With our current product portfolio and commitment to innovation, DENTSPLY SIRONA is the only manufacturer with the ability to offer end-to-end solutions to dental professionals. 
As I promised earlier, let me now share with you some early integration success stories. On the cost side, we are well into the country development process. We're combining organizations in multiple countries to form country and regional teams. This will reduce costs, improve collaboration, cross-selling, leverage customer resources and relationships. We have recently kicked off a major initiative focused on creating a best-in-class support structure. We are currently establishing the appropriate baseline for general and administrative resources to support future growth. Building on our past success in procurement, we have established a global team that is focused on saving opportunities with vendors on both materials and services. 
While becoming more efficient is critical to our success, our merger will be defined by our ability to accelerate growth and drive revenue synergies. With the largest sales and service infrastructure in the industry, we are uniquely positioned to deliver on our offering. Leveraging 4,000 sales professionals and 5,000 distributors around the world, we are introducing commercial strategies to capture revenue synergies. We have established a project management structure to drive execution. 
During the quarter, communication and teamwork between DENTSPLY SIRONA equipment and consumables specialists resulted in us winning an international hospital vendor. Thanks to their teamwork, we offered a much stronger proposition to the hospital. As a result, we ended up selling double the amount of product. 
Another way in which we are driving revenue synergies is through product innovation. During the quarter, we introduced multiple solutions to the marketplace. These products will have impact for years to come. In chairside consumables, we are beginning to launch Aquasil Ultra Plus, a new, best-in-class impression material, it makes taking impressions quicker and easier. In Endo, we are rolling out our new RECIPROC Root,  next-generation endodontic file to do root canals faster and safer. In ortho, we launched our new Omni Plus and BioForce Plus brackets and wires. We are in the very early stages of transforming this business. These new products, along with others, will help us grow and gain market share. 
One of the unique opportunities for DENTSPLY SIRONA is the collaboration and development of new, fully integrated solutions. As you know, earlier this year, we launched our zirconia package with both equipment and consumables. CEREC Zirconia package is driving robust demand for both equipment and consumables. We continue to expand our materials offering. The ability to do zirconia chairside is opening up new customer base and creating additional interest in CEREC. The large community of zirconia users can now offer single-visit dentistry to their patients. 
Overall, I am pleased with our accomplishments to date. We are all looking forward to SIROWORLD next week. This will be our first major event as DENTSPLY SIRONA. The team is very excited to interact with dental professionals and demonstrate why DENTSPLY SIRONA is The Dental Solutions Company. 
I'd like to thank our customers for their loyal support, trust and enthusiasm for DENTSPLY SIRONA. We are pleased to recognize our distributing partners for their loyal support. I'd also like to extend a special thanks to our employees who daily show their commitment to improve the lives of dental professionals and their patients. Together, we'll change dentistry for the better.

But keep in mind that there is ebbs and flows in the summer and there can be some spottiness with that. We are excited about the demand we see for our CEREC World event next week, which seem to pick up the attendance in June and July. So we think that that's positive.

With regard to implant, we're seeing some nice bundling opportunities with our 3D there and also on customer abutment. But I would say that we're looking to show balance throughout.

Maybe we'll start with the FX impact, right? When we last spoke to you, we said that the guidance implies about a $0.10 headwind in FX. We've had, for the full year, we've had a $0.04 headwind in Q1. We've now had all-in $0.01 tailwind",477,"Yes. Thanks, Jeff. Maybe we'll start with the FX impact, right? When we last spoke to you, we said that the guidance implies about a $0.10 headwind in FX. We've had, for the full year, we've had a $0.04 headwind in Q1. We've now had all-in $0.01 tailwind in Q2, but that includes this onetime impact from the Brexit moves. What happened is that we supply out of Europe into South America, Asia, Australia, Eastern Europe, many of these countries products. And we have receivables on our euro books in Brazilian real, in Japanese yen, in Australian dollars, South African rand, you name it. And all these currencies certainly strengthened to the euro when the Brexit vote happened. And we realized about  -- we didn't realize we recorded about a $9 million gain on this in the company receivables. Now who knows whether these will stay or whether the exchange rates will move back. Our guidance does not give, everything else being equal, full credits to these gains. Now if I look what has happened since quarter-end, we probably lost somewhere between $0.005 to $0.01 again on these gains by currency movements. If they stay, that is a positive. Now when we give guidance, we weigh all the pros and cons very carefully. And we try to give you the best estimate and a balanced judgment of what we see. And there are upsides and downsides. And sometimes, we end up being too optimistic. Sometimes, too conservative. Maybe on the FX point, we've taken a bit of a conservative view. But on the other hand, our guidance does not include a deterioration of end markets in the second half of the year. And you've heard one of our biggest customers yesterday express more concerns. We looked at it, as Jeff mentioned, we saw the spottiness and softness in parts of the U.S. consumable markets going into the summer as well. But when we look at the big picture, the macroeconomics for North America, very strong. Job creation is good, especially white-collar jobs. So we said here, look fundamentally, we do not really see why there should be a major deterioration. So we did not include this in our guidance and in the forecast we had prepared. So if we weigh all this, we do think it is a realistic and weighted guidance that we gave you. There's a range you can apply judgment yourself, if you believe, based on the factors we explained to you, maybe where we might end up rather on the upper end or on the lower part. But we try to be transparent with this, and we apply our best judgment we can based on all the facts and circumstances we see and we know. And it was a lengthy answer, but I hope it helps you think some of the things, Jeff."

While we're pleased about what we're able to do in Brazil and China, those markets are challenged. Middle East continues to have some difficulties. So we have to put that in the overall perspective. We heard from Schein yesterday what they're viewing. We can't discount it, although we don't see it, but we see it in a little bit spotty way. And then we talk about the bigger issues, which is the macro trends and the megatrends, which we talked about earlier in the call, which are all working our way, and plus the ability for our team to come together, which I think is very positive, what I'm seeing. And you can't emphasize enough how good it is to recognize some of our businesses that have taken a little bit of time to get back like lab and ortho starting to progress. Remember, we said Rest of World would be our driver of growth this year. But as we go into the third quarter, remember that's a pretty tough comp, record IDS and CEREC 30 was strong.

Relative to relative growth sizes, again, if you look over a longer-time period, value implants generally are growing in the mid- to high single-digit range, probably skewing over a longer period of time in the high single-digit range.

It is my pleasure to welcome you all to our second quarter conference call. Also joining us on the call today: Uly Michel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Chris Clark, our President and Chief Operating Officer, Technologies; and Derek Leckow, Vice President of Investor Relations. 
Our second quarter represented our first full quarter as DENTSPLY SIRONA. We are now at day 168 of the merger. And after seeing the progress we've made and the talent we have, I'm even more optimistic today than I was on day 1. 
Our culture remains a top priority for myself and the management team. We are already seeing the benefits of our focus on this priority. We are designating resources to ensure that our people come together as a high-performance organization. 
During the quarter, we selected culture champions and have begun to hold workshops. Our 15,000 employees are embracing our mission, vision and values, which are all aimed at accelerating growth and having a greater impact on the dental community. 
I'm also pleased with the rollout of our new DENTSPLY SIRONA brand. Across the globe, our employees are embracing being one global team. From recruiting, to trade shows, Toronto to Tokyo, our employees are welcoming the opportunity to put forward a unified brand. We are on track to hit our synergy target of $125 million by the end of our third year. We're beginning to ramp up investments in these opportunities and are confident that they will deliver strong returns. Later on, I will share some early success stories. Integration and synergy capture are high priorities, but we also remain focused on the business at hand. 
Turning to the second quarter. Constant-currency revenue growth of 3.4% was driven by internal growth of 2.4%. Rest of World led with 7.5% internal growth, showing strength in both consumables and technologies. I am particularly pleased to see the strong performance of our team in challenging geographies such as China and Brazil. Our U.S. business grew 3.8% with 1.2% internal growth driven by consumables. Our technologies business came off a strong Q1 while we continue to lead in the digital sensor category with our Schick brand. Our second quarter growth was negatively impacted by lower shipments of epidural sensors. 
In Europe, we managed to grow on top of our 9% growth in Q2 last year. We were pleased to maintain the high level of revenues in this region with consumables offsetting declines in technologies. As a reminder, our equipment business grew strong double digits in Europe last year, associated with a record IDF. 
Turning to our business segments. Dental and Healthcare Consumables delivered constant-currency growth of 3.4% and internal growth of 3.8%. Growth was broad-based across all dental and health care product categories. We are particularly proud of the rebound in our prosthetics business following last year's reorganization. They are energized to take advantage of the opportunities presented to the lab business through the merger. 
Our technology segment grew 3.3% constant-currency with 1% internal growth. As noted earlier, this follows double-digit growth in the prior year and strong growth in Q1. Regionally, growth in Rest of the World offset declines in Europe. 
Adjusted EPS of $0.76 grew 4.1%. Net income growth of 75% offset the impact of additional shares issued in the merger. During the quarter, we also delivered on our commitment to return capital to our shareholders. We bought back an additional 1.6 million shares for $100 million and paid $18 million in dividends. Our balance sheet remains strong and gives us the flexibility to pursue multiple avenues of value creation. In June, we announced the agreement to acquire MIS Implants for $375 million. MIS is a leading value implant manufacturer with a strong brand across the globe. This acquisition represents our entry into the growing $1.5 billion value implant market. MIS will play an important role in many of our dental solution strategies. 
Overall, I am pleased with what we accomplished in a very short period of time both operationally and strategically. 
I will now turn the call over to Uly, who will review our second quarter financials."

This morning, I will discuss our U.S. GAAP results as well as our non-GAAP adjusted results. As I walk through the earnings performance, I will also point out major impacts of merger accounting on our results. 
In the second quarter, our recorded revenue increased $324 million to $1,022,000,000, up 46.4% from last year. Adjusted sales of our combined businesses, excluding precious metals, grew 3.4% on a constant-currency basis. Internal growth was 2.4%, excluding a 1.5% favorable impact from net acquisitions and 50 basis points unfavorable impact from discontinued products. Foreign exchange movements were headwinds to revenue of approximately 70 basis points. As a reminder, these growth percentages reflect the performance of the combined business as if it had been consolidated on January 1, 2015. 
Jeff already addressed revenue growth by geography and segment. We have provided reconciliation tables for every segment and region that will help you understand how the GAAP reported revenue and internal growth come together. 
U.S. GAAP gross profit was $526.9 million, up $127.2 million or 31.8% from 2015. Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, excluding precious metal content, decreased by 680 basis points to 52.4% from 59.2% in the prior year. As you can see on the non-GAAP reconciliation tables, the gross profit margin was negatively impacted by 780 basis points, mostly due to the effects of step-up amortization and other merchant-related items. On an adjusted basis, gross profit margin was 60.2% for the quarter. The company generated benefits from its global efficiency program, which largely offset negative foreign currency impacts. 
Reported SG&A expense, which includes R&D, was $402.1 million, up $127.1 million or 46.2% versus last year. This equates to 40% of sales, excluding precious metals, 80 basis points below prior year. The decrease was primarily the result of Sirona's lower operating expense rate and savings from the global efficiency program, partially offset by increased amortization expense and other costs related to the merger. Adjusted for these non-GAAP items, SG&A expense, as a percentage of sales, excluding precious metals, was 37.1% compared to 39% last year. The ratio was largely unaffected by FX. 
Restructuring expenses were $3.6 million, down from $38.9 million last year. In 2015, the company reorganized portions of its laboratory business and associated manufacturing capabilities within the Dental and Healthcare Consumables segments. 
In total, GAAP operating income was $121.2 million, up $35.4 million or 41.3% from last year. Excluding the non-GAAP items set forth in our non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted operating margin was 23.1%, up 190 basis points compared to 21.2% last year. Margins benefited from the positive impacts of the global efficiency program and the consolidation of Sirona. FX had a negative impact of approximately 80 basis points on the rate. 
Net interest expense for the second quarter was $8.9 million, $200,000 lower than prior year. 
Other income in the second quarter was $11.5 million, up $11.2 million from prior year. During the quarter, there were significant foreign exchange movements which provided a $13 million tailwind to other income. Approximately $9 million of this amount reflects unrealized gains on intercompany balances caused by currency movements following the Brexit vote at quarter-end. 
For the 3 months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded U.S. GAAP income tax expense of $17.9 million versus $24.8 million last year. The 2016 expense is based on a full year adjusted operational tax rate of 23%, in line with last year's rate. 
Q2 U.S. GAAP net income attributable to DENTSPLY SIRONA was $105.4 million, up 139% from the prior year. Second quarter 2016 diluted GAAP EPS was $0.44 compared to $0.31 in the prior year. Adjusted non-GAAP net income grew 74.6% to $180.9 million. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.76, up 4.1% from last year, as net income growth more than offset the impact of additional share issuance related to the merger. For a reconciliation of GAAP EPS to non-GAAP adjusted EPS, please see our earnings press release. 
Cash flow from operating activities during the quarter was $187.4 million compared to $145.6 million last year. Cash used in investing activities was $18.1 million compared to $14.4 million in the prior year. The year-over-year increases were primarily related to the consolidation with Sirona. The sum of operating and investing cash flows resulted in free cash flow of $169.3 million compared to $131.3 million last year. As you can see, we used the free cash flow in Q2 to settle repurchases of shares and to pay dividends to our shareholders. We finished the quarter with a cash balance of $311.6 million. 
Now turning to guidance. We reiterate our previous guidance. For fiscal 2016, we still expect adjusted non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.70 to $2.80. Our guidance includes the following key inputs: constant-currency sales growth to range from 4% to 6%, excluding precious metals. This includes a 1% net benefit from acquisitions, divestitures and discontinued products and internal growth in the range of 3% to 5%. At current exchange rates, this translates to reported revenues, including precious metals, of about $3.73 billion to $3.81 billion. Please keep in mind that we continue to face a challenging comp in Q3 related to last year's record international dental show and strong performance in our consumables business. At the current exchange rates, we would expect adjusted operating income margins in the range of 21% to 22%. We anticipate our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 23%. Our EPS range implies a full year share count of 220 million to 225 million fully diluted shares and FX headwinds up to $0.10. Our guidance does not include the impact of MIS or any other prospective acquisitions. 
I will now turn the call back to Jeff. Jeff?"

With our second quarter behind us, we have even more confidence that DENTSPLY SIRONA is ideally positioned to benefit from 6 megatrends in dentistry. First, positive demographics are driving the need for more dental care around the world. Wit",1099,"Thanks, Uly. With our second quarter behind us, we have even more confidence that DENTSPLY SIRONA is ideally positioned to benefit from 6 megatrends in dentistry. First, positive demographics are driving the need for more dental care around the world. With the broadest portfolio of products and the widest geographical coverage, DENTSPLY SIRONA is in an outstanding position to capitalize on this trend. We are actively driving 2 other megatrends, the adoption of digital dentistry and single-visit dentistry. It is broadly agreed in the industry that both of these will become standard of care. While everyone is trying to jump on the digital wave, just offering a product in the category isn't enough. Brand, technology and service are key differentiators. As the innovator and market leader, DENTSPLY SIRONA uniquely provides the confidence to dental professionals to go digital. We are committed to keep investing in R&D to maintain and extend our leadership position. 
Last week, we saw another good indication that these trends are accelerating. In Berlin, the German Society for Computerized Dentistry opened a digital dental academy. This establishment is the first of its kind in Europe. They chose to partner with DENTSPLY SIRONA for equipment and consumables. This organization will work with leading universities and facilities to privately train on digital workflow. 
Additionally, we see dental labs increasingly partnering up with dentists to assist them in buying our Omnicam. Digital impression is proving to not only be positive for the dentist and the patient, but for the lab as well. 
Another megatrend is the general practitioners are expanding their practice and performing more specialized procedures. To do so, they require technology as well as training and education. DENTSPLY SIRONA has the broadest clinical education platform in the industry. Each year, we train over 300,000 clinicians covering all procedures and treatment categories around the world. We have developed this capability over decades with significant investment resources. We also work with dental schools around the globe to ensure adoption of our best-in-class technology. 
In the U.S., DENTSPLY SIRONA products are in virtually all dental and dental hygiene schools. Our vision to improve oral health around the globe will be driven by the next-generation of practitioners who are learning on our products today. 
During the quarter, we announced a collaboration with NYU College of Dentistry. We are providing a fully equipped endodontic clinical suite. We will employ the most advanced educational and patient care technologies available with equipment and consumables from DENTSPLY SIRONA. This synergy came as a result of the teamwork within our organization and the innovative products we offer. 
Another megatrend is the expansion of group practices. Groups understand the value of efficiency and consistency of care. They are gaining greater appreciation of the competitive advantages associated with single-visit dentistry. Therefore, exceptional technology, training and education are critical when selecting manufacturing partners. As DENTSPLY SIRONA, we are best positioned to meet their needs. 
Last but not least, integrated workflow is another megatrend. One key rationale for our merger was the convergence of consumables and technology to address this trend. Next week, SIROWORLD event will provide thousands of dental professionals their first experience with the power of our integrated solutions. 
With our current product portfolio and commitment to innovation, DENTSPLY SIRONA is the only manufacturer with the ability to offer end-to-end solutions to dental professionals. 
As I promised earlier, let me now share with you some early integration success stories. On the cost side, we are well into the country development process. We're combining organizations in multiple countries to form country and regional teams. This will reduce costs, improve collaboration, cross-selling, leverage customer resources and relationships. We have recently kicked off a major initiative focused on creating a best-in-class support structure. We are currently establishing the appropriate baseline for general and administrative resources to support future growth. Building on our past success in procurement, we have established a global team that is focused on saving opportunities with vendors on both materials and services. 
While becoming more efficient is critical to our success, our merger will be defined by our ability to accelerate growth and drive revenue synergies. With the largest sales and service infrastructure in the industry, we are uniquely positioned to deliver on our offering. Leveraging 4,000 sales professionals and 5,000 distributors around the world, we are introducing commercial strategies to capture revenue synergies. We have established a project management structure to drive execution. 
During the quarter, communication and teamwork between DENTSPLY SIRONA equipment and consumables specialists resulted in us winning an international hospital vendor. Thanks to their teamwork, we offered a much stronger proposition to the hospital. As a result, we ended up selling double the amount of product. 
Another way in which we are driving revenue synergies is through product innovation. During the quarter, we introduced multiple solutions to the marketplace. These products will have impact for years to come. In chairside consumables, we are beginning to launch Aquasil Ultra Plus, a new, best-in-class impression material, it makes taking impressions quicker and easier. In Endo, we are rolling out our new RECIPROC Root,  next-generation endodontic file to do root canals faster and safer. In ortho, we launched our new Omni Plus and BioForce Plus brackets and wires. We are in the very early stages of transforming this business. These new products, along with others, will help us grow and gain market share. 
One of the unique opportunities for DENTSPLY SIRONA is the collaboration and development of new, fully integrated solutions. As you know, earlier this year, we launched our zirconia package with both equipment and consumables. CEREC Zirconia package is driving robust demand for both equipment and consumables. We continue to expand our materials offering. The ability to do zirconia chairside is opening up new customer base and creating additional interest in CEREC. The large community of zirconia users can now offer single-visit dentistry to their patients. 
Overall, I am pleased with our accomplishments to date. We are all looking forward to SIROWORLD next week. This will be our first major event as DENTSPLY SIRONA. The team is very excited to interact with dental professionals and demonstrate why DENTSPLY SIRONA is The Dental Solutions Company. 
I'd like to thank our customers for their loyal support, trust and enthusiasm for DENTSPLY SIRONA. We are pleased to recognize our distributing partners for their loyal support. I'd also like to extend a special thanks to our employees who daily show their commitment to improve the lives of dental professionals and their patients. Together, we will change dentistry for the better. 
We will now address your questions. Operator, please proceed."

Certainly, to see consumables lead the way in the U.S. showed solid growth, saw some really nice rebound from our lab business and ortho there. We would say that the market is stable, and we continue to be optimistic about it as we progress through the summer. But keep in mind that there is ebbs and flows in the summer and there can be some spottiness with that. We are excited about the demand we see for our CEREC World event next week, which seemed to pick up the attendance in June and July. So we think that, that's positive. And certainly, we're announcing a number of new products, which I think is always critical to driving growth. So can't really comment on seeing too much softness, but certainly, in parts of the business, we can understand why that could be said."

We found that there are some real opportunities on both the consumable and the technology sides through the cross-promotions and sharing of leads and across KOLs. The fact of the matter is that the world is going digital and there is a clear connection between our endo business and 3D and intraoral, which is playing out well for us also. With regard to implant, we're seeing some nice bundling opportunities with our 3D there and also on customer abutment. But I would say that we're looking to show balance throughout. What you have to keep in mind is that we've got over 100 initiatives that we're working through.

So we have higher revenues, our -- lot of our costs are fixed and do not fluctuate that much with revenues. So that gives us a bit of a lift in the second quarter every year.

Maybe we'll start with the FX impact, right? When we last spoke to you, we said that the guidance implies about a $0.10 headwind in FX. We've had, for the full year, we've had a $0.04 headwind in Q1. We've now had all-in $0.01 tailwind",477,"Yes. Thanks, Jeff. Maybe we'll start with the FX impact, right? When we last spoke to you, we said that the guidance implies about a $0.10 headwind in FX. We've had, for the full year, we've had a $0.04 headwind in Q1. We've now had all-in $0.01 tailwind in Q2, but that includes this onetime impact from the Brexit moves. What happened is that we supply out of Europe into South America, Asia, Australia, Eastern Europe, many of these countries' products. And we have receivables on our euro books in Brazilian real, in Japanese yen, in Australian dollars, South African rand, you name it. And all these currencies certainly strengthened to the euro when the Brexit vote happened. And we realized about  -- we didn't realize, we recorded about a $9 million gain on this in the company receivables. Now who knows whether these will stay or whether the exchange rates will move back. Our guidance does not give, everything else being equal, full credits to these gains. Now if I look what has happened since quarter-end, we probably lost somewhere between $0.005 to $0.01 again on these gains by currency movements. If they stay, that is a positive. Now when we give guidance, we weigh all the pros and cons very carefully. And we try to give you the best estimate and a balanced judgment of what we see. And there are upsides and downsides. And sometimes, we end up being too optimistic. Sometimes, too conservative. Maybe on the FX point, we've taken a bit of a conservative view. But on the other hand, our guidance does not include a deterioration of end markets in the second half of the year. And you've heard one of our biggest customers yesterday express more concerns. We looked at it, as Jeff mentioned, we saw the spottiness and softness in parts of the U.S. consumable markets going into the summer as well. But when we look at the big picture, the macroeconomics for North America, very strong. Job creation is good, especially white-collar jobs. So we said here, look fundamentally, we do not really see why there should be a major deterioration. So we did not include this in our guidance and in the forecast we had prepared. So if we weigh all this, we do think it is a realistic and weighted guidance that we gave you. There's a range you can apply judgment yourself, if you believe, based on the factors we explained to you, maybe where we might end up rather on the upper end or on the lower part. But we try to be transparent with this, and we apply our best judgment we can based on all the facts and circumstances we see and we know. And it was a lengthy answer, but I hope it helps you think some of the things, Jeff."

Remember, we said Rest of World would be our driver of growth this year. But as we go into the third quarter, remember that's a pretty tough comp, record IDS and CEREC 30 was strong. So we've got to keep that all in our consideration, Jeff. And I think that's my perspective of kind of pulling out some of the stuff that Uly was saying. And that's built in into our range. We'll certainly -- are we optimistic that next week's SIROWORLD will be -- sorry, Steve -- will be a very positive event for our organization? Absolutely. Do we -- but we've got to move through this summer and see how we finish up. And we've decided it's appropriate to keep the range that we have given all of those issues. But we don't see a fundamental change in our business proposition that we have. In fact, we would say that we're seeing more and more indications that being The Dental Solutions Company and being able to offer these integrated end-to-end solutions is exactly what the dental profession is looking for."

When you look at your customer base, Jeff, now that you have a premium implant brand, what do you think the percentages of doctors out there that are using a value and an implant brand simultaneously, how do you size up that opportunity?

But let me just tell you that MIS is an organization that both companies were looking at prior to the merger, actually saw a management team that would fit the culture, an innovation cycle that we thought would -- and has the ability to lead the way in the value segment. So very exciting opportunity for us, specifically to get into the value segment, which we know is growing faster than other segments in dental. And $1.5 billion market size is something that's significant when you're talking about a market that's maybe $25 billion overall in dental and the space that we play in. I think when you couple that together with the installed base of customers we have, there's a lot of room. We do see a trend that more and more dentists are having a dual-brand strategy to meeting their implant needs. And from a perspective of making a decision in this category, we thought MIS had the best brand that cut across multiple regions and countries. Most value brands are country-specific. MIS is unusual to that and is an exciting product to add to our portfolio. Chris, let me hand it over to you."

It is my pleasure to welcome you all to our second quarter conference call. Also joining us on the call today: Uly Michel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Chris Clark, our President and Chief Operating Officer, Technologies; and Derek Leckow, Vice President of Investor Relations. 
Our second quarter represented our first full quarter as DENTSPLY SIRONA. We are now at day 168 of the merger. And after seeing the progress we've made and the talent we have, I'm even more optimistic today than I was on day 1. 
Our culture remains a top priority for myself and the management team. We are already seeing the benefits of our focus on this priority. We are designating resources to ensure that our people come together as a high-performance organization. 
During the quarter, we selected culture champions and have begun to hold workshops. Our 15,000 employees are embracing our mission, vision and values, which are all aimed at accelerating growth and having a greater impact on the dental community. 
I'm also pleased with the rollout of our new DENTSPLY SIRONA brand. Across the globe, our employees are embracing being one global team. From recruiting, to trade shows, Toronto to Tokyo, our employees are welcoming the opportunity to put forward a unified brand. We are on track to hit our synergy target of $125 million by the end of our third year. We're beginning to ramp up investments in these opportunities and are confident that they will deliver strong returns. Later on, I will share some early success stories. Integration and synergy capture are high priorities, but we also remain focused on the business at hand. 
Turning to the second quarter. Constant-currency revenue growth of 3.4% was driven by internal growth of 2.4%. Rest of World led with 7.5% internal growth, showing strength in both consumables and technologies. I am particularly pleased to see the strong performance of our team in challenging geographies such as China and Brazil. Our U.S. business grew 3.8% with 1.2% internal growth driven by consumables. Our technologies business came off a strong Q1 while we continue to lead in the digital sensor category with our Schick brand. Our second quarter growth was negatively impacted by lower shipments of epidural sensors. 
In Europe, we managed to grow on top of our 9% growth in Q2 last year. We were pleased to maintain the high level of revenues in this region with consumables offsetting declines in technologies. As a reminder, our equipment business grew strong double digits in Europe last year, associated with a record IDF. 
Turning to our business segments. Dental and Healthcare Consumables delivered constant-currency growth of 3.4% and internal growth of 3.8%. Growth was broad-based across all dental and health care product categories. We are particularly proud of the rebound in our prosthetics business following last year's reorganization. They are energized to take advantage of the opportunities presented to the lab business through the merger. 
Our technology segment grew 3.3% constant-currency with 1% internal growth. As noted earlier, this follows double-digit growth in the prior year and strong growth in Q1. Regionally, growth in Rest of the World offset declines in Europe. 
Adjusted EPS of $0.76 grew 4.1%. Net income growth of 75% offset the impact of additional shares issued in the merger. During the quarter, we also delivered on our commitment to return capital to our shareholders. We bought back an additional 1.6 million shares for $100 million and paid $18 million in dividends. Our balance sheet remains strong and gives us the flexibility to pursue multiple avenues of value creation. In June, we announced the agreement to acquire MIS Implants for $375 million. MIS is a leading value implant manufacturer with a strong brand across the globe. This acquisition represents our entry into the growing $1.5 billion value implant market. MIS will play an important role in many of our dental solution strategies. 
Overall, I am pleased with what we accomplished in a very short period of time both operationally and strategically. 
I will now turn the call over to Uly, who will review our second quarter financials."

This morning, I will discuss our U.S. GAAP results as well as our non-GAAP adjusted results. As I walk through the earnings performance, I will also point out major impacts of merger accounting on our results. I",951,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will discuss our U.S. GAAP results as well as our non-GAAP adjusted results. As I walk through the earnings performance, I will also point out major impacts of merger accounting on our results. 
In the second quarter, our recorded revenue increased $324 million to $1,022,000,000, up 46.4% from last year. Adjusted sales of our combined businesses, excluding precious metals, grew 3.4% on a constant-currency basis. Internal growth was 2.4%, excluding a 1.5% favorable impact from net acquisitions and 50 basis points unfavorable impact from discontinued products. Foreign exchange movements were headwinds to revenue of approximately 70 basis points. As a reminder, these growth percentages reflect the performance of the combined business as if it had been consolidated on January 1, 2015. 
Jeff already addressed revenue growth by geography and segment. We have provided reconciliation tables for every segment and region that will help you understand how the GAAP reported revenue and internal growth come together. 
U.S. GAAP gross profit was $526.9 million, up $127.2 million or 31.8% from 2015. Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, excluding precious metal content, decreased by 680 basis points to 52.4% from 59.2% in the prior year. As you can see on the non-GAAP reconciliation tables, the gross profit margin was negatively impacted by 780 basis points, mostly due to the effects of step-up amortization and other merchant-related items. On an adjusted basis, gross profit margin was 60.2% for the quarter. The company generated benefits from its global efficiency program, which largely offset negative foreign currency impacts. 
Reported SG&A expense, which includes R&D, was $402.1 million, up $127.1 million or 46.2% versus last year. This equates to 40% of sales, excluding precious metals, 80 basis points below prior year. The decrease was primarily the result of Sirona's lower operating expense rate and savings from the global efficiency program, partially offset by increased amortization expense and other costs related to the merger. Adjusted for these non-GAAP items, SG&A expense, as a percentage of sales, excluding precious metals, was 37.1% compared to 39% last year. The ratio was largely unaffected by FX. 
Restructuring expenses were $3.6 million, down from $38.9 million last year. In 2015, the company reorganized portions of its laboratory business and associated manufacturing capabilities within the Dental and Healthcare Consumables segments. 
In total, GAAP operating income was $121.2 million, up $35.4 million or 41.3% from last year. Excluding the non-GAAP items set forth in our non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted operating margin was 23.1%, up 190 basis points compared to 21.2% last year. Margins benefited from the positive impacts of the global efficiency program and the consolidation of Sirona. FX had a negative impact of approximately 80 basis points on the rate. 
Net interest expense for the second quarter was $8.9 million, $200,000 lower than prior year. 
Other income in the second quarter was $11.5 million, up $11.2 million from prior year. During the quarter, there were significant foreign exchange movements which provided a $13 million tailwind to other income. Approximately $9 million of this amount reflects unrealized gains on intercompany balances caused by currency movements following the Brexit vote at quarter-end. 
For the 3 months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded U.S. GAAP income tax expense of $17.9 million versus $24.8 million last year. The 2016 expense is based on a full year adjusted operational tax rate of 23%, in line with last year's rate. 
Q2 U.S. GAAP net income attributable to DENTSPLY SIRONA was $105.4 million, up 139% from the prior year. Second quarter 2016 diluted GAAP EPS was $0.44 compared to $0.31 in the prior year. Adjusted non-GAAP net income grew 74.6% to $180.9 million. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.76, up 4.1% from last year, as net income growth more than offset the impact of additional share issuance related to the merger. For a reconciliation of GAAP EPS to non-GAAP adjusted EPS, please see our earnings press release. 
Cash flow from operating activities during the quarter was $187.4 million compared to $145.6 million last year. Cash used in investing activities was $18.1 million compared to $14.4 million in the prior year. The year-over-year increases were primarily related to the consolidation with Sirona. The sum of operating and investing cash flows resulted in free cash flow of $169.3 million compared to $131.3 million last year. As you can see, we used the free cash flow in Q2 to settle repurchases of shares and to pay dividends to our shareholders. We finished the quarter with a cash balance of $311.6 million. 
Now turning to guidance. We reiterate our previous guidance. For fiscal 2016, we still expect adjusted non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.70 to $2.80. Our guidance includes the following key inputs: constant-currency sales growth to range from 4% to 6%, excluding precious metals. This includes a 1% net benefit from acquisitions, divestitures and discontinued products and internal growth in the range of 3% to 5%. At current exchange rates, this translates to reported revenues, including precious metals, of about $3.73 billion to $3.81 billion. Please keep in mind that we continue to face a challenging comp in Q3 related to last year's record international dental show and strong performance in our consumables business. At the current exchange rates, we would expect adjusted operating income margins in the range of 21% to 22%. We anticipate our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 23%. Our EPS range implies a full year share count of 220 million to 225 million fully diluted shares and FX headwinds up to $0.10. Our guidance does not include the impact of MIS or any other prospective acquisitions. 
I will now turn the call back to Jeff. Jeff?"
27504,377271651,1027987,"DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2016",2016-08-05,"Earnings Calls","DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Uly. With our second quarter behind us, we have even more confidence that DENTSPLY SIRONA is ideally positioned to benefit from 6 megatrends in dentistry. First, positive demographics are driving the need for more dental care around the world. Wit",1099,"Thanks, Uly. With our second quarter behind us, we have even more confidence that DENTSPLY SIRONA is ideally positioned to benefit from 6 megatrends in dentistry. First, positive demographics are driving the need for more dental care around the world. With the broadest portfolio of products and the widest geographical coverage, DENTSPLY SIRONA is in an outstanding position to capitalize on this trend. We are actively driving 2 other megatrends, the adoption of digital dentistry and single-visit dentistry. It is broadly agreed in the industry that both of these will become standard of care. While everyone is trying to jump on the digital wave, just offering a product in the category isn't enough. Brand, technology and service are key differentiators. As the innovator and market leader, DENTSPLY SIRONA uniquely provides the confidence to dental professionals to go digital. We are committed to keep investing in R&D to maintain and extend our leadership position. 
Last week, we saw another good indication that these trends are accelerating. In Berlin, the German Society for Computerized Dentistry opened a digital dental academy. This establishment is the first of its kind in Europe. They chose to partner with DENTSPLY SIRONA for equipment and consumables. This organization will work with leading universities and facilities to privately train on digital workflow. 
Additionally, we see dental labs increasingly partnering up with dentists to assist them in buying our Omnicam. Digital impression is proving to not only be positive for the dentist and the patient, but for the lab as well. 
Another megatrend is the general practitioners are expanding their practice and performing more specialized procedures. To do so, they require technology as well as training and education. DENTSPLY SIRONA has the broadest clinical education platform in the industry. Each year, we train over 300,000 clinicians covering all procedures and treatment categories around the world. We have developed this capability over decades with significant investment resources. We also work with dental schools around the globe to ensure adoption of our best-in-class technology. 
In the U.S., DENTSPLY SIRONA products are in virtually all dental and dental hygiene schools. Our vision to improve oral health around the globe will be driven by the next-generation of practitioners who are learning on our products today. 
During the quarter, we announced a collaboration with NYU College of Dentistry. We are providing a fully equipped endodontic clinical suite. We will employ the most advanced educational and patient care technologies available with equipment and consumables from DENTSPLY SIRONA. This synergy came as a result of the teamwork within our organization and the innovative products we offer. 
Another megatrend is the expansion of group practices. Groups understand the value of efficiency and consistency of care. They are gaining greater appreciation of the competitive advantages associated with single-visit dentistry. Therefore, exceptional technology, training and education are critical when selecting manufacturing partners. As DENTSPLY SIRONA, we are best positioned to meet their needs. 
Last but not least, integrated workflow is another megatrend. One key rationale for our merger was the convergence of consumables and technology to address this trend. Next week, SIROWORLD event will provide thousands of dental professionals their first experience with the power of our integrated solutions. 
With our current product portfolio and commitment to innovation, DENTSPLY SIRONA is the only manufacturer with the ability to offer end-to-end solutions to dental professionals. 
As I promised earlier, let me now share with you some early integration success stories. On the cost side, we are well into the country development process. We're combining organizations in multiple countries to form country and regional teams. This will reduce costs, improve collaboration, cross-selling, leverage customer resources and relationships. We have recently kicked off a major initiative focused on creating a best-in-class support structure. We are currently establishing the appropriate baseline for general and administrative resources to support future growth. Building on our past success in procurement, we have established a global team that is focused on saving opportunities with vendors on both materials and services. 
While becoming more efficient is critical to our success, our merger will be defined by our ability to accelerate growth and drive revenue synergies. With the largest sales and service infrastructure in the industry, we are uniquely positioned to deliver on our offering. Leveraging 4,000 sales professionals and 5,000 distributors around the world, we are introducing commercial strategies to capture revenue synergies. We have established a project management structure to drive execution. 
During the quarter, communication and teamwork between DENTSPLY SIRONA equipment and consumables specialists resulted in us winning an international hospital vendor. Thanks to their teamwork, we offered a much stronger proposition to the hospital. As a result, we ended up selling double the amount of product. 
Another way in which we are driving revenue synergies is through product innovation. During the quarter, we introduced multiple solutions to the marketplace. These products will have impact for years to come. In chairside consumables, we are beginning to launch Aquasil Ultra Plus, a new, best-in-class impression material, it makes taking impressions quicker and easier. In Endo, we are rolling out our new RECIPROC Root,  next-generation endodontic file to do root canals faster and safer. In ortho, we launched our new Omni Plus and BioForce Plus brackets and wires. We are in the very early stages of transforming this business. These new products, along with others, will help us grow and gain market share. 
One of the unique opportunities for DENTSPLY SIRONA is the collaboration and development of new, fully integrated solutions. As you know, earlier this year, we launched our zirconia package with both equipment and consumables. CEREC Zirconia package is driving robust demand for both equipment and consumables. We continue to expand our materials offering. The ability to do zirconia chairside is opening up new customer base and creating additional interest in CEREC. The large community of zirconia users can now offer single-visit dentistry to their patients. 
Overall, I am pleased with our accomplishments to date. We are all looking forward to SIROWORLD next week. This will be our first major event as DENTSPLY SIRONA. The team is very excited to interact with dental professionals and demonstrate why DENTSPLY SIRONA is The Dental Solutions Company. 
I'd like to thank our customers for their loyal support, trust and enthusiasm for DENTSPLY SIRONA. We are pleased to recognize our distributing partners for their loyal support. I'd also like to extend a special thanks to our employees who daily show their commitment to improve the lives of dental professionals and their patients. Together, we will change dentistry for the better. 
We will now address your questions. Operator, please proceed."

We would say that the market is stable, and we continue to be optimistic about it as we progress through the summer. But keep in mind that there is ebbs and flows in the summer and there can be some spottiness with that. We are excited about the demand we see for our CEREC World event next week, which seemed to pick up the attendance in June and July. So we think that, that's positive. And certainly, we're announcing a number of new products, which I think is always critical to driving growth. So can't really comment on seeing too much softness, but certainly, in parts of the business, we can understand why that could be said."

The fact of the matter is that the world is going digital and there is a clear connection between our endo business and 3D and intraoral, which is playing out well for us also. With regard to implant, we're seeing some nice bundling opportunities with our 3D there and also on customer abutment. But I would say that we're looking to show balance throughout.

What I would tell you is that Europe did well for us in general from a perspective that Germany was a drag, right? We could not expect with the extraordinary year we had last year, which was truly a record that we could grow on that. But I wouldn't say we lost any market share there. And as I look, if you take Germany out of Northern Europe, it was rather solid for us. And certainly, as we look at Southern Europe, very solid and feel good about with what we saw.

Maybe we'll start with the FX impact, right? When we last spoke to you, we said that the guidance implies about a $0.10 headwind in FX. We've had, for the full year, we've had a $0.04 headwind in Q1. We've now had all-in $0.01 tailwind",477,"Yes. Thanks, Jeff. Maybe we'll start with the FX impact, right? When we last spoke to you, we said that the guidance implies about a $0.10 headwind in FX. We've had, for the full year, we've had a $0.04 headwind in Q1. We've now had all-in $0.01 tailwind in Q2, but that includes this onetime impact from the Brexit moves. What happened is that we supply out of Europe into South America, Asia, Australia, Eastern Europe, many of these countries' products. And we have receivables on our euro books in Brazilian real, in Japanese yen, in Australian dollars, South African rand, you name it. And all these currencies certainly strengthened to the euro when the Brexit vote happened. And we realized about  -- we didn't realize, we recorded about a $9 million gain on this in the company receivables. Now who knows whether these will stay or whether the exchange rates will move back. Our guidance does not give, everything else being equal, full credits to these gains. Now if I look what has happened since quarter-end, we probably lost somewhere between $0.005 to $0.01 again on these gains by currency movements. If they stay, that is a positive. Now when we give guidance, we weigh all the pros and cons very carefully. And we try to give you the best estimate and a balanced judgment of what we see. And there are upsides and downsides. And sometimes, we end up being too optimistic. Sometimes, too conservative. Maybe on the FX point, we've taken a bit of a conservative view. But on the other hand, our guidance does not include a deterioration of end markets in the second half of the year. And you've heard one of our biggest customers yesterday express more concerns. We looked at it, as Jeff mentioned, we saw the spottiness and softness in parts of the U.S. consumable markets going into the summer as well. But when we look at the big picture, the macroeconomics for North America, very strong. Job creation is good, especially white-collar jobs. So we said here, look fundamentally, we do not really see why there should be a major deterioration. So we did not include this in our guidance and in the forecast we had prepared. So if we weigh all this, we do think it is a realistic and weighted guidance that we gave you. There's a range you can apply judgment yourself, if you believe, based on the factors we explained to you, maybe where we might end up rather on the upper end or on the lower part. But we try to be transparent with this, and we apply our best judgment we can based on all the facts and circumstances we see and we know. And it was a lengthy answer, but I hope it helps you think some of the things, Jeff."

While we're pleased about what we're able to do in Brazil and China, those markets are challenged. Middle East continues to have some difficulties. So we have to put that in the overall perspective. We heard from Schein yesterday what they're viewing. We can't discount it, although we don't see it, but we see it in a little bit spotty way. And then we talk about the bigger issues, which is the macro trends and the megatrends, which we talked about earlier in the call, which are all working our way, and plus the ability for our team to come together, which I think is very positive, what I'm seeing. And you can't emphasize enough how good it is to recognize some of our businesses that have taken a little bit of time to get back, like lab and ortho starting to progress. Remember, we said Rest of World would be our driver of growth this year. But as we go into the third quarter, remember that's a pretty tough comp, record IDS and CEREC 30 was strong. So we've got to keep that all in our consideration, Jeff. And I think that's my perspective of kind of pulling out some of the stuff that Uly was saying. And that's built in into our range. We'll certainly -- are we optimistic that next week's SIROWORLD will be -- sorry, Steve -- will be a very positive event for our organization? Absolutely.

And $1.5 billion market size is something that's significant when you're talking about a market that's maybe $25 billion overall in dental and the space that we play in. I think when you couple that together with the installed base of customers we have, there's a lot of room. We do see a trend that more and more dentists are having a dual-brand strategy to meeting their implant needs. And from a perspective of making a decision in this category, we thought MIS had the best brand that cut across multiple regions and countries. Most value brands are country-specific.

It is my pleasure to welcome you all to our second quarter conference call. Also joining us on the call today: Uly Michel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Chris Clark, our President and Chief Operating Officer, Technologies; and Derek Leckow, Vice President of Investor Relations. 
Our second quarter represented our first full quarter as DENTSPLY SIRONA. We are now at day 168 of the merger. And after seeing the progress we've made and the talent we have, I'm even more optimistic today than I was on day 1. 
Our culture remains a top priority for myself and the management team. We are already seeing the benefits of our focus on this priority. We are designating resources to ensure that our people come together as a high-performance organization. 
During the quarter, we selected culture champions and have begun to hold workshops. Our 15,000 employees are embracing our mission, vision and values which are all aimed at accelerating growth and having a greater impact on the dental community. 
I am also pleased with the rollout of our new DENTSPLY SIRONA brand. Across the globe, our employees are embracing being one global team. From recruiting, to trade shows, Toronto to Tokyo, our employees are welcoming the opportunity to put forward a unified brand. We are on track to hit our synergy target of $125 million by the end of our third year. We're beginning to ramp up investments in these opportunities and are confident that they will deliver strong returns. Later on, I will share some early success stories. Integration and synergy capture are high priorities but we also remain focused on the business at hand. 
Turning to the second quarter. Constant-currency revenue growth of 3.4% was driven by internal growth of 2.4%. Rest of World led with 7.5% internal growth, showing strength in both the consumables and technologies. I am particularly pleased to see the strong performance of our team in challenging geographies such as China and Brazil. Our U.S. business grew 3.8% with 1.2% internal growth driven by consumables. Our technologies business came off a strong Q1 while we continue to lead in the digital sensor category with our Schick brand. Our second quarter growth was negatively impacted by lower shipments of intraoral sensors. 
In Europe, we managed to grow on top of our 9% growth in Q2 last year. We were pleased to maintain the high level of revenues in this region with consumables offsetting declines in technologies. As a reminder, our equipment business grew strong double digits in Europe last year associated with a record IDF. 
Turning to our business segments. Dental and Healthcare Consumables delivered constant-currency growth of 3.4% and internal growth of 3.8%. Growth was broad-based across all dental and health care product categories. We are particularly proud of the rebound in our prosthetics business following last year's reorganization. They are energized to take advantage of the opportunities presented to the lab business through the merger. 
Our technology segment grew 3.3% constant-currency with 1% internal growth. As noted earlier, this follows double-digit growth in the prior year and strong growth in Q1. Regionally, growth in Rest of the World offset declines in Europe. 
Adjusted EPS of $0.76 grew 4.1%. Net income growth of 75% offset the impact of additional shares issued in the merger. During the quarter, we also delivered on our commitment to return capital to our shareholders. We bought back an additional 1.6 million shares for $100 million and paid $18 million in dividends. Our balance sheet remains strong and gives us the flexibility to pursue multiple avenues of value creation. In June, we announced the agreement to acquire MIS Implants for $375 million. MIS is a leading value implant manufacturer with a strong brand across the globe. This acquisition represents our entry into the growing $1.5 billion value implant market. MIS will play an important role in many of our dental solution strategies. 
Overall, I am pleased with what we accomplished in a very short period of time both operationally and strategically. 
I will now turn the call over to Uly, who will review our second quarter financials."

This morning, I will discuss our U.S. GAAP results as well as our non-GAAP adjusted results. As I walk through the earnings performance, I will also point out major impacts of merger accounting on our results. 
In the second quarter, our recorded revenue increased $324 million to $1,022,000,000, up 46.4% from last year. Adjusted sales of our combined businesses, excluding precious metals, grew 3.4% on a constant-currency basis. Internal growth was 2.4%, excluding a 1.5% favorable impact from net acquisitions and 50 basis points unfavorable impact from discontinued products. Foreign exchange movements were headwinds to revenue of approximately 70 basis points. As a reminder, these growth percentages reflect the performance of the combined business as if it had been consolidated on January 1, 2015. 
Jeff already addressed revenue growth by geography and segment. We have provided reconciliation tables for every segment and region that will help you understand how the GAAP reported revenue and internal growth come together. 
U.S. GAAP gross profit was $526.9 million, up $127.2 million or 31.8% from 2015. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, excluding precious metal content, decreased by 680 basis points to 52.4% from 59.2% in the prior year. As you can see on the non-GAAP reconciliation tables, the gross profit margin was negatively impacted by 780 basis points mostly due to the effects of step-up amortization and other merchant-related items. On an adjusted basis, gross profit margin was 60.2% for the quarter. The company generated benefits from its global efficiency program which largely offset negative foreign currency impacts. 
Reported SG&A expense, which includes R&D, was $402.1 million, up $127.1 million or 46.2% versus last year. This equates to 40% of sales excluding precious metals, 80 basis points below prior year. The decrease was primarily the result of Sirona's lower operating expense rate and savings from the global efficiency program, partially offset by increased amortization expense and other costs related to the merger. Adjusted for these non-GAAP items, SG&A expense as a percentage of sales, excluding precious metals, was 37.1% compared to 39% last year. The ratio was largely unaffected by FX. 
Restructuring expenses were $3.6 million, down from $38.9 million last year. In 2015, the company reorganized portions of its laboratory business and associated manufacturing capabilities within the Dental and Healthcare Consumables segments. 
In total, GAAP operating income was $121.2 million, up $35.4 million or 41.3% from last year. Excluding the non-GAAP items set forth in our non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted operating margin was 23.1%, up 190 basis points compared to 21.2% last year. Margins benefited from the positive impacts of the global efficiency program and the consolidation of Sirona. FX had a negative impact of approximately 80 basis points on the rate. 
Net interest expense for the second quarter was $8.9 million, $200,000 lower than prior year. 
Other income in the second quarter was $11.5 million, up $11.2 million from prior year. During the quarter, there were significant foreign exchange movements which provided a $13 million tailwind to other income. Approximately $9 million of this amount reflects unrealized gains on intercompany balances caused by currency movements following the Brexit vote at quarter end. 
For the 3 months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded U.S. GAAP income tax expense of $17.9 million versus $24.8 million last year. The 2016 expense is based on a full year adjusted operational tax rate of 23%, in line with last year's rate. 
Q2 U.S. GAAP net income attributable to DENTSPLY SIRONA was $105.4 million, up 139% from the prior year. Second quarter 2016 diluted GAAP EPS was $0.44 compared to $0.31 in the prior year. Adjusted non-GAAP net income grew 74.6% to $180.9 million. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.76, up 4.1% from last year, as net income growth more than offset the impact of additional share issuance related to the merger. For a reconciliation of GAAP EPS to non-GAAP adjusted EPS, please see our earnings press release. 
Cash flow from operating activities during the quarter was $187.4 million compared to $145.6 million last year. Cash used in investing activities was $18.1 million compared to $14.4 million in the prior year. The year-over-year increases were primarily related to the consolidation with Sirona. The sum of operating and investing cash flows resulted in free cash flow of $169.3 million compared to $131.3 million last year. As you can see, we used the free cash flow in Q2 to settle repurchases of shares and to pay dividends to our shareholders. We finished the quarter with a cash balance of $311.6 million. 
Now turning to guidance. We reiterate our previous guidance. For fiscal 2016, we still expect adjusted non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.70 to $2.80. Our guidance includes the following key inputs: constant-currency sales growth to range from 4% to 6%, excluding precious metals. This includes a 1% net benefit from acquisitions, divestitures and discontinued products and internal growth in the range of 3% to 5%. At current exchange rates, this translates to reported revenues including precious metals, of about $3.73 billion to $3.81 billion. Please keep in mind that we continue to face a challenging comp in Q3 related to last year's record international Dental Show and strong performance in our consumables business. At the current exchange rates, we would expect adjusted operating income margins in the range of 21% to 22%. We anticipate our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 23%. Our EPS range implies a full year share count of 220 million to 225 million fully diluted shares and FX headwinds up to $0.10. Our guidance does not include the impact of MIS or any other prospective acquisitions. 
I will now turn the call back to Jeff. Jeff?"
27504,377271651,1028230,"DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2016",2016-08-05,"Earnings Calls","DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Uly. With our second quarter behind us, we have even more confidence that DENTSPLY SIRONA is ideally positioned to benefit from 6 megatrends in dentistry. First, positive demographics are driving the need for more dental care around the world. Wit",1100,"Thanks, Uly. With our second quarter behind us, we have even more confidence that DENTSPLY SIRONA is ideally positioned to benefit from 6 megatrends in dentistry. First, positive demographics are driving the need for more dental care around the world. With the broadest portfolio of products and the widest geographical coverage, DENTSPLY SIRONA is in an outstanding position to capitalize on this trend. We are actively driving 2 other megatrends, the adoption of digital dentistry and single-visit dentistry. It is broadly agreed in the industry that both of these will become standard of care. While everyone is trying to jump on the digital wave, just offering a product in the category isn't enough. Brand, technology and service are key differentiators. As the innovator and market leader, DENTSPLY SIRONA uniquely provides the confidence to dental professionals to go digital. We are committed to keep investing in R&D to maintain and extend our leadership position. 
Last week, we saw another good indication that these trends are accelerating. In Berlin, the German Society for Computerized Dentistry opened a digital dental academy. This establishment is the first of its kind in Europe. They chose to partner with DENTSPLY SIRONA for equipment and consumables. This organization will work with leading universities and facilities to privately train on digital workflow. 
Additionally, we see dental labs increasingly partnering up with dentists to assist them in buying our Omnicam. Digital impression is proving to not only be positive for the dentist and the patient, but for the lab as well. 
Another megatrend is the general practitioners are expanding their practice and performing more specialized procedures. To do so, they require technology as well as training and education. DENTSPLY SIRONA has the broadest clinical education platform in the industry. Each year, we train over 300,000 clinicians covering all procedures and treatment categories around the world. We have developed this capability over decades with significant investment resources. We also work with dental schools around the globe to ensure adoption of our best-in-class technology. 
In the U.S., DENTSPLY SIRONA products are in virtually all dental and dental hygiene schools. Our vision to improve oral health around the globe will be driven by the next generation of practitioners who are learning on our products today. 
During the quarter, we announced a collaboration with NYU College of Dentistry. We are providing a fully equipped endodontic clinical suite. We will employ the most advanced educational and patient care technologies available with equipment and consumables from DENTSPLY SIRONA. This synergy came as a result of the teamwork within our organization and the innovative products we offer. 
Another megatrend is the expansion of group practices. Groups understand the value of efficiency and consistency of care. They are gaining greater appreciation of the competitive advantages associated with single-visit dentistry. Therefore, exceptional technology, training and education are critical when selecting manufacturing partners. As DENTSPLY SIRONA, we are best positioned to meet their needs. 
Last but not least, integrated workflow is another megatrend. One key rationale for our merger was the convergence of consumables and technology to address this trend. Next week, SIROWORLD event will provide thousands of dental professionals their first experience with the power of our integrated solutions. 
With our current product portfolio and commitment to innovation, DENTSPLY SIRONA is the only manufacturer with the ability to offer end-to-end solutions to dental professionals. 
As I promised earlier, let me now share with you some early integration success stories. On the cost side, we are well into the country development process. We're combining organizations in multiple countries to form country and regional teams. This will reduce costs, improve collaboration, cross-selling, leverage customer resources and relationships. We have recently kicked off a major initiative focused on creating a best-in-class support structure. We are currently establishing the appropriate baseline for general and administrative resources to support future growth. Building on our past success in procurement, we have established a global team that is focused on saving opportunities with vendors on both materials and services. 
While becoming more efficient is critical to our success, our merger will be defined by our ability to accelerate growth and drive revenue synergies. With the largest sales and service infrastructure in the industry, we are uniquely positioned to deliver on our offering. Leveraging 4,000 sales professionals and 5,000 distributors around the world, we are introducing commercial strategies to capture revenue synergies. We have established a project management structure to drive execution. 
During the quarter, communication and teamwork between DENTSPLY SIRONA equipment and consumables specialists resulted in us winning an international hospital vendor. Thanks to their teamwork, we offered a much stronger proposition to the hospital. As a result, we ended up selling double the amount of product. 
Another way in which we are driving revenue synergies is through product innovation. During the quarter, we introduced multiple solutions to the marketplace. These products will have impact for years to come. In chairside consumables, we are beginning to launch Aquasil Ultra Plus, a new, best-in-class impression material, it makes taking impressions quicker and easier. In Endo, we are rolling out our new RECIPROC glue,  next-generation endodontic file to do root canals faster and safer. In ortho, we launched our new Omni Plus and BioForce Plus brackets and wires. We are in the very early stages of transforming this business. These new products, along with others, will help us grow and gain market share. 
One of the unique opportunities for DENTSPLY SIRONA is the collaboration and development of new, fully integrated solutions. As you know, earlier this year, we launched our zirconia package with both equipment and consumables. CEREC Zirconia package is driving robust demand for both equipment and consumable. We continue to expand our materials offering. The ability to do zirconia chairside is opening up new customer base and creating additional interest in CEREC. The large community of zirconia users can now offer single-visit dentistry to their patients. 
Overall, I am pleased with our accomplishments to date. We are all looking forward to SIROWORLD next week. This will be our first major event as DENTSPLY SIRONA. The team is very excited to interact with dental professionals and demonstrate why DENTSPLY SIRONA is The Dental Solutions Company. 
I'd like to thank our customers for their loyal support, trust and enthusiasm for DENTSPLY SIRONA. We are pleased to recognize our distributing partners for their loyal support. I'd also like to extend a special thanks to our employees who, daily, show their commitment to improve the lives of dental professionals and their patients.

I have to tell you I'm pleased with the growth in our quarter in both of our segments. Certainly, to see consumables lead the way in the U.S. showed solid growth, we saw some really nice rebound from our lab business and ortho there. We would say that the market is stable and we continue to be optimistic about it as we progress through the summer. But keep in mind that there is ebbs and flows in the summer and there can be some spottiness with that. We are excited about the demand we see for our CEREC World event next week which seemed to pick up the attendance in June and July. So we think that, that's positive. And certainly, we're announcing a number of new products which I think is always critical to driving growth. So can't really comment on seeing too much softness but, certainly, in parts of the business, we can understand why that could be said."

So we will invest a bit more in the second half of the year. Then if you look at the seasonality of our business, Q2 is traditionally probably the highest quarter in the year. So we have higher revenues, lot of our costs are fixed and do not fluctuate that much with revenues. So that gives us a bit of a lift in the second quarter every year. You will see a bit of a downturn in the third quarter from this. And in the balance of these 2 factors, we guided to the EPS number we did, and we based it on margins that should be somewhere between 21% and 22% for the full year."

We've now had a all-in $0.01 tailwin",479,"Yes. Thanks, Jeff. Maybe we'll start with the FX impact, right? When we last spoke to you, we said that the guidance implies about a $0.10 headwind in FX. We've had, for the full year, we've had a $0.04 headwind in Q1. We've now had a all-in $0.01 tailwind in Q2, but that includes this onetime impact from the Brexit moves. What happened is that we supply out of Europe into South America, Asia, Australia, Eastern Europe, many of these countries' products. And we have receivables on our euro books in Brazilian real, in Japanese yen, in Australian dollars, South African rand, you name it. And all these currencies certainly strengthened to the euro when the Brexit vote happened. And we realized about  -- we didn't realize, we recorded about a $9 million gain on this in the company receivables. Now who knows whether these will stay or whether the exchange rates will move back. Our guidance does not give, everything else being equal, full credits to these gains. 
Now if I look what has happened since quarter end, we probably lost somewhere between $0.005 to $0.01 again on these gains by currency movements. If they stay, that is a positive. Now when we give guidance, we weigh all the pros and cons very carefully. And we try to give you the best estimate and a balanced judgment of what we see. And there is upsides and downsides. And sometimes, we end up being too optimistic. Sometimes, too conservative. Maybe on the FX point, we've taken a bit of a conservative view. But on the other hand, our guidance does not include a deterioration of end markets in the second half of the year. 
And you've heard one of our biggest customers yesterday express more concerns. We looked at it, as Jeff mentioned, we saw the spottiness and softness in parts of the U.S. consumable markets going into the summer as well. But when we look at the big picture, the macroeconomics for North America, very strong. Job creation is good, especially white-collar jobs. So we said here, look fundamentally, we do not really see why there should be a major deterioration. So we did not include this in our guidance and in the forecast we had prepared. So if we weigh all this, we do think it is a realistic and weighted guidance that we gave you. There's a range, you can apply judgment yourself, if you believe, based on the factors we explained to you, maybe where we might end up rather on the upper end or on the lower part. But we try to be transparent with this, and we apply our best judgment we can based on all the facts and circumstances we see and we know. And it was a lengthy answer, but I hope it helps you think some of the things, Jeff."

While we're pleased about what we're able to do in Brazil and China, those markets are challenged. The Middle East continues to have some difficulties. So we have to put that in the overall perspective. We heard from Schein yesterday what they're viewing. We can't discount it, although we don't see it, but we see it in a little bit spotty way. And then we talk about the bigger issues which is the macro trends and the megatrends, which we talked about earlier in the call, which are all working our way, and plus the ability for our team to come together, which I think is very positive, what I'm seeing. And you can't emphasize enough how good it is to recognize some of our businesses that have taken a little bit of time to get back, like lab and ortho starting to progress. 
Remember, we said Rest of World would be our driver of growth this year. But as we go into the third quarter, remember that's a pretty tough comp, record IDS and CEREC 30 was strong. So we've got to keep that all in our consideration, Jeff. And I think that's my perspective of kind of pulling out some of the stuff that Uly was saying. And that's built in into our range. We'll certainly -- are we optimistic that next week's SIROWORLD will be -- sorry, Steve -- will be a very positive event for our organization? Absolutely. Do we -- but we've got to move through this summer and see how we finish up. And we've decided it's appropriate to keep the range that we have given all of those issues.

And $1.5 billion market size is something that's significant when you're talking about a market that's maybe $25 billion overall in dental and the space that we play in. I think when you couple that together with the installed base of customers we have, there's a lot of room. 
We do see a trend that more and more dentists are having a dual-brand strategy to meeting their implant needs. And from a perspective of making a decision in this category, we thought MIS had the best brand that cut across multiple regions and countries. Most value brands are country-specific. MIS is unusual to that and is an exciting product to add to our portfolio. Chris, let me hand it over to you."

But I would say that the MIS was a really important acquisition for us because we believed with -- in the value proposition that we have and the geographic reach. And when we take a look at our customers, this is an area that we just didn't play in. And as both Chris and I have said, to not play in a $1.5 billion market that has a faster-growing profile than most of the others is just something that we felt was inappropriate for our organization and felt that we needed to do it.

It is my pleasure to welcome you all to our second quarter conference call. Also joining us on the call today: Uly Michel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Chris Clark, our President and Chief Operating Officer, Technologies; and Derek Leckow, Vice President of Investor Relations. 
Our second quarter represented our first full quarter as DENTSPLY SIRONA. We are now at day 168 of the merger. And after seeing the progress we've made and the talent we have, I'm even more optimistic today than I was on day 1. 
Our culture remains a top priority for myself and the management team. We are already seeing the benefits of our focus on this priority. We are designating resources to ensure that our people come together as a high-performance organization. 
During the quarter, we selected culture champions and have begun to hold workshops. Our 15,000 employees are embracing our mission, vision and values which are all aimed at accelerating growth and having a greater impact on the dental community. 
I am also pleased with the rollout of our new DENTSPLY SIRONA brand. Across the globe, our employees are embracing being one global team. From recruiting, to trade shows, Toronto to Tokyo, our employees are welcoming the opportunity to put forward a unified brand. We are on track to hit our synergy target of $125 million by the end of our third year. We're beginning to ramp up investments in these opportunities and are confident that they will deliver strong returns. Later on, I will share some early success stories. Integration and synergy capture are high priorities but we also remain focused on the business at hand. 
Turning to the second quarter. Constant-currency revenue growth of 3.4% was driven by internal growth of 2.4%. Rest of World led with 7.5% internal growth, showing strength in both the consumables and technologies. I am particularly pleased to see the strong performance of our team in challenging geographies such as China and Brazil. Our U.S. business grew 3.8% with 1.2% internal growth driven by consumables. Our technologies business came off a strong Q1 while we continue to lead in the digital sensor category with our Schick brand. Our second quarter growth was negatively impacted by lower shipments of intraoral sensors. 
In Europe, we managed to grow on top of our 9% growth in Q2 last year. We were pleased to maintain the high level of revenues in this region with consumables offsetting declines in technologies. As a reminder, our equipment business grew strong double digits in Europe last year associated with a record IDF. 
Turning to our business segments. Dental and Healthcare Consumables delivered constant-currency growth of 3.4% and internal growth of 3.8%. Growth was broad-based across all dental and health care product categories. We are particularly proud of the rebound in our prosthetics business following last year's reorganization. They are energized to take advantage of the opportunities presented to the lab business through the merger. 
Our technology segment grew 3.3% constant-currency with 1% internal growth. As noted earlier, this follows double-digit growth in the prior year and strong growth in Q1. Regionally, growth in Rest of the World offset declines in Europe. 
Adjusted EPS of $0.76 grew 4.1%. Net income growth of 75% offset the impact of additional shares issued in the merger. During the quarter, we also delivered on our commitment to return capital to our shareholders. We bought back an additional 1.6 million shares for $100 million and paid $18 million in dividends. Our balance sheet remains strong and gives us the flexibility to pursue multiple avenues of value creation. In June, we announced the agreement to acquire MIS Implants for $375 million. MIS is a leading value implant manufacturer with a strong brand across the globe. This acquisition represents our entry into the growing $1.5 billion value implant market. MIS will play an important role in many of our dental solution strategies. 
Overall, I am pleased with what we accomplished in a very short period of time both operationally and strategically. 
I will now turn the call over to Uly, who will review our second quarter financials."

This morning, I will discuss our U.S. GAAP results as well as our non-GAAP adjusted results. As I walk through the earnings performance, I will also point out major impacts of merger accounting on our results. 
In the second quarter, our recorded revenue increased $324 million to $1,022,000,000, up 46.4% from last year. Adjusted sales of our combined businesses, excluding precious metals, grew 3.4% on a constant-currency basis. Internal growth was 2.4%, excluding a 1.5% favorable impact from net acquisitions and 50 basis points unfavorable impact from discontinued products. Foreign exchange movements were headwinds to revenue of approximately 70 basis points. As a reminder, these growth percentages reflect the performance of the combined business as if it had been consolidated on January 1, 2015. 
Jeff already addressed revenue growth by geography and segment. We have provided reconciliation tables for every segment and region that will help you understand how the GAAP reported revenue and internal growth come together. 
U.S. GAAP gross profit was $526.9 million, up $127.2 million or 31.8% from 2015. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, excluding precious metal content, decreased by 680 basis points to 52.4% from 59.2% in the prior year. As you can see on the non-GAAP reconciliation tables, the gross profit margin was negatively impacted by 780 basis points mostly due to the effects of step-up amortization and other merchant-related items. On an adjusted basis, gross profit margin was 60.2% for the quarter. The company generated benefits from its global efficiency program which largely offset negative foreign currency impacts. 
Reported SG&A expense, which includes R&D, was $402.1 million, up $127.1 million or 46.2% versus last year. This equates to 40% of sales excluding precious metals, 80 basis points below prior year. The decrease was primarily the result of Sirona's lower operating expense rate and savings from the global efficiency program, partially offset by increased amortization expense and other costs related to the merger. Adjusted for these non-GAAP items, SG&A expense as a percentage of sales, excluding precious metals, was 37.1% compared to 39% last year. The ratio was largely unaffected by FX. 
Restructuring expenses were $3.6 million, down from $38.9 million last year. In 2015, the company reorganized portions of its laboratory business and associated manufacturing capabilities within the Dental and Healthcare Consumables segments. 
In total, GAAP operating income was $121.2 million, up $35.4 million or 41.3% from last year. Excluding the non-GAAP items set forth in our non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted operating margin was 23.1%, up 190 basis points compared to 21.2% last year. Margins benefited from the positive impacts of the global efficiency program and the consolidation of Sirona. FX had a negative impact of approximately 80 basis points on the rate. 
Net interest expense for the second quarter was $8.9 million, $200,000 lower than prior year. 
Other income in the second quarter was $11.5 million, up $11.2 million from prior year. During the quarter, there were significant foreign exchange movements which provided a $13 million tailwind to other income. Approximately $9 million of this amount reflects unrealized gains on intercompany balances caused by currency movements following the Brexit vote at quarter end. 
For the 3 months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded U.S. GAAP income tax expense of $17.9 million versus $24.8 million last year. The 2016 expense is based on a full year adjusted operational tax rate of 23%, in line with last year's rate. 
Q2 U.S. GAAP net income attributable to DENTSPLY SIRONA was $105.4 million, up 139% from the prior year. Second quarter 2016 diluted GAAP EPS was $0.44 compared to $0.31 in the prior year. Adjusted non-GAAP net income grew 74.6% to $180.9 million. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.76, up 4.1% from last year, as net income growth more than offset the impact of additional share issuance related to the merger. For a reconciliation of GAAP EPS to non-GAAP adjusted EPS, please see our earnings press release. 
Cash flow from operating activities during the quarter was $187.4 million compared to $145.6 million last year. Cash used in investing activities was $18.1 million compared to $14.4 million in the prior year. The year-over-year increases were primarily related to the consolidation with Sirona. The sum of operating and investing cash flows resulted in free cash flow of $169.3 million compared to $131.3 million last year. As you can see, we used the free cash flow in Q2 to settle repurchases of shares and to pay dividends to our shareholders. We finished the quarter with a cash balance of $311.6 million. 
Now turning to guidance. We reiterate our previous guidance. For fiscal 2016, we still expect adjusted non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.70 to $2.80. Our guidance includes the following key inputs: constant-currency sales growth to range from 4% to 6%, excluding precious metals. This includes a 1% net benefit from acquisitions, divestitures and discontinued products and internal growth in the range of 3% to 5%. At current exchange rates, this translates to reported revenues including precious metals, of about $3.73 billion to $3.81 billion. Please keep in mind that we continue to face a challenging comp in Q3 related to last year's record international Dental Show and strong performance in our consumables business. At the current exchange rates, we would expect adjusted operating income margins in the range of 21% to 22%. We anticipate our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 23%. Our EPS range implies a full year share count of 220 million to 225 million fully diluted shares and FX headwinds up to $0.10. Our guidance does not include the impact of MIS or any other prospective acquisitions. 
I will now turn the call back to Jeff. Jeff?"
27504,377271651,1029324,"DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2016",2016-08-05,"Earnings Calls","DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Uly. With our second quarter behind us, we have even more confidence that DENTSPLY SIRONA is ideally positioned to benefit from 6 megatrends in dentistry. First, positive demographics are driving the need for more dental care around the world. Wit",1100,"Thanks, Uly. With our second quarter behind us, we have even more confidence that DENTSPLY SIRONA is ideally positioned to benefit from 6 megatrends in dentistry. First, positive demographics are driving the need for more dental care around the world. With the broadest portfolio of products and the widest geographical coverage, DENTSPLY SIRONA is in an outstanding position to capitalize on this trend. We are actively driving 2 other megatrends, the adoption of digital dentistry and single-visit dentistry. It is broadly agreed in the industry that both of these will become standard of care. While everyone is trying to jump on the digital wave, just offering a product in the category isn't enough. Brand, technology and service are key differentiators. As the innovator and market leader, DENTSPLY SIRONA uniquely provides the confidence to dental professionals to go digital. We are committed to keep investing in R&D to maintain and extend our leadership position. 
Last week, we saw another good indication that these trends are accelerating. In Berlin, the German Society for Computerized Dentistry opened a digital dental academy. This establishment is the first of its kind in Europe. They chose to partner with DENTSPLY SIRONA for equipment and consumables. This organization will work with leading universities and facilities to privately train on digital workflow. 
Additionally, we see dental labs increasingly partnering up with dentists to assist them in buying our Omnicam. Digital impression is proving to not only be positive for the dentist and the patient, but for the lab as well. 
Another megatrend is the general practitioners are expanding their practice and performing more specialized procedures. To do so, they require technology as well as training and education. DENTSPLY SIRONA has the broadest clinical education platform in the industry. Each year, we train over 300,000 clinicians covering all procedures and treatment categories around the world. We have developed this capability over decades with significant investment resources. We also work with dental schools around the globe to ensure adoption of our best-in-class technology. 
In the U.S., DENTSPLY SIRONA products are in virtually all dental and dental hygiene schools. Our vision to improve oral health around the globe will be driven by the next generation of practitioners who are learning on our products today. 
During the quarter, we announced a collaboration with NYU College of Dentistry. We are providing a fully equipped endodontic clinical suite. We will employ the most advanced educational and patient care technologies available with equipment and consumables from DENTSPLY SIRONA. This synergy came as a result of the teamwork within our organization and the innovative products we offer. 
Another megatrend is the expansion of group practices. Groups understand the value of efficiency and consistency of care. They are gaining greater appreciation of the competitive advantages associated with single-visit dentistry. Therefore, exceptional technology, training and education are critical when selecting manufacturing partners. As DENTSPLY SIRONA, we are best positioned to meet their needs. 
Last but not least, integrated workflow is another megatrend. One key rationale for our merger was the convergence of consumables and technology to address this trend. Next week, SIROWORLD event will provide thousands of dental professionals their first experience with the power of our integrated solutions. 
With our current product portfolio and commitment to innovation, DENTSPLY SIRONA is the only manufacturer with the ability to offer end-to-end solutions to dental professionals. 
As I promised earlier, let me now share with you some early integration success stories. On the cost side, we are well into the country development process. We're combining organizations in multiple countries to form country and regional teams. This will reduce costs, improve collaboration, cross-selling, leverage customer resources and relationships. We have recently kicked off a major initiative focused on creating a best-in-class support structure. We are currently establishing the appropriate baseline for general and administrative resources to support future growth. Building on our past success in procurement, we have established a global team that is focused on saving opportunities with vendors on both materials and services. 
While becoming more efficient is critical to our success, our merger will be defined by our ability to accelerate growth and drive revenue synergies. With the largest sales and service infrastructure in the industry, we are uniquely positioned to deliver on our offering. Leveraging 4,000 sales professionals and 5,000 distributors around the world, we are introducing commercial strategies to capture revenue synergies. We have established a project management structure to drive execution. 
During the quarter, communication and teamwork between DENTSPLY SIRONA equipment and consumables specialists resulted in us winning an international hospital vendor. Thanks to their teamwork, we offered a much stronger proposition to the hospital. As a result, we ended up selling double the amount of product. 
Another way in which we are driving revenue synergies is through product innovation. During the quarter, we introduced multiple solutions to the marketplace. These products will have impact for years to come. In chairside consumables, we are beginning to launch Aquasil Ultra Plus, a new, best-in-class impression material, it makes taking impressions quicker and easier. In Endo, we are rolling out our new RECIPROC glue,  next-generation endodontic file to do root canals faster and safer. In ortho, we launched our new Omni Plus and BioForce Plus brackets and wires. We are in the very early stages of transforming this business. These new products, along with others, will help us grow and gain market share. 
One of the unique opportunities for DENTSPLY SIRONA is the collaboration and development of new, fully integrated solutions. As you know, earlier this year, we launched our zirconia package with both equipment and consumables. CEREC Zirconia package is driving robust demand for both equipment and consumable. We continue to expand our materials offering. The ability to do zirconia chairside is opening up new customer base and creating additional interest in CEREC. The large community of zirconia users can now offer single-visit dentistry to their patients. 
Overall, I am pleased with our accomplishments to date. We are all looking forward to SIROWORLD next week. This will be our first major event as DENTSPLY SIRONA. The team is very excited to interact with dental professionals and demonstrate why DENTSPLY SIRONA is The Dental Solutions Company. 
I'd like to thank our customers for their loyal support, trust and enthusiasm for DENTSPLY SIRONA. We are pleased to recognize our distributing partners for their loyal support. I'd also like to extend a special thanks to our employees who, daily, show their commitment to improve the lives of dental professionals and their patients. Together, we will change dentistry for the better. 
We will now address your questions. Operator, please proceed."

I have to tell you I'm pleased with the growth in our quarter in both of our segments. Certainly, to see consumables lead the way in the U.S. showed solid growth, we saw some really nice rebound from our lab business and ortho there. We would say that the market is stable and we continue to be optimistic about it as we progress through the summer. But keep in mind that there is ebbs and flows in the summer and there can be some spottiness with that. We are excited about the demand we see for our CEREC World event next week which seemed to pick up the attendance in June and July. So we think that, that's positive. And certainly, we're announcing a number of new products which I think is always critical to driving growth. So can't really comment on seeing too much softness but, certainly, in parts of the business, we can understand why that could be said."

The fact of the matter is that the world is going digital and there is a clear connection between our endo business and 3D and intraoral which is playing out well for us also. With regard to implant, we're seeing some nice bundling opportunities with our 3D there and also on custom abutment. But I would say that we're looking to show balance throughout.

So we will invest a bit more in the second half of the year. Then if you look at the seasonality of our business, Q2 is traditionally probably the highest quarter in the year. So we have higher revenues, lot of our costs are fixed and do not fluctuate that much with revenues. So that gives us a bit of a lift in the second quarter every year.

Maybe we'll start with the FX impact, right? When we last spoke to you, we said that the guidance implies about a $0.10 headwind in FX. We've had, for the full year, we've had a $0.04 headwind in Q1. We've now had a all-in $0.01 tailwin",479,"Yes. Thanks, Jeff. Maybe we'll start with the FX impact, right? When we last spoke to you, we said that the guidance implies about a $0.10 headwind in FX. We've had, for the full year, we've had a $0.04 headwind in Q1. We've now had a all-in $0.01 tailwind in Q2, but that includes this onetime impact from the Brexit moves. What happened is that we supply out of Europe into South America, Asia, Australia, Eastern Europe, many of these countries' products. And we have receivables on our euro books in Brazilian real, in Japanese yen, in Australian dollars, South African rand, you name it. And all these currencies certainly strengthened to the euro when the Brexit vote happened. And we realized about  -- we didn't realize, we recorded about a $9 million gain on this in the company receivables. Now who knows whether these will stay or whether the exchange rates will move back. Our guidance does not give, everything else being equal, full credits to these gains. 
Now if I look what has happened since quarter end, we probably lost somewhere between $0.005 to $0.01 again on these gains by currency movements. If they stay, that is a positive. Now when we give guidance, we weigh all the pros and cons very carefully. And we try to give you the best estimate and a balanced judgment of what we see. And there is upsides and downsides. And sometimes, we end up being too optimistic. Sometimes, too conservative. Maybe on the FX point, we've taken a bit of a conservative view. But on the other hand, our guidance does not include a deterioration of end markets in the second half of the year. 
And you've heard one of our biggest customers yesterday express more concerns. We looked at it, as Jeff mentioned, we saw the spottiness and softness in parts of the U.S. consumable markets going into the summer as well. But when we look at the big picture, the macroeconomics for North America, very strong. Job creation is good, especially white-collar jobs. So we said here, look fundamentally, we do not really see why there should be a major deterioration. So we did not include this in our guidance and in the forecast we had prepared. So if we weigh all this, we do think it is a realistic and weighted guidance that we gave you. There's a range, you can apply judgment yourself, if you believe, based on the factors we explained to you, maybe where we might end up rather on the upper end or on the lower part. But we try to be transparent with this, and we apply our best judgment we can based on all the facts and circumstances we see and we know. And it was a lengthy answer, but I hope it helps you think some of the things, Jeff."

It seems like consensus might be in the lower half of the range.

The aspect of the real uncertainty in the overall macro market has -- it's still out there, right? Russia has not improved. While we're pleased about what we're able to do in Brazil and China, those markets are challenged. The Middle East continues to have some difficulties. So we have to put that in the overall perspective. We heard from Schein yesterday what they're viewing. We can't discount it, although we don't see it, but we see it in a little bit spotty way. And then we talk about the bigger issues which is the macro trends and the megatrends, which we talked about earlier in the call, which are all working our way, and plus the ability for our team to come together, which I think is very positive, what I'm seeing. And you can't emphasize enough how good it is to recognize some of our businesses that have taken a little bit of time to get back, like lab and ortho starting to progress. 
Remember, we said Rest of World would be our driver of growth this year. But as we go into the third quarter, remember that's a pretty tough comp, record IDS and CEREC 30 was strong. So we've got to keep that all in our consideration, Jeff. And I think that's my perspective of kind of pulling out some of the stuff that Uly was saying. And that's built in into our range. We'll certainly -- are we optimistic that next week's SIROWORLD will be -- sorry, Steve -- will be a very positive event for our organization? Absolutely. Do we -- but we've got to move through this summer and see how we finish up. And we've decided it's appropriate to keep the range that we have given all of those issues. But we don't see a fundamental change in our business proposition that we have. In fact, we would say that we're seeing more and more indications that being The Dental Solutions Company and being able to offer these integrated end-to-end solutions is exactly what the dental profession is looking for."

So very exciting opportunity for us, specifically to get into the value segment which we know is growing faster than other segments in dental. And $1.5 billion market size is something that's significant when you're talking about a market that's maybe $25 billion overall in dental and the space that we play in. I think when you couple that together with the installed base of customers we have, there's a lot of room. 
We do see a trend that more and more dentists are having a dual-brand strategy to meeting their implant needs. And from a perspective of making a decision in this category, we thought MIS had the best brand that cut across multiple regions and countries. Most value brands are country-specific. MIS is unusual to that and is an exciting product to add to our portfolio. Chris, let me hand it over to you."

It is my pleasure to welcome all of you to our third quarter conference call. Also joining us on the call today, Uly Michel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Chris Clark, our President and Chief Operating Officer for Technologies; and Derek Leckow, Vice President of Investor Relations. 
This was our second full quarter together following the historic merger of DENTSPLY and SIRONA. As anticipated at the time, there are best synergies on both the cost side, and more importantly, the revenue side. We have spent the last 6 months focused on bringing the cultures together and doing the required planning for enhancing our value proposition to the customer and also streamlining our cost structure. We are now moving from planning to execution. This was evident at SIROWORLD in Orlando in August. There was a great interest in our end-to-end solutions and how we can enhance the customer experience and clinical benefits. I think it is fair to say SIROWORLD was a great success. As evidence of this, we have a record-setting rate of enrollment for our event next year in Las Vegas, indicating a very high interest in where we are going with DENTSPLY SIRONA. 
Our teams are fully engaged in finding and capitalizing on the strength of bringing the world's largest dental consumable and technology platforms together. This is important as our merger is all about growth. At this stage, I am pleased with the progress I'm seeing as we are beginning to execute on our plan. 
On the cost side, we had some early successes. As we move forward, there will be more activity, including some sizable opportunities in manufacturing, procurement, logistics and overhead. This quarter, you have already seen significant tax savings that have occurred as a result of the formation of the new combined company. We are on track as we progress deeper into the implementation phase. 
Turning to our results. The third quarter revenue came in a bit lower than we expected. Constant currency revenue growth was up slightly, driven by internal growth of 2.6% in Rest of World, up against a very challenging comparison. Last year, Rest of World grew 15.6%. Europe was up 1.2% on an internal basis. Both our technologies and consumable segments grew. We grew in both Northern and Southern Europe. Our U.S. business was down 3.2%, with declines in both segments. Our technologies business grew double digits a year ago. We benefited from CEREC 30 and the launch of treatment centers. Although end-users demand for our technologies remain strong, we were unable to grow on top of the 18% growth in equipment last year. In consumables, the combination of a soft summer and a change in dealer buying patterns led to the decline. Last year, we received typical strong orders ahead of our annual October price increase. This year, we saw significantly less activity. Overall, we see the U.S. market as stable. We believe that our growth will pick up in the fourth quarter. 
Our adjusted EPS was $0.66, unchanged from last year. Net income grew 66% and was offset by the increase in shares outstanding. Our net income benefited from a lower tax rate. When we structured the merger, we disclosed that there were multiple synergy opportunities to capture. I am pleased to report that our tax team has been supporting our integration activities, which has yielded some tax efficiencies. 
Before I turn the call over to Uly, I want to comment on our capital deployment. During the third quarter, we repurchased $100 million of our shares. Year-to-date, we have bought $700 million worth of our stock. I'm also pleased to announce that the board has authorized us to repurchase an additional 5 million shares. 
In September, we completed the acquisition of MIS. We can now address this faster-growing $1.5 billion value market. This is a great addition to our DENTSPLY SIRONA implant portfolio. 
In addition, we operate in a very fragmented market, where there is ample opportunity for more consolidation. Our balance sheet remains strong and gives us the flexibility to pursue multiple avenues to create value. 
Lastly, of course, we have continued to return capital to shareholders through our dividend. 
Overall, I'm pleased that where we are on our strategic initiatives and how our organization is coming together. Growth is a top priority for DENTSPLY SIRONA and a major reason for why we merged. We're positioning the company for top and bottom line growth. As you saw in the press release today, we are bringing the low end of our guidance range up by $0.05 per share, reflecting our continued confidence in the business model and our prospects going forward. 
I will now turn the call over to Uly, who will review our third quarter financials."

This morning, I will discuss our U.S. GAAP results as well as our non-GAAP adjusted results. As I walk through the earnings performance, I will also point out major impacts of merger accounting on our results. I",1068,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will discuss our U.S. GAAP results as well as our non-GAAP adjusted results. As I walk through the earnings performance, I will also point out major impacts of merger accounting on our results. 
In the third quarter, our reported revenue increased $305.3 million to $954.2 million, up 47%. Adjusted sales of our combined businesses, excluding precious metals, grew 0.4% on a constant currency basis. Internal growth was flat excluding an 80 basis point favorable impact from net acquisitions and the 40 basis points unfavorable impact from discontinued products. Foreign exchange movements were a tailwind to revenue of 40 basis points. As a reminder, these growth percentages reflect the performance of the combined business as if it had been consolidated on January 1, 2015. 
Jeff already addressed revenue growth by geography and segments. We have provided reconciliation tables for every segment and region that will help you understand how the GAAP reported revenue and internal growth come together. 
U.S. GAAP gross profit was $513.6 million, up $144.1 million or 38.9% from $369.5 million in 2015. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, excluding precious metal content, decreased by 400 basis points to 54.7% from 58.7% in the prior year. As you can see, on the non-GAAP reconciliation tables, the gross profit margin was negatively impacted by 320 basis points, mostly due to the effect of step-up amortization and other merger-related items. On an adjusted basis, gross margin was 57.8%, down 230 basis points for the quarter. Unfavorable product mix and foreign exchange impact offset the benefits of savings from the global efficiency program and favorable product pricing. 
Reported SG&A expenses, which include R&D, was $379.1 million, up $114.8 million or 43.4% versus last year. This equates to 40.4% of sales, excluding precious metals, 160 basis points below prior year. The decrease was primarily the result of Sirona's lower operating expense rate and savings from the global efficiency program, partially offset by increased amortization expense and other costs related to the merger. Adjusted for non-GAAP items, including amortization expense and other costs related to the merger, SG&A expense was $348.3 million or 37% of sales, excluding precious metals, representing a 200 basis point improvement. This ratio was largely unaffected by FX. Restructuring expenses were $7.9 million, up from $6.6 million last year. 
In total, GAAP operating income was $126.6 million, up $28 million or 28.4% from last year. Excluding the non-GAAP items set forth in our non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted operating margin was 20.8%, down 20 basis points compared to the 21% last year. Margins benefited from the positive impacts of the global efficiency programs and the consolidation of Sirona. FX had a negative impact of approximately 50 basis points on the rate. 
Net interest expense for the third quarter was $7.9 million, $1.3 million lower than prior year. Other expense in the third quarter was $1.6 million, a swing from a net gain of $3.8 million in the prior year. This $5.4 million negative impact is driven by changes in gains and losses from currency transaction and hedges. 
For the 3 months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded U.S. GAAP income tax expense of $24.8 million versus $19.6 million last year. During Q3, the company recorded $5.1 million of tax expense related to these pretax matters. Excluding these pretax matters, the company's effective tax rate was 17.8%. The Q3 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by an update of our annual estimated tax rate. It includes the combined benefit of the first 3 quarters. After completing major steps of our integration, we now anticipate our annual effective tax rate to be 21%. 
Q3 U.S. GAAP net income attributable to DENTSPLY SIRONA was $92.5 million, up 9.5% from the prior year. Third quarter 2016 diluted GAAP EPS was $0.39 compared to $0.59 in the prior year. Adjusted non-GAAP net income grew 65.9% to $155.6 million. Adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.66, the same as last year. Net income growth was offset by the impact of additional share issuance related to the merger. For a reconciliation of GAAP EPS to non-GAAP adjusted EPS, please see our earnings press release. 
Cash flow from operating activities during the third quarter was $152.9 million compared to $159.7 million last year. Q3 2016 operating cash flows were negatively impacted by increases in working capital versus the reduction of working capital in Q3 2015. The single biggest item was related to the timing of customer payments, which we only received in early October. 
Cash used in investing activities was $379.7 million compared to a source of cash of $36.2 million in the prior year. The primary driver of the change was the cash paid for MIS Implants. Cash flow from financing activities was $237.1 million inflow versus an outflow of $55.4 million last year. 
In Q3 2016, we returned close to $113 million to our shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. We paid $419 million of long-term and short-term borrowings, and we had proceeds of $760 million from long-term borrowings. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $330.7 million. 
On October 27, subsequent to the quarter end, we issued EUR 350 million of private placement notes with tenors between 8 and 15 years and a weighted average interest rate of 1.4%. The proceeds were used to repay $375 million drawn under our revolving credit facility. 
Now turning to guidance. For fiscal 2016, we now expect adjusted non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.75 to $2.80 versus our previous range of $2.70 to $2.80. Our guidance includes the following key inputs: so far, we have been expecting constant currency sales growth in the range of 4% to 6% and internal sales growth of 3% to 5%. At current exchange rates, this would translate to reported revenues, excluding precious metals, of approximately $3.73 billion to $3.81 billion. We now expect our revenues to be at the low end of the previously expressed range. This implies a return to mid-single-digit growth in Q4. We expect adjusted operating income margins in the range of 21% to 22%. We anticipate our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 21%. The EPS range implies a full year share count of $220 million to 225 million fully diluted shares and FX headwinds in the range of $0.08 to $0.10. 
I will now turn the call back to Jeff. Jeff?"

We have differentiated ourselves through quality, innovation and putting the customer first. Our goal is to build upon our legacy in this very attractive market. We have an extraordinary opportunity to make a significant impact in the dental market, which will drive our growth. The dental market is growing, supported by sustainable long-term demographic trends. In developed markets, an aging population is retaining more of their natural teeth. In emerging economies, the growing middle class is demanding more dental care. A significant part of our market is private pay. Short-term consumer behavior can impact the quarter or product mix, but dental care is rarely postponed long. And we do not face the uncertainty associated with other health care reimbursement systems. Furthermore, oral health is continuously proving to be more important to overall health. 
From a cost-benefit perspective, individuals and governments alike get significant return on their investment in dental. All of these factors make dental an attractive space. 
There are other megatrends like general practitioners taking on additional procedures, the digitization of dentistry, single-visit dentistry and the increasing demand for integrated workflow solutions. All of these developments are growing faster than the market. DENTSPLY SIRONA was created to accelerate these trends. We are well positioned to benefit from this. 
I am pleased to see how well our organization has come together over the last 9 months. Our focus on culture is paying off. I've always believed that getting the culture right is the most decisive factor of the long-term success of the merger. We continue to invest the time, resources and people to create a winning and extraordinary culture. We've trained over 200 culture champions and launched cultural workshops across the globe. We introduced new branding to our customers. We are now beginning to accelerate integration activities. 
In the third quarter, we truly began laying the groundwork for accelerating growth. We launched new products and initiated key revenue synergy work streams. In August, over 4,000 dental professionals attended SIROWORLD in Orlando, Florida. This was the very first DENTSPLY SIRONA event in the U.S. The market was presented with the DENTSPLY SIRONA brand and the power of our end-to-end integrated solutions. SIROWORLD was unlike any event in the past. Educational tracks spanned across all general and specialty procedures. Dentists got trained on our leading technology and saw how they connect to each other. DENTSPLY SIRONA is the only company that can offer dental professionals true end-to-end integrated solutions. 
Our CEREC Zirconia package continues to accelerate adoption of CAD/CAM. The ability through zirconia chairside is expanding our market opportunity. New users are driving this growth. They are also becoming customers of our chairside materials, like CELTRA. We have a significant opportunity to capture share in this market. We are also seeing increased demand for our ORTHOPHOS SL. 3D adoption is increasing rapidly. Our merger is clearly helping drive demand for digital dentistry. 
Our investments in R&D will continue to deliver differentiated solutions. These will drive demand for our products and accelerate our growth. We are in the very early stages of rolling out some of these solutions. 
In the U.S., we launched the new Midwest E Plus series of electric handpieces. This new instrument is yet another example of one of the many revenue synergies. With our E Plus series, we are able to leverage our world-class German engineering and manufacturing with our leading U.S. Midwest brand and sales force. For years, electric instruments have been standard of care outside the U.S. Today, electric represents only 15% of the market. With this synergy, we can take advantage of the growing trend in the largest market in the world. Early indications are that the Midwest E Plus is a winner. 
Cross-selling and collaboration will also be critical to our success. Our lab business is a perfect example of how DENTSPLY SIRONA coming together will accelerate growth. By combining consumables, equipment and services, we can address all the needs of the lab. We are in a much stronger position together. Now that the business has been transformed, it is poised to gain market share. 
The strength in our organization for accelerating growth, we have been ramping up our country consolidation activities. These activities leverage our infrastructure and improve efficiencies. In October, we initiated actions to reorganize and combine portions of manufacturing, logistics and distribution. By reducing complexity, we can encourage collaboration and promote one DENTSPLY SIRONA brand. 
All of these actions will deliver significant cost savings and position the company best in the future. To date, we have been investing a lot of the savings into investments that will generate growth. As we move ahead, we expect more of the savings to drop to the bottom line. 
We have been continuously investing in our sales and service infrastructure. We began investing over a year ago, and that's continued. It typically takes 12 to 18 months to fully ramp up these sales resources. We are just beginning to see the benefits of these investments. We expect them to become larger contributors as we head into 2017. 
Overall, I am very pleased with where DENTSPLY SIRONA is positioned today. We are executing on our cost and revenue synergy targets. We are investing in R&D and sales and service to accelerate growth. We are excited about our new product offerings. We are also looking forward to introducing even more products at the International Dental Show in March. We expect to finish the year strong. We will accelerate growth in the fourth quarter. With the innovations we can offer today and our ideas for treating patients in the future, we are enabling dental professionals to improve, change and save lives. 
I'd like to thank our customers for their loyal support, trust and enthusiasm for DENTSPLY SIRONA. We're pleased to recognize our distribution partners for their support. I'd also like to extend a special thanks to our employees who daily show their commitment to improve the lives of dental professionals and their patients. Together, we will change dentistry for the better. 
We will now address your questions. Operator, please proceed."

But again, we're very pleased with the performance of our team there. And on the endo side, we just continue to innovate and are very pleased with what's coming out from the R&D shop there. We launched the RECIPROC Blue file in the quarter and also our new 3D endo software, which, again, both of which will be very nice platforms for us moving forward."

When we launched it, we've always been about CAD/CAM for everyone. So we've had a product for years in each one of these segment areas, whether it be on the digital impression only, all the way up to the practice lab. And so that has certainly run the gamut. I -- we have seen more activity in the DI, which, on an overall basis, would lower the ASP in that category, but we see much more sales on the chairside because it's a much more compelling proposition for the dental professional and certainly, the patient that they serve. And so the big winner for us continues to be chairside with the MC XL in full functionality. That being said, we did run a promotion on our DI, which lowered the ASP to just under 30,000. But keep in mind that when you think about all of the functionality we're adding to the system, with the speed fire and what zirconia can do, we're now allowing a dentist to do chairside, which they always relied on the lab. Zirconia is the #1 material used by dentists for restorative, and we're allowing that to happen chairside. And that's a bigger deal, and that's a big trend. And that's just getting started. That's early days for us, and we're very excited about that. We're also very excited about our CELTRA Duo and what that offers and taking care of the dental professionals. So I -- you're right. There is more interest in DI than we've seen in the past. But DENTSPLY SIRONA is getting their fair share there, although we continue to see the best value proposition for the dental professional being chairside."

Putting together the team, which we had a PMO, which is now an IMO, an integration office, that's working through all of the complex aspects of it, from country formation to looking at how we become more efficient and effective and leverage ourselves. And certainly, it's what we looked at when we first put our guidance together so we're able to look at areas where, if it were, to be able to have an impact on it. That's why you spend so much time the first 6 months really planning and stabilizing your organization to be able to be focused on driving our growth, meeting our guidance expectations, but then also preparing ourselves to be able to do the heavy-lifting of integration. And certainly, you saw with our tax today that we had a synergy which came from the proper planning with the tax team that was able to do that. We felt confident that we were executing at a high-enough level that we raised the bottom of our guidance range by $0.05, which is significant. And we also -- when we look forward to the fourth quarter, we have metrics that give us confidence about the revenue synergies that we will be able to execute on over the next few months. And certainly, you have to keep that 2 things separate from the ongoing process of integration and the restructuring, and that's one, having your sales force focused. We're going into this. We're very clear about that. We broke it down into 5 RCO regions. I actually have the regions reporting into me, so I get a lot of visibility. We have a team that is focused on giving us the insight on where the revenue synergies are coming from. Keep in mind, we talked about that we had close to 200 work streams. We've now been whittling that down to the ones that are working best. We were able to deal with the SIROWORLD, which we saw -- the whole management team was able to see what's capable and isolated to an area. And then the other part which is so important is that it doesn't disrupt our ability to innovate and bring products to market faster. We have not seen anything with regard to the integration slow our product cycle, which is critical, especially as we get to the point of readying ourselves for an IDS for next year. Yes, we talked about that this merger was all about growth, and growth comes from our tremendous brand and product portfolio, our sales and service infrastructure, our clinical education and our ability to launch new products.

Both companies had good strong improvements last year in the third quarter. So where do we get back to kind of a pro forma or combined, I guess, operating margin improvement trend line as we move into next year? Is that still on the table?"

This was our second full quarter together following the historic merger of DENTSPLY and SIRONA. As anticipated at the time, there are best synergies on both the cost side, and more importantly, the revenue side. We have spent the last 6 months focused on bringing the cultures together and doing the required planning for enhancing our value proposition to the customer and also streamlining our cost structure. We are now moving from planning to execution. This was evident at SIROWORLD in Orlando in August. There was a great interest in our end-to-end solutions and how we can enhance the customer experience and clinical benefits. I think it is fair to say SIROWORLD was a great success. As evidence of this, we have a record-setting rate of enrollment for our event next year in Las Vegas, indicating a very high interest in where we are going with DENTSPLY SIRONA. 
Our teams are fully engaged in finding and capitalizing on the strength of bringing the world's largest dental consumable and technology platforms together. This is important as our merger is all about growth. At this stage, I am pleased with the progress I'm seeing as we are beginning to execute on our plan. 
On the cost side, we had some early successes. As we move forward, there will be more activity, including some sizable opportunities in manufacturing, procurement, logistics and overhead. This quarter, you have already seen significant tax savings that have occurred as a result of the formation of the new combined company. We are on track as we progress deeper into the implementation phase. 
Turning to our results. The third quarter revenue came in a bit lower than we expected. Constant currency revenue growth was up slightly, driven by internal growth of 2.6% in Rest of World, up against a very challenging comparison. Last year, Rest of World grew 15.6%. Europe was up 1.2% on an internal basis. Both our technologies and consumable segments grew. We grew in both Northern and Southern Europe. Our U.S. business was down 3.2%, with declines in both segments. Our technologies business grew double digits a year ago. We benefited from CEREC 30 and the launch of treatment centers. Although end-users demand for our technologies remain strong, we were unable to grow on top of the 18% growth in equipment last year. In consumables, the combination of a soft summer and a change in dealer buying patterns led to the decline. Last year, we received typical strong orders ahead of our annual October price increase. This year, we saw significantly less activity. Overall, we see the U.S. market as stable. We believe that our growth will pick up in the fourth quarter. 
Our adjusted EPS was $0.66, unchanged from last year. Net income grew 66% and was offset by the increase in shares outstanding. Our net income benefited from a lower tax rate. When we structured the merger, we disclosed that there were multiple synergy opportunities to capture. I am pleased to report that our tax team has been supporting our integration activities, which has yielded some tax efficiencies. 
Before I turn the call over to Uly, I want to comment on our capital deployment. During the third quarter, we repurchased $100 million of our shares. Year-to-date, we have bought $700 million worth of our stock. I'm also pleased to announce that the board has authorized us to repurchase an additional 5 million shares. 
In September, we completed the acquisition of MIS. We can now address this faster-growing $1.5 billion value market. This is a great addition to our DENTSPLY SIRONA implant portfolio. 
In addition, we operate in a very fragmented market, where there is ample opportunity for more consolidation. Our balance sheet remains strong and gives us the flexibility to pursue multiple avenues to create value. 
Lastly, of course, we have continued to return capital to shareholders through our dividend. 
Overall, I'm pleased that where we are on our strategic initiatives and how our organization is coming together. Growth is a top priority for DENTSPLY SIRONA and a major reason for why we merged. We're positioning the company for top and bottom line growth. As you saw in the press release today, we are bringing the low end of our guidance range up by $0.05 per share, reflecting our continued confidence in the business model and our prospects going forward. 
I will now turn the call over to Uly, who will review our third quarter financials."

This morning, I will discuss our U.S. GAAP results as well as our non-GAAP adjusted results. As I walk through the earnings performance, I will also point out major impacts of merger accounting on our results. I",1068,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will discuss our U.S. GAAP results as well as our non-GAAP adjusted results. As I walk through the earnings performance, I will also point out major impacts of merger accounting on our results. 
In the third quarter, our reported revenue increased $305.3 million to $954.2 million, up 47%. Adjusted sales of our combined businesses, excluding precious metals, grew 0.4% on a constant currency basis. Internal growth was flat excluding an 80 basis point favorable impact from net acquisitions and the 40 basis points unfavorable impact from discontinued products. Foreign exchange movements were a tailwind to revenue of 40 basis points. As a reminder, these growth percentages reflect the performance of the combined business as if it had been consolidated on January 1, 2015. 
Jeff already addressed revenue growth by geography and segments. We have provided reconciliation tables for every segment and region that will help you understand how the GAAP reported revenue and internal growth come together. 
U.S. GAAP gross profit was $513.6 million, up $144.1 million or 38.9% from $369.5 million in 2015. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, excluding precious metal content, decreased by 400 basis points to 54.7% from 58.7% in the prior year. As you can see, on the non-GAAP reconciliation tables, the gross profit margin was negatively impacted by 320 basis points, mostly due to the effect of step-up amortization and other merger-related items. On an adjusted basis, gross margin was 57.8%, down 230 basis points for the quarter. Unfavorable product mix and foreign exchange impact offset the benefits of savings from the global efficiency program and favorable product pricing. 
Reported SG&A expenses, which include R&D, was $379.1 million, up $114.8 million or 43.4% versus last year. This equates to 40.4% of sales, excluding precious metals, 160 basis points below prior year. The decrease was primarily the result of Sirona's lower operating expense rate and savings from the global efficiency program, partially offset by increased amortization expense and other costs related to the merger. Adjusted for non-GAAP items, including amortization expense and other costs related to the merger, SG&A expense was $348.3 million or 37% of sales, excluding precious metals, representing a 200 basis point improvement. This ratio was largely unaffected by FX. Restructuring expenses were $7.9 million, up from $6.6 million last year. 
In total, GAAP operating income was $126.6 million, up $28 million or 28.4% from last year. Excluding the non-GAAP items set forth in our non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted operating margin was 20.8%, down 20 basis points compared to the 21% last year. Margins benefited from the positive impacts of the global efficiency programs and the consolidation of Sirona. FX had a negative impact of approximately 50 basis points on the rate. 
Net interest expense for the third quarter was $7.9 million, $1.3 million lower than prior year. Other expense in the third quarter was $1.6 million, a swing from a net gain of $3.8 million in the prior year. This $5.4 million negative impact is driven by changes in gains and losses from currency transaction and hedges. 
For the 3 months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded U.S. GAAP income tax expense of $24.8 million versus $19.6 million last year. During Q3, the company recorded $5.1 million of tax expense related to these pretax matters. Excluding these pretax matters, the company's effective tax rate was 17.8%. The Q3 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by an update of our annual estimated tax rate. It includes the combined benefit of the first 3 quarters. After completing major steps of our integration, we now anticipate our annual effective tax rate to be 21%. 
Q3 U.S. GAAP net income attributable to DENTSPLY SIRONA was $92.5 million, up 9.5% from the prior year. Third quarter 2016 diluted GAAP EPS was $0.39 compared to $0.59 in the prior year. Adjusted non-GAAP net income grew 65.9% to $155.6 million. Adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.66, the same as last year. Net income growth was offset by the impact of additional share issuance related to the merger. For a reconciliation of GAAP EPS to non-GAAP adjusted EPS, please see our earnings press release. 
Cash flow from operating activities during the third quarter was $152.9 million compared to $159.7 million last year. Q3 2016 operating cash flows were negatively impacted by increases in working capital versus the reduction of working capital in Q3 2015. The single biggest item was related to the timing of customer payments, which we only received in early October. 
Cash used in investing activities was $379.7 million compared to a source of cash of $36.2 million in the prior year. The primary driver of the change was the cash paid for MIS Implants. Cash flow from financing activities was $237.1 million inflow versus an outflow of $55.4 million last year. 
In Q3 2016, we returned close to $113 million to our shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. We paid $419 million of long-term and short-term borrowings, and we had proceeds of $760 million from long-term borrowings. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $330.7 million. 
On October 27, subsequent to the quarter end, we issued EUR 350 million of private placement notes with tenors between 8 and 15 years and a weighted average interest rate of 1.4%. The proceeds were used to repay $375 million drawn under our revolving credit facility. 
Now turning to guidance. For fiscal 2016, we now expect adjusted non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.75 to $2.80 versus our previous range of $2.70 to $2.80. Our guidance includes the following key inputs: so far, we have been expecting constant currency sales growth in the range of 4% to 6% and internal sales growth of 3% to 5%. At current exchange rates, this would translate to reported revenues, excluding precious metals, of approximately $3.73 billion to $3.81 billion. We now expect our revenues to be at the low end of the previously expressed range. This implies a return to mid-single-digit growth in Q4. We expect adjusted operating income margins in the range of 21% to 22%. We anticipate our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 21%. The EPS range implies a full year share count of $220 million to 225 million fully diluted shares and FX headwinds in the range of $0.08 to $0.10. 
I will now turn the call back to Jeff. Jeff?"

We have differentiated ourselves through quality, innovation and putting the customer first. Our goal is to build upon our legacy in this very attractive market. We have an extraordinary opportunity to make a significant impact in the dental market, which will drive our growth. The dental market is growing, supported by sustainable long-term demographic trends. In developed markets, an aging population is retaining more of their natural teeth. In emerging economies, the growing middle class is demanding more dental care. A significant part of our market is private pay. Short-term consumer behavior can impact the quarter or product mix, but dental care is rarely postponed long. And we do not face the uncertainty associated with other health care reimbursement systems. Furthermore, oral health is continuously proving to be more important to overall health. 
From a cost-benefit perspective, individuals and governments alike get significant return on their investment in dental. All of these factors make dental an attractive space. 
There are other megatrends like general practitioners taking on additional procedures, the digitization of dentistry, single-visit dentistry and the increasing demand for integrated workflow solutions. All of these developments are growing faster than the market. DENTSPLY SIRONA was created to accelerate these trends. We are well positioned to benefit from this. 
I am pleased to see how well our organization has come together over the last 9 months. Our focus on culture is paying off. I've always believed that getting the culture right is the most decisive factor of the long-term success of the merger. We continue to invest the time, resources and people to create a winning and extraordinary culture. We've trained over 200 culture champions and launched cultural workshops across the globe. We introduced new branding to our customers. We are now beginning to accelerate integration activities. 
In the third quarter, we truly began laying the groundwork for accelerating growth. We launched new products and initiated key revenue synergy work streams. In August, over 4,000 dental professionals attended SIROWORLD in Orlando, Florida. This was the very first DENTSPLY SIRONA event in the U.S. The market was presented with the DENTSPLY SIRONA brand and the power of our end-to-end integrated solutions. SIROWORLD was unlike any event in the past. Educational tracks spanned across all general and specialty procedures. Dentists got trained on our leading technology and saw how they connect to each other. DENTSPLY SIRONA is the only company that can offer dental professionals true end-to-end integrated solutions. 
Our CEREC Zirconia package continues to accelerate adoption of CAD/CAM. The ability through zirconia chairside is expanding our market opportunity. New users are driving this growth. They are also becoming customers of our chairside materials, like CELTRA. We have a significant opportunity to capture share in this market. We are also seeing increased demand for our ORTHOPHOS SL. 3D adoption is increasing rapidly. Our merger is clearly helping drive demand for digital dentistry. 
Our investments in R&D will continue to deliver differentiated solutions. These will drive demand for our products and accelerate our growth. We are in the very early stages of rolling out some of these solutions. 
In the U.S., we launched the new Midwest E Plus series of electric handpieces. This new instrument is yet another example of one of the many revenue synergies. With our E Plus series, we are able to leverage our world-class German engineering and manufacturing with our leading U.S. Midwest brand and sales force. For years, electric instruments have been standard of care outside the U.S. Today, electric represents only 15% of the market. With this synergy, we can take advantage of the growing trend in the largest market in the world. Early indications are that the Midwest E Plus is a winner. 
Cross-selling and collaboration will also be critical to our success. Our lab business is a perfect example of how DENTSPLY SIRONA coming together will accelerate growth. By combining consumables, equipment and services, we can address all the needs of the lab. We are in a much stronger position together. Now that the business has been transformed, it is poised to gain market share. 
The strength in our organization for accelerating growth, we have been ramping up our country consolidation activities. These activities leverage our infrastructure and improve efficiencies. In October, we initiated actions to reorganize and combine portions of manufacturing, logistics and distribution. By reducing complexity, we can encourage collaboration and promote one DENTSPLY SIRONA brand. 
All of these actions will deliver significant cost savings and position the company best in the future. To date, we have been investing a lot of the savings into investments that will generate growth. As we move ahead, we expect more of the savings to drop to the bottom line. 
We have been continuously investing in our sales and service infrastructure. We began investing over a year ago, and that's continued. It typically takes 12 to 18 months to fully ramp up these sales resources. We are just beginning to see the benefits of these investments. We expect them to become larger contributors as we head into 2017. 
Overall, I am very pleased with where DENTSPLY SIRONA is positioned today. We are executing on our cost and revenue synergy targets. We are investing in R&D and sales and service to accelerate growth. We are excited about our new product offerings. We are also looking forward to introducing even more products at the International Dental Show in March. We expect to finish the year strong. We will accelerate growth in the fourth quarter. With the innovations we can offer today and our ideas for treating patients in the future, we are enabling dental professionals to improve, change and save lives. 
I'd like to thank our customers for their loyal support, trust and enthusiasm for DENTSPLY SIRONA. We're pleased to recognize our distribution partners for their support. I'd also like to extend a special thanks to our employees who daily show their commitment to improve the lives of dental professionals and their patients. Together, we will change dentistry for the better. 
We will now address your questions. Operator, please proceed."

John, every IDS has to be better than the one before, and this is no exception. For us, as we think about 2017, we do expect -- well, I'm not going to give guidance on this call to see growth accelerate given what we're doing on our -- with our revenue synergies and how we're coming together."

When we launched it, we've always been about CAD/CAM for everyone. So we've had a product for years in each one of these segment areas, whether it be on the digital impression only, all the way up to the practice lab. And so that has certainly run the gamut. I -- we have seen more activity in the DI, which, on an overall basis, would lower the ASP in that category, but we see much more sales on the chairside because it's a much more compelling proposition for the dental professional and certainly, the patient that they serve. And so the big winner for us continues to be chairside with the MC XL in full functionality. That being said, we did run a promotion on our DI, which lowered the ASP to just under 30,000. But keep in mind that when you think about all of the functionality we're adding to the system, with the speed fire and what zirconia can do, we're now allowing a dentist to do chairside, which they always relied on the lab. Zirconia is the #1 material used by dentists for restorative, and we're allowing that to happen chairside. And that's a bigger deal, and that's a big trend. And that's just getting started. That's early days for us, and we're very excited about that. We're also very excited about our CELTRA Duo and what that offers and taking care of the dental professionals. So I -- you're right. There is more interest in DI than we've seen in the past. But DENTSPLY SIRONA is getting their fair share there, although we continue to see the best value proposition for the dental professional being chairside."

And certainly, it's what we looked at when we first put our guidance together, so we're able to look at areas where, if it were, to be able to have an impact on it. That's why you spend so much time the first 6 months really planning and stabilizing your organization to be able to be focused on driving our growth, meeting our guidance expectations, but then also preparing ourselves to be able to do the heavy lifting of integration. And certainly, you saw in -- with our tax today that we had a synergy, which came from the proper planning with the tax team that was able to do that. We felt confident that we were executing at a high enough level that we raise the bottom of our guidance range by $0.05, which is significant. And we also -- when we look forward to the fourth quarter, we have metrics that give us confidence about the revenue synergies that we will be able to execute on over the next few months. And certainly, you have to keep that 2 things separate from the ongoing process of integration and the restructuring, and that's one, having your sales force focused. We're going into this. We're very clear about that. We broke it down into 5 RCO regions. Actually have the regions reporting into me, so I get a lot of visibility. We have a team that is focused on giving us the insight on where the revenue synergies are coming from. Keep in mind, we talked about that we had close to 200 work streams. We've now been whittling that down to the ones that are working best. We were able to deal with the SIROWORLD, which we saw -- the whole management team was able to see what's capable and isolated to an area. And then the other part, which is so important, is that it doesn't disrupt our ability to innovate and bring products to market faster. We have not seen anything with regard to the integration slow our product cycle, which is critical, especially as we get to the point of readying ourselves for an IDS for next year. Yes, we talked about that this merger was all about growth.

This was our second full quarter together following the historic merger of DENTSPLY and SIRONA. As anticipated at the time, there are vast synergies on both the cost side, and more importantly, the revenue side. We have spent the last 6 months focused on bringing the cultures together and doing the required planning for enhancing our value proposition to the customer and also streamlining our cost structure. We are now moving from planning to execution. This was evident at SIROWORLD in Orlando in August. There was a great interest in our end-to-end solutions and how we can enhance the customer experience and clinical benefits. I think it is fair to say SIROWORLD was a great success. As evidence of this, we have a record-setting rate of enrollment for our event next year in Las Vegas, indicating a very high interest in where we are going with DENTSPLY SIRONA. 
Our teams are fully engaged in finding and capitalizing on the strength of bringing the world's largest dental consumable and technology platforms together. This is important as our merger is all about growth. At this stage, I am pleased with the progress I'm seeing as we are beginning to execute on our plan. 
On the cost side, we had some early successes. As we move forward, there will be more activity, including some sizable opportunities in manufacturing, procurement, logistics and overhead. This quarter, you have already seen significant tax savings that have occurred as a result of the formation of the new combined company. We are on track as we progress deeper into the implementation phase. 
Turning to our results. The third quarter revenue came in a bit lower than we expected. Constant currency revenue growth was up slightly, driven by internal growth of 2.6% in Rest of World, up against a very challenging comparison. Last year, Rest of World grew 15.6%. Europe was up 1.2% on an internal basis. Both our technologies and consumable segments grew. We grew in both Northern and Southern Europe. Our U.S. business was down 3.2%, with declines in both segments. Our technologies business grew double digits a year ago. We benefited from CEREC 30 and the launch of treatment centers. Although end-users demand for our technologies remain strong, we were unable to grow on top of the 18% growth in equipment last year. In consumables, the combination of a soft summer and a change in dealer buying patterns led to the decline. Last year, we received typical strong orders ahead of our annual October price increase. This year, we saw significantly less activity. Overall, we see the U.S. market as stable. We believe that our growth will pick up in the fourth quarter. 
Our adjusted EPS was $0.66, unchanged from last year. Net income grew 66% and was offset by the increase in shares outstanding. Our net income benefited from a lower tax rate. When we structured the merger, we disclosed that there were multiple synergy opportunities to capture. I am pleased to report that our tax team has been supporting our integration activities, which has yielded some tax efficiencies. 
Before I turn the call over to Uly, I want to comment on our capital deployment. During the third quarter, we repurchased $100 million of our shares. Year-to-date, we have bought $700 million worth of our stock. I'm also pleased to announce that the board has authorized us to repurchase an additional 5 million shares. 
In September, we completed the acquisition of MIS. We can now address the faster-growing $1.5 billion value market. This is a great addition to our DENTSPLY SIRONA implant portfolio. 
In addition, we operate in a very fragmented market, where there is ample opportunity for more consolidation. Our balance sheet remains strong and gives us the flexibility to pursue multiple avenues to create value. 
Lastly, of course, we have continued to return capital to shareholders through our dividend. 
Overall, I'm pleased that where we are on our strategic initiatives and how our organization is coming together. Growth is a top priority for DENTSPLY SIRONA and a major reason for why we merged. We're positioning the company for top and bottom line growth. As you saw in the press release today, we are bringing the low end of our guidance range up by $0.05 per share, reflecting our continued confidence in the business model and our prospects going forward. 
I will now turn the call over to Uly, who will review our third quarter financials."
27504,406678676,1074616,"DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2016",2016-11-04,"Earnings Calls","DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will discuss our U.S. GAAP results as well as our non-GAAP adjusted results. As I walk through the earnings performance, I will also point out major impacts of merger accounting on our results. I",1068,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will discuss our U.S. GAAP results as well as our non-GAAP adjusted results. As I walk through the earnings performance, I will also point out major impacts of merger accounting on our results. 
In the third quarter, our reported revenue increased $305.3 million to $954.2 million, up 47%. Adjusted sales of our combined businesses, excluding precious metals, grew 0.4% on a constant currency basis. Internal growth was flat excluding an 80 basis point favorable impact from net acquisitions and the 40 basis points unfavorable impact from discontinued products. Foreign exchange movements were a tailwind to revenue of 40 basis points. As a reminder, these growth percentages reflect the performance of the combined business as if it had been consolidated on January 1, 2015. 
Jeff already addressed revenue growth by geography and segments. We have provided reconciliation tables for every segment and region that will help you understand how the GAAP reported revenue and internal growth come together. 
U.S. GAAP gross profit was $513.6 million, up $144.1 million or 38.9% from $369.5 million in 2015. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, excluding precious metal content, decreased by 400 basis points to 54.7% from 58.7% in the prior year. As you can see, on the non-GAAP reconciliation tables, the gross profit margin was negatively impacted by 320 basis points, mostly due to the effect of step-up amortization and other merger-related items. On an adjusted basis, gross margin was 57.8%, down 230 basis points for the quarter. Unfavorable product mix and foreign exchange impact offset the benefits of savings from the global efficiency program and favorable product pricing. 
Reported SG&A expenses, which include R&D, was $379.1 million, up $114.8 million or 43.4% versus last year. This equates to 40.4% of sales, excluding precious metals, 160 basis points below prior year. The decrease was primarily the result of Sirona's lower operating expense rate and savings from the global efficiency program, partially offset by increased amortization expense and other costs related to the merger. Adjusted for non-GAAP items, including amortization expense and other costs related to the merger, SG&A expense was $348.3 million or 37% of sales, excluding precious metals, representing a 200 basis point improvement. This ratio was largely unaffected by FX. Restructuring expenses were $7.9 million, up from $6.6 million last year. 
In total, GAAP operating income was $126.6 million, up $28 million or 28.4% from last year. Excluding the non-GAAP items set forth in our non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted operating margin was 20.8%, down 20 basis points compared to the 21% last year. Margins benefited from the positive impacts of the global efficiency programs and the consolidation of Sirona. FX had a negative impact of approximately 50 basis points on the rate. 
Net interest expense for the third quarter was $7.9 million, $1.3 million lower than prior year. Other expense in the third quarter was $1.6 million, a swing from a net gain of $3.8 million in the prior year. This $5.4 million negative impact is driven by changes in gains and losses from currency transaction and hedges. 
For the 3 months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded U.S. GAAP income tax expense of $24.8 million versus $19.6 million last year. During Q3, the company recorded $5.1 million of tax expense related to these pretax matters. Excluding these pretax matters, the company's effective tax rate was 17.8%. The Q3 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by an update of our annual estimated tax rate. It includes the combined benefit of the first 3 quarters. After completing major steps of our integration, we now anticipate our annual effective tax rate to be 21%. 
Q3 U.S. GAAP net income attributable to DENTSPLY SIRONA was $92.5 million, up 9.5% from the prior year. Third quarter 2016 diluted GAAP EPS was $0.39 compared to $0.59 in the prior year. Adjusted non-GAAP net income grew 65.9% to $155.6 million. Adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.66, the same as last year. Net income growth was offset by the impact of additional share issuance related to the merger. For a reconciliation of GAAP EPS to non-GAAP adjusted EPS, please see our earnings press release. 
Cash flow from operating activities during the third quarter was $152.9 million compared to $159.7 million last year. Q3 2016 operating cash flows were negatively impacted by increases in working capital versus the reduction of working capital in Q3 2015. The single biggest item was related to the timing of customer payments, which we only received in early October. 
Cash used in investing activities was $379.7 million compared to a source of cash of $36.2 million in the prior year. The primary driver of the change was the cash paid for MIS Implants. Cash flow from financing activities was $237.1 million inflow versus an outflow of $55.4 million last year. 
In Q3 2016, we returned close to $113 million to our shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. We paid $419 million of long-term and short-term borrowings, and we had proceeds of $760 million from long-term borrowings. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $330.7 million. 
On October 27, subsequent to the quarter end, we issued EUR 350 million of private placement notes with tenors between 8 and 15 years and a weighted average interest rate of 1.4%. The proceeds were used to repay $375 million drawn under our revolving credit facility. 
Now turning to guidance. For fiscal 2016, we now expect adjusted non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.75 to $2.80 versus our previous range of $2.70 to $2.80. Our guidance includes the following key inputs: so far, we have been expecting constant currency sales growth in the range of 4% to 6% and internal sales growth of 3% to 5%. At current exchange rates, this would translate to reported revenues, excluding precious metals, of approximately $3.73 billion to $3.81 billion. We now expect our revenues to be at the low end of the previously expressed range. This implies a return to mid-single-digit growth in Q4. We expect adjusted operating income margins in the range of 21% to 22%. We anticipate our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 21%. The EPS range implies a full year share count of $220 million to 225 million fully diluted shares and FX headwinds in the range of $0.08 to $0.10. 
I will now turn the call back to Jeff. Jeff?"

We have differentiated ourselves through quality, innovation and putting the customer first. Our goal is to build upon our legacy in this very attractive market. We have an extraordinary opportunity to make a significant impact in the dental market, which will drive our growth. The dental market is growing, supported by sustainable long-term demographic trends. In developed markets, an aging population is retaining more of their natural teeth. In emerging economies, the growing middle class is demanding more dental care. A significant part of our market is private pay. Short-term consumer behavior can impact the quarter or product mix, but dental care is rarely postponed long. And we do not face the uncertainty associated with other health care reimbursement systems. Furthermore, oral health is continuously proving to be more important to overall health. 
From a cost-benefit perspective, individuals and governments alike get significant return on their investment in dental. All of these factors make dental an attractive space. 
There are other megatrends like general practitioners taking on additional procedures, the digitization of dentistry, single-visit dentistry and the increasing demand for integrated workflow solutions. All of these developments are growing faster than the market. DENTSPLY SIRONA was created to accelerate these trends. We are well positioned to benefit from this. 
I am pleased to see how well our organization has come together over the last 9 months. Our focus on culture is paying off. I've always believed that getting the culture right is the most decisive factor of the long-term success of the merger. We continue to invest the time, resources and people to create a winning and extraordinary culture. We've trained over 200 culture champions and launched cultural workshops across the globe. We introduced new branding to our customers. We are now beginning to accelerate integration activities. 
In the third quarter, we truly began laying the groundwork for accelerating growth. We launched new products and initiated key revenue synergy work streams. In August, over 4,000 dental professionals attended SIROWORLD in Orlando, Florida. This was the very first DENTSPLY SIRONA event in the U.S. The market was presented with the DENTSPLY SIRONA brand and the power of our end-to-end integrated solutions. SIROWORLD was unlike any event in the past. Educational tracks spanned across all general and specialty procedures. Dentists got trained on our leading technology and saw how they connect to each other. DENTSPLY SIRONA is the only company that can offer dental professionals true end-to-end integrated solutions. 
Our CEREC Zirconia package continues to accelerate adoption of CAD/CAM. The ability through zirconia chairside is expanding our market opportunity. New users are driving this growth. They are also becoming customers of our chairside materials, like CELTRA. We have a significant opportunity to capture share in this market. We are also seeing increased demand for our ORTHOPHOS SL. 3D adoption is increasing rapidly. Our merger is clearly helping drive demand for digital dentistry. 
Our investments in R&D will continue to deliver differentiated solutions. These will drive demand for our products and accelerate our growth. We are in the very early stages of rolling out some of these solutions. 
In the U.S., we launched the new Midwest E Plus series of electric handpieces. This new instrument is yet another example of one of the many revenue synergies. With our E Plus series, we are able to leverage our world-class German engineering and manufacturing with our leading U.S. Midwest brand and sales force. For years, electric instruments have been standard of care outside the U.S. Today, electric represents only 15% of the market. With this synergy, we can take advantage of the growing trend in the largest market in the world. Early indications are that the Midwest E Plus is a winner. 
Cross-selling and collaboration will also be critical to our success. Our lab business is a perfect example of how DENTSPLY SIRONA coming together will accelerate growth. By combining consumables, equipment and services, we can address all the needs of the lab. We are in a much stronger position together. Now that the business has been transformed, it is poised to gain market share. 
The strength in our organization for accelerating growth, we have been ramping up our country consolidation activities. These activities leverage our infrastructure and improve efficiencies. In October, we initiated actions to reorganize and combine portions of manufacturing, logistics and distribution. By reducing complexity, we can encourage collaboration and promote one DENTSPLY SIRONA brand. 
All of these actions will deliver significant cost savings and position the company best in the future. To date, we have been reinvesting a lot of the savings into investments that will generate growth. As we move ahead, we expect more of the savings to drop to the bottom line. 
We have been continuously investing in our sales and service infrastructure. We began investing over a year ago, and that's continued. It typically takes 12 to 18 months to fully ramp up these sales resources. We are just beginning to see the benefits of these investments. We expect them to become larger contributors as we head into 2017. 
Overall, I am very pleased with where DENTSPLY SIRONA is positioned today. We are executing on our cost and revenue synergy targets. We are investing in R&D and sales and service to accelerate growth. We are excited about our new product offerings. We are also looking forward to introducing even more products at the International Dental Show in March. We expect to finish the year strong. We will accelerate growth in the fourth quarter. With the innovations we can offer today and our ideas for treating patients in the future, we are enabling dental professionals to improve, change and save lives. 
I'd like to thank our customers for their loyal support, trust and enthusiasm for DENTSPLY SIRONA. We're pleased to recognize our distribution partners for their support. I'd also like to extend a special thanks to our employees who daily show their commitment to improve the lives of dental professionals and their patients. Together, we will change dentistry for the better. 
We will now address your questions. Operator, please proceed."

I would tell you that intraoral continues to be slow, so you're not seeing the type of purchases by the manufacturers that we have in the past. But again, if you look at our overall business in its totality, we grew 6% in that prior quarter. And overall, the equipment a year ago was up 18%. In this type of market, you can still do well, but it's muted with what happened.

So we've had a product for years in each one of these segment areas, whether it be on the digital impression only, all the way up to the practice lab. And so that has certainly run the gamut. I -- we have seen more activity in the DI, which, on an overall basis, would lower the ASP in that category, but we see much more sales on the chairside because it's a much more compelling proposition for the dental professional and certainly, the patient that they serve. And so the big winner for us continues to be chairside with the MC XL in full functionality. That being said, we did run a promotion on our DI, which lowered the ASP to just under 30,000. But keep in mind that when you think about all of the functionality we're adding to the system, with the speed fire and what zirconia can do, we're now allowing a dentist to do chairside, which they always relied on the lab. Zirconia is the #1 material used by dentists for restorative, and we're allowing that to happen chairside. And that's a bigger deal, and that's a big trend. And that's just getting started. That's early days for us, and we're very excited about that. We're also very excited about our CELTRA Duo and what that offers and taking care of the dental professionals. So I -- you're right. There is more interest in DI than we've seen in the past. But DENTSPLY SIRONA is getting their fair share there, although we continue to see the best value proposition for the dental professional being chairside."

And certainly, it's what we looked at when we first put our guidance together, so we're able to look at areas where, if it were, to be able to have an impact on it. That's why you spend so much time the first 6 months really planning and stabilizing your organization to be able to be focused on driving our growth, meeting our guidance expectations, but then also preparing ourselves to be able to do the heavy lifting of integration. And certainly, you saw in -- with our tax today that we had a synergy, which came from the proper planning with the tax team that was able to do that. We felt confident that we were executing at a high enough level that we raise the bottom of our guidance range by $0.05, which is significant. And we also -- when we look forward to the fourth quarter, we have metrics that give us confidence about the revenue synergies that we will be able to execute on over the next few months. And certainly, you have to keep that 2 things separate from the ongoing process of integration and the restructuring, and that's one, having your sales force focused. We're going into this. We're very clear about that. We broke it down into 5 RCO regions. Actually have the regions reporting it to me, so I get a lot of visibility. We have a team that is focused on giving us the insight on where the revenue synergies are coming from. Keep in mind, we talked about that we had close to 200 work streams. We've now been whittling that down to the ones that are working best. We were able to deal with the SIROWORLD, which we saw -- the whole management team was able to see what's capable and isolated to an area. And then the other part, which is so important, is that it doesn't disrupt our ability to innovate and bring products to market faster. We have not seen anything with regard to the integration slow our product cycle, which is critical, especially as we get to the point of readying ourselves for an IDS for next year. Yes, we talked about that this merger was all about growth.

This was our second full quarter together following the historic merger of DENTSPLY and SIRONA. As anticipated at the time, there are vast synergies on both the cost side, and more importantly, the revenue side. We have spent the last 6 months focused on bringing the cultures together and doing the required planning for enhancing our value proposition to the customer and also streamlining our cost structure. We are now moving from planning to execution. This was evident at SIROWORLD in Orlando in August. There was a great interest in our end-to-end solutions and how we can enhance the customer experience and clinical benefits. I think it is fair to say SIROWORLD was a great success. As evidence of this, we have a record-setting rate of enrollment for our event next year in Las Vegas, indicating a very high interest in where we are going with DENTSPLY SIRONA. 
Our teams are fully engaged in finding and capitalizing on the strength of bringing the world's largest dental consumable and technology platforms together. This is important as our merger is all about growth. At this stage, I am pleased with the progress I'm seeing as we are beginning to execute on our plan. 
On the cost side, we had some early successes. As we move forward, there will be more activity, including some sizable opportunities in manufacturing, procurement, logistics and overhead. This quarter, you have already seen significant tax savings that have occurred as a result of the formation of the new combined company. We are on track as we progress deeper into the implementation phase. 
Turning to our results. The third quarter revenue came in a bit lower than we expected. Constant currency revenue growth was up slightly, driven by internal growth of 2.6% in Rest of World, up against a very challenging comparison. Last year, Rest of World grew 15.6%. Europe was up 1.2% on an internal basis. Both our technologies and consumable segments grew. We grew in both Northern and Southern Europe. Our U.S. business was down 3.2%, with declines in both segments. Our technologies business grew double digits a year ago. We benefited from CEREC 30 and the launch of treatment centers. Although end-users demand for our technologies remain strong, we were unable to grow on top of the 18% growth in equipment last year. In consumables, the combination of a soft summer and a change in dealer buying patterns led to the decline. Last year, we received typical strong orders ahead of our annual October price increase. This year, we saw significantly less activity. Overall, we see the U.S. market as stable. We believe that our growth will pick up in the fourth quarter. 
Our adjusted EPS was $0.66, unchanged from last year. Net income grew 66% and was offset by the increase in shares outstanding. Our net income benefited from a lower tax rate. When we structured the merger, we disclosed that there were multiple synergy opportunities to capture. I am pleased to report that our tax team has been supporting our integration activities, which has yielded some tax efficiencies. 
Before I turn the call over to Uly, I want to comment on our capital deployment. During the third quarter, we repurchased $100 million of our shares. Year-to-date, we have bought $700 million worth of our stock. I'm also pleased to announce that the board has authorized us to repurchase an additional 5 million shares. 
In September, we completed the acquisition of MIS. We can now address the faster-growing $1.5 billion value market. This is a great addition to our DENTSPLY SIRONA implant portfolio. 
In addition, we operate in a very fragmented market, where there is ample opportunity for more consolidation. Our balance sheet remains strong and gives us the flexibility to pursue multiple avenues to create value. 
Lastly, of course, we have continued to return capital to shareholders through our dividend. 
Overall, I'm pleased that where we are on our strategic initiatives and how our organization is coming together. Growth is a top priority for DENTSPLY SIRONA and a major reason for why we merged. We're positioning the company for top and bottom line growth. As you saw in the press release today, we are bringing the low end of our guidance range up by $0.05 per share, reflecting our continued confidence in the business model and our prospects going forward. 
I will now turn the call over to Uly, who will review our third quarter financials."
27504,406678676,1077075,"DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2016",2016-11-04,"Earnings Calls","DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will discuss our U.S. GAAP results as well as our non-GAAP adjusted results. As I walk through the earnings performance, I will also point out major impacts of merger accounting on our results. I",1068,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will discuss our U.S. GAAP results as well as our non-GAAP adjusted results. As I walk through the earnings performance, I will also point out major impacts of merger accounting on our results. 
In the third quarter, our reported revenue increased $305.3 million to $954.2 million, up 47%. Adjusted sales of our combined businesses, excluding precious metals, grew 0.4% on a constant currency basis. Internal growth was flat excluding an 80 basis point favorable impact from net acquisitions and the 40 basis points unfavorable impact from discontinued products. Foreign exchange movements were a tailwind to revenue of 40 basis points. As a reminder, these growth percentages reflect the performance of the combined business as if it had been consolidated on January 1, 2015. 
Jeff already addressed revenue growth by geography and segments. We have provided reconciliation tables for every segment and region that will help you understand how the GAAP reported revenue and internal growth come together. 
U.S. GAAP gross profit was $513.6 million, up $144.1 million or 38.9% from $369.5 million in 2015. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, excluding precious metal content, decreased by 400 basis points to 54.7% from 58.7% in the prior year. As you can see, on the non-GAAP reconciliation tables, the gross profit margin was negatively impacted by 320 basis points, mostly due to the effect of step-up amortization and other merger-related items. On an adjusted basis, gross margin was 57.8%, down 230 basis points for the quarter. Unfavorable product mix and foreign exchange impact offset the benefits of savings from the global efficiency program and favorable product pricing. 
Reported SG&A expenses, which include R&D, was $379.1 million, up $114.8 million or 43.4% versus last year. This equates to 40.4% of sales, excluding precious metals, 160 basis points below prior year. The decrease was primarily the result of Sirona's lower operating expense rate and savings from the global efficiency program, partially offset by increased amortization expense and other costs related to the merger. Adjusted for non-GAAP items, including amortization expense and other costs related to the merger, SG&A expense was $348.3 million or 37% of sales, excluding precious metals, representing a 200 basis point improvement. This ratio was largely unaffected by FX. Restructuring expenses were $7.9 million, up from $6.6 million last year. 
In total, GAAP operating income was $126.6 million, up $28 million or 28.4% from last year. Excluding the non-GAAP items set forth in our non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted operating margin was 20.8%, down 20 basis points compared to the 21% last year. Margins benefited from the positive impacts of the global efficiency programs and the consolidation of Sirona. FX had a negative impact of approximately 50 basis points on the rate. 
Net interest expense for the third quarter was $7.9 million, $1.3 million lower than prior year. Other expense in the third quarter was $1.6 million, a swing from a net gain of $3.8 million in the prior year. This $5.4 million negative impact is driven by changes in gains and losses from currency transaction and hedges. 
For the 3 months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded U.S. GAAP income tax expense of $24.8 million versus $19.6 million last year. During Q3, the company recorded $5.1 million of tax expense related to these pretax matters. Excluding these pretax matters, the company's effective tax rate was 17.8%. The Q3 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by an update of our annual estimated tax rate. It includes the combined benefit of the first 3 quarters. After completing major steps of our integration, we now anticipate our annual effective tax rate to be 21%. 
Q3 U.S. GAAP net income attributable to DENTSPLY SIRONA was $92.5 million, up 9.5% from the prior year. Third quarter 2016 diluted GAAP EPS was $0.39 compared to $0.59 in the prior year. Adjusted non-GAAP net income grew 65.9% to $155.6 million. Adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.66, the same as last year. Net income growth was offset by the impact of additional share issuance related to the merger. For a reconciliation of GAAP EPS to non-GAAP adjusted EPS, please see our earnings press release. 
Cash flow from operating activities during the third quarter was $152.9 million compared to $159.7 million last year. Q3 2016 operating cash flows were negatively impacted by increases in working capital versus the reduction of working capital in Q3 2015. The single biggest item was related to the timing of customer payments, which we only received in early October. 
Cash used in investing activities was $379.7 million compared to a source of cash of $36.2 million in the prior year. The primary driver of the change was the cash paid for MIS Implants. Cash flow from financing activities was $237.1 million inflow versus an outflow of $55.4 million last year. 
In Q3 2016, we returned close to $113 million to our shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. We paid $419 million of long-term and short-term borrowings, and we had proceeds of $760 million from long-term borrowings. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $330.7 million. 
On October 27, subsequent to the quarter end, we issued EUR 350 million of private placement notes with tenors between 8 and 15 years and a weighted average interest rate of 1.4%. The proceeds were used to repay $375 million drawn under our revolving credit facility. 
Now turning to guidance. For fiscal 2016, we now expect adjusted non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.75 to $2.80 versus our previous range of $2.70 to $2.80. Our guidance includes the following key inputs: so far, we have been expecting constant currency sales growth in the range of 4% to 6% and internal sales growth of 3% to 5%. At current exchange rates, this would translate to reported revenues, excluding precious metals, of approximately $3.73 billion to $3.81 billion. We now expect our revenues to be at the low end of the previously expressed range. This implies a return to mid-single-digit growth in Q4. We expect adjusted operating income margins in the range of 21% to 22%. We anticipate our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 21%. The EPS range implies a full year share count of $220 million to 225 million fully diluted shares and FX headwinds in the range of $0.08 to $0.10. 
I will now turn the call back to Jeff. Jeff?"

For over 100 years, DENTSPLY SIRONA has been a market leader in dentistry. We have differentiated ourselves through quality, innovation and putting the customer first. Our goal is to build upon our legacy in this very attractive market. We ha",1026,"Thanks, Uly. For over 100 years, DENTSPLY SIRONA has been a market leader in dentistry. We have differentiated ourselves through quality, innovation and putting the customer first. Our goal is to build upon our legacy in this very attractive market. We have an extraordinary opportunity to make a significant impact in the dental market, which will drive our growth. The dental market is growing, supported by sustainable long-term demographic trends. In developed markets, an aging population is retaining more of their natural teeth. In emerging economies, the growing middle class is demanding more dental care. A significant part of our market is private pay. Short-term consumer behavior can impact the quarter or product mix, but dental care is rarely postponed long. And we do not face the uncertainty associated with other health care reimbursement systems. Furthermore, oral health is continuously proving to be more important to overall health. 
From a cost-benefit perspective, individuals and governments alike get significant return on their investment in dental. All of these factors make dental an attractive space. 
There are other megatrends like general practitioners taking on additional procedures, the digitization of dentistry, single-visit dentistry and the increasing demand for integrated workflow solutions. All of these developments are growing faster than the market. DENTSPLY SIRONA was created to accelerate these trends. We are well positioned to benefit from this. 
I am pleased to see how well our organization has come together over the last 9 months. Our focus on culture is paying off. I've always believed that getting the culture right is the most decisive factor of the long-term success of the merger. We continue to invest the time, resources and people to create a winning and extraordinary culture. We've trained over 200 culture champions and launched cultural workshops across the globe. We introduced new branding to our customers. We are now beginning to accelerate integration activities. 
In the third quarter, we truly began laying the groundwork for accelerating growth. We launched new products and initiated key revenue synergy work streams. In August, over 4,000 dental professionals attended SIROWORLD in Orlando, Florida. This was the very first DENTSPLY SIRONA event in the U.S. The market was presented with the DENTSPLY SIRONA brand and the power of our end-to-end integrated solutions. SIROWORLD was unlike any event in the past. Educational tracks spanned across all general and specialty procedures. Dentists got trained on our leading technology and saw how they connect to each other. DENTSPLY SIRONA is the only company that can offer dental professionals true end-to-end integrated solutions. 
Our CEREC Zirconia package continues to accelerate adoption of CAD/CAM. The ability through zirconia chairside is expanding our market opportunity. New users are driving this growth. They are also becoming customers of our chairside materials, like CELTRA. We have a significant opportunity to capture share in this market. We are also seeing increased demand for our ORTHOPHOS SL. 3D adoption is increasing rapidly. Our merger is clearly helping drive demand for digital dentistry. 
Our investments in R&D will continue to deliver differentiated solutions. These will drive demand for our products and accelerate our growth. We are in the very early stages of rolling out some of these solutions. 
In the U.S., we launched the new Midwest E Plus series of electric handpieces. This new instrument is yet another example of one of the many revenue synergies. With our E Plus series, we are able to leverage our world-class German engineering and manufacturing with our leading U.S. Midwest brand and sales force. For years, electric instruments have been standard of care outside the U.S. Today, electric represents only 15% of the market. With this synergy, we can take advantage of the growing trend in the largest market in the world. Early indications are that the Midwest E Plus is a winner. 
Cross-selling and collaboration will also be critical to our success. Our lab business is a perfect example of how DENTSPLY SIRONA coming together will accelerate growth. By combining consumables, equipment and services, we can address all the needs of the lab. We are in a much stronger position together. Now that the business has been transformed, it is poised to gain market share. 
The strength in our organization for accelerating growth, we have been ramping up our country consolidation activities. These activities leverage our infrastructure and improve efficiencies. In October, we initiated actions to reorganize and combine portions of manufacturing, logistics and distribution. By reducing complexity, we can encourage collaboration and promote one DENTSPLY SIRONA brand. 
All of these actions will deliver significant cost savings and position the company best in the future. To date, we have been reinvesting a lot of the savings into investments that will generate growth. As we move ahead, we expect more of the savings to drop to the bottom line. 
We have been continuously investing in our sales and service infrastructure. We began investing over a year ago, and that's continued. It typically takes 12 to 18 months to fully ramp up these sales resources. We are just beginning to see the benefits of these investments. We expect them to become larger contributors as we head into 2017. 
Overall, I am very pleased with where DENTSPLY SIRONA is positioned today. We are executing on our cost and revenue synergy targets. We are investing in R&D and sales and service to accelerate growth. We are excited about our new product offerings. We are also looking forward to introducing even more products at the International Dental Show in March. We expect to finish the year strong. We will accelerate growth in the fourth quarter. With the innovations we can offer today and our ideas for treating patients in the future, we are enabling dental professionals to improve, change and save lives. 
I'd like to thank our customers for their loyal support, trust and enthusiasm for DENTSPLY SIRONA. We're pleased to recognize our distribution partners for their support. I'd also like to extend a special thanks to our employees who daily show their commitment to improve the lives of dental professionals and their patients. Together, we will change dentistry for the better. 
We will now address your questions. Operator, please proceed."

We -- and I have to tell you, I felt very good about what we saw on the CAD/CAM and on the imaging side, certainly much more of a focus on the 3D. I would tell you that intraoral continues to be slow, so you're not seeing the type of purchases by the manufacturers that we have in the past.

When we launched it, we've always been about CAD/CAM for everyone. So we've had a product for years in each one of these segment areas, whether it be on the digital impression only, all the way up to the practice lab. And so that has certainly run the gamut. I -- we have seen more activity in the DI, which, on an overall basis, would lower the ASP in that category, but we see much more sales on the chairside because it's a much more compelling proposition for the dental professional and certainly, the patient that they serve. And so the big winner for us continues to be chairside with the MC XL in full functionality. That being said, we did run a promotion on our DI, which lowered the ASP to just under 30,000. But keep in mind that when you think about all of the functionality we're adding to the system, with the speed fire and what zirconia can do, we're now allowing a dentist to do chairside, which they always relied on the lab. Zirconia is the #1 material used by dentists for restorative, and we're allowing that to happen chairside. And that's a bigger deal, and that's a big trend. And that's just getting started. That's early days for us, and we're very excited about that. We're also very excited about our CELTRA Duo and what that offers and taking care of the dental professionals. So I -- you're right. There is more interest in DI than we've seen in the past. But DENTSPLY SIRONA is getting their fair share there, although we continue to see the best value proposition for the dental professional being chairside."

Putting together the team, which we had a PMO, which is now an IMO, an integration office, that's working through all of the complex aspects of it from country formation to looking at how we become more efficient and effective and leverage ourselves. And certainly, it's what we looked at when we first put our guidance together, so we're able to look at areas where, if it were, to be able to have an impact on it. That's why you spend so much time the first 6 months really planning and stabilizing your organization to be able to be focused on driving our growth, meeting our guidance expectations, but then also preparing ourselves to be able to do the heavy lifting of integration. And certainly, you saw in -- with our tax today that we had a synergy, which came from the proper planning with the tax team that was able to do that. We felt confident that we were executing at a high enough level that we raise the bottom of our guidance range by $0.05, which is significant. And we also -- when we look forward to the fourth quarter, we have metrics that give us confidence about the revenue synergies that we will be able to execute on over the next few months. And certainly, you have to keep that 2 things separate from the ongoing process of integration and the restructuring, and that's one, having your sales force focused. We're going into this. We're very clear about that. We broke it down into 5 RCO regions. Actually have the regions reporting it to me, so I get a lot of visibility. We have a team that is focused on giving us the insight on where the revenue synergies are coming from. Keep in mind, we talked about that we had close to 200 work streams. We've now been whittling that down to the ones that are working best. We were able to deal with the SIROWORLD, which we saw -- the whole management team was able to see what's capable and isolated to an area. And then the other part, which is so important, is that it doesn't disrupt our ability to innovate and bring products to market faster. We have not seen anything with regard to the integration slow our product cycle, which is critical, especially as we get to the point of readying ourselves for an IDS for next year. Yes, we talked about that this merger was all about growth. And growth comes from our tremendous brand and product portfolio, our sales and service infrastructure, our clinical education and our ability to launch new products.
