1004106,323556746,930251,"Aramark, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2016",2016-02-10,"Earnings Calls","Aramark","Executives","Thanks, Ian. And good morning, and thanks to everybody, for joining us. As you saw in this morning's release, we reported a strong quarter and the year is off to a good start.

As you saw in this morning's release, we reported a strong quarter and the year is off to a good start. The consistent execution of our transformation strategy continues to deliver a combination of broad-based growth, as well as productivity improvement, both of which are leading solid margin expansion. Despite some modest incremental currency headwinds, our outlook for the year remains unchanged.
Looking at the quarter, adjusted earnings per share were $0.50, a 9% increase from last year on a constant currency basis. Total company organic sales were up 3%, and food and labor and SGA productivity gains facilitated an increase in adjusted operating margins to 7.1%, a 30 basis point improvement versus year ago. In the quarter, we also continued to reinvest in the business as we continue to support technology, capability and growth initiatives across the organization. Overall, the quarter was consistent with our expectations and it illustrates solid momentum and supported the multiyear growth and margin expansion goals we presented in our Investor Day in December.
As a reminder, at Investor Day, we committed to 100 basis point improvement in constant currency adjusted operating margins from 2016 to 2018. We have a very good line of sight on the food and labor cost reductions that will facilitate this margin lock, and while to a lesser degree, SG&A savings are also an important component. We expect to drive margin improvement over this time period while simultaneously reinvesting in the business, particularly in the area of technology as we continue to work to create long-term shareholder value.
I think our first quarter results demonstrate that achieving balanced sales growth, margin expansion and simultaneous reinvestment is possible when you have the right strategy in place and are actively managing the business. Going a bit deeper into growth, retention rates remain strong and are tracking consistently with our targeted mid-90s percentage for the year. North America organic sales were 4% in the quarter, led by sports and education with notable gains coming from new clients on boarding and strong play off activity. We also saw good growth across business and industry, leisure and healthcare and technologies.
Our international business grew organic sales by 2% driven by continued expansion in Europe, mid-single-digit growth in emerging markets, including strong high teens growth in China. Absent our previously disclosed exit from 2 small geographies in Latin America, which reduced the international segments growth by a couple of percent in the quarter, we saw consistent and stable growth patterns across our international business. Uniforms continues to benefit from our investments in capacity expansion, which resulted in organic sales growth of 4% in the quarter. 
We signed a number of new business wins during the quarter, including Capital One financial Corporation, Lincoln University, Highway Technologies in China and a new Odyssey aquarium in Scottsdale, Arizona. We look forward to our pipeline of new business as it remains encouraging, which I think bodes well for continued execution behind the multiyear framework. Also on the new business front, we had told you previously that we won the Yosemite National Park, the largest client win in Aramark's history. And we've made excellent progress in our transition plans for the March 1 start up, retained almost 100% of the dedicated Yosemite employees who will manage overnight accommodations, food and beverage operations, retail sales and a variety of other park activities.
We're extremely proud to welcome Yosemite to the Aramark family, and we look forward in the coming months with a number of innovations to make the consumer experience at the park even more memorable. Innovation remains an integral component of achieving the growth goals we've identified. Innovation buttresses our productivity improvement by cementing our Right to Win new clients and our ability to maintain healthy retention rates while also creating a more memorable experience for consumers. A few recent examples of notable innovation include our sports partnerships and ongoing focus on health and wellness. 
Following our World Series partnerships with both the Kansas City Royals and New York Mets, we continued to fuel championship performances across collegiate and professional sports, including being the proud partner with the 2016 NCAA football champions, the Alabama Crimson Tide and this year's runner up, the Crimson Tigers. Both of these universities have been entrusted Aramark for decades to fuel their students and student athletes to excellence in the classroom and on the field. In the NFL, 7 of our 13 teams that we proudly serve competed in the postseason, including our 15-year facilities partner and Super Bowl 50 champion, Denver Broncos, and we congratulate on an outstanding performance. 
Speaking of Super Bowl 50, for the second year in a row, we were selected by the NFL to manage the NFL shop, the primary Super Bowl retail store. Our 35,000 square-foot retail store was more than just a store and was designed to entertain fans while they shop featuring a VIP boutique and customizations section, as well as player signings, wine tastings and music. I want to congratulate our teams and our partners because we drove a double-digit increase and achieved record sales this year on the merchandise front. And we're already looking forward to next year Super Bowl in Houston where we'll manage the full lineup of food and beverage, retail merchandise and the facility services.
Coming up next, we're preparing for the NCAA March madness, where several tournament games and the final 4 will be played at Aramark venues. Turning to innovative offerings around health and wellness, our initiatives that we launched last year with the American Heart Association continue to ramp up. For February heart month, we kicked off the Eat Well challenge to engage consumers at locations across the U.S. and committed to making healthier eating choices. People who accepted our Eat Well challenge have a chance to win multiple, Healthy For Life prices like FitBits and juicers that go to them and/or someone they care about.
And to make it easier to eat well while dining with Aramark, consumers now look for our special Healthy For Life icon leaving them to choices with at least 1 full serving of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, or lean proteins, as well as few calories, saturated fat and sodium than the traditional choices. Turning from growth to our second strategic must, which is all around activating productivity to reinvesting growth and expand margins. Here we continue to drive meaningful improvement in operating margins through reductions in our food, labor and SG&A expenses across lines of business. 
During the quarter, we grew North American constant currency adjusted operating income by 8%, partially driven by a 30 basis point increase in North America AOI margin. Our international business delivered a 7% increase in constant currency AOI, as well as a 10 basis point improvement in margins. We also saw strong margin expansion across our South America, Mexico and China business and while uniforms AOI was down 3%, this was expected and relates our previously announced capacity expansion. Absent this temporary effects, we estimate the uniform margin growth would've been consistent with business at preexpansion levels and additionally, we expect this capacity expansion to subside as we continue throughout 2016.
Our focus on driving a cultural mindset around operational excellence to drive efficiency and productivity across our enterprise remains resilient. Our holistic approach to our operating models globally to address opportunities in food across supply chain, to lowering our cost of goods sold through procurement, distribution, as well as food production process continues. In labor, we're implementing a standardized in-unit labor model, as well as focus on overtime and agency labor. We also continue to streamline and simplify our above unit organization structure to ensure we've got clear roles and accountabilities that speed decision-making to create a better consumer experience.
Looking at our third strategic pillar, our people, last week, we are honored to join our partner at the University of Central Florida to open an innovative therapy Café, featuring a special harness system allowing people with traumatic brain injuries or strokes the chance to be mobile in the workplace. This creates a safe environment where they can focus on recovery, as well as practiced communication and cognitive skills and tasks. On a related note, we continue to earn recognition around the diverse and inclusive environment we provide to our employees. For the second year in a row, careers in Disable Magazine ranked Aramark amongst its top 50 employers by providing a positive work environment for people with disabilities.
Our recruiting efforts continue to focus on filling the talent pipeline with our on-campus recruiting initiatives, as well as continuing to source from a large pool of deserving military veterans. Before I turn the call over to Steve, one other topic, which warrants touching on given the level of uncertainty over the broader economy. And that is the resilience of our business model. There are many facets of our model that provide a second degree of resiliency in an economic downturn. Our diversified and blue chip client base reduces concentration risk and interestingly, no 1 client comprises more than 2% of our annual sales.
We also have a little over 50% of our sales derived from less cyclical healthcare, education and corrections clients, which adds just another level of stability. Our variable food and labor input costs allow us to really flex the business model to meet macro environment. And while I would add to my comments have no degree of prognostication regarding the trajectory of the broader economy, but as it relates to Aramark outside of energy, we have not noted any unusual disruptions in our clients, in our sales pipeline or more broadly across the business.
And as I've pointed out, our outlook for the year is unchanged and we remain encouraged with our prospects going forward. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve for a more detailed look at the numbers. Steve?"

As Eric mentioned, the first quarter performance was quite consistent with our expectations. Even though we are facing a generally, more uncertain global macroeconomic backdrop, we were able to make demonstrable progress against our longer term financial objectives without compromising our commitment to invest in the business. Furthermore, we augmented our already strong financial flexibility during the quarter in spite of choppy market conditions. 
Let me begin on Slide 4 with the sales reconciliation versus the first quarter of 2015. Sales on a GAAP basis were flat year-over-year at about $3.7 billion. Adverse currency trends in the form of a stronger U.S. dollar was the only significant reconciling item year-over-year as there was no material M&A impact. For us, the most significant drivers of the $113 million currency sales headwind in the quarter were the Canadian dollar, the euro and the Chilean peso, all of which weakens between low and mid-double digits on a year-over-year basis against the U.S. dollar. Organic sales for the company grew 3% in the quarter with positive contributions from all 3 reportable segments.
Slide 5 reconciles adjusted operating income year-over-year performance on a constant currency basis. Please note that as we have foreshadowed at the end of 2015, we've conformed our presentation of constant currency results to a format we believe is now more consistent with broader practice. We will no longer be adjusting prior-year reported numbers. In the center of the page, first quarter 2016 adjusted operating income was $262 million, approximately 4% higher than prior year's figure of $252 million. The $262 million recorded in 2016's first quarter includes $7 million of a currency headwind or about 3% versus the prior year starting point.
Therefore, on a constant currency basis, our adjusted operating income improved 7% year-over-year. Both in America and international FSS segments reported higher year-on-year adjusted operating income while uniforms was lower due to the planned capacity expansion work in the quarter on the West Coast of the United States. When complete, which should be by the end of the second quarter, we will have expanded capacity in this part of the uniform business by over 20%, which lays the groundwork for continued multiyear revenue and margin expansion in this segment.
Slide 6 provide the roll forward to help bridge our adjusted EPS year-over-year and as presented in the same format with that of adjusted operating income. Our adjusted EPS increased to $0.50 in the quarter versus the $0.47 we reported in the first quarter of 2015. Taking into account approximately $0.01 of currency headwind, this is a 9% increase on a constant currency basis.
Slide 7 summarizes our balance sheet position in the quarter. I'm very pleased to report that we continue to make steady progress, improving our already strong financial flexibility profile. Our quarter end liquidity remained strong with our cash position and undrawn revolver providing approximately $780 million of available liquidity. While the first quarter is a significant seasonal use of cash for us, free cash flow, which we defined as cash from operations less net capital expenditures, improved by approximately $85 million year-over-year and that was largely due to a combination of higher EBITDA and lower capital spending. The latter of which was largely timing related.
Our total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 30 basis points lower than prior year at 4.3x due to both higher EBITDA and approximately $270 million of lower debt levels thanks to the deleveraging activity in previous years. During the quarter, the company opportunistically issued $400 million of 8-year fixed-rate unsecured notes due in 2024. This will extend the tenor of our debt maturity profile as it's now the longest live piece of debt that we have and by the end of the year, it will allow us to reduce a commensurate amount of secured short-term financing that matures on 2019. You should expect that we will continue to take advantage of opportunities that present themselves regarding our debt maturity profile over the next several years. We continue to expect that our free cash flow generation in 2016, which is after we've adequately reinvested in the business will first be applied to servicing the dividend and then directed to further deleveraging.
Slide 8 details our expectations for 2016 and it should look very familiar from our last call. Other than a modest incremental currency translation headwind of an additional $0.02 per share at current rates, which we expect to absorb and offset within operations, our business outlook remains completely unchanged. We continue to expect adjusted EPS between %1.65 and $1.75 and corporate performance at least on par with our long-term framework. And as a reminder, our framework contemplates 3% to 5% annual organic sales growth, mid-to upper single-digit AOI growth and low double-digit adjusted EPS growth.
Q1 results were clearly supportive of this framework. The recent bond offering will not change our interest expense assumptions for the year, which should be consistent with 2015 levels. Our segment expectations for the first half of 2016, which is on the right-hand side of the page are exactly the same as what we told you in November. I have 2 comments related to the quarterly cadence of year-over-year performance in the first half. The first relates to the timing of our Yosemite accounts start up. We did not invest as much as we had anticipated in the first quarter, which we'll push more of a plan investment into the second. We will essentially incurred the full cost of running the account during the entire quarter to ensure that we have a smooth transition while we only begin to record revenue in the last month for the second quarter.
Secondly, the recent weather events on the East Coast of the U.S. are likely to have cost us the equivalent of a service day or 2 across several of our lines of business in the quarter. So to conclude, I would reiterate our expectations for the first half and the full year remain completely unchanged from our earlier comments and consistent with our multiyear financial platform. 
With that, I believe Eric has a couple of closing comments."

I think as we shared at Investor Day, we commit -- we committed to rolling out a variety of tools and technology that will help us as we proceed down that path. Our investments in technology vary from trying to standardize our Global Field Financials, which is well in place. On the labor side, Kronos is an important scheduling tool. Again, we're fairly far down that path relative to moving from pilot to deployment. I would say where there's still a lot of work in progress is on the food side, whether that be with PRIMA Web, which helps with our food production process and then on the sales side, again fairly fully deployed with tools like Salesforce.com. So my simple answer I think would be if you look at the quarter, about half of our investment went into technology, the other half went into people and capability. And that will continue and I'd say we're fairly well deployed more in the labor tools and the work in progress on the food side."

And then basically, what's the glide path? It sounds like you sound -- you said that the margins were going to abate as the year -- the margin hedges are going to abate as the year went on. What does that look like? Do we get -- do you think we can see positive margins by 4Q? Or just some of your commentary around that will be helpful."

So I think specifically in the first quarter, a couple of different questions in there. Our exposure on some of the macro stuff in our uniforms business, energy clients and that sort of thing, I would not label as material, so and put that aside first. We clearly did get a modest benefit on year-over-year basis from lower diesel and fuel costs, probably a couple of million dollars on a year-over-year basis of their. The way I would describe the pressure that we had in the first quarter from the capacity expansion is for a period of time, we essentially are running 2 factories at the same time we're starting up a new factory and we've hired all the people and we turned it on, and running the equipment and in the process of transitioning the laundry from 1 to the other, the legacy factory is also up and running. And so you're incurring kind of a doubling of cost for a period of time related to that facility. And so that doubling of cost across the West Coast is what drove ultimately, the margins to be a little bit down on a year-over-year basis. We certainly, if you look at our guidance for the rest of the year, I would expect uniforms to be positive on the year-over-year basis in the second quarter modestly and then will get a to more traditional run rate in that business by the second half of the year as it relates to year-over-year margin improvement."

And then you'll start to see a reversal of that in the third and we would expect to be getting fairly typical profitability in that account as we get into the second and later part of the year."

So maybe you could give us a little color on how much is startup is labor and traditional startup versus how much is kind of unique startup from this particular kind of comfort you're having? And is that number even known yet? Or is it still up in the air depending on what happens with the challenge of the transfer of ownership for some of those brand names?"

First of all, I think we're very honored to have been chosen. It's a real privilege and certainly an honor that we take very seriously. I think as you think about the startup, the team has been working seamlessly with NPS to create a real seamless transition. The great news is unlike a lot of other more intensive startups, this one while it's big in terms of revenue, the degree of difficulty is actually a little bit easier relative to the transition. One of the big reasons for that is we have actually retained and hired about 90% -- plus percent of the employee base. So to your point, when we talk about startup costs, I would characterize as our start up costs are very traditional, investing in capability -- investing in capital and other improvements that are needed. And I wouldn't say there's anything of any significant relative to anything unique to use your term, relative to cost as we look at that. And again, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on some of the things that have been going on from a litigation standpoint. But rest assured, I think that the NPS and Aramark are going to be long-term partners. We continue to develop innovative programs and services that'll create a better experience for park visitors and I think you're going to find this is going to be a great, great client of ours and one that we are very happy to win."

We saw good growth in business dining, another big segment for us. We saw good growth in our healthcare technology business, which grew. So I think literarily across-the-board, we saw fairly significant growth. I think maybe with the one exception that I would call out, which would be corrections as you know, we exited a client that will impact us a little bit in the early part of the year. And then as you break down the international growth, again saw really good growth in Europe, led by Germany and Ireland and Spain. That was offset by some of the headwinds we we're experiencing with the U.K. offshore business. And then as you get into emerging markets, saw double-digit growth out of China as I mentioned. Korea was double-digit. Mexico was double-digit. And as we've talked, as we exit a couple of this unprofitable markets, they're a little bit of a headwind.

And so to the extent the third of that piece of the business, which is more of a traditional kind of cost plus our client interest type of a business, right to the extent there is deflation or inflation, we would not benefit or feel the pain associated with that. That would generally pass on to the clients account. So I would tell you not much is passing on one way or the other, thus far this year. The other 2/3 of that piece of the business, which is really on our own account obviously, we would get the benefit of deflation or lack of inflation and to the extent it ticks up, we would have to incur that on our own.

So my expectation sitting here is I think we will be more likely to attack near-term maturities given the size of that tower, and the fact that, that gives us more flexibility from a secured debt standpoint. But we will certainly look at the math as it relates to the notes that the next call down date as you would expect us to."

So for sure, we want to continue to delever the balance sheet. So absent something from a strategic point of view that gives us a compelling reason to assess whether we would want to spend some of our capital on there, which tends to be very episodic, obviously, and not totally within our control generally, anyways. Certainly in this fiscal year, you should expect us to continue to delever. You know that we've been very clear that we're targeting a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio somewhere south of 3.5x. And so we will need to take the cash we generate this year and apply that to deleveraging to move closer to that 3.5x number. And as we had said on Investor Day, to the extent that here's a strategically compelling opportunity for us in the market, we would certainly look at that. And to the extent we would pursue something, we would need to be confident that there was a very clear path for us to maintain progress around deleveraging on the longer term basis. We need to see how we get back on the path that we're currently pursuing. But short-term, the cash flow will continue to go to deleveraging, absent any additional alternatives."

As you saw in this morning's release, we reported a strong quarter and the year is off to a good start.

As you saw in this morning's release, we reported a strong quarter and the year is off to a good start. The consistent execution of our transformation strategy continues to deliver a combination of broad-based growth, as well as productivity improvement, both of which are leading to solid margin expansion. And despite some modest incremental currency headwinds, our outlook for the year remains unchanged.
Looking at the quarter, adjusted earnings per share were $0.50, a 9% increase from last year on a constant currency basis. Total company organic sales were up 3%, and food, labor and SG&A productivity gains facilitated an increase in adjusted operating margins to 7.1%, a 30 basis point improvement versus year ago. In the quarter, we also continued to reinvest in the business as we continue to support technology, capability and growth initiatives across the organization. Overall, the quarter was consistent with our expectations and it illustrates solid momentum and supported the multiyear growth and margin expansion goals we presented at our Investor Day in December.
As a reminder, at Investor Day, we committed to 100 basis point improvement in constant currency adjusted operating margins from 2016 to 2018. We have a very good line of sight on the food and labor cost reductions that will facilitate this margin lock, and while to a lesser degree, SG&A savings are also an important component. We expect to drive margin improvement over this time period while simultaneously reinvesting in the business, particularly in the area of technology as we continue to work to create long-term shareholder value.
I think our first quarter results demonstrate that achieving balanced sales growth, margin expansion and simultaneous reinvestment is possible when you have the right strategy in place and are actively managing the business. Going a bit deeper into growth, retention rates remain strong and are tracking consistently with our targeted mid-90s percentage for the year. North America organic sales were 4% in the quarter, led by sports and education with notable gains coming from new clients on boarding and strong play off activity. We also saw good growth across business and industry, leisure and healthcare and technologies.
Our international business grew organic sales by 2% driven by continued expansion in Europe, mid-single-digit growth in emerging markets, including strong high teens growth in China. Absent our previously disclosed exit from 2 small geographies in Latin America, which reduced the international segment's growth by a couple of percent in the quarter, we saw consistent and stable growth patterns across our international business. Uniforms continues to benefit from our investments in capacity expansion, which resulted in organic sales growth of 4% in the quarter. 
We signed a number of new business wins during the quarter, including Capital One Financial Corporation, Lincoln University, Highway Technologies in China and the new OdySea Aquarium in Scottsdale, Arizona. We look forward to our pipeline of new business as it remains encouraging, which I think bodes well for continued execution behind the multiyear framework. Also on the new business front, we had told you previously that we won Yosemite National Park, the largest client win in Aramark's history. And we've made excellent progress in our transition plans for the March 1 start up, retaining almost 100% of the dedicated Yosemite employees who will manage overnight accommodations, food and beverage operations, retail sales and a variety of other park activities.
We're extremely proud to welcome Yosemite to the Aramark family, and we look forward in the coming months, with a number of innovations, to make the consumer experience at the park even more memorable. Innovation remains an integral component of achieving the growth goals we've identified. Innovation buttresses our productivity improvement by cementing our Right to Win new clients and our ability to maintain healthy retention rates while also creating a more memorable experience for consumers. A few recent examples of notable innovation include our sports partnerships and ongoing focus on health and wellness. 
Following our World Series partnerships with both the Kansas City Royals and New York Mets, we continue to fuel championship performances across collegiate and professional sports, including being a proud partner with the 2016 NCAA football champions, the Alabama Crimson Tide, and this year's runner up, the Clemson Tigers. Both of these universities have entrusted Aramark for decades to fuel their students and student athletes to excellence in the classroom and on the field. In the NFL, 7 of our 13 teams that we proudly serve competed in the postseason, including our 15-year facilities partner and Super Bowl 50 champion, Denver Broncos, who we congratulate on an outstanding performance. 
Speaking of Super Bowl 50, for the second year in a row, we were selected by the NFL to manage the NFL shop, the primary Super Bowl retail store. Our 35,000 square-foot retail store was more than just a store, and was designed to entertain fans while they shop, featuring a VIP boutique and customization section, as well as player signings, wine tastings and music. I want to congratulate our teams and our partners because we drove a double-digit increase and achieved record sales this year on the merchandise front. And we're already looking forward to next year's Super Bowl in Houston where we'll manage the full lineup of food and beverage, retail merchandise and the facility services.
Coming up next, we're preparing for the NCAA March madness, where several tournament games and the final 4 will be played at Aramark venues. Turning to innovative offerings around health and wellness, our initiatives that we launched last year with the American Heart Association continue to ramp up. For February heart month, we kicked off the Eat Well challenge to engage consumers at locations across the U.S. and committed to making healthier eating choices. People who accepted our Eat Well challenge have a chance to win multiple Healthy For Life prizes, like FitBits and juicers that go to them and/or someone they care about.
And to make it easier to eat well while dining with Aramark, consumers now look for our special Healthy For Life icon, leading them to choices with at least 1 full serving of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, or lean proteins, as well as fewer calories, saturated fat and sodium than the traditional choices. Turning from growth to our second strategic must, which is all around activating productivity to reinvesting growth and expand margins. Here we continue to drive meaningful improvement in operating margins through reductions in our food, labor and SG&A expenses across lines of business. 
During the quarter, we grew North American constant currency adjusted operating income by 8%, partially driven by a 30 basis point increase in North America AOI margin. Our international business delivered a 7% increase in constant currency AOI, as well as a 10 basis point improvement in margins. We also saw strong margin expansion across our South America, Mexico and China businesses, and while Uniforms AOI was down 3%, this was expected, and relates our previously announced capacity expansion. Absent this temporary effect, we estimate the Uniform margin growth would've been consistent with business at pre-expansion levels and additionally, we expect this capacity expansion to subside as we continue throughout 2016.
Our focus on driving a cultural mindset around operational excellence to drive efficiency and productivity across our enterprise remains resilient. Our holistic approach to our operating models globally, to address opportunities in food across supply chain, to lowering our cost of goods sold through procurement, distribution, as well as the food production process continues. In labor, we're implementing a standardized in-unit labor model, as well as focused on overtime and agency labor. We also continue to streamline and simplify our above unit organizational structure to ensure we've got clear roles in accountabilities that speed decision-making to create a better consumer experience.
Looking at our third strategic pillar, our people, last week, we were honored to join our partner at the University of Central Florida to open an innovative therapy café, featuring a special harness system allowing people with traumatic brain injuries or strokes the chance to be mobile in the workplace. This creates a safe environment where they can focus on recovery, as well as practice communication and cognitive skills and tasks. On a related note, we continue to earn recognition around the diverse and inclusive environment we provide to our employees. For the second year in a row, CAREERS and disABLED Magazine ranked Aramark amongst its top 50 employers by providing a positive work environment for people with disabilities.
Our recruiting efforts continue to focus on filling the talent pipeline with our on-campus recruiting initiatives, as well as continuing to source from a large pool of deserving military veterans. Before I turn the call over to Steve, one other topic, which warrants touching on, given the level of uncertainty over the broader economy. And that is the resilience of our business model. There are many facets of our model that provide a second degree of resiliency in an economic downturn. Our diversified and blue chip client base reduces concentration risk and interestingly, no one client comprises more than 2% of our annual sales.
We also have a little over 50% of our sales derived from less cyclical healthcare, education and corrections clients, which adds just another level of stability. Our variable food and labor input costs allow us to really flex the business model to meet the macro environment. And while I would add that my comments have no degree of prognostication regarding the trajectory of the broader economy, but as it relates to Aramark outside of energy, we have not noted any unusual disruptions in our clients, in our sales pipeline or more broadly, across the business.
And as I've pointed out, our outlook for the year is unchanged and we remain encouraged with our prospects going forward. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve for a more detailed look at the numbers. Steve?"

As Eric mentioned, the first quarter performance was quite consistent with our expectations.

As Eric mentioned, the first quarter performance was quite consistent with our expectations. Even though we are facing a generally more uncertain global macroeconomic backdrop, we were able to make demonstrable progress against our longer term financial objectives without compromising our commitment to invest in the business. Furthermore, we augmented our already strong financial flexibility during the quarter in spite of choppy market conditions. 
Let me begin on Slide 4 with the sales reconciliation versus the first quarter of 2015. Sales on a GAAP basis were flat year-over-year at about $3.7 billion. Adverse currency trends in the form of a stronger U.S. dollar was the only significant reconciling item year-over-year as there was no material M&A impact. For us, the most significant drivers of the $113 million currency sales headwind in the quarter were the Canadian dollar, the euro and the Chilean peso, all of which weakened between low and mid-double digits on a year-over-year basis against the U.S. dollar. Organic sales for the company grew 3% in the quarter with positive contributions from all 3 reportable segments.
Slide 5 reconciles adjusted operating income year-over-year performance on a constant currency basis. Please note that as we have foreshadowed at the end of 2015, we've conformed our presentation of constant currency results to a format we believe is now more consistent with broader practice. We will no longer be adjusting prior-year reported numbers. In the center of the page, first quarter 2016 adjusted operating income was $262 million, approximately 4% higher than prior year's figure of $252 million. The $262 million reported in 2016's first quarter includes $7 million of a currency headwind or about 3% versus the prior year starting point.
Therefore, on a constant currency basis, our adjusted operating income improved 7% year-over-year. Both the North America and international FSS segments reported higher year-on-year adjusted operating income while Uniforms was lower due to the planned capacity expansion work in the quarter on the West Coast of the United States. When complete, which should be by the end of the second quarter, we will have expanded capacity in this part of the Uniform business by over 20%, which lays the groundwork for continued multiyear revenue and margin expansion in this segment.
Slide 6 provides a roll forward to help bridge our adjusted EPS year-over-year and is presented in the same format as that of adjusted operating income. Our adjusted EPS increased to $0.50 in the quarter versus the $0.47 we reported in the first quarter of 2015. Taking into account approximately $0.01 of currency headwind, this is a 9% increase on a constant currency basis.
Slide 7 summarizes our balance sheet position in the quarter. I'm very pleased to report that we continue to make steady progress, improving our already strong financial flexibility profile. Our quarter end liquidity remained strong with our cash position and undrawn revolver providing approximately $780 million of available liquidity. While the first quarter is a significant seasonal use of cash for us, free cash flow, which we define as cash from operations less net capital expenditures, improved by approximately $85 million year-over-year and that was largely due to a combination of higher EBITDA and lower capital spending. The latter of which was largely timing related.
Our total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 30 basis points lower than prior year at 4.3x due to both higher EBITDA and approximately $270 million of lower debt levels thanks to the deleveraging activity in previous years. During the quarter, the company opportunistically issued $400 million of 8-year fixed-rate unsecured notes due in 2024. This will extend the tenure of our debt maturity profile as it's now the longest live piece of debt that we have and by the end of the year, it will allow us to reduce a commensurate amount of secured short-term financing that matures in 2019. You should expect that we will continue to take advantage of opportunities that present themselves regarding our debt maturity profile over the next several years. We continue to expect that our free cash flow generation in 2016, which is after we've adequately reinvested in the business, will first be applied to servicing the dividend and then directed to further deleveraging.
Slide 8 details our expectations for 2016 and it should look very familiar from our last call. Other than a modest incremental currency translation headwind of an additional $0.02 per share at current rates, which we expect to absorb and offset within operations, our business outlook remains completely unchanged. We continue to expect adjusted EPS between %1.65 and $1.75 and corporate performance at least on par with our long-term framework. And as a reminder, our framework contemplates 3% to 5% annual organic sales growth, mid-to upper single-digit AOI growth and low double-digit adjusted EPS growth.
Q1 results are clearly supportive of this framework. The recent bond offering will not change our interest expense assumptions for the year, which should be consistent with 2015 levels. Our segment expectations for the first half of 2016, which is on the right-hand side of the page, are exactly the same as what we told you in November. I have 2 comments related to the quarterly cadence of year-over-year performance in the first half. The first relates to the timing of our Yosemite account start up. We did not invest as much as we had anticipated in the first quarter, which will push more of the plan investment into the second. We will essentially incur the full cost of running the account during the entire quarter to ensure that we have a smooth transition, while we only begin to record revenue in the last month for the second quarter.
Secondly, the recent weather events on the East Coast of the U.S. are likely to have cost us the equivalent of a service day or 2 across several of our lines of business in the quarter. So to conclude, I would reiterate our expectations for the first half and the full year remain completely unchanged from our earlier comments and consistent with our multiyear financial framework. 
With that, I believe Eric has a couple of closing comments."

So my simple answer I think would be, if you looked at the quarter, about half of our investment went into technology, the other half went into people and capability. And that will continue, and I'd say we're fairly well deployed more on the labor tools and work in progress on the food side."

So let me start with that. I think as you look at the performance of the various businesses, education, Sports & Entertainment led the way in North America. But again, I think the revenue connected with -- for example, strong playoffs, will vary a year-to-year but it's not a huge, huge contributor or a huge, huge headwind in any given year or quarter is the best way I would characterize it, if that's the core of your question."

And then, basically, what's the glide path? It sounds like you sound -- you said that the margins were going to abate as the year, or the margin headwinds were going to abate as the year went on. What does that look like? Are we -- do we get -- do you think  that we can see positive margins by 4Q? Or just some of your commentary around that would be helpful."

So I think specifically in the first quarter, a couple of different questions in there. Our exposure on some of the macro stuff in our Uniforms business, energy clients and that sort of thing, I would not label as material, so and put that aside first. We clearly did get a modest benefit on a year-over-year basis from lower diesel and fuel costs, probably a couple of million dollars on a year-over-year basis there. The way I would describe the pressure that we had in the first quarter from the capacity expansion is, for a period of time, we essentially are running 2 factories at the same time we're starting up a new factory and we've hired all the people and we've turned it on, and running the equipment and in the process of transitioning the laundry from one to the other, the legacy factory is also up and running. And so you're incurring kind of a doubling of cost for a period of time related to that facility. And so that doubling of cost across the West Coast is what drove, ultimately, the margins to be a little bit down on a year-over-year basis. We certainly, if you look at our guidance for the rest of the year, I would expect uniforms to be positive on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter modestly, and then we will get us to more of the traditional run rate in that business by the second half of the year, as it relates to year-over-year margin improvement."

It's been a major priority. As you know, the last several years, we've made significant progress to the tune of 50 bps or better performance year in and year out, each of the last 3 years. As Steve mentioned and as we mentioned in the comments, there is headwind due to capacity. That will subside, so I think as we watch the year unfold, you'll see margins improve and would expect them to be positive on a full-year basis."

So we clearly won't get all of that in the fiscal year, but we'll get most of the high season based on the -- when the park in the summer is within our fiscal year. But I would expect us to pick up or to incur a couple of million dollars of incremental operating cost without a lot of revenue to show for it in the second quarter.

First of all, I think we're very honored to have been chosen. It's a real privilege and certainly an honor that we take very seriously. I think as you think about the startup, the team has been working seamlessly with NPS to create a real seamless transition. The great news is, is unlike a lot of other, more intensive startups, this one, while it's big in terms of revenue, the degree of difficulty is actually a little bit easier relative to the transition. One of the big reasons for that is, we have actually retained and hired about 90% of the -- plus percent of the employee base. So to your point, when we talk about startup cost, I would characterize as, our start up costs are very traditional, investing in capability -- investing in capital and other improvements that are needed. And I wouldn't say there's anything of any significance relative -- anything unique, to use your term, relative to cost as we look at that. And again, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on some of the things that have been going on, from a litigation standpoint. But rest assured that I think the NPS and Aramark are going to be long-term partners. We continue to develop innovative programs and services that willl create a better experience for park visitors and I think you're going to find this is going to be a great, great client of ours and one that we are very happy to land."

So I think literarily across-the-board, we saw fairly significant growth. I think maybe with the one exception that I would call out, which would be corrections, as you know, we exited a client that will impact us a little bit in the early part of the year. And then as you break down the international growth, again saw really good growth in Europe, led by Germany and Ireland and Spain. That was offset by some of the headwinds we're experiencing with the U.K. offshore business. And then as you get into emerging markets, saw double-digit growth out of China as I mentioned. Korea was double-digit. Mexico was double-digit. And as we've talked, as we exit a couple of these unprofitable markets, they're a little bit of a headwind.

That would generally pass on to the client's account. So I would tell you not much is passing on one way or the other, thus far this year.

And so, absent something from a strategic point of view that gives us a compelling reason to assess whether we would want to spend some of our capital on there, which tends to be very episodic, obviously, and not totally within our control generally, anyways. Certainly in this fiscal year, you should expect us to continue to delever. You know that we've been very clear that we're targeting a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio somewhere south of 3.5x. And so, we will need to take the cash we generate this year and apply that to deleveraging, to move closer to that 3.5x number. And as we had said on Investor Day, to the extent that there is a strategically compelling opportunity for us in the market, we would certainly look at that. And to the extent we would pursue something, we would need to be confident that there was a very clear path for us to maintain progress around deleveraging in a longer term basis, right?

As you saw in this morning's release, we reported a strong quarter and the year is off to a good start. The consistent execution of our transformation strategy continues to deliver a combination of broad-based growth, as well as productivity improvement, both of which are leading to solid margin expansion. And despite some modest incremental currency headwinds, our outlook for the year remains unchanged.
Looking at the quarter, adjusted earnings per share were $0.50, a 9% increase from last year on a constant currency basis. Total company organic sales were up 3%, and food, labor and SG&A productivity gains facilitated an increase in adjusted operating margins to 7.1%, a 30 basis point improvement versus year ago. In the quarter, we also continued to reinvest in the business as we continue to support technology, capability and growth initiatives across the organization. Overall, the quarter was consistent with our expectations and it illustrates solid momentum in support of the multiyear growth and margin expansion goals we presented at our Investor Day in December.
As a reminder, at Investor Day, we committed to 100 basis point improvement in constant currency adjusted operating margins from 2016 to 2018. We have a very good line of sight on the food and labor cost reductions that will facilitate this margin walk, and while to a lesser degree, SG&A savings are also an important component. We expect to drive margin improvement over this time period while simultaneously reinvesting in the business, particularly in the area of technology as we continue to work to create long-term shareholder value.
I think our first quarter results demonstrate that achieving balanced sales growth, margin expansion and simultaneous reinvestment is possible when you have the right strategy in place and are actively managing the business. Going a bit deeper into growth, retention rates remain strong and are tracking consistently with our targeted mid-90s percentage for the year. North America organic sales were 4% in the quarter, led by sports and education with notable gains coming from new clients onboarding and strong play off activity. We also saw good growth across business and industry, leisure and healthcare and technologies.
Our international business grew organic sales by 2% driven by continued expansion in Europe, mid-single-digit growth in emerging markets, including strong high-teens growth in China. Absent our previously disclosed exit from 2 small geographies in Latin America, which reduced the international segment's growth by a couple percent in the quarter, we saw consistent and stable growth patterns across our international business. Uniforms continues to benefit from our investments in capacity expansion, which resulted in organic sales growth of 4% in the quarter. 
We signed a number of new business wins during the quarter, including Capital One Financial Corporation, Lincoln University, Highway Technologies in China and the new OdySea Aquarium in Scottsdale, Arizona. We look forward to our pipeline of new business as it remains encouraging, which I think bodes well for continued execution behind the multiyear framework. Also on the new business front, we had told you previously that we won Yosemite National Park, the largest client win in Aramark's history. And we've made excellent progress in our transition plans for the March 1 start up, retaining almost 100% of the dedicated Yosemite employees who will manage overnight accommodations, food and beverage operations, retail sales and a variety of other park activities.
We're extremely proud to welcome Yosemite to the Aramark family, and we look forward in the coming months, with a number of innovations, to make the consumer experience at the park even more memorable. Innovation remains an integral component of achieving the growth goals we've identified. Innovation buttresses our productivity improvement by cementing our Right to Win new clients and our ability to maintain healthy retention rates, while also creating a more memorable experience for consumers. A few recent examples of notable innovation include our sports partnerships and ongoing focus on health and wellness. 
Following our World Series partnerships with both the Kansas City Royals and New York Mets, we continue to fuel championship performances across collegiate and professional sports, including being a proud partner with the 2016 NCAA football champions, the Alabama Crimson Tide, and this year's runner up, the Clemson Tigers. Both of these universities have entrusted Aramark for decades to fuel their students and student athletes to excellence in the classroom and on the field. In the NFL, 7 of our 13 teams that we proudly serve competed in the postseason, including our 15-year facilities partner and Super Bowl 50 champion, Denver Broncos, who we congratulate on an outstanding performance. 
Speaking of Super Bowl 50, for the second year in a row, we were selected by the NFL to manage the NFL shop, the primary Super Bowl retail store. Our 35,000 square-foot retail store was more than just a store, and was designed to entertain fans while they shop, featuring a VIP boutique and customization section, as well as player signings, wine tastings and music. I want to congratulate our teams and our partners because we drove a double-digit increase and achieved record sales this year on the merchandise front. And we're already looking forward to next year's Super Bowl in Houston where we'll manage the full lineup of food and beverage, retail merchandise and the facility services.
Coming up next, we're preparing for the NCAA March Madness, where several tournament games and the Final Four will be played at Aramark venues. Turning to innovative offerings around health and wellness, our initiatives that we launched last year with the American Heart Association continue to ramp up. For February Heart Month, we kicked off the Eat Well Challenge to engage consumers at locations across the U.S. and committed to making healthier eating choices. People who accepted our Eat Well Challenge have a chance to win multiple Healthy For Life prizes, like FitBits and juicers that go to them and/or someone they care about.
And to make it easier to eat well while dining with Aramark, consumers now look for our special Healthy For Life icon, leading them to choices with at least 1 full serving of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, or lean proteins, as well as fewer calories, saturated fat and sodium than the traditional choices. Turning from growth to our second strategic must, which is all around activating productivity to reinvesting growth and expand margins. Here we continue to drive meaningful improvement in operating margins through reductions in our food, labor and SG&A expenses across lines of business. 
During the quarter, we grew North American constant currency adjusted operating income by 8%, partially driven by a 30 basis point increase in North America AOI margin. Our international business delivered a 7% increase in constant currency AOI, as well as a 10 basis point improvement in margins. We also saw strong margin expansion across our South America, Mexico and China businesses, and while Uniforms AOI was down 3%, this was expected, and relates to our previously announced capacity expansion. Absent this temporary effect, we estimate the Uniform margin growth would've been consistent with business at pre-expansion levels and additionally, we expect this capacity expansion to subside as we continue throughout 2016.
Our focus on driving a cultural mindset around operational excellence to drive efficiency and productivity across our enterprise remains resilient. Our holistic approach to our operating models globally, to address opportunities in food across supply chain, to lowering our cost of goods sold through procurement, distribution, as well as the food production process continues. In labor, we're implementing a standardized in-unit labor model, as well as focused on overtime and agency labor. We also continue to streamline and simplify our above unit organizational structure to ensure we've got clear roles and accountabilities that speed decision-making to create a better consumer experience.
Looking at our third strategic pillar, our people, last week, we were honored to join our partner at the University of Central Florida to open an innovative therapy café, featuring a special harness system allowing people with traumatic brain injuries or strokes the chance to be mobile in the workplace. This creates a safe environment where they can focus on recovery, as well as practice communication and cognitive skills and tasks. On a related note, we continue to earn recognition around the diverse and inclusive environment we provide to our employees. For the second year in a row, CAREERS & the disABLED magazine ranked Aramark amongst its top 50 employers by providing a positive work environment for people with disabilities.
Our recruiting efforts continue to focus on filling the talent pipeline with our on-campus recruiting initiatives, as well as continuing to source from the large pool of deserving military veterans. Before I turn the call over to Steve, one other topic, which warrants touching on given the level of uncertainty over the broader economy. And that is the resilience of our business model. There are many facets of our model that provide a second degree of resiliency in an economic downturn. Our diversified and blue chip client base reduces concentration risk and interestingly, no one client comprises more than 2% of our annual sales.
We also have a little over 50% of our sales derived from less cyclical healthcare, education and corrections clients, which adds just another level of stability. Our variable food and labor input costs allow us to really flex the business model to meet the macro environment. And while I would add that my comments have no degree of prognostication regarding the trajectory of the broader economy, but as it relates to Aramark outside of energy, we have not noted any unusual disruptions in our clients, in our sales pipeline or more broadly, across the business.
And as I've pointed out, our outlook for the year is unchanged and we remain encouraged with our prospects going forward. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve for a more detailed look at the numbers. Steve?"
1004106,323556746,930623,"Aramark, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2016",2016-02-10,"Earnings Calls","Aramark","Executives","Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. As Eric mentioned, the first quarter performance was quite consistent with our expectations.

As Eric mentioned, the first quarter performance was quite consistent with our expectations. Even though we are facing a generally more uncertain global macroeconomic backdrop, we were able to make demonstrable progress against our longer term financial objectives without compromising our commitment to invest in the business. Furthermore, we augmented our already strong financial flexibility during the quarter in spite of choppy market conditions. 
Let me begin on Slide 4 with the sales reconciliation versus the first quarter of 2015. Sales on a GAAP basis were flat year-over-year at about $3.7 billion. Adverse currency trends in the form of a stronger U.S. dollar was the only significant reconciling item year-over-year as there was no material M&A impact. For us, the most significant drivers of the $113 million currency sales headwind in the quarter were the Canadian dollar, the euro and the Chilean peso, all of which weakened between low and mid-double digits on a year-over-year basis against the U.S. dollar. Organic sales for the company grew 3% in the quarter with positive contributions from all 3 reportable segments.
Slide 5 reconciles adjusted operating income year-over-year performance on a constant currency basis. Please note that as we had foreshadowed at the end of 2015, we've conformed our presentation of constant currency results to a format we believe is now more consistent with broader practice. We will no longer be adjusting prior-year reported numbers. In the center of the page, first quarter 2016 adjusted operating income was $262 million, approximately 4% higher than prior year's figure of $252 million. The $262 million reported in 2016's first quarter includes $7 million of a currency headwind or about 3% versus the prior year starting point.
Therefore, on a constant currency basis, our adjusted operating income improved 7% year-over-year. Both the North America and international FSS segments reported higher year-on-year adjusted operating income while Uniforms was lower due to the planned capacity expansion work in the quarter on the West Coast of the United States. When complete, which should be by the end of the second quarter, we will have expanded capacity in this part of the Uniform business by over 20%, which lays the groundwork for continued multiyear revenue and margin expansion in this segment.
Slide 6 provides a roll forward to help bridge our adjusted EPS year-over-year and is presented in the same format as that of adjusted operating income. Our adjusted EPS increased to $0.50 in the quarter versus the $0.47 we reported in the first quarter of 2015. Taking into account approximately $0.01 of currency headwind, this is a 9% increase on a constant currency basis.
Slide 7 summarizes our balance sheet position in the quarter. I'm very pleased to report that we continue to make steady progress, improving our already strong financial flexibility profile. Our quarter end liquidity remained strong with our cash position and undrawn revolver providing approximately $780 million of available liquidity. While the first quarter is a significant seasonal use of cash for us, free cash flow, which we define as cash from operations less net capital expenditures, improved by approximately $85 million year-over-year and that was largely due to a combination of higher EBITDA and lower capital spending. The latter of which was largely timing related.
Our total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 30 basis points lower than prior year at 4.3x due to both higher EBITDA and approximately $270 million of lower debt levels thanks to the deleveraging activity in previous years. During the quarter, the company opportunistically issued $400 million of 8-year fixed-rate unsecured notes due in 2024. This will extend the tenor of our debt maturity profile as it's now the longest live piece of debt that we have and by the end of the year, it will allow us to reduce a commensurate amount of secured short-term financing that matures in 2019. You should expect that we will continue to take advantage of opportunities that present themselves regarding our debt maturity profile over the next several years. We continue to expect that our free cash flow generation in 2016, which is after we've adequately reinvested in the business, will first be applied to servicing the dividend and then directed to further deleveraging.
Slide 8 details our expectations for 2016 and it should look very familiar from our last call. Other than a modest incremental currency translation headwind of an additional $0.02 per share at current rates, which we expect to absorb and offset within operations, our business outlook remains completely unchanged. We continue to expect adjusted EPS between $1.65 and $1.75 and corporate performance at least on par with our long-term framework. And as a reminder, our framework contemplates 3% to 5% annual organic sales growth, mid-to upper single-digit AOI growth and low double-digit adjusted EPS growth.
The Q1 results are clearly supportive of this framework. The recent bond offering will not change our interest expense assumptions for the year, which should be consistent with 2015 levels. Our segment expectations for the first half of 2016, which is on the right-hand side of the page, are exactly the same as what we told you in November. I have 2 comments related to the quarterly cadence of year-over-year performance in the first half. The first relates to the timing of our Yosemite account start up. We did not invest as much as we had anticipated in the first quarter, which will push more of the plan investment into the second. We will essentially incur the full cost of running the account during the entire quarter to ensure that we have a smooth transition, while we only begin to record revenue in the last month of the second quarter.
Secondly, the recent weather events on the East Coast of the U.S. are likely to have cost us the equivalent of a service day or 2 across several of our lines of business in the quarter. So to conclude, I would reiterate our expectations for the first half and the full year remain completely unchanged from our earlier comments and consistent with our multiyear financial framework. 
With that, I believe that Eric has a couple of closing comments."

I think as we shared at Investor Day, we commit -- we committed to rolling out a variety of tools and technology that will help us as we proceed down that path. Our investments in technology vary from trying to standardize our Global Field Financials, which is well in place. On the labor side, Kronos is an important scheduling tool. Again we're fairly far down that path relative to moving from pilot to deployment. I would say where there's still a lot of work in progress is on the food side, whether that be with PRIMA Web, which helps with our food production process, and then on the sales side, again fairly fully deployed with tools like Salesforce.com. So my simple answer I think would be, if you looked at the quarter, about half of our investment went into technology, the other half went into people and capability. That will continue, and I'd say we're fairly well deployed more on the labor tools and work in progress on the food side."

It came from a combination of strong retention, a very good base business growth, some moderate pricing into that base business growth, and as we referenced in the comments, some strong new business wins. So let me start with that. I think as you look at the performance of the various businesses, Education, Sports & Entertainment led the way in North America. But again, I think the revenue connected with, for example, strong playoffs, will vary a year-to-year but it's not a huge, huge contributor or a huge, huge headwind in any given year or quarter is the best way I would characterize it, if that's the core of your question."

But I have to imagine things like fuel were at least a little bit helpful to you, but maybe merchandise costs, maybe some of the other key buckets that varied year-over-year? And then, basically, what's the glide path? It sounds like you said -- you said that the margins were going to abate as the year, or the margin headwinds were going to abate as the year went on. What does that look like? Are we -- do we get -- do you think that we can see positive margins by 4Q? Or just some of your commentary around that would be helpful."

So I think specifically in the first quarter, a couple of different questions in there. Our exposure on some of the macro stuff in our Uniforms business, energy clients and that sort of thing, I would not label as material, so and put that aside first. We clearly did get a modest benefit on a year-over-year basis from lower diesel and fuel costs, probably a couple of million dollars on a year-over-year basis there. The way I would describe the pressure that we had in the first quarter from the capacity expansion is, for a period of time, we essentially are running 2 factories at the same time. We're starting up a new factory and we've hired all the people and we've turned it on, and running the equipment and in the process of transitioning the laundry from one to the other, the legacy factory is also up and running. And so you're incurring kind of a doubling of cost for a period of time related to that facility. And so that doubling of cost across the West Coast is what drove, ultimately, the margins to be a little bit down on a year-over-year basis. We certainly, if you look at our guidance for the rest of the year, I would expect uniforms to be positive on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter, modestly, and then we will get us to more of the traditional run rate in that business by the second half of the year, as it relates to year-over-year margin improvement."

So we clearly won't get all of that in the fiscal year, but we'll get most of the high season based on the -- when the park in the summer is within our fiscal year. But I would expect us to pick up or to incur a couple of million dollars of incremental operating cost without a lot of revenue to show for it in the second quarter.

First of all, I think we're very honored to have been chosen. It's a real privilege and certainly an honor that we take very seriously. I think as you think about the startup, the team has been working seamlessly with NPS to create a real seamless transition. The great news is, is unlike a lot of other, more intensive startups, this one, while it's big in terms of revenue, the degree of difficulty is actually a little bit easier relative to the transition. One of the big reasons for that is, we have actually retained and hired about 90% of the -- plus percent of the employee base. So to your point, when we talk about startup cost, I would characterize as, our start up costs are very traditional, investing in capability -- investing in capital and other improvements that are needed. And I wouldn't say there's anything of any significance relative to anything unique, to use your term, relative to cost as we look at that. And again, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on some of the things that have been going on from a litigation standpoint. But rest assured that I think the NPS and Aramark are going to be long-term partners. We continue to develop innovative programs and services that'll create a better experience for park visitors and I think you're going to find this is going to be a great, great client of ours and one that we are very happy to land."

That was offset by some of the headwinds we're experiencing with the U.K. offshore business. And then as you get into emerging markets, saw double-digit growth out of China as I mentioned. Korea was double-digit. Mexico was double-digit. And as we've talked, as we exit a couple of these unprofitable markets, they're a little bit of a headwind. So I mean, it's really broad-based, as is evidenced by my comments."

So our experience year-to-date on food, I would say is generally pretty flat. I don't think we are -- I don't think we're actually in a deflationary environment in total, but we certainly do not have a lot of inflation at the same time. So if you think of the 75% to 80% of our business that is food-related, food is probably 40% or so of our cost of services in that part of the business. And so to the extent the 1/3 of that piece of the business, which is more of a traditional kind of a cost plus or a client interest type of a business, right, to the extent there is deflation or inflation, we would not benefit or feel the pain associated with that. That would generally pass on to the client's account. So I would tell you not much is passing on one way or the other, thus far this year. The other 2/3 of that piece of the business, which is really on our own account, obviously, we would get the benefit of deflation or lack of inflation and to the extent it ticks up, we would have to incur that on our own. But by and large, thus far very little to any inflation at all on the net or a gross basis thus far this year."

That, plus the fact that 50% of this business rests in less cyclical sectors like health care and education. The fact that the model itself is diversified, certainly helps, and then I think our ability to deal with some of the things that Steve mentioned, relative to inflation, gives us I think some very unique advantages. And so I think, if you go back in time, what you'll find is over time, both in good times and in more difficult economic times, the model is very resilient, relative to the margin structure and the overall profitability.

Certainly in this fiscal year, you should expect us to continue to delever. We've been very clear that we're targeting a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio somewhere south of 3.5x. And so, we will need to take the cash we generate this year and apply that to deleveraging to move closer to that 3.5x number.

I'm pleased to report another solid quarter, which as you saw in this morning's release keeps our outlook for the year unchanged. Strong in market execution of our strategy is delivering balanced and broad-based business momentum across the portfolio. In fact, both in quarter and year-to-date, all of our segments are showing top line growth, margin expansion and improved profitability. Our improved performance is also creating opportunity with regards to the strategic management of the business. Today's release include some commentary on our acquisition of a small Irish specialty food company, which brings a very strong European brand and new offerings to Aramark's portfolio. The release also includes references to our previously announced portfolio optimization efforts, including exiting from India and 2 small countries in North America, which are driving meaningful margin improvement in our emerging markets business. 
Four years ago, with trailing financial metrics and higher leverage, we might have been more hesitant to take some of these strategic actions, especially with the accompanying short-term volatility they create in quarterly results. But with the momentum and improvement in our financials and a good line of sight to our food, labor and overhead productivity goals, flexibility to act on strategic decisions like bolt on M&A and portfolio actions, only enhances our ability to compete and to create long-term shareholder value going forward. Looking at the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.39, an 8% increase from last year on a constant currency basis. Total company organic sales were up 1% and we're negatively impacted by about a point -- 1.5 from Easter holiday shift as well as the portfolio actions we took to exit unprofitable geographies and accounts. Actions again, that were consistent with our Investor Day comments as we focused on margins and returns. 
Productivity gains facilitated an increase in adjusted operating margins to 6.2%, a 30-basis-point improvement versus year ago. Consistent with last quarter, about half of our productivity gains were reinvested in the business as we continue to support technology.
[Audio Gap]
were strong, particularly in higher Education, including wins at Fuller University, the University of Louisville, Presbyterian University and State. Our international business grew organic sales by 1%. In Europe, we saw good growth in Ireland, Germany and Spain, offset by further declines in oil drilling in the North Sea. Emerging market business growth was strong led by double-digit growth in China, Korea and Mexico. Our new business wins were also strong in our international markets. During the quarter, we won the largest client in our German businesses history, the Cologne trade fair company. This is a 10-year agreement starting in January that will provide for the delivery of food service for one of the world's most prestigious event venues and is the sixth largest trade fair and an exhibition trading center in the world. 
Our uniform sector performance was equally positive. Uniforms continued to benefit from our investments in capacity expansion, which resulted in organic sales growth of 4% in the quarter. Another highlight of the quarter was the start-up of our 15-year of National Park Service contract at Yosemite, which I'm pleased to report has gone exceptionally well. I'd be remiss if not congratulating our entire leisure team for executing a very complex opening extremely well. We retained well over 95% of the roughly 1,000 plus legacy Yosemite employees, which we welcome to the Aramark family. We've been making enhancements to the facilities and upgrading technology to significantly enhance the guest experience as we head into the peak spring and summer season. As is the case at Yosemite, innovation across the entire business remains an integral component of achieving our goals. And let me turn to one of the more important innovation areas, health and wellness, and give you an update on our partnership with the American Heart Association. 
As part of our shared goal with AHA to improve the diet and health of millions of consumers, we've launched the next phase of our Healthy for Life 20 by 20 alliance that provides underserved communities with vital educational support. A new engagement program is currently being piloted in Chicago, Houston and Philadelphia that teaches people about a balanced diet and how to shop for nutritious ingredients to prepare healthy meals. The learnings will be used to scale the program nationwide and the impact of well-being will impact tens of thousands of families in communities most in need of this support. 
Looking at our second strategic pillar, capturing productivity, we continue to execute well. We saw gains in our base productivity across food, labor and overheads, which drove about a 60 basis point margin increase in the quarter. These gains continue to be driven by a focus on waste as well as reducing complexity across the supply chain to reduce food costs, while also reducing our labor costs to refocus on overtime and agency expenses. In the further reduction of overheads, we continue to expand our usage of zero-based budgeting processes. Productivity reinvestment and enterprise technology is and will remain an important catalyst in unlocking margin potential, including the deployment of our major tool investments. Kronos, our labor management tool, is now deployed in over 90% of our North America locations. PRIMA Web, our master menu system is installing in about 2/3 of our North America locations. Arriba, which is an SAP solution, is really still in the early stages. By month's end, we will be enabled in 30 pilot locations where we'll continue to refine our processes, tools and KPIs to ensure we have it right before broad launch. We're also making good progress in our MICROS installation, which is now in about 20% of our locations. Again, remember that MICROS is our point-of-sale system that facilitates our broader pricing strategy. 
Expect us to continue to expand usage in these tools in coming quarters and have good line of sight to capture our food, labor and overhead improvement that we identified at Investor Day. Now occasionally, we're asked about the pace of deployment in terms of executing more quickly, which is a very fair question. And I'd only point out that unlike a fast food chain or quick serve restaurant that has a consistent physical footprint, each of our 10,000 plus locations is unique and requires some degree of customization to optimize results. So we'll continue to approach the rollout in a measured way geared to our business and ensures we receive maximum benefit not only for us, but for our clients and consumers that we serve. In the second quarter, our productivity gains net of reinvestment told an increase in North America class and current see our adjusted operating income of 4%, which led to a 20 basis point increase in North America AOI margins. Our international business delivered a 6% increase in constant currency AOI and a 30-basis-point improvement in margins with particular strong margin expansion across South America. Uniforms drove a 9% increase in AOI, coupled with a 60-basis-point improvement in margins. 
So I think it's fairly evident that our relentless focus on cost and productivity is paying off across our businesses. Moving to our strategic pillar of people. In the second quarter, we garnered strong validation to ensure we're creating a Great Place to Work. Not only did we earn a spot on Fortune's most admired companies list, we achieved first-place ranking for diversified outsourcing companies. We also rank in the top 3 categories for all 9 criteria that the companies are evaluated against, including first place for innovation, global competitiveness and social responsibility. This honor is a testament to our 270,000 dedicated associates around the world who sell and serve with passion every day. Also, in the quarter, we were included in DiversityInc's top 25 noteworthy companies for diversity, which recognize our ongoing commitment to a diverse and inclusive workforce. So in summary, we had strong financial and operational performance in the quarter and we continue to be encouraged by our progress. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Steve for a more detailed look on the numbers"
1004106,332147249,981124,"Aramark, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, May 11, 2016",2016-05-11,"Earnings Calls","Aramark","Executives","Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone. I will start with the observation that our second quarter performance was largely consistent with our broader expectations for all of our segments. On Slide 4, let me walk through the revenue reconciliation versus",1418,"Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone. I will start with the observation that our second quarter performance was largely consistent with our broader expectations for all of our segments. On Slide 4, let me walk through the revenue reconciliation versus the prior year. We reported second quarter sales of nearly $3.6 billion in 2016. As you can see, this is essentially equivalent to the nearly $3.6 billion in sales we recorded in the prior year. Below the $20 million difference between the 2 years does round down to a negative 1% change on a GAAP basis year-on-year. The largest reconciling items between the 2 years is foreign currency. The stronger U.S. dollar in the current year reduced translated revenue from our international businesses by almost $70 million or 2%. Even though the U.S. dollar weakened a bit in the last month of the quarter, on average, it was 8% stronger than the prior-year period. In our case, both the Canadian dollar and the Chilean peso were down low double-digit percentages in the second quarter on average versus prior year. 
Moving down the reconciliation. We were recorded approximately $8 million in revenue from our Irish acquisition, which closed during the quarter. Consistent with our past practice, we will exclude significant M&A related revenue from our calculation of working results for the first year of ownership. We would expect ultimately to record approximately $50 million in GAAP revenue from this transaction by the conclusion of our fiscal year. Our organic revenue therefore, increased approximately $40 million in the quarter or 1%. There are several components worth delineating within this figure. First, the timing of the Easter in 2016 cost us about a day of service versus the prior year second quarter in several lines of business or approximately 0.5% for the total company. This will obviously, reverse in the second quarter. Second, the headwinds we faced along with many other companies from lower energy prices continued. In our case, this was another 0.5% of revenue and was spread across both our international and North American FSS segments. Finally, the specific portfolio optimization steps that we've announced over the last couple of quarters in both our North American and international FSS segments reduced revenue by a full 1% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. 
The underlying-based business therefore, grew approximately 3% which combined with a 2% of headwinds from Easter energy and the portfolio pruning, gives us a recorded 1% organic growth. As for our base business, specifically in our North American FSS business, we had notable revenue gains in our Sports & Entertainment and higher Education businesses. I would point out that while we started to serve Yosemite, as noted by Eric earlier, it did not have a material impact on the company financially in the second quarter. In our international FSS segment. Growth was broad-based with Ireland, excluding Invoco, China, Mexico and Korea, all recording double-digit gains. Our uniform segment continued it's very steady revenue trend with another quarter of 4% growth. 
Now let's move to Slide 5 to discuss the changes in adjusted operating income and our profitability during the quarter. In general, we continue to make excellent progress in this regard led by productivity initiatives and our strategic portfolio pruning actions. In the center of the page, second quarter 2016 adjusted operating income was $221 million, approximately 4% higher than the prior year's $213 million. However, we did incur a modest 2% currency headwind on earnings during the quarter, which is consistent with the revenue discussion of a few minutes ago. Therefore, on a constant currency basis, our adjusted operating income improved 6% year-over-year. Our margin increased to 6.2%, which is a record level of profitability for us as a company in the second quarter. All 3 segments reported robust improvements and adjusted operating income with North America FSS up 4%, international FSS up 6%, and uniforms up 9% on a year-over-year basis. 
Broad productivity initiatives favorably impacted all segments, while the portfolio actions benefited the North America and international segments. In addition, uniforms benefited from our expected bounce back and operating effectiveness as our West Coast capacity expansion project was completed as planned during the quarter. Slide 6 provides a roll forward to help bridge our adjusted EPS year-over-year and is presented in the same format as that of adjusted operating income. Our adjusted EPS increased to $0.39 in the quarter versus the $0.37 we reported in the second quarter of 2015. Taking into account approximately $0.01 of currency headwind, this is an 8% increase on a constant currency basis. Interest expense was flat for the quarter year-over-year and the adjusted net effective tax rate was consistent with the prior year quarter but slightly under 36%. 
Moving to Slide 7. I'll discuss the current state of the balance sheet for the moment. Our financial flexibility in a word is strong and continues to improve year-over-year consistent with our expectations. We ended the quarter with approximately $150 million of cash on hand and no draw on our revolving credit facility. Together, these provide over $850 million in available liquidity. Our leverage ratio as measured by total debt-to-EBITDA, improved nearly 25 basis points year-over-year in the quarter to 4.1x. And total debt declined year-over-year by $160 million. We recently renewed through 2019 our $350 million account receivable securitization facility with modestly improved economics. As a result, we have no significant debt maturities of any kind prior to 2019. Given current conditions, we are continuing to closely monitor the markets and we do intend to be opportunistic if the economics are justified to further extend the tenor of our debt maturities. 
Finally, year-to-date cash flow, while negative due to the seasonality of our business, has thus far shown a very nice improvement year-over-year from both higher earnings and better working capital performance. I'll now make a few comments regarding our outlook for the remainder of the year on Slide 8. Beginning with the full year expectations on the left, our adjusted EPS range for the year remains exactly the same as it's been, $1.65 to $1.75. Due to rounding, we have incurred $0.03 of year-to-date currency headwinds in the first 6 months. At current rates, we should have less of a currency headwind for the second half of the year than we faced in the first and modestly less than we anticipated last quarter. I would estimate approximately another $0.01 to go, which would be largely due in the third quarter. Our capital spending expectations for the year also remain unchanged. We would not expect to exceed 3.5% of revenue during the year. Our bond offering last quarter did not impact our interest expense assumptions for the year, which remained flat versus 2015, and we continue to expect a full year effective tax rate of between 35% to 36%, which is comparable to the prior year. 
Our free cash flow should be at least $200 million, which would be consistent with the earnings growth in the range above and clearly, our year-to-date performance gives us a nice start towards achieving this improvement. Our segment expectations for the second half of 2016 are on the right and you will see they're directionally consistent with our long-term algorithm expectations for broad base improvement in the business both in terms of revenue growth as well as margin expansion. All of our segments will show year-on-year growth in revenue in the second quarter. Our FSS North America segment will benefit from a full period of Yosemite revenue which should approximate $90 million in the second quarter. We expect growth in Europe and Asia will drive our international revenue segments. Uniforms will remain on its steady trajectory of recent years. For the company, we expect our portfolio optimization efforts will represent a 1% headwind on a full-year basis. Furthermore, at current levels, the energy sector will account for 50 basis points of headwinds for the year. And finally, as I mentioned earlier, currency headwinds are mitigating thus the current FX rates revenue changes from FX will present about headwinds that equal to about a half -- of what the experience in the first half of the year. Adjusted operating income should grow year-on-year in each of our segments in the second half, primarily driven by better productivity, and complemented by our portfolio optimization activity. This segment outlook is consistent with our full-year earnings guidance.

The multi-year framework I think remains very much intact from our perspective. Again, the good news is I think we're seeing growth across all reportable segments. There's no debating in 2016 that we're going to encounter some of this headwind both from a portfolio action and energy perspective. But as we look at the business again, the drivers of this business are retention that stays fairly steady at that mid-90% range. That's factual. Our base business is actually performing well which basically puts you back on the new business question. And I think the new business pipeline looks good. As I mentioned, in my comments, we expect to book north of $1 billion in new business this year. But it's really the on boarding of that new business that creates a lumpy quarter-to-quarter optics that we deal with. So I think as we look long-term, we're going to play our game. Again, we're confident in the algorithm, 3% of 5%. Having said that, we're going to run this business for the long-term and where we see end up opportunities to take rate of actions against the margin return to that we talked about in Investor Day we're going to pursue it."

Losses. But I wanted to see that you could give any more color on the Toronto loss. It seems unusual because they were moving from outsourcing to self-operated, where as I kind of had the feeling that generally it's a one-way street. Once they go to outsourcing, they kind of may be a shift between the players from time to time, but it's kind of unusual for it to go away from outsourcing. And then we were estimating this to be like a $0.02 impact in '17. Maybe if you could just give us some color there that would be helpful as well."

I mean, first of all Denny, I'm not going to talk about any specific clients. But what I would say is there is an industry dynamic where in some instances, business will convert from competitor to competitor. Or in some instances, it will convert from outsourced back to in source. So it's not a unique to a particular client phenomenon that in fact, does take place. I think again, as I said in our opening commentary, our Education business continues to perform very, very well through second quarter through the first half of the year and certainly as we look to the 4 Education clients that I highlighted as we on board those in September, we expect to continue to see that Education business performed like it has for us in the last several years. Again, I would just caution you that when you look at any of these social media posts or more notices, it's only one side of the story. So as you try to net out in a particular line of business, my caution would be in some instances there are new business wins that we have that we're actually unable to disclose because of certain agreements we have with clients. So it's very difficult to look at kind of what you're seeing in the media and draw any kind of long-term conclusions. That would be my one caution."

It's a combination of what happened relative to some wins in the business, coupled with our performance to drive per capita consumption, coupled with some of the things that have happened from a playoff perspective as well. We always get the NCAA this year. So we've had a very successful run. I think as we look at our sports entertainment business, you'll see continued performance that again in a given quarter-to-quarter lap might create a bit of a pressure. But I would say in the whole scheme of things not to hang your hat on any type of game scheduler a playoff schedule or special event schedule.

But I wouldn't want to overpromise how quickly we can make that happen. So as I said before, I think this started as promising. It certainly gives us a higher level of confidence that we can achieve a target we set out here at the beginning of the year. So much of our working capital a seasonal in the fourth quarter.

So if you look across the globe and take a little deeper, there will be geographies where we've grown faster each of the last several years from an international business is one of those. There'll be markets where they've grown faster. If you look at the North America breakdown, there are a couple of spaces where they play that we don't. One is in the GPO space. The other is the eldercare space. That I would say again, we are at very different phases relative to our strategic focus. And as I mentioned earlier, ours is going to apply a very strong return in margins. So as we make any decision, we are going to have that top of mind in this organization. Make sure our orientation is around profitable growth. And again, that's translating into us doing a few things I think that might be different just based on where each of the separate companies are in their evolution. So at the end of the day, I'm not going to obsess about any individual competitor. Our approaches to play our game and we have continued confidence in our ability to continue this growth and create shareholder value going forward."

I'm pleased to report another solid quarter, which as you saw in this morning's release keeps our outlook for the year unchanged. Strong in market execution of our strategy is delivering balanced and broad-based",1460,"Thank you, Ian, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report another solid quarter, which as you saw in this morning's release keeps our outlook for the year unchanged. Strong in market execution of our strategy is delivering balanced and broad-based business momentum across the portfolio. In fact, both in quarter and year-to-date, all of our segments are showing top line growth, margin expansion and improved profitability. Our improved performance is also creating opportunity with regards to the strategic management of the business. Today's release includes some commentary on our acquisition of a small Irish specialty food company, Avoca, which brings a very strong European brand and new offerings to Aramark's portfolio. The release also includes references to our previously announced portfolio optimization efforts, including exiting from India and 2 small countries in South America, which are driving meaningful margin improvement in our emerging markets business. 
Four years ago, with trailing financial metrics and higher leverage, we might have been more hesitant to take some of these strategic actions, especially with the accompanying short-term volatility they create in quarterly results. But with the momentum and improving our financials and a good line of sight to our food, labor and overhead productivity goals, flexibility to act on strategic decisions like bolt-on M&A and portfolio actions, only enhances our ability to compete and to create long-term shareholder value going forward. 
Looking at the quarter, adjusted earnings per share were $0.39, an 8% increase from last year on a constant currency basis. Total company organic sales were up 1% and were negatively impacted by about 1 point -- excuse me, 1.5 from the Easter holiday shift as well as the portfolio actions we took to exit unprofitable geographies and accounts. Actions, again, that were consistent with our Investor Day comments as we focused on margins and returns. 
Productivity gains facilitated an increase in adjusted operating margins to 6.2%, a 30 basis point improvement versus year ago. Consistent with last quarter, about half of our productivity gains were reinvested in the business as we continue to support technology, capability and growth initiatives across the organization. Overall, our constant currency adjusted operating income was up 6%. 
Looking at our strategic pillar of growth, retention rates were strong and remain consistent with our targeted mid-90s percentage for the year. Our new business pipeline is encouraging, and we're tracking north of $1 billion in new business wins for the year. North America organic sales were up 1% in the quarter, with the early Easter holiday creating about a half a point of timing headwind versus year ago. Our portfolio actions reduced sales by about 1 point, but are meaningful accretive to margin improvement going forward. North America new business wins were strong, particularly in higher education, including wins at Fordham University, the University of Louisville, Presbyterian University and Valdosta State. Our international business grew organic sales by 1%. In Europe, we saw good growth in Ireland, Germany and Spain, offset by further declines in oil drilling in the North Sea. 
Emerging market business growth was strong led by double-digit growth in China, Korea and Mexico. Our new business wins were also strong in our international markets. During the quarter, we won the largest client in our German businesses history, the Cologne trade fair company. This is a 10-year agreement starting in January that will provide for the delivery of food service for one of the world's most prestigious event venues and is the sixth largest trade fair and an exhibition convention center in the world. 
Our uniform sector performance was equally positive. Uniforms continued to benefit from our investments in capacity expansion, which resulted in organic sales growth of 4% in the quarter. Another highlight of the quarter was the start-up of our 15-year of National Park Service contract at Yosemite, which I'm pleased to report has gone exceptionally well. I'd be remiss if not congratulating our entire leisure team for executing a very complex opening extremely well. We retained well over 95% of the roughly 1,000 plus legacy Yosemite employees, which we welcome to the Aramark family. We've been making enhancements to the facilities and upgrading technology to significantly enhance the guest experience as we head into the peak spring and summer season. As is the case at Yosemite, innovation across the entire business remains an integral component of achieving our goals. 
And let me turn to one of the more important innovation areas, health and wellness, and give you an update on our partnership with the American Heart Association. As part of our shared goal with AHA to improve the diet and health of millions of consumers, we've launched the next phase of our Healthy for Life 20 by 20 alliance that provides underserved communities with vital educational support. A new engagement program is currently being piloted in Chicago, Houston and Philadelphia, that teaches people about a balanced diet and how to shop for nutritious ingredients to prepare healthy meals. The learnings will be used to scale the program nationwide and the impact of well-being will impact tens of thousands of families in communities most in need of this support. 
Looking at our second strategic pillar, capturing productivity. We continue to execute well. We saw gains in our base productivity across food, labor and overheads, which drove about a 60 basis point margin increase in the quarter. These gains continue to be driven by a focus on waste as well as reducing complexity across the supply chain to reduce food costs, while also reducing our labor costs to refocus on overtime and agency expenses. In the further reduction of overheads, we continue to expand our usage of zero-based budgeting processes. Productivity reinvestment and enterprise technology is and will remain an important catalyst in unlocking margin potential, including the deployment of our major tool investments. 
Kronos, our labor management tool, is now deployed in over 90% of our North America locations. PRIMA Web, our master menu system is installing about 2/3 of our North America locations. Ariba, which is an SAP solution, is really still in the early stages. By month's end, we will be enabled in 30 pilot locations where we'll continue to refine our processes, tools and KPIs to ensure we have it right before broad launch. We're also making good progress with our MICROS installation, which is now in about 20% of our locations. Again, remember that MICROS is our point-of-sale system that facilitates our broader pricing strategy. Expect us to continue to expand usage of these tools in coming quarters and have a good line of sight to capture our food, labor and overhead improvement that we identified at Investor Day. 
Occasionally, we're asked about the pace of deployment in terms of executing more quickly, which is a very fair question. And I'd only point out that unlike a fast food chain or quick serve restaurant that has a consistent physical footprint, each of our 10,000 plus locations is unique and requires some degree of customization to optimize results. So we'll continue to approach the rollout in a measured way geared to our business that ensures we receive maximum benefit, not only for us but for our clients and the consumers that we serve. 
In the second quarter, our productivity gains net of reinvestment drove an increase in North America constant currency adjusted operating income of 4%, which led to a 20 basis point increase in North America AOI margins. Our international business delivered a 6% increase in constant currency AOI and a 30 basis point improvement in margins, with particular strong margin expansion across South America. Uniforms drove a 9% increase in AOI, coupled with a 60 basis point improvement in margins. So I think it's fairly evident that our relentless focus on cost and productivity is paying off across our businesses. 
Moving to our strategic pillar of people. In second quarter, we garnered strong validation to ensure we're creating a great place to work. Not only did we earn a spot on Fortune's most admired companies list, we achieved first place ranking for diversified outsourcing companies. We also rank in the top 3 categories for all 9 criteria that companies are evaluated against, including first place for innovation, global competitiveness and social responsibility. This honor is a testament to our 270,000 dedicated associates around the world who sell and serve with passion every day. Also, in the quarter, we were included in DiversityInc's top 25 noteworthy companies for diversity, which recognized our ongoing commitment to a diverse and inclusive workforce. 
So in summary, we had strong financial and operational performance in the quarter, and we continue to be encouraged by our progress. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Steve for a more detailed look at the numbers."
1004106,332147249,981551,"Aramark, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, May 11, 2016",2016-05-11,"Earnings Calls","Aramark","Executives","Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone. I will start with the observation that our second quarter performance was largely consistent with our broader expectations for all of our segments. On Slide 4, let me walk through the revenue reconciliation vers",1422,"Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone. I will start with the observation that our second quarter performance was largely consistent with our broader expectations for all of our segments. 
On Slide 4, let me walk through the revenue reconciliation versus the prior year. We reported second quarter sales of nearly $3.6 billion in 2016. As you can see, this is essentially equivalent to the nearly $3.6 billion in sales we recorded in the prior year, though the $20 million difference between the 2 years does round down to a negative 1% change on a GAAP basis year-on-year. The largest reconciling item between the 2 years is foreign currency. The stronger U.S. dollar in the current year reduced translated revenue from our international businesses by almost $70 million or 2%. Even though the U.S. dollar weakened a bit in the last month of the quarter, on average, it was 8% stronger than the prior year period. In our case, both the Canadian dollar and the Chilean peso were down low double-digit percentages in the second quarter on average versus prior year. 
Moving down the reconciliation. We recorded approximately $8 million in revenue from our Irish acquisition, which closed during the quarter. Consistent with our past practice, we will exclude significant M&A related revenue from our calculation of organic results for the first year of ownership. We would expect ultimately to record approximately $50 million in GAAP revenue from this transaction by the conclusion of our fiscal year. Our organic revenue, therefore, increased approximately $40 million in the quarter or 1%. 
There are several components worth delineating within this figure. First, the timing of Easter in 2016 cost us about a day of service versus the prior year second quarter in several lines of business or approximately 0.5% for the total company. This will obviously, reverse in the third quarter. Second, the headwinds we faced along with many other companies from lower energy prices continued. In our case, this was another 0.5% of revenue and was spread across both our international and North American FSS segments. Finally, the specific portfolio optimization steps that we've announced over the last couple of quarters in both our North American and international FSS segments reduced revenue by a full 1% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. The underlying-based business, therefore, grew approximately 3%, which combined with a 2% of headwinds from Easter, energy and the portfolio pruning, gives us the recorded 1% organic growth. 
As for our base business, specifically in our North American FSS business, we had notable revenue gains in our Sports & Entertainment and higher education businesses. I would point out that while we started to serve Yosemite, as noted by Eric earlier, it did not have a material impact on the company financially in the second quarter. 
In our international FSS segment, growth was broad-based with Ireland, excluding Avoca, China, Mexico and Korea, all recording double-digit gains. Our uniform segment continued it's very steady revenue trend with another quarter of 4% growth. 
Now let's move to Slide 5 to discuss the changes in adjusted operating income and our profitability during the quarter. In general, we continue to make excellent progress in this regard, led by productivity initiatives and our strategic portfolio pruning actions. In the center of the page, second quarter 2016 adjusted operating income was $221 million, approximately 4% higher than the prior year's $213 million. However, we did incur a modest 2% currency headwind on earnings during the quarter, which is consistent with the revenue discussion of a few minutes ago. Therefore, on a constant currency basis, our adjusted operating income improved 6% year-over-year. Our margin increased to 6.2%, which is a record level of profitability for us as a company in the second quarter. All 3 segments reported robust improvements and adjusted operating income, with North America FSS up 4%, international FSS up 6% and uniforms up 9% on a year-over-year basis. 
Broad productivity initiatives favorably impacted all segments, while the portfolio actions benefited the North America and international segments. In addition, uniforms benefited from our expected bounce back and operating effectiveness as our West Coast capacity expansion project was completed as planned during the quarter. 
Slide 6 provides a roll forward to help bridge our adjusted EPS year-over-year and is presented in the same format as that of adjusted operating income. Our adjusted EPS increased to $0.39 in the quarter versus the $0.37 we reported in the second quarter of 2015. Taking into account approximately $0.01 of currency headwind, this is an 8% increase on a constant currency basis. Interest expense was flat for the quarter year-over-year and the adjusted effective tax rate was consistent with the prior year quarter, but slightly under 36%. 
Moving to Slide 7. I'll discuss the current state of the balance sheet for a moment. Our financial flexibility in a word is strong and continues to improve year-over-year, consistent with our expectations. We ended the quarter with approximately $150 million of cash on hand and no draw on our revolving credit facility. Together, these provide over $850 million in available liquidity. Our leverage ratio as measured by total debt to EBITDA, improved nearly 25 basis points year-over-year in the quarter to 4.1x. And total debt declined year-over-year by $160 million. We recently renewed through 2019 our $350 million accounts receivable securitization facility with modestly improved economics. As a result, we have no significant debt maturities of any kind prior to 2019. Given current conditions, we are continuing to closely monitor the markets, and we do intend to be opportunistic if the economics are justified to further extend the tenor of our debt maturities. 
Finally, year-to-date cash flow, while negative due to the seasonality of our business, has thus far shown a very nice improvement year-over-year from both higher earnings and better working capital performance. 
I'll now make a few comments regarding our outlook for the remainder of the year on Slide 8. Beginning with the full year expectations on the left, our adjusted EPS range for the year remains exactly the same as it's been, $1.65 to $1.75. Due to rounding, we have incurred $0.03 of year-to-date currency headwinds in the first 6 months. At current rates, we should have less of a currency headwind for the second half of the year than we faced in the first and modestly less than we anticipated last quarter. I would estimate approximately another $0.01 to go, which will largely be in the third quarter. Our capital spending expectations for the year also remain unchanged. We would not expect to exceed 3.5% of revenue for the year. Our bond offering last quarter did not impact our interest expense assumptions for the year, which remain flat versus 2015, and we continue to expect a full year effective tax rate of between 35% to 36%, which is comparable to the prior year. 
Our free cash flow should be at least $200 million, which would be consistent with the earnings growth in the range above and clearly, our year-to-date performance gives us a nice start towards achieving this improvement. Our segment expectations for the second half of 2016 are on the right, and you will see they're directionally consistent with our long-term algorithm expectations for broad-based improvement in the business, both in terms of revenue growth as well as margin expansion. All of our segments will show year-on-year growth in revenue in the second half. Our FSS North America segment will benefit from a full period of Yosemite revenue, which should approximate $90 million in the second half. We expect growth in Europe and Asia will drive our international revenue segments. 
Uniforms will remain on its steady trajectory of recent years. For the company, we expect our portfolio optimization efforts will represent about a 1% headwind on a full year basis. Furthermore, at current levels, the energy sector will account for another 50 basis points of headwind for the year. 
And finally, as I mentioned earlier, currency headwinds are mitigating. Thus, the current FX rates, revenue changes from FX, will present about a half -- headwinds that equal to about a half of what we experienced in the first half of the year. Adjusted operating income should grow year-on-year in each of our segments in the second half, primarily driven by better productivity and complemented by our portfolio optimization activity. This segment outlook is consistent with our full year earnings guidance. 
I will now turn the call back over to Eric for some closing remarks and advance of Q&A. Eric?"

The real pressure points in North America, I'd say, rest in, as Steve mentioned, as we've exited, in one instance, a large high profile corrections account as well as some -- a similar situation in health care. So I think as is typical in this business, and you've heard me talk about how lumpy it is, while we feel good both where we stand both in terms of new business pipeline in North America as well as some of the new business wins, the way in which we onboard that business, the timing of that, I think, has been a little different than maybe we had anticipated. So I'd say, those are the real variables driving the North America business."

And Gary, maybe I would just add the seasonality of our business does matter in terms of the percentage changes right around the sequential. So the dollar impact of things like the portfolio actions we've taken as low as the energy headwind is roughly comparable to first quarter and second quarter, but the revenue base that it's applied against is going to be much smaller in the second quarter just because of seasonality. So you end up with more of a percentage change just because the base is a little bit different in size."

The multiyear framework, I think, remains very much intact from our perspective. Again, the good news is, I think, we're seeing growth across all reportable segments. There is no debating in 2016 that we're going to encounter some of this headwind, both from a portfolio action and energy perspective. But as we look at the business, again, the drivers of this business are retention that stays fairly steady at that mid-90% range. That's factual. Our base business is actually performing well, which basically puts you back on the new business question. And I think the new business pipeline looks good. As I mentioned in my comments, we expect to book north of $1 billion in new business this year, but it's really the onboarding of that new business that creates the lumpy quarter-to-quarter optics that we deal with. So I think as we look long-term, we're going to play our game. Again, we're confident in the algorithm, 3% of 5%. Having said that, we're going to run this business for the long-term and where we see and have opportunities to take corrective actions against the margin and return screen that we talked about at Investor Day we're going to pursue."

I think, first of all, Denny, I'm not going to talk about any specific clients, but what I would say is there is an industry dynamic where, in some instances, business will convert from competitor to competitor, or in some instances, it will convert from outsourced back to in-source. So it's not unique to a particular client phenomenon that, in fact, does take place. I think -- again, as I said in our opening commentary, our Education business continues to perform very, very well through second quarter, through the first half of the year. And certainly as we look to the 4 education clients that I highlighted, as we onboard those in September, would expect to continue to see that Education business perform like it has for us in the last several years. Again, I would just caution you that when you look at any of these social media posts or warn notices, it's only one side of the story. And so as you try to net out in a particular line of business, my caution would be, in some instances, there are new business wins that we have that we're actually unable to disclose because of certain agreements we have with clients. So it's very difficult to look at kind of what you're seeing in the media and draw any kind of long-term conclusions. That would be my one caution."

And I think that combined with a very aggressive plan that Bruce Fears in our Leisure team had, has made that go exceedingly well. And so I think as we look at this, one of the things that we're spending a lot of time on across all of our lines of business is the whole concept of mobilization and startups. And so I'd say the answer to Yosemite question is it was a very successful transition, very seamless. And I'd say, going forward, I think we've got a much more comprehensive plan as a result of some of our learnings in the last few years to make sure we get businesses started up across various lines of business in a more proactive and effective fashion going forward."

We had about 1 month of revenue based on the start-up date and obviously, were -- or a couple of months of revenues, and we were fully staffed and invested going into the quarter. And so that drag will improve as the year plays out, and we will certainly be profitable on a full year basis by the time we get to the end of the year. And then on the uniform side, I think the easiest thing to do, they obviously had a rough first quarter based on their kind of historical performance in terms of just profitability on a year-over-year basis. And almost all of that underperformance versus their historical average, I think, you can attribute directly to the expansion project that we were doing on the West Coast. So I think that's the easiest way to quantify that for that line of business."

But from a cadence standpoint, this year, just looking at what has continued to transpire with energy costs, I think your premise is right. Third quarter will be a touch more of a headwind and then fourth just based on the way energy has broadly behaved, but it's also there is a lag I would remind you around our client decisions, and they don't react immediately to changes in the price as well. So I think for modeling purposes, I think it's best to just assume a fairly consistent headwind quarter-to-quarter on energy over the course of the whole year.

If you look at the last couple of years versus the competitor you mentioned, I think, in 2014, we grew faster. I think last year, they grew faster than us. So as you look across the globe and dig a little deeper, there will be geographies where we've grown faster each of the last several years. Certainly, our international business is one of those. There'll be markets where they've grown faster. If you look at the North America breakdown, there are a couple of spaces where they play that we don't. One is in the GPO space, the other is the elder care space, but I would say again, we are at very different phases relative to our strategic focus. And as I mentioned earlier, ours is going to apply a very strong return and margin filter. So as we make any decision, we are going to have that top of mind in this organization and make sure our orientation is around profitable growth. And again, that's translating into us doing a few things, I think, that might be different just based on where each of the separate companies are in their evolution. So at the end of the day, I'm not going to obsess about any individual competitor. Our approach is to play our game, and we have continued confidence in our ability to grow this business and create shareholder value going forward."

I'm pleased to report another solid quarter, which as you saw in this morning's release, keeps our outlook for the year unchanged. Strong in-market execution of our strategy is delivering balanced and broad-base",1454,"Thank you, Ian, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report another solid quarter, which as you saw in this morning's release, keeps our outlook for the year unchanged. Strong in-market execution of our strategy is delivering balanced and broad-based business momentum across the portfolio. In fact, both in quarter and year-to-date, all of our segments are showing top line growth, margin expansion and improved profitability. Our improved performance is also creating opportunity with regards to the strategic management of the business. Today's release includes some commentary on our acquisition of a small Irish specialty food company, Avoca, which brings a very strong European brand and new offerings to Aramark's portfolio. The release also includes references to our previously announced portfolio optimization efforts, including exiting from India and 2 small countries in South America, which are driving meaningful margin improvement in our emerging markets business. 
Four years ago, with trailing financial metrics and higher leverage, we might have been more hesitant to take some of these strategic actions, especially with the accompanying short-term volatility they create in quarterly results. But with the momentum in improving our financials and a good line of sight to our food, labor and overhead productivity goals, flexibility to act on strategic decisions, like bolt-on M&A and portfolio actions, only enhances our ability to compete and to create long-term shareholder value going forward. 
Looking at the quarter, adjusted earnings per share were $0.39, an 8% increase from last year on a constant currency basis. Total company organic sales were up 1% and were negatively impacted by about 1 point -- excuse me, 1.5 points from the Easter holiday shift as well as the portfolio actions we took to exit unprofitable geographies and accounts. Actions, again, that were consistent with our Investor Day comments as we focus on margins and returns. 
Productivity gains facilitated an increase in adjusted operating margins to 6.2%, a 30 basis point improvement versus year ago. Consistent with last quarter, about half of our productivity gains were reinvested in the business as we continue to support technology, capability and growth initiatives across the organization. Overall, our constant currency adjusted operating income was up 6%. 
Looking at our strategic pillar of growth, retention rates were strong and remain consistent with our targeted mid-90s percentage for the year. Our new business pipeline is encouraging, and we're tracking north of $1 billion in new business wins for the year. North America organic sales were up 1% in the quarter, with the early Easter holiday creating about 0.5 points of timing headwind versus year ago. Our portfolio actions reduced sales by about 1 point, but are meaningfully accretive to margin improvement going forward. North America new business wins were strong, particularly in higher education, including wins at Fordham University, the University of Louisville, Presbyterian University and Valdosta State. Our international business grew organic sales by 1%. In Europe, we saw good growth in Ireland, Germany and Spain, offset by further declines in oil drilling in the North Sea. 
Emerging market business growth was strong, led by double-digit growth in China, Korea and Mexico. Our new business wins were also strong in our international markets. During the quarter, we won the largest client in our German business' history, the Cologne trade fair company. This is a 10-year agreement starting in January that will provide for the delivery of food service for one of the world's most prestigious event venues and is the sixth-largest trade fair and exhibition convention center in the world. 
Our uniform sector performance was equally positive. Uniforms continued to benefit from our investments in capacity expansion, which resulted in organic sales growth of 4% in the quarter. Another highlight of the quarter was the start-up of our 15-year National Park Service contract at Yosemite, which I'm pleased to report has gone exceptionally well. I'd be remiss if not congratulating our entire Leisure team for executing a very complex opening extremely well. We retained well over 95% of the roughly 1,000-plus legacy Yosemite employees, which we welcome to the Aramark family. We've been making enhancements to the facilities and upgrading technology to significantly enhance the guest experience as we head into the peak spring and summer season. As is the case at Yosemite, innovation across the entire business remains an integral component of achieving our goals. 
And let me turn to one of the more important innovation areas, health and wellness, and give you an update on our partnership with the American Heart Association. As part of our shared goal with AHA to improve the diet and health of millions of consumers, we've launched the next phase of our Healthy for Life 20 by 20 alliance that provides underserved communities with vital educational support. A new engagement program is currently being piloted in Chicago, Houston and Philadelphia, that teaches people about a balanced diet and how to shop for nutritious ingredients to prepare healthy meals. The learnings will be used to scale the program nationwide and the impact of well-being will impact tens of thousands of families in communities most in need of this support. 
Looking at our second strategic pillar, capturing productivity. We continue to execute well. We saw gains in our base productivity across food, labor and overheads, which drove about a 60 basis point margin increase in the quarter. These gains continue to be driven by a focus on waste as well as reducing complexity across the supply chain to reduce food costs, while also reducing our labor costs to refocus on overtime and agency expenses. In the further reduction of overheads, we continue to expand our usage of zero-based budgeting processes. Productivity reinvestment in enterprise technology is and will remain an important catalyst in unlocking margin potential, including the deployment of our major tool investments. 
Kronos, our labor management tool, is now deployed in over 90% of our North America locations. PRIMA Web, our master menu system, is installed in about 2/3 of our North America locations. Ariba, which is an SAP solution, is really still in the early stages. By month's end, we will be enabled in 30 pilot locations where we'll continue to refine our processes, tools and KPIs to ensure we have it right before broad launch. We're also making good progress with our MICROS installation, which is now in about 20% of our locations. Again, remember that MICROS is our point-of-sale system that facilitates our broader pricing strategy. Expect us to continue to expand usage of these tools in coming quarters and have a good line of sight to capture our food, labor and overhead improvement that we identified at Investor Day. 
Occasionally, we're asked about the pace of deployment in terms of executing more quickly, which is a very fair question. And I'd only point out that unlike a fast food chain or quick serve restaurant that has a consistent physical footprint, each of our 10,000-plus locations is unique and requires some degree of customization to optimize results. So we'll continue to approach the rollout in a measured way, geared to our business, that ensures we receive maximum benefit not only for us, but for our clients and the consumers that we serve. 
In the second quarter, our productivity gains net of reinvestment drove an increase in North America constant currency adjusted operating income of 4%, which led to a 20 basis point increase in North America AOI margins. Our international business delivered a 6% increase in constant currency AOI and a 30 basis point improvement in margins, with particular strong margin expansion across South America. Uniforms drove a 9% increase in AOI, coupled with a 60 basis point improvement in margins. So I think it's fairly evident that our relentless focus on cost and productivity is paying off across our businesses. 
Moving to our strategic pillar of people. In second quarter, we garnered strong validation to ensure we're creating a great place to work. Not only did we earn a spot on Fortune's Most Admired Companies list, we achieved first place ranking for diversified outsourcing companies. We also rank in the top 3 categories for all 9 criteria that companies are evaluated against, including first place for innovation, global competitiveness and social responsibility. This honor is a testament to our 270,000 dedicated associates around the world who sell and serve with passion every day. Also, in the quarter, we were included in DiversityInc's Top 25 Noteworthy Companies for Diversity, which recognized our ongoing commitment to a diverse and inclusive workforce. 
So in summary, we had strong financial and operational performance in the quarter, and we continue to be encouraged by our progress. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Steve for a more detailed look at the numbers."
1004106,332147249,981690,"Aramark, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, May 11, 2016",2016-05-11,"Earnings Calls","Aramark","Executives","Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone. I will start with the observation that our second quarter performance was largely consistent with our broader expectations for all of our segments. On Slide 4, let me walk through the revenue reconciliation vers",1421,"Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone. I will start with the observation that our second quarter performance was largely consistent with our broader expectations for all of our segments. 
On Slide 4, let me walk through the revenue reconciliation versus the prior year. We reported second quarter sales of nearly $3.6 billion in 2016. As you can see, this is essentially equivalent to the nearly $3.6 billion in sales we recorded in the prior year, though the $20 million difference between the 2 years does round down to a negative 1% change on a GAAP basis year-on-year. The largest reconciling item between the 2 years is foreign currency. The stronger U.S. dollar in the current year reduced translated revenue from our international businesses by almost $70 million or 2%. Even though the U.S. dollar weakened a bit in the last month of the quarter, on average, it was 8% stronger than the prior year period. In our case, both the Canadian dollar and the Chilean peso were down low double-digit percentages in the second quarter on average versus prior year. 
Moving down the reconciliation. We recorded approximately $8 million in revenue from our Irish acquisition, which closed during the quarter. Consistent with our past practice, we will exclude significant M&A-related revenue from our calculation of organic results for the first year of ownership. We would expect ultimately to record approximately $50 million in GAAP revenue from this transaction by the conclusion of our fiscal year. Our organic revenue, therefore, increased approximately $40 million in the quarter or 1%. 
There are several components worth delineating within this figure. First, the timing of Easter in 2016 cost us about a day of service versus the prior year second quarter in several lines of business or approximately 0.5% for the total company. This will obviously reverse in the third quarter. Second, the headwinds we faced, along with many other companies, from lower energy prices continued. In our case, this was another 0.5% of revenue and was spread across both our international and North American FSS segments. Finally, the specific portfolio optimization steps that we've announced over the last couple of quarters in both our North American and international FSS segments reduced revenue by a full 1% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. The underlying base business, therefore, grew approximately 3%, which combined with the 2% of headwinds from Easter, energy and the portfolio pruning, gives us the recorded 1% organic growth. 
As for our base business, specifically in our North American FSS business, we had notable revenue gains in our Sports & Entertainment and Higher Education businesses. I would point out that while we started to serve Yosemite, as noted by Eric earlier, it did not have a material impact on the company financially in the second quarter. 
In our international FSS segment, growth was broad based with Ireland, excluding Avoca; China; Mexico and Korea, all recording double-digit gains. Our uniform segment continued it's very steady revenue trend with another quarter of 4% growth. 
Now let's move to Slide 5 to discuss the changes in adjusted operating income and our profitability during the quarter. In general, we continue to make excellent progress in this regard, led by productivity initiatives and our strategic portfolio pruning actions. In the center of the page, second quarter 2016 adjusted operating income was $221 million, approximately 4% higher than the prior year's $213 million. However, we did incur a modest 2% currency headwind on earnings during the quarter, which is consistent with the revenue discussion of a few minutes ago. Therefore, on a constant currency basis, our adjusted operating income improved 6% year-over-year. Our margin increased to 6.2%, which is a record level of profitability for us as a company in the second quarter. All 3 segments reported robust improvements in adjusted operating income, with North America FSS up 4%, international FSS up 6% and uniforms up 9% on a year-over-year basis. 
Broad productivity initiatives favorably impacted all segments, while the portfolio actions benefited the North America and international segments. In addition, uniforms benefited from our expected bounce-back in operating effectiveness as our West Coast capacity expansion project was completed as planned during the quarter. 
Slide 6 provides a roll-forward to help bridge our adjusted EPS year-over-year and is presented in the same format as that of adjusted operating income. Our adjusted EPS increased to $0.39 in the quarter versus the $0.37 we reported in the second quarter of 2015. Taking into account approximately $0.01 of currency headwind, this is an 8% increase on a constant currency basis. Interest expense was flat for the quarter, year-over-year, and the adjusted effective tax rate was consistent with the prior year quarter at slightly under 36%. 
Moving to Slide 7. I'll discuss the current state of the balance sheet for a moment. Our financial flexibility in a word is strong and continues to improve year-over-year, consistent with our expectations. We ended the quarter with approximately $150 million of cash on hand and no draw on our revolving credit facility. Together, these provide over $850 million in available liquidity. Our leverage ratio, as measured by total debt to EBITDA, improved nearly 25 basis points year-over-year in the quarter to 4.1x. And total debt declined year-over-year by $160 million. We recently renewed through 2019 our $350 million accounts receivable securitization facility with modestly improved economics. As a result, we have no significant debt maturities of any kind prior to 2019. Given current conditions, we are continuing to closely monitor the markets, and we do intend to be opportunistic if the economics are justified to further extend the tenor of our debt maturities. 
Finally, year-to-date cash flow, while negative due to the seasonality of our business, has thus far shown a very nice improvement year-over-year from both higher earnings and better working capital performance. 
I'll now make a few comments regarding our outlook for the remainder of the year on Slide 8. Beginning with the full year expectations on the left, our adjusted EPS range for the year remains exactly the same as it's been, $1.65 to $1.75. Due to rounding, we have incurred $0.03 of year-to-date currency headwinds in the first 6 months. At current rates, we should have less of a currency headwind for the second half of the year than we faced in the first and modestly less than we anticipated last quarter. I would estimate approximately another $0.01 to go, which will largely be in the third quarter. Our capital spending expectations for the year also remain unchanged. We would not expect it to exceed 3.5% of revenue for the year. Our bond offering last quarter did not impact our interest expense assumptions for the year, which remain flat versus 2015, and we continue to expect a full year effective tax rate of between 35% to 36%, which is comparable to the prior year. 
Our free cash flow should be at least $200 million, which would be consistent with the earnings growth in the range above and clearly, our year-to-date performance gives us a nice start towards achieving this improvement. Our segment expectations for the second half of 2016 are on the right, and you will see they're directionally consistent with our long-term algorithm expectations for broad-based improvement in the business, both in terms of revenue growth as well as margin expansion. All of our segments will show year-on-year growth in revenue in the second half. Our FSS North America segment will benefit from a full period of Yosemite revenue, which should approximate $90 million in the second half. We expect growth in Europe and Asia will drive our international revenue segments. 
Uniforms will remain on its steady trajectory of recent years. For the company, we expect our portfolio optimization efforts will represent about a 1% headwind on a full year basis. Furthermore, at current levels, the energy sector will account for another 50 basis points of headwind for the year. 
And finally, as I mentioned earlier, currency headwinds are mitigating. At the current FX rates, revenue changes from FX will present about a half -- headwinds that equal to about half of what we experienced in the first half of the year. Adjusted operating income should grow year-on-year in each of our segments in the second half, primarily driven by better productivity and complemented by our portfolio optimization activity. This segment outlook is consistent with our full year earnings guidance. 
I will now turn the call back over to Eric for some closing remarks in advance of Q&A. Eric?"

The real pressure points in North America, I'd say, rest in, as Steve mentioned, as we've exited, in one instance, a large high-profile corrections account as well as some -- a similar situation in health care. So I think as is typical in this business, and you've heard me talk about how lumpy it is, while we feel good about where we stand both in terms of new business pipeline in North America as well as some of the new business wins, the way in which we onboard that new business, the timing of that, I think, has been a little different than maybe we had anticipated.

The multiyear framework, I think, remains very much intact from our perspective. Again, the good news is, I think, we're seeing growth across all reportable segments. There is no debating in 2016 that we're going to encounter some of this headwind, both from a portfolio action and energy perspective. But as we look at the business, again, the drivers of this business are retention that stays fairly steady at that mid-90% range. That's factual. Our base business is actually performing well, which basically puts you back on the new business question. And I think the new business pipeline looks good. As I mentioned in my comments, we expect to book north of $1 billion in new business this year, but it's really the onboarding of that new business that creates the lumpy quarter-to-quarter optics that we deal with. So I think as we look long term, we're going to play our game. Again, we're confident in the algorithm, 3% of 5%. Having said that, we're going to run this business for the long term, and where we see and have opportunities to take corrective actions against the margin and return stream that we talked about at Investor Day, we're going to pursue them."

I think, first of all, Denny, I'm not going to talk about any specific clients, but what I would say is there is an industry dynamic where, in some instances, business will convert from competitor to competitor, or in some instances, it will convert from outsourced back to in-source. So it's not a ""unique to a particular client"" phenomenon. That, in fact, does take place. I think -- again, as I said in our opening commentary, our Education business continues to perform very, very well through second quarter, through the first half of the year. And certainly as we look to the 4 Education clients that I highlighted, as we onboard those in September, would expect to continue to see that Education business perform like it has for us in the last several years. Again, I would just caution you that when you look at any of these social media posts or warn notices, it's only one side of the story. And so as you try to net out in a particular line of business, my caution would be, in some instances, there are new business wins that we have that we're actually unable to disclose because of certain agreements we have with clients. So it's very difficult to look at kind of what you're seeing in the media and draw any kind of long-term conclusions. That would be my one caution."

As we -- and as we continue to consolidate transactional activity into more of a shared service center environment, ultimately, it will give us more visibility and control on centralized disbursements, specifically on the payables side. But I wouldn't want to overpromise how quickly we can make that happen. So as I said before, I think the start is promising. It certainly gives us a higher level of confidence that we can achieve the target we've set out here at the beginning of the year. So much of our working capital is seasonal in the fourth quarter.

Again, this is a small tuck-in acquisition of a leading Irish retail brand. And actually, they're one of the most successful retailers in Ireland and have a market-leading position. To us, it really complements our strategy. Where we would look to add brands to improve our portfolio offering really is around, does it give us additional scale? Does it give us additional competencies? Does it allow us to maybe play in a particular area of the market where we're not playing today? So I think the fact is that Avoca is a great destination store. They've got a very successful catering business. And the Pratt family remains involved. So I think it's an acquisition that you'll see will continue to perform well. And the broader answer to your question is yes, we will look for these bolt-on, tuck-in acquisitions of brands as we go -- as we look to the future."

And so I think as we look at this, one of the things that we're spending a lot of time on across all of our lines of business is the whole concept of mobilization in start-ups. And so I'd say the answer to the Yosemite question is it was a very successful transition, very seamless.

And so that drag will improve as the year plays out, and we will certainly be profitable on a full year basis by the time we get to the end of the year. And then on the uniform side, I think the easiest thing to do -- they obviously had a rough first quarter based on their kind of historical performance in terms of just profitability on a year-over-year basis. And almost all of that underperformance versus their historical average, I think, you can attribute directly to the expansion project that we were doing on the West Coast.

But from a cadence standpoint, this year, just looking at what has continued to transpire with energy costs, I think your premise is right. Third quarter will probably be a touch more of a headwind, and then fourth just based on the way energy has broadly behaved. But it's also there is a lag, I would remind you, around our client decisions, and they don't react immediately to changes in the price as well. So I think for modeling purposes, I think it's best to just assume a fairly consistent headwind quarter-to-quarter on energy over the course of the whole year.

I think if you looked -- look at it over time, for us, it's important to make sure our growth is in line and ahead of the industry. If you look at the last couple of years versus the competitor you mentioned, I think, in 2014, we grew faster. I think last year, they grew faster than us. So as you look across the globe and dig a little deeper, there will be geographies where we've grown faster each of the last several years. Certainly, our international business is one of those. There'll be markets where they've grown faster. If you look at the North America breakdown, there are a couple of spaces where they play that we don't. One is in the GPO space, the other is the elder care space. But I would say again, we are at very different phases relative to our strategic focus. And as I mentioned earlier, ours is going to apply a very strong return and margin filter. So as we make any decision, we are going to have that top of mind in this organization and make sure our orientation is around profitable growth. And again, that's translating into us doing a few things, I think, that might be different just based on where each of the separate companies are in their evolution. So at the end of the day, I'm not going to obsess about any individual competitor. Our approach is to play our game, and we have continued confidence in our ability to grow this business and create shareholder value going forward."

I'm pleased to report another solid quarter, which as you saw in this morning's release, keeps our outlook for the year unchanged. Strong in-market execution of our strategy is delivering balanced and broad-base",1454,"Thank you, Ian, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report another solid quarter, which as you saw in this morning's release, keeps our outlook for the year unchanged. Strong in-market execution of our strategy is delivering balanced and broad-based business momentum across the portfolio. In fact, both in quarter and year-to-date, all of our segments are showing top line growth, margin expansion and improved profitability. Our improved performance is also creating opportunity with regards to the strategic management of the business. Today's release includes some commentary on our acquisition of a small Irish specialty food company, Avoca, which brings a very strong European brand and new offerings to Aramark's portfolio. The release also includes references to our previously announced portfolio optimization efforts, including exiting from India and 2 small countries in South America, which are driving meaningful margin improvement in our emerging markets business. 
Four years ago, with trailing financial metrics and higher leverage, we might have been more hesitant to take some of these strategic actions, especially with the accompanying short-term volatility they create in quarterly results. But with the momentum in improving our financials and a good line of sight to our food, labor and overhead productivity goals, flexibility to act on strategic decisions, like bolt-on M&A and portfolio actions, only enhances our ability to compete and to create long-term shareholder value going forward. 
Looking at the quarter, adjusted earnings per share were $0.39, an 8% increase from last year on a constant currency basis. Total company organic sales were up 1% and were negatively impacted by about 1 point -- excuse me, 1.5 points from the Easter holiday shift as well as the portfolio actions we took to exit unprofitable geographies and accounts. Actions, again, that were consistent with our Investor Day comments as we focus on margins and returns. 
Productivity gains facilitated an increase in adjusted operating margins to 6.2%, a 30 basis point improvement versus year ago. Consistent with last quarter, about half of our productivity gains were reinvested in the business as we continue to support technology, capability and growth initiatives across the organization. Overall, our constant currency adjusted operating income was up 6%. 
Looking at our strategic pillar of growth, retention rates were strong and remain consistent with our targeted mid-90s percentage for the year. Our new business pipeline is encouraging, and we're tracking north of $1 billion in new business wins for the year. North America organic sales were up 1% in the quarter, with the early Easter holiday creating about 0.5 points of timing headwind versus year ago. Our portfolio actions reduced sales by about 1 point, but are meaningfully accretive to margin improvement going forward. North America new business wins were strong, particularly in higher education, including wins at Fordham University, the University of Louisville, Presbyterian University and Valdosta State. Our international business grew organic sales by 1%. In Europe, we saw good growth in Ireland, Germany and Spain, offset by further declines in oil drilling in the North Sea. 
Emerging market business growth was strong, led by double-digit growth in China, Korea and Mexico. Our new business wins were also strong in our international markets. During the quarter, we won the largest client in our German business' history, the Cologne trade fair company. This is a 10-year agreement starting in January that will provide for the delivery of food service for one of the world's most prestigious event venues and is the sixth-largest trade fair and exhibition convention center in the world. 
Our uniform sector performance was equally positive. Uniforms continued to benefit from our investments in capacity expansion, which resulted in organic sales growth of 4% in the quarter. Another highlight of the quarter was the start-up of our 15-year National Park Service contract at Yosemite, which I'm pleased to report has gone exceptionally well. I'd be remiss if not congratulating our entire Leisure team for executing a very complex opening extremely well. We retained well over 95% of the roughly 1,000-plus legacy Yosemite employees, which we welcome to the Aramark family. We've been making enhancements to the facilities and upgrading technology to significantly enhance the guest experience as we head into the peak spring and summer season. As is the case at Yosemite, innovation across the entire business remains an integral component of achieving our goals. 
And let me turn to one of the more important innovation areas, health and wellness, and give you an update on our partnership with the American Heart Association. As part of our shared goal with AHA to improve the diet and health of millions of consumers, we've launched the next phase of our Healthy for Life 20 by 20 alliance that provides underserved communities with vital educational support. A new engagement program is currently being piloted in Chicago, Houston and Philadelphia, that teaches people about a balanced diet and how to shop for nutritious ingredients to prepare healthy meals. The learnings will be used to scale the program nationwide and the impact of well-being will impact tens of thousands of families in communities most in need of this support. 
Looking at our second strategic pillar, capturing productivity. We continue to execute well. We saw gains in our base productivity across food, labor and overheads, which drove about a 60 basis point margin increase in the quarter. These gains continue to be driven by a focus on waste as well as reducing complexity across the supply chain to reduce food costs, while also reducing our labor costs to refocus on overtime and agency expenses. In the further reduction of overheads, we continue to expand our usage of zero-based budgeting processes. Productivity reinvestment in enterprise technology is and will remain an important catalyst in unlocking margin potential, including the deployment of our major tool investments. 
Kronos, our labor management tool, is now deployed in over 90% of our North America locations. PRIMA Web, our master menu system, is installed in about 2/3 of our North America locations. Ariba, which is an SAP solution, is really still in the early stages. By month's end, we will be enabled in 30 pilot locations where we'll continue to refine our processes, tools and KPIs to ensure we have it right before broad launch. We're also making good progress with our MICROS installation, which is now in about 20% of our locations. Again, remember that MICROS is our point-of-sale system that facilitates our broader pricing strategy. Expect us to continue to expand usage of these tools in coming quarters and have a good line of sight to capture our food, labor and overhead improvement that we identified at Investor Day. 
Occasionally, we're asked about the pace of deployment in terms of executing more quickly, which is a very fair question. And I'd only point out that unlike a fast food chain or quick serve restaurant that has a consistent physical footprint, each of our 10,000-plus locations is unique and requires some degree of customization to optimize results. So we'll continue to approach the rollout in a measured way, geared to our business, that ensures we receive maximum benefit not only for us, but for our clients and the consumers that we serve. 
In the second quarter, our productivity gains net of reinvestment drove an increase in North America constant currency adjusted operating income of 4%, which led to a 20 basis point increase in North America AOI margins. Our international business delivered a 6% increase in constant currency AOI and a 30 basis point improvement in margins, with particular strong margin expansion across South America. Uniforms drove a 9% increase in AOI, coupled with a 60 basis point improvement in margins. So I think it's fairly evident that our relentless focus on cost and productivity is paying off across our businesses. 
Moving to our strategic pillar of people. In second quarter, we garnered strong validation to ensure we're creating a great place to work. Not only did we earn a spot on Fortune's Most Admired Companies list, we achieved first place ranking for diversified outsourcing companies. We also rank in the top 3 categories for all 9 criteria that companies are evaluated against, including first place for innovation, global competitiveness and social responsibility. This honor is a testament to our 270,000 dedicated associates around the world who sell and serve with passion every day. Also, in the quarter, we were included in DiversityInc's Top 25 Noteworthy Companies for Diversity, which recognized our ongoing commitment to a diverse and inclusive workforce. 
So in summary, we had strong financial and operational performance in the quarter, and we continue to be encouraged by our progress. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Steve for a more detailed look at the numbers."
1004106,332147249,982301,"Aramark, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, May 11, 2016",2016-05-11,"Earnings Calls","Aramark","Executives","Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone. I will start with the observation that our second quarter performance was largely consistent with our broader expectations for all of our segments. On Slide 4, let me walk through the revenue reconciliation vers",1421,"Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone. I will start with the observation that our second quarter performance was largely consistent with our broader expectations for all of our segments. 
On Slide 4, let me walk through the revenue reconciliation versus the prior year. We reported second quarter sales of nearly $3.6 billion in 2016. As you can see, this is essentially equivalent to the nearly $3.6 billion in sales we recorded in the prior year, though the $20 million difference between the 2 years does round down to a negative 1% change on a GAAP basis year-on-year. The largest reconciling item between the 2 years is foreign currency. The stronger U.S. dollar in the current year reduced translated revenue from our international businesses by almost $70 million or 2%. Even though the U.S. dollar weakened a bit in the last month of the quarter, on average, it was 8% stronger than the prior year period. In our case, both the Canadian dollar and the Chilean peso were down low double-digit percentages in the second quarter on average versus prior year. 
Moving down the reconciliation. We recorded approximately $8 million in revenue from our Irish acquisition, which closed during the quarter. Consistent with our past practice, we will exclude significant M&A-related revenue from our calculation of organic results for the first year of ownership. We would expect ultimately to record approximately $50 million in GAAP revenue from this transaction by the conclusion of our fiscal year. Our organic revenue, therefore, increased approximately $40 million in the quarter or 1%. 
There are several components worth delineating within this figure. First, the timing of Easter in 2016 cost us about a day of service versus the prior year second quarter in several lines of business or approximately 0.5% for the total company. This will obviously reverse in the third quarter. Second, the headwinds we faced, along with many other companies, from lower energy prices continued. In our case, this was another 0.5% of revenue and was spread across both our international and North American FSS segments. Finally, the specific portfolio optimization steps that we've announced over the last couple of quarters in both our North American and international FSS segments reduced revenue by a full 1% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. The underlying base business, therefore, grew approximately 3%, which combined with the 2% of headwinds from Easter, energy and the portfolio pruning, gives us the recorded 1% organic growth. 
As for our base business, specifically in our North American FSS business, we had notable revenue gains in our Sports & Entertainment and Higher Education businesses. I would point out that while we started to serve Yosemite, as noted by Eric earlier, it did not have a material impact on the company financially in the second quarter. 
In our international FSS segment, growth was broad based with Ireland, excluding Avoca; China; Mexico and Korea, all recording double-digit gains. Our uniform segment continued it's very steady revenue trend with another quarter of 4% growth. 
Now let's move to Slide 5 to discuss the changes in adjusted operating income and our profitability during the quarter. In general, we continue to make excellent progress in this regard, led by productivity initiatives and our strategic portfolio pruning actions. In the center of the page, second quarter 2016 adjusted operating income was $221 million, approximately 4% higher than the prior year's $213 million. However, we did incur a modest 2% currency headwind on earnings during the quarter, which is consistent with the revenue discussion of a few minutes ago. Therefore, on a constant currency basis, our adjusted operating income improved 6% year-over-year. Our margin increased to 6.2%, which is a record level of profitability for us as a company in the second quarter. All 3 segments reported robust improvements in adjusted operating income, with North America FSS up 4%, international FSS up 6% and uniforms up 9% on a year-over-year basis. 
Broad productivity initiatives favorably impacted all segments, while the portfolio actions benefited the North America and international segments. In addition, uniforms benefited from our expected bounce-back in operating effectiveness as our West Coast capacity expansion project was completed as planned during the quarter. 
Slide 6 provides a roll-forward to help bridge our adjusted EPS year-over-year and is presented in the same format as that of adjusted operating income. Our adjusted EPS increased to $0.39 in the quarter versus the $0.37 we reported in the second quarter of 2015. Taking into account approximately $0.01 of currency headwind, this is an 8% increase on a constant currency basis. Interest expense was flat for the quarter, year-over-year, and the adjusted effective tax rate was consistent with the prior year quarter at slightly under 36%. 
Moving to Slide 7. I'll discuss the current state of the balance sheet for a moment. Our financial flexibility in a word is strong and continues to improve year-over-year, consistent with our expectations. We ended the quarter with approximately $150 million of cash on hand and no draw on our revolving credit facility. Together, these provide over $850 million in available liquidity. Our leverage ratio, as measured by total debt to EBITDA, improved nearly 25 basis points year-over-year in the quarter to 4.1x. And total debt declined year-over-year by $160 million. We recently renewed through 2019 our $350 million accounts receivable securitization facility with modestly improved economics. As a result, we have no significant debt maturities of any kind prior to 2019. Given current conditions, we are continuing to closely monitor the markets, and we do intend to be opportunistic if the economics are justified to further extend the tenor of our debt maturities. 
Finally, year-to-date cash flow, while negative due to the seasonality of our business, has thus far shown a very nice improvement year-over-year from both higher earnings and better working capital performance. 
I'll now make a few comments regarding our outlook for the remainder of the year on Slide 8. Beginning with the full year expectations on the left, our adjusted EPS range for the year remains exactly the same as it's been, $1.65 to $1.75. Due to rounding, we have incurred $0.03 of year-to-date currency headwinds in the first 6 months. At current rates, we should have less of a currency headwind for the second half of the year than we faced in the first and modestly less than we anticipated last quarter. I would estimate approximately another $0.01 to go, which will largely be in the third quarter. Our capital spending expectations for the year also remain unchanged. We would not expect it to exceed 3.5% of revenue for the year. Our bond offering last quarter did not impact our interest expense assumptions for the year, which remain flat versus 2015, and we continue to expect a full year effective tax rate of between 35% to 36%, which is comparable to the prior year. 
Our free cash flow should be at least $200 million, which would be consistent with the earnings growth in the range above and clearly, our year-to-date performance gives us a nice start towards achieving this improvement. Our segment expectations for the second half of 2016 are on the right, and you will see they're directionally consistent with our long-term algorithm expectations for broad-based improvement in the business, both in terms of revenue growth as well as margin expansion. All of our segments will show year-on-year growth in revenue in the second half. Our FSS North America segment will benefit from a full period of Yosemite revenue, which should approximate $90 million in the second half. We expect growth in Europe and Asia will drive our international revenue segments. 
Uniforms will remain on its steady trajectory of recent years. For the company, we expect our portfolio optimization efforts will represent about a 1% headwind on a full year basis. Furthermore, at current levels, the energy sector will account for another 50 basis points of headwind for the year. 
And finally, as I mentioned earlier, currency headwinds are mitigating. At the current FX rates, revenue changes from FX will present about a half -- headwinds that equal to about half of what we experienced in the first half of the year. Adjusted operating income should grow year-on-year in each of our segments in the second half, primarily driven by better productivity and complemented by our portfolio optimization activity. This segment outlook is consistent with our full year earnings guidance. 
I will now turn the call back over to Eric for some closing remarks in advance of Q&A. Eric?"

The real pressure points in North America, I'd say, rest in, as Steve mentioned, as we've exited, in one instance, a large high-profile corrections account as well as some -- a similar situation in health care. So I think as is typical in this business, and you've heard me talk about how lumpy it is, while we feel good about where we stand both in terms of new business pipeline in North America as well as some of the new business wins, the way in which we onboard that new business, the timing of that, I think, has been a little different than maybe we had anticipated. So I'd say, those are the real variables driving the North America business."

So the dollar impact of things like the portfolio actions we've taken as well as the energy headwind is roughly comparable to first quarter and second quarter, but the revenue base that it's applied against is going to be much smaller in the second quarter just because of seasonality. So you end up with more of a percentage change just because the base is a little bit different in size."

The multiyear framework, I think, remains very much intact from our perspective. Again, the good news is, I think, we're seeing growth across all reportable segments. There is no debating in 2016 that we're going to encounter some of this headwind, both from a portfolio action and energy perspective. But as we look at the business, again, the drivers of this business are retention that stays fairly steady at that mid-90% range. That's factual. Our base business is actually performing well, which basically puts you back on the new business question. And I think the new business pipeline looks good. As I mentioned in my comments, we expect to book north of $1 billion in new business this year, but it's really the onboarding of that new business that creates the lumpy quarter-to-quarter optics that we deal with. So I think as we look long term, we're going to play our game. Again, we're confident in the algorithm, 3% of 5%. Having said that, we're going to run this business for the long term, and where we see and have opportunities to take corrective actions against the margin and return stream that we talked about at Investor Day, we're going to pursue them."

And then we were estimating this might be like a $0.02 impact in '17. Just maybe if you could give us any color there, that would be helpful as well."

So it's not a ""unique to a particular client"" phenomenon. That, in fact, does take place. I think -- again, as I said in our opening commentary, our Education business continues to perform very, very well through second quarter, through the first half of the year. And certainly as we look to the 4 Education clients that I highlighted, as we onboard those in September, would expect to continue to see that Education business perform like it has for us in the last several years. Again, I would just caution you that when you look at any of these social media posts or warn notices, it's only one side of the story. And so as you try to net out in a particular line of business, my caution would be, in some instances, there are new business wins that we have that we're actually unable to disclose because of certain agreements we have with clients. So it's very difficult to look at kind of what you're seeing in the media and draw any kind of long-term conclusions. That would be my one caution."

I think what we've done, Stephen -- if you think about the last couple of years, I would say there is a bit of a principle that would say our investment approach is driven by a couple of things. But typically, when we went into a planned year, you'd see a little more heavier investment during the first half of the year, but it can also be based on the roll out of certain initiatives. But broadly speaking, we're making a lot of progress with a lot of runway ahead of us. And again, as we looked at the first half, our base productivity showed a 60 basis point improvement. We invested 30 bps of that back into the business, but I wouldn't say that becomes a trend. I think we continue to look and evaluate. And I think, for the most part, you should expect first half investments to be a little higher than you typically see in the second half."

Certainly, I hope some of it is sustainable. There's no doubt a portion of it is timing. So in the prior year, we were making -- prior year being '15, we made some large commission payments to a former client based on some activity in '14. And so we didn't have to do that this year, which would be a one-off event in the first half of the year that would not necessarily carry forward. But I think we're doing very well in terms of collections on things like DSO, that's getting a lot more focus in the organization. As we -- and as we continue to consolidate transactional activity into more of a shared service center environment, ultimately, it will give us more visibility and control on centralized disbursements, specifically on the payables side. But I wouldn't want to overpromise how quickly we can make that happen. So as I said before, I think the start is promising. It certainly gives us a higher level of confidence that we can achieve the target we've set out here at the beginning of the year. So much of our working capital is seasonal in the fourth quarter. And so while we're in good shape sitting here today, the reality is much of it will be determined on how we perform in the fourth quarter."

I would say, as you look at this business -- and I'd say this applies not purely just to Education but to most of our lines of business.

Second, are we providing a consistently great customer experience at the moment of truth? And third, do we have the right team on the ground? And if we win new business, typically it's because we've demonstrated an ability to do that, and we we'll have the potential client tour existing clients and be able to see and touch and feel that. And if we find ourselves in a tough retention situation, it's usually for one of those 3 variables as well. Having said that, I just want to come back to the fact that we expect our Education retention rates this year to once again be in the high 90s. So I just -- I want to come back to that point, along with the fact that we are very encouraged by our new business wins.

Does it give us additional competencies? Does it allow us to maybe play in a particular area of the market where we're not playing today? So I think the fact is that Avoca is a great destination store. They've got a very successful catering business. And the Pratt family remains involved.

And so I think as we look at this, one of the things that we're spending a lot of time on across all of our lines of business is the whole concept of mobilization in start-ups. And so I'd say the answer to the Yosemite question is it was a very successful transition, very seamless.

And so that drag will improve as the year plays out, and we will certainly be profitable on a full year basis by the time we get to the end of the year. And then on the uniform side, I think the easiest thing to do -- they obviously had a rough first quarter based on their kind of historical performance in terms of just profitability on a year-over-year basis. And almost all of that underperformance versus their historical average, I think, you can attribute directly to the expansion project that we were doing on the West Coast.

But from a cadence standpoint, this year, just looking at what has continued to transpire with energy costs, I think your premise is right. Third quarter will probably be a touch more of a headwind, and then fourth just based on the way energy has broadly behaved. But it's also there is a lag, I would remind you, around our client decisions, and they don't react immediately to changes in the price as well. So I think for modeling purposes, I think it's best to just assume a fairly consistent headwind quarter-to-quarter on energy over the course of the whole year.

I think if you looked -- look at it over time, for us, it's important to make sure our growth is in line and ahead of the industry. If you look at the last couple of years versus the competitor you mentioned, I think, in 2014, we grew faster. I think last year, they grew faster than us. So as you look across the globe and dig a little deeper, there will be geographies where we've grown faster each of the last several years. Certainly, our international business is one of those. There'll be markets where they've grown faster. If you look at the North America breakdown, there are a couple of spaces where they play that we don't. One is in the GPO space, the other is the elder care space. But I would say again, we are at very different phases relative to our strategic focus. And as I mentioned earlier, ours is going to apply a very strong return and margin filter. So as we make any decision, we are going to have that top of mind in this organization and make sure our orientation is around profitable growth. And again, that's translating into us doing a few things, I think, that might be different just based on where each of the separate companies are in their evolution. So at the end of the day, I'm not going to obsess about any individual competitor. Our approach is to play our game, and we have continued confidence in our ability to grow this business and create shareholder value going forward."

I would like to remind you that our notice regarding forward-looking statements is included in our press release this morning, which can be found on our website and is detailed on Page 2 of our earnings slide deck. 
During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks, uncertainties and important factors, including those discussed in risk factors, MD&A and other sections of our SEC filings. Additionally, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures.

We posted organic sales growth in the quarter of 4%, net of about a point of strategic actions that we discussed in our last earnings call. Said differently, our underlying business grew in the mid-single digits for the quarter. Solid productivity gains drove meaningful profitability expansion on a constant currency basis. Margins increased 50 basis points, adjusted operating income grew 15% and adjusted EPS was $0.34, a 17% increase from prior year. 
Our outlook for the full year remains unchanged. So all in, a really good quarter on multiple fronts. Not only were our financial and operational results strong, we were also busy in the marketplace. We hosted and serviced multiple major sports playoff events, watched an innovative celebrity partnership that really enhances our product offerings. We hit the ground running in Yosemite National Park, provided food service to both the RNC and DNC conventions and also received more external recognition awards. Also in early August, we acquired HPSI, a company that will help strengthen our group purchasing capabilities particularly in the health care and education sectors. 
I'd like to thank the 270,000 strong Aramark team members that are clearly rallying behind our focused strategy, which is driving increased customer and employee satisfaction and accelerating financial performance, which in turn has created meaningful shareholder value. So let me dive a bit deeper on our third quarter results. Looking at revenue and as I mentioned a moment ago, third quarter organic growth was 4%, net of about 150 basis points in previously identified headwinds, 100 basis points of strategic actions and roughly 50 basis points of energy pressures. The quarterly sales momentum was driven by our base business expansion, new business growth. 
We continue to see solid retention into a lesser degree, about 0.5. benefit from the timing of Easter. For the full year both retention rates and new business wins are tracking consistently with the past few years, which indicates mid-90s retention and roughly $1 billion in new business wins for the year. Our North America business showed solid 5% organic sales growth in the quarter. New business wins remains strong, including the rock 'n roll Hall of Fame, the University of Pennsylvania and Tennessee Department of Corrections. Notable performances were turned in by our education as well as our sports and leisure sectors as we scaled up our operations in Yosemite and saw strong playoff performance in both the NBA and the NHL. 
And to that end, I'd like to congratulate our partners, Pittsburgh Penguins, a narrow win of the NHL Stanley Cup as well as the Cleveland Cavaliers on their win of the MBA championship. We have now proudly served just about every major professional and college champion this past season, which started off this season with the major league baseball world champion in Kansas City, followed by the Denver Broncos in the NFL and then the Penguins and the Cavs. In NCAA football, the University of Alabama, NCAA basketball the Philadelphia Wildcats, men's and women Lacrosse champions from the University of Caroline and the NCAA basketball champion, coastal Carolina University. 
And while playoff spot for the client does not generally influence our quarterly financial results in a material way, it was quite an impressive run this year and we are thrilled to serve and be the partner of champions. Our international segment grew organic sales by 1%, net of about 200 basis points attributed to our exit of nonstrategic geographies. Absent those strategic decisions and energy headwinds, our underlying international segment continues to experience solid base sales growth led by China and Mexico, which were both up solid double-digits. We also saw good mid-single digit growth in Europe led by Ireland, Germany and Spain. 
The uniform segment performed well in the quarter and continues to benefit from our recent investments in capacity expansion, but did experience a modest slower demand from our energy clients, which resulted in organic sales growth of 2% in the quarter. Innovation and quality continue to be a major focal point for us across the entire business, particularly in the important area of health and wellness. During the quarter, we announced a strategic partnership with TV personality, restaurant crew or an iron Chef, Cat Cora, to develop an exclusive concept called Olilo by Cat Cora, which focuses on healthy major way Mediterranean cuisine. We're also testing a healthy micromarket concept featuring 80% better-for-you offerings, which we expect to roll across our portfolio in the near future. 
These initiatives and many more to come really supports the goals of our Healthy for Life 20 by 20 partnership with the American Heart Association and stay on point with consumer market trends related to healthy eating. Moving on to productivity. I'm pleased to report that our margin March continues. We continue to attack food and labor costs. On food, these gains are driven by focusing on reducing waste as well as complexity across our supply chain. We're doing that by simplifying our menu offerings and streamlining our supply chain with fewer SKUs. On the labor front, our ongoing efforts are focused on driving headcount productivity while ensuring we continue to reduce overtime and agency hours. 
And as we've mentioned previously, we continued to roll out new technology solutions. And that's a way for us to reduce complexity in the supply chain. In our Ariba pilot accounts, we've been able to trim the number of recipes by 30% and reduce the number of SKUs by more than 50% while simultaneously improving electronic invoicing and payments by 40%. Finally, we continue to ensure our above unit costs are appropriate by continuing to look at spans and layers to facilitate clear roles and responsibilities. These productivity gains our tangible and in the third quarter, they helped drive a 17% increase in North America constant currency adjusted operating income, which led to a key basis point increase in North American constant currency AOI margin. 
Our international segment delivered a 7% increase in constant currency AOI and 30 basis points of constant currency margin expansion. And in uniforms, we saw a 5% increase in AOI, coupled with a 50 basis points of margin expansion. As we communicated to you at our Investor Day, we are committed to expanding our margins 100 basis points over a 3-year time frame and we're certainly on track to do so. One important driver of this opportunity is leveraging our purchasing power through both scale and technology. And with this strategic goal in mind, the HPSI acquisition we announced a few weeks ago, gives us access to industry-leading and complimentary supply chain management and technology in the group purchasing space, particularly in Healthcare and Education. 
In the area of tracking and retaining talent, we continue to make gains and achieve external accolades. During the quarter, we were named to Latino magazines Latino 100, an annual listing that spotlights companies providing the most viable business opportunities for Latinos. Aramark's support of its diverse family includes it's many employee resource groups. And a final note for the quarter, one of which I think helps illustrate the breadth of our business, TripAdvisor, the world's largest travel site, awarded 28 Aramark-managed lodges, restaurants and attractions their 2016 Certificate of Excellence. A few of our locations that were recognized include: the majestic Yosemite hotel, Park Lake Crescent Lodge in Olympic National Park, and the Huawei campground at Lake Tahoe. 
So all in, I feel good about both the quarter and our year-to-date progress. For the first 9 months of fiscal 2016, we've grown organic revenue by 3% net of strategic actions. AOI constant currency is up 9% year-over-year and constant currency adjusted EPS is growing double-digit by 11%. The business is performing consistently with the multi year goals that we identified at Investor Day and we remain very encouraged with our transformative progress. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Steve who'll go a little more detail into the numbers."
1004106,378067107,1032664,"Aramark, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 10, 2016",2016-08-10,"Earnings Calls","Aramark","Executives","Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone. As Eric just described, we delivered both a strong operational and financial in the quarter and we continue to make steady, solid progress against our targets. I'm going to start on Slide 4 and walk through the Q3",1551,"Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone. As Eric just described, we delivered both a strong operational and financial in the quarter and we continue to make steady, solid progress against our targets. I'm going to start on Slide 4 and walk through the Q3 revenue reconciliation versus the prior year. 
We reported third quarter sales of nearly $3.6 billion in 2016. As you can see, this is $100 million more than the $3.5 billion we reported in the third quarter of 2015, which equates to a 3% increase on a GAAP basis. As we get further into the year, we're seeing headwinds from a stronger U.S. dollar start to dissipate. In the third quarter, translated revenue from our international countries was reduced by $45 million or approximately 1%. This compares to about a 2.5% headwind in the first half of the year from currency. 
Moving down the reconciliation. We've recorded approximately $16 million in revenue from our Irish acquisition, which was disclosed last quarter. We exclude material acquisition-related results from our calculation of organic for the first year of ownership in the case of Invoco, we expect to record over $50 million in capital revenue by the conclusion of the fiscal year. Our organic revenue therefore, increased approximately $130 million in the quarter or 4%. The revenue influences regarding Easter, energy and our strategic portfolio actions that we identified on our last call remain unchanged. 
Therefore, the 4% organic sales growth for the total company is net of about 100 basis points of strategic portfolio actions and 50 basis points of energy headwind year-over-year, but it is benefiting by about 50 basis points from the timing of Easter. Taken all of this together, the underlying base business grew in the mid-single digits. Specific to the base business. In North America FSS, we had notable revenue gains in our sports, leisure and entertainment and higher education businesses. In the quarter, we on boarded a new higher ed accounts, benefited from the first quarter of full operations at Yosemite whereby we recorded approximately $45 million of revenue and picked up about 0.5 of sales from incremental year-on-year sports activity largely driven by the NBA and the NHL playoffs. 
Underlying sales of the international segment continued to grow nicely and were offset by previously announced strategic portfolio actions, which impacted the sector by about 200 basis points in the quarter. Our uniform segment recorded 2% growth in the quarter, lower employment levels among certain clients in the energy-related industries, reduced our revenue in this segment by approximately 1%. Let's move on to Slide 5 to discuss the changes in adjusted operating income and profitability during the quarter. In general, we continue to make excellent progress in this regard, led by productivity initiatives and our strategic portfolio pruning actions. 
Third quarter 2016 adjusted operating income was $202 million, which is approximately 14% higher than the prior year's $178 million. However, we did incur a modest 1% currency headwind on earnings during the quarter, which is consistent with the revenue discussion of a few minutes ago. Therefore, on a constant currency basis, our adjusted operating income improved 15% year-over-year. Our AOI margin increased to 5.6%, which is a record level of profitability for us as a public company in the third quarter. All 3 segments reported solid improvement in adjusted operating income with North America FSS up 17%, international FSS up 7% and uniforms up 5% on a currency-neutral basis. Broad productivity initiatives favorably impacted all of our segments while specific portfolio pruning further benefited North America and international. 
Slide 6 provides a roll forward to bridge our adjusted EPS year-over-year. Our adjusted EPS increased to $0.34 per share in the quarter versus the $0.29 per share we reported in the third quarter of 2015. And that's an increase of 17%. Currency translation was not material to the adjusted EPS calculation in the quarter. Adjusted interest expense was essentially flat for the quarter year-over-year and the adjusted effective tax rate was modestly higher than the prior year quarter. As is our typical practice, our non-GAAP disclosures are reconciled in this morning's press release in the quarter. Standard adjustments were made for LBO-related amortization, stock-based compensation and transformation charges, which primarily consist of severance from the prior year's previously announced actions. 
Two items of note here, in the quarter consistent with our past practice. We have excluded the benefit of $11 million in gains related to our fuel hedging program, and the calculation of adjusted net income, we've excluded $31 million in onetime costs related to the $1 billion refinancing transaction that was executed in May. Moving to Slide 7. Our balance sheet and our financial flexibility continues to get stronger each and every quarter. We ended Q3 with almost $200 million of cash on hand and our revolver was completely undrawn. Together, these provide over $900 million in available liquidity to us. Our leverage ratio, as measured by total debt to adjusted EBITDA, improved approximately 40 basis points year-on-year in the quarter to 4x. 
Total debt was lower year-over-year by $185 million. As I referenced earlier, we did execute $1 billion worth of refinancing in the quarter through the reopening and upsizing by $500 million, our 5 1/8% notes that were due -- are due in 2024. In conjunction with issuing a new $500 million 4 3/4% tenure note due 2026. The average effective tax rate indigents action was 4.6% and I'm happy to report that's the best outcome in terms of coupon in the company's recent history for a long-term unsecured bond addition. In early August, as Eric mentioned, we closed the acquisition of HPSI for approximately $140 million and we funded that transaction with cash on hand. We continue to expect our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at the end of the year to be a touch below 4x. 
On Slide 8, I'll make a few comments regarding our outlook for the remainder of the year. To be sustained, our outlook for the year related to EPS is unchanged, the range of $1.65 to $1.75 per share. Given that we have 3 quarters of the year behind us, we would now expect to be approximately at the middle of that range by the time we closed the year. Note, this will be after we have incurred a $0.03 headwind from currency versus the expectations we had at the time we gave guidance. Therefore, the underlying business performance will be at the higher end of our beginning of the year expectations. 
We often speak of the diverse nature and geographic mix of our client portfolio as a point of resiliency for our business model, and this is a mitigator -- this mitigator concentration risk holds true for us in the context of Brexit as well. While there is no doubt, the U.K. is an important geography for us, Sterling-denominated sales represent about 3% of the total company sales. Therefore, at current sterling rates, we would expect about an annualized $60 million revenue reduction, several million dollars of lower EBIT, all of which would equate to about a penny. However, due to its timing in this fiscal year for the remainder of 2016, I would not expect direct Brexit impact to be material to our results. 
I continue to expect capital spending for the year to be approximately 3.5% of sales at this point. We continue to see, and we will continue to invest in growth generating opportunities, while remaining cognizant of the need to continue to drive higher returns on the capital that we invest. Our free cash flow is now expected to be at least $225 million, which would be 20% greater than our 2015 free cash flow. A number of factors are influencing this improvement. But in general, I can say we remain very focused on meaningfully impacting the various levers that are available to us to improve both working capital and free cash flow conversion as we look out into the future. 
Our segment expectations for the second half of 2016 are on the right, and you will see they're unchanged from the last call and they remain directionally consistent with our longer-term algorithm expectations for both broad-based and balanced improvement in the business, both in terms of revenue growth as well as margin expansion.
At current exchange rates, currency translation should not be material to us for the remainder of the year. On a full-year basis, our underlying organic revenue growth should be right in the center of our long-term framework. However, what we report is organic revenue for the year will be reduced by the 150 basis points of previously discussed strategic portfolio actions and energy headwinds. Looking into 2017, even after incorporating the uncertainties that exist in the global macroeconomic situation, it is certainly our expectation that the business' momentum is sustainable and supportive for both our multiyear framework and the 3-year margin expansion goal that we laid out this past December. 
We're currently working through our 2017 budget process. But at this point in time, our expectations of mid-2017 will be largely consistent with our multiyear framework and we will provide a more detailed view of 2017 expectations in November. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Eric for some closing remarks and advance of Q&A. Eric?"

I think as we look at the business, what we're trying to say is there's no debate in 2016 that we have a couple of headwinds. One of those headwinds are the strategic decisions that we made to either exit unprofitable geographies or unprofitable accounts. Second, like any company out there, there's no doubt that a second headwind has just been the global macro environment. I think third is, there's no doubt the energy sector has been under some pressure. And so as we talked about our top line focus, we continue to remain very, very positive about the pipeline, which looks very good. We continue to be confident our growth prospects going forward. I think what we were trying to say is that our focus will be on profitable growth.

I think the historical decentralization of the company has put us in a position where we don't have a single source or a single point of contact where we connect all the money that's due to us or where we disperse all of the funds. So as we roll out a lot of the systems that we've alluded to earlier, that will provide greater transparency for us and will allow us to consolidate control over both receivables and payables that we don't have today. Now having said that, certainly in the short-term, our continued general focus on things like DSO, DPO, et cetera will create opportunities for us. And we've made some progress there. And that's partially reflected in the year-over-year improvements we've had thus far in working capital.

Certainly, again absent the strategic transaction, HPSI where we would direct some funds to the primary use of capital in the near term here will remain deleveraging. I think we've been clear on that. I don't think that has changed. Now as we get closer to kind of a mid-3 sort of a number, we certainly will have more flexibility around how we would choose to allocate that capital. So my sense is if you look at just the rate of EBITDA improvement in general and the rate of free cash flow generation, you're probably looking at a largely deleveraging focus initiative into the next fiscal year. And then beyond that, if we achieve the objectives that we set out for ourselves, I think we'll start to enter into a period where we'll have a little bit more flexibility around how we deploy that capital, but it's probably 12 months out."

As it relates to the quarter impact to some of the strategic initiatives we take on the productivity front, as we have said several times, our investments -- we pull productivity out of the business in terms of the initiatives we have and we reinvest a portion of that back into capabilities either on the growth side or new business generation. Our investments tend to be front-end loaded, if you're looking at our fiscal calendar. And so if we are showing about a 50-basis-point improvement on a year-over-year basis, if you just look at the productivity initiatives in the first half of the year, we would've reinvested probably about half of the productivity that we pulled out of the business. So kind of yielding about 50%. Our yield up to somewhere 2/3, 75% of the productivity that we realized in the third quarter is the intensity as some of the investment starts to tail off in the second half the year.

I'm happy to report strong third quarter financial results. We posted organic sales growth in the quarter of 4%, net of about a point of strategic actions that we discussed in our last earnings call. Said differently, our underlying business grew in the mid-single digits for the quarter. Solid productivity gains drove meaningful profitability expansion on a constant currency basis. Margins increased 50 basis points, adjusted operating income grew 15% and adjusted EPS was $0.34, a 17% increase from prior year.
Our outlook for the full year remains unchanged. So all in, a really good quarter on multiple fronts. Not only were our financial and operational results strong, we were also busy in the marketplace. We hosted and serviced multiple major sports playoff events, watched an innovative celebrity partnership that really enhances our product offerings. We hit the ground running in Yosemite National Park, provided food service to both the RNC and DNC conventions and also received more external recognition awards. Also in early August, we acquired HPSI, a company that will help strengthen our group purchasing capabilities, particularly in healthcare and the education sectors.
And I'd like to thank the 270,000 strong Aramark team members that are clearly rallying behind our focused strategy, which is driving increased customer and employee satisfaction and accelerating financial performance, which in turn is creating meaningful shareholder value.
So let me dive a bit deeper on our third quarter results. Looking at revenue and as I mentioned a moment ago, third quarter organic growth was 4%, net of about 150 basis points in previously identified headwinds, 100 basis points of strategic actions and roughly 50 basis points of energy pressures. The quarterly sales momentum was driven by our base business expansion, new business growth, we continue to see solid retention and to a lesser degree, about 0.5. benefit from the timing of Easter. For the full year, both retention rates and new business wins are tracking consistently with the past few years, which indicates mid-90s retention and roughly $1 billion in new business wins for the year. Our North America business showed solid 5% organic sales growth in the quarter. New business wins remain strong, including the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the University of Pennsylvania and the Tennessee Department of Corrections. Notable performances were turned in by our education as well as our sports and leisure sectors as we scaled up our operations in Yosemite and saw strong playoff performance in both the NBA and the NHL.
And to that end, I'd like to congratulate our partners, the Pittsburgh Penguins, a narrow win of the NHL Stanley Cup as well as the Cleveland Cavaliers on their win of the NBA championship. We have now proudly served just about every major professional and college champion this past season. We'd started off this season with the Major League Baseball world champion, Kansas City Royals, followed by the Denver Broncos in the NFL and then the Penguins and the Cavs. In NCAA Football, the University of Alabama, NCAA Basketball, the Villanova Wildcats, men's and women lacrosse champions from the University of North Carolina and the NCAA Baseball champion, Coastal Carolina University. And while a playoff spot for a client does not generally influence our quarterly financial results in a material way, it was quite an impressive run this year, and we are thrilled to serve and be the partner of champions.
Our international segment grew organic sales by 1%, net of about 200 basis points attributed to our exit of nonstrategic geographies. Absent those strategic decisions and energy headwinds, our underlying international segment continues to experience solid base sales growth led by China and Mexico, which were both up solid double-digit. We also saw good to mid-single digit growth in Europe led by Ireland, Germany and Spain.
The uniform segment performed well in the quarter and continues to benefit from our recent investments in capacity expansion, but did experience a modest slower demand from our energy clients, which resulted in organic sales growth of 2% in the quarter. Innovation and quality continue to be a major focal point for us across the entire business, particularly in the important area of health and wellness. During the quarter, we announced a strategic partnership with TV personality, restaurateur and Iron Chef, Cat Cora, to develop an exclusive concept called OLILO by Cat Cora, which focuses on healthy made-your-way Mediterranean cuisine. We're also testing a healthy micromarket concept featuring 80% better-for-you offerings, which we expect to roll across our portfolio in the near future.
These initiatives and many more to come really supports the goals of our Healthy for Life 20 by 20 partnership with the American Heart Association and stay on point with consumer market trends related to healthy eating.
Moving on to productivity. I'm pleased to report that our margin March continues. We continue to attack food and labor costs. On food, these gains are driven by focusing on reducing waste as well as complexity across our supply chain. We're doing that by simplifying our menu offerings and streamlining our supply chain with fewer SKUs. On the labor front, our ongoing efforts are focused on driving headcount productivity while ensuring we continue to reduce overtime and agency hours. And as we've mentioned previously, we continue to roll out new technology solutions. And that's a way for us to reduce complexity in the supply chain. In our Ariba pilot accounts, we've been able to trim the number of recipes by 30% and reduce the number of SKUs by more than 50% while simultaneously improving electronic invoicing and payments by 40%.
Finally, we continue to ensure our above-unit costs are appropriate by continuing to look at spans and layers to facilitate clear roles and responsibilities. These productivity gains are tangible, and in the third quarter, they helped drive a 17% increase in North America constant currency adjusted operating income, which led to a 50 basis point increase in North American constant currency AOI margin.
Our international segment delivered a 7% increase in constant currency AOI and 30 basis points of constant currency margin expansion. And in uniforms, we saw a 5% increase in AOI, coupled with a 50 basis points of margin expansion. As we communicated to you at our Investor Day, we are committed to expanding our margins 100 basis points over a 3-year time frame, and we're certainly on track to do so. One important driver of this opportunity is leveraging our purchasing power through both scale and technology. And with this strategic goal in mind, the HPSI acquisition we announced a few weeks ago gives us access to industry-leading and complimentary supply chain management and technology in the group purchasing space, particularly in Healthcare and Education.
In the area of attracting and retaining talent, we continue to make gains and achieve external accolades. During the quarter, we were named to Latino Magazine's LATINO 100, an annual listing that spotlights companies providing the most viable business opportunities for Latinos. Aramark's support of its diverse family includes its many employee resource groups.
And a final note for the quarter, one of which I think helps illustrate the breadth of our business, TripAdvisor, the world's largest travel site, awarded 28 Aramark-managed lodges, restaurants and attractions their 2016 Certificate of Excellence. A few of our locations that were recognized include: the majestic Yosemite hotel, Park Lake Crescent Lodge in Olympic National Park, and the Wahweap Campground at Lake Powell.
So all in, I feel good about both the quarter and our year-to-date progress. For the first 9 months of fiscal 2016, we've grown organic revenue by 3% net of strategic actions. AOI constant currency is up 9% year-over-year, and constant currency adjusted EPS is growing double-digit by 11%. The business is performing consistently with the multiyear goals that we identified at Investor Day, and we remain very encouraged with our transformative progress.
With that, let me turn the call over to Steve, who'll go a little more detail into the numbers."
1004106,378067107,1032967,"Aramark, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 10, 2016",2016-08-10,"Earnings Calls","Aramark","Executives","Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone.As Eric just described, we delivered both a strong operational and financial quarter, and we continue to make steady, solid progress against our targets. I'm going to start on Slide 4 and walk through the Q3 reve",1553,"Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone.
As Eric just described, we delivered both a strong operational and financial quarter, and we continue to make steady, solid progress against our targets. I'm going to start on Slide 4 and walk through the Q3 revenue reconciliation versus the prior year.
We reported third quarter sales of nearly $3.6 billion in 2016. As you can see, this is $100 million more than the $3.5 billion we reported in the third quarter of 2015, which equates to a 3% increase on a GAAP basis. As we get further into the year, we were seeing the headwinds from a stronger U.S. dollar start to dissipate. In the third quarter, translated revenue from our international countries was reduced by $45 million or approximately 1%. This compares to about a 2.5% headwind in the first half of the year from currency.
Moving down to reconciliation. We recorded approximately $16 million in revenue from our Irish acquisition, which was disclosed last quarter. We exclude material acquisition-related results from our calculation of organic for the first year of ownership. In the case of Avoca, we expect to record over $50 million in GAAP revenue by the conclusion of the fiscal year. Our organic revenue, therefore, increased approximately $130 million in the quarter or 4%. The revenue influences regarding Easter, energy and our strategic portfolio actions that we identified on our last call remain unchanged. Therefore, the 4% organic sales growth for the total company is net of about 100 basis points of strategic portfolio actions and 50 basis points of energy headwind year-over-year, but it is benefiting by about 50 basis points from the timing of Easter. Taking all of this together, the underlying base business grew in the mid-single digits.
Specific to the base business. In North America FSS, we had notable revenue gains in our sports, leisure and entertainment and higher education businesses. In the quarter, we on-boarded a number of new higher ed accounts, benefited from the first quarter of full operations at Yosemite, whereby we recorded approximately $45 million of revenue, and picked up about 0.5 point of sales from incremental year-on-year sports activity largely driven by the NBA and the NHL playoffs.
Underlying sales of the international segment continued to grow nicely and were offset by previously announced strategic portfolio actions, which impacted the sector by about 200 basis points in the quarter. Our uniform segment recorded 2% growth in the quarter. Lower employment levels among certain clients in the energy-related industries reduced our revenue in this segment by approximately 1%.
Let's move on to Slide 5 to discuss the changes in adjusted operating income and profitability during the quarter. In general, we continue to make excellent progress in this regard, led by productivity initiatives and our strategic portfolio-pruning actions.
Third quarter 2016 adjusted operating income was $202 million, which is approximately 14% higher than the prior year's $178 million. However, we did incur a modest 1% currency headwind on earnings during the quarter, which is consistent with the revenue discussion of a few minutes ago. Therefore, on a constant currency basis, our adjusted operating income improved 15% year-over-year. Our AOI margin increased to 5.6%, which is a record level of profitability for us as a public company in the third quarter. All 3 segments reported solid improvement in adjusted operating income, with North America FSS up 17%, International FSS up 7% and uniforms up 5% on a currency-neutral year-over-year basis. Broad productivity initiatives favorably impacted all of our segments while specific portfolio pruning further benefited North America and International.
Slide 6 provides a roll forward to help bridge our adjusted EPS year-over-year. Our adjusted EPS increased to $0.34 per share in the quarter versus the $0.29 per share we reported in the third quarter of 2015. And that's an increase of 17%. Currency translation was not material to the adjusted EPS calculation in the quarter. Adjusted interest expense was essentially flat for the quarter year-over-year, and the adjusted effective tax rate was modestly higher than the prior year quarter. As is our typical practice, our non-GAAP disclosures are reconciled in this morning's press release in the quarter. Standard adjustments were made for LBO-related amortization, stock-based compensation and transformation charges, which primarily consist of severance from the prior year's previously announced actions.
Two items of note here in the quarter consistent with our past practice. We have excluded the benefit of $11 million in gains related to our fuel hedging program, and in the calculation of adjusted net income, we've excluded $31 million in one-time costs related to the $1 billion refinancing transaction that was executed in May.
Moving to Slide 7. Our balance sheet and our financial flexibility continues to get stronger each and every quarter. We ended Q3 with almost $200 million of cash on hand, and our revolver was completely undrawn. Together, these provide over $900 million in available liquidity to us. Our leverage ratio, as measured by total debt to adjusted EBITDA, improved approximately 40 basis points year-on-year in the quarter to 4x.
Total debt was lower year-over-year by $185 million. As I referenced earlier, we did execute $1 billion worth of refinancing in the quarter through the reopening and upsizing by $500 million, our 5 1/8% notes that were due -- are due in 2024. In conjunction with issuing a new $500 million 4 3/4% tenure note due 2026. The average effective interest rate on the transaction was 4.6%, and I'm happy to report that's the best outcome in terms of coupon in the company's recent history for a long-term unsecured bond addition [ph]. In early August, as Eric mentioned, we closed the acquisition of HPSI for approximately $140 million, and we funded that transaction with cash on hand. We continue to expect our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at the end of the year to be a touch below 4x.
On Slide 8, I'll make a few comments regarding our outlook for the remainder of the year. To be succinct, our outlook for the year related to EPS is unchanged, the range of $1.65 to $1.75 per share. Given that we have 3 quarters of the year behind us, we would now expect to be approximately at the middle of that range by the time we close the year. Note, this will be after we've incurred a $0.03 headwind from currency versus the expectations we had at the time we gave guidance. Therefore, the underlying business performance will be at the higher end of our beginning-of-the-year expectations.
We often speak of the diverse nature and geographic mix of our client portfolio as a point of resiliency for our business model, and this is a mitigator -- this mitigator concentration risk holds true for us in the context of Brexit as well. While there is no doubt the U.K. is an important geography for us, sterling-denominated sales represent about 3% of the total company sales. Therefore, at current sterling rates, we would expect about an annualized $60 million revenue reduction, several million dollars of lower EBIT, all of which would equate to about a penny. However, due to its timing in this fiscal year for the remainder of 2016, I would not expect direct Brexit impact to be material to our results.
I continue to expect capital spending for the year to be approximately 3.5% of sales at this point. We continue to see and we will continue to invest in growth-generating opportunities while remaining cognizant of the need to continue to drive higher returns on the capital that we invest. Our free cash flow is now expected to be at least $225 million, which would be 20% greater than our 2015 free cash flow. A number of factors are influencing this improvement. But in general, I can say we remain very focused on meaningfully impacting the various levers that are available to us to improve both working capital and free cash flow conversion as we look out into the future.
Our segment expectations for the second half of 2016 are on the right, and you will see they're unchanged from the last call, and they remain directionally consistent with our longer-term algorithm expectations for both broad-based and balanced improvement in the business, both in terms of revenue growth as well as margin expansion.
At current exchange rates, currency translation should not be material to us for the remainder of the year. On a full-year basis, our underlying organic revenue growth should be right in the center of our long-term framework. However, what we report as organic revenue for the year will be reduced by the 150 basis points of previously discussed strategic portfolio actions and energy headwinds. Looking into 2017, even after incorporating the uncertainties that exist in the global macroeconomic situation, it is certainly our expectation that the business' momentum is sustainable and supportive of both our multiyear framework and the 3-year margin expansion goal that we laid out this past December.
We're currently working through our 2017 budget process. But at this point in time, our expectations are that 2017 will be largely consistent with our multiyear framework, and we will provide a more detailed view of 2017 expectations in November.
I'll now turn the call back over to Eric for some closing remarks in advance of Q&A. Eric?"

So in summary, we continue to execute against our focused strategy. That strategy is driving stronger client relationships, moving us as a company to a best-in-class employer and improving our financial results across businesses and geographies. I think as our momentum illustrates, we've got the right people executing the right strategy, and that strategy balances the continuously improving financial performance with prudent reinvestment to maximize long-term shareholder value.
So taking our progress together with the promising dynamics of the industry and our upside potential, we continue to remain confident in our Right to Win and are really energized by the prospects going forward.
So with that, Caitlyn will open the lines and are happy to take any questions."

We continue to have year-over-year, we will have lower SG&A spending as we continue to look at the initiatives that Eric referenced earlier.

They buy about over $1 billion in annual purchasing, about $1.4 billion. They've been privately held. They've got thousands of largely clients in the healthcare and education space. And again, what our objective is, is to take this, combine it with our own purchasing power, which we think allows us to strengthen our purchasing capabilities and ultimately obviously, add scale immediately, but further exploit that scale over time. So more to come relative to the upside potential. But I would say that strategically, this was a very important move for us to strengthen our purchasing capabilities and one that we really think is a leverage-able asset for us."

One of those headwinds are the strategic decisions that we made to either exit unprofitable geographies or unprofitable accounts. Second, like every company out there, there's no doubt that a second headwind has just been the global macro environment. I think third is, there's no doubt the energy sector has been under some pressure.

And so as we roll out a lot of the systems that we've alluded to earlier, that will provide greater transparency for us and will allow us to consolidate control over both receivables and payables that we don't have today. Now having said that, certainly in the short-term, our continued general focus on things like DSO, DPO, et cetera create opportunities for us. And we've made some progress there. And that's partially reflected in the year-over-year improvements we've had thus far in working capital.

That is not something that we're forecasting as part of fourth quarter. So I think it's the 3 things we've been dealing with all year plus that one.

As it relates to the quarter impact to some of the strategic initiatives we've taken on the productivity front, as we had said several times, our investments -- we pull productivity out of the business in terms of the initiatives we have and then we'll reinvest a portion of that back into capabilities, either on the growth side or new business generation. Our investments tend to be front-end loaded, if you're looking at our fiscal calendar. And so if we are showing about a 50-basis-point improvement on a year-over-year basis, if you just look at the productivity initiatives in the first half of the year, we would've reinvested probably about half of the productivity that we pulled out of the business, so kind of yielding about 50%. Our yield's up to somewhere 2/3, 75% of the productivity that we realized in the third quarter as the intensity of some of the investment starts to tail off in the second half of the year.

Europe has performed well, both in the quarter and year-to-date. I think if you look at lines of business within our international geography, you really have to go country by country.

The -- our China business is largely a facilities business in the Healthcare space. It's continued to perform very, very well.

I'm happy to report strong third quarter financial results. We posted organic sales growth in the quarter of 4%, net of about a point of strategic actions that we discussed in our last earnings call. Said differently, our underlying business grew in the mid-single digits for the quarter. Solid productivity gains drove meaningful profitability expansion on a constant currency basis. Margins increased 50 basis points, adjusted operating income grew 15% and adjusted EPS was $0.34, a 17% increase from prior year.
Our outlook for the full year remains unchanged. So all in, a really good quarter on multiple fronts. Not only were our financial and operational results strong, we were also busy in the marketplace. We hosted and serviced multiple major sports playoff events, launched an innovative celebrity partnership that really enhances our product offerings. We hit the ground running in Yosemite National Park, provided food service to both the RNC and DNC conventions and also received more external recognition awards. Also in early August, we acquired HPSI, a company that will help strengthen our group purchasing capabilities, particularly in healthcare and the education sectors.
And I'd like to thank the 270,000-strong Aramark team members that are clearly rallying behind our focused strategy, which is driving increased customer and employee satisfaction and accelerating financial performance, which in turn is creating meaningful shareholder value.
So let me dive a bit deeper on our third quarter results. Looking at revenue and as I mentioned a moment ago, third quarter organic growth was 4%, net of about 150 basis points in previously identified headwinds, 100 basis points of strategic actions and roughly 50 basis points of energy pressures. The quarterly sales momentum was driven by our base business expansion, new business growth, we continued to see solid retention and to a lesser degree, about 0.5 point benefit from the timing of Easter. For the full year, both retention rates and new business wins are tracking consistently with the past few years, which indicates mid-90s retention and roughly $1 billion in new business wins for the year. Our North America business showed solid 5% organic sales growth in the quarter. New business wins remain strong, including the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the University of Pennsylvania and the Tennessee Department of Corrections. Notable performances were turned in by our education, as well as our sports and leisure sectors, as we scaled up our operations in Yosemite and saw strong playoff performance in both the NBA and the NHL.
And to that end, I'd like to congratulate our partners, the Pittsburgh Penguins, on their win of the NHL Stanley Cup, as well as the Cleveland Cavaliers on their win of the NBA championship. We have now proudly served just about every major professional and college champion this past season. We started off the season with the Major League Baseball world champion, Kansas City Royals, followed by the Denver Broncos in the NFL and then the Penguins and the Cavs. In NCAA Football, the University of Alabama; NCAA Basketball, the Villanova Wildcats; men's and women lacrosse champions from the University of North Carolina; and the NCAA Baseball champion, Coastal Carolina University. And while a playoff spot for a client does not generally influence our quarterly financial results in a material way, it was quite an impressive run this year, and we are thrilled to serve and be the partner of champions.
Our international segment grew organic sales by 1%, net of about 200 basis points attributed to our exit of nonstrategic geographies. Absent those strategic decisions and energy headwinds, our underlying international segment continues to experience solid base sales growth led by China and Mexico, which were both up solid double-digit. We also saw good mid-single digit growth in Europe, led by Ireland, Germany and Spain.
The uniform segment performed well in the quarter and continues to benefit from our recent investments in capacity expansion, but did experience a modest slower demand from our energy clients, which resulted in organic sales growth of 2% in the quarter. Innovation and quality continue to be a major focal point for us across the entire business, particularly in the important area of health and wellness. During the quarter, we announced a strategic partnership with TV personality, restaurateur and Iron Chef, Cat Cora, to develop an exclusive concept called OLILO by Cat Cora, which focuses on healthy, made-your-way Mediterranean cuisine. We're also testing a healthy micromarket concept featuring 80% better-for-you offerings, which we expect to roll across our portfolio in the near future.
These initiatives and many more to come really support the goals of our Healthy for Life 20 by 20 partnership with the American Heart Association and stay on point with consumer market trends related to healthy eating.
Moving on to productivity. I'm pleased to report that our margin march continues. We continue to attack food and labor costs. On food, these gains are driven by focusing on reducing waste as well as complexity across our supply chain. We're doing that by simplifying our menu offerings and streamlining our supply chain with fewer SKUs. On the labor front, our ongoing efforts are focused on driving headcount productivity while ensuring we continue to reduce overtime and agency hours. And as we've mentioned previously, we continue to roll out new technology solutions. And that's a way for us to reduce complexity in the supply chain. In our Ariba pilot accounts, we've been able to trim the number of recipes by 30% and reduce the number of SKUs by more than 50%, while simultaneously improving electronic invoicing and payments by 40%.
Finally, we continue to ensure our above-unit costs are appropriate by continuing to look at spans and layers to facilitate clear roles and responsibilities. These productivity gains are tangible, and in the third quarter, they helped drive a 17% increase in North America constant currency adjusted operating income, which led to a 50 basis point increase in North American constant currency AOI margin.
Our international segment delivered a 7% increase in constant currency AOI and 30 basis points of constant currency margin expansion. And in uniforms, we saw a 5% increase in AOI, coupled with 50 basis points of margin expansion. As we communicated to you at our Investor Day, we are committed to expanding our margins 100 basis points over a 3-year time frame, and we're certainly on track to do so. One important driver of this opportunity is leveraging our purchasing power through both scale and technology. And with this strategic goal in mind, the HPSI acquisition we announced a few weeks ago gives us access to industry-leading and complementary supply chain management and technology in the group purchasing space, particularly in Healthcare and Education.
In the area of attracting and retaining talent, we continue to make gains and achieve external accolades. During the quarter, we were named to Latino Magazine's LATINO 100, an annual listing that spotlights companies providing the most viable business opportunities for Latinos. Aramark's support of its diverse family includes its many employee resource groups.
And a final note for the quarter, one of which I think helps illustrate the breadth of our business, TripAdvisor, the world's largest travel site, awarded 28 Aramark-managed lodges, restaurants and attractions, their 2016 Certificate of Excellence. A few of our locations that were recognized include: The Majestic Yosemite Hotel, park Lake Crescent Lodge in Olympic National Park and the Wahweap Campground at Lake Powell.
So all in, I feel good about both the quarter and our year-to-date progress. For the first 9 months of fiscal 2016, we've grown organic revenue by 3% net of strategic actions. AOI constant currency is up 9% year-over-year, and constant currency adjusted EPS is growing double-digit by 11%. The business is performing consistently with the multiyear goals that we identified at Investor Day, and we remain very encouraged with our transformative progress.
With that, let me turn the call over to Steve, who'll go a little more detail into the numbers."
1004106,378067107,1033101,"Aramark, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 10, 2016",2016-08-10,"Earnings Calls","Aramark","Executives","Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone.As Eric just described, we delivered both a strong operational and financial quarter, and we continue to make steady, solid progress against our targets. I'm going to start on Slide 4 and walk through the Q3 reve",1553,"Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone.
As Eric just described, we delivered both a strong operational and financial quarter, and we continue to make steady, solid progress against our targets. I'm going to start on Slide 4 and walk through the Q3 revenue reconciliation versus the prior year.
We reported third quarter sales of nearly $3.6 billion in 2016. As you can see, this is $100 million more than the $3.5 billion we reported in the third quarter of 2015, which equates to a 3% increase on a GAAP basis. As we get further into the year, we are seeing the headwinds from a stronger U.S. dollar start to dissipate. In the third quarter, translated revenue from our international countries was reduced by $45 million or approximately 1%. This compares to about a 2.5% headwind in the first half of the year from currency.
Moving down to reconciliation. We recorded approximately $16 million in revenue from our Irish acquisition, which was disclosed last quarter. We exclude material acquisition-related results from our calculation of organic for the first year of ownership. In the case of Avoca, we expect to record over $50 million in GAAP revenue by the conclusion of the fiscal year. Our organic revenue therefore increased approximately $130 million in the quarter or 4%. The revenue influences regarding Easter, energy and our strategic portfolio actions that we identified on our last call remain unchanged. Therefore, the 4% organic sales growth for the total company is net of about 100 basis points of strategic portfolio actions and 50 basis points of energy headwind year-over-year, but it is benefiting by about 50 basis points from the timing of Easter. Taking all of this together, the underlying base business grew in the mid-single digits.
Specific to the base business. In North America FSS, we had notable revenue gains in our sports, leisure and entertainment and higher education businesses. In the quarter, we on-boarded a number of new higher ed accounts, benefited from the first quarter of full operations at Yosemite, whereby we recorded approximately $45 million of revenue, and picked up about 0.5 point of sales from incremental year-on-year sports activity, largely driven by the NBA and the NHL playoffs.
Underlying sales in the international segment continued to grow nicely and were offset by previously announced strategic portfolio actions, which impacted the sector by about 200 basis points in the quarter. Our uniform segment recorded 2% growth in the quarter. Lower employment levels among certain clients in the energy-related industries reduced our revenue in this segment by approximately 1%.
Let's move on to Slide 5 to discuss the changes in adjusted operating income and profitability during the quarter. In general, we continue to make excellent progress in this regard, led by productivity initiatives and our strategic portfolio-pruning actions.
Third quarter 2016 adjusted operating income was $202 million, which is approximately 14% higher than the prior year's $178 million. However, we did incur a modest 1% currency headwind on earnings during the quarter, which is consistent with the revenue discussion of a few minutes ago. Therefore, on a constant currency basis, our adjusted operating income improved 15% year-over-year. Our AOI margin increased to 5.6%, which is a record level of profitability for us as a public company in the third quarter. All 3 segments reported solid improvement in adjusted operating income, with North America FSS up 17%, International FSS up 7% and uniforms up 5% on a currency-neutral year-over-year basis. Broad productivity initiatives favorably impacted all of our segments, while specific portfolio pruning further benefited North America and International.
Slide 6 provides a roll-forward to help bridge our adjusted EPS year-over-year. Our adjusted EPS increased to $0.34 per share in the quarter, versus the $0.29 per share we reported in the third quarter of 2015. And that's an increase of 17%. Currency translation was not material to the adjusted EPS calculation in the quarter. Adjusted interest expense was essentially flat for the quarter year-over-year, and the adjusted effective tax rate was modestly higher than the prior year quarter. As is our typical practice, our non-GAAP disclosures are reconciled in this morning's press release in the quarter. Standard adjustments were made for LBO-related amortization, stock-based compensation and transformation charges, which primarily consist of severance from the prior year's previously announced actions.
Two items of note here in the quarter. Consistent with our past practice, we have excluded the benefit of $11 million in gains related to our fuel hedging program, and in the calculation of adjusted net income, we've excluded $31 million in one-time costs related to the $1 billion refinancing transaction that was executed in May.
Moving to Slide 7. Our balance sheet and our financial flexibility continues to get stronger each and every quarter. We ended Q3 with almost $200 million of cash on hand, and our revolver was completely undrawn. Together, these provide over $900 million in available liquidity to us. Our leverage ratio, as measured by total debt to adjusted EBITDA, improved approximately 40 basis points year-on-year in the quarter to 4x.
Total debt was lower year-over-year by $185 million. As I referenced earlier, we did execute $1 billion worth of refinancing in the quarter through the reopening and upsizing by $500 million, our 5 1/8% notes that were due -- are due in 2024. In conjunction with issuing a new $500 million, 4 3/4% 10-year note due 2026, the average effective interest rate on the transaction was 4.6%, and I'm happy to report that's the best outcome in terms of coupon in the company's recent history for a long-term unsecured bond issue [ph]. In early August, as Eric mentioned, we closed the acquisition of HPSI for approximately $140 million, and we funded that transaction with cash on hand. We continue to expect our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at the end of the year to be a touch below 4x.
On Slide 8, I'll make a few comments regarding our outlook for the remainder of the year. To be succinct, our outlook for the year related to EPS is unchanged, the range of $1.65 to $1.75 per share. Given that we have 3 quarters of the year behind us, we would now expect to be approximately at the middle of that range by the time we close the year. Note, this will be after we've incurred a $0.03 headwind from currency versus the expectations we had at the time we gave guidance. Therefore, the underlying business performance will be at the higher end of our beginning-of-the-year expectations.
We often speak of the diverse nature and geographic mix of our client portfolio as a point of resiliency for our business model, and this is a mitigator -- this mitigator of concentration risk holds true for us in the context of Brexit as well. While there is no doubt the U.K. is an important geography for us, sterling-denominated sales represent about 3% of the total company sales. Therefore, at current sterling rates, we would expect about an annualized $60 million revenue reduction, several million dollars of lower EBIT, all of which would equate to about a $0.01. However, due to its timing in this fiscal year ,for the remainder of 2016, I would not expect direct Brexit impact to be material to our results.
I continue to expect capital spending for the year to be approximately 3.5% of sales at this point. We continue to see and we will continue to invest in growth-generating opportunities while remaining cognizant of the need to continue to drive higher returns on the capital that we invest. Our free cash flow is now expected to be at least $225 million, which would be 20% greater than our 2015 free cash flow. A number of factors are influencing this improvement. But in general, I can say we remain very focused on meaningfully impacting the various levers that are available to us to improve both working capital and free cash flow conversion as we look out into the future.
Our segment expectations for the second half of 2016 are on the right, and you will see they're unchanged from the last call, and they remain directionally consistent with our longer-term algorithm expectations for both broad-based and balanced improvement in the business, both in terms of revenue growth as well as margin expansion.
At current exchange rates, currency translation should not be material to us for the remainder of the year. On a full-year basis, our underlying organic revenue growth should be right in the center of our long-term framework. However, what we report as organic revenue for the year will be reduced by the 150 basis points of previously discussed strategic portfolio actions and energy headwinds. Looking into 2017, even after incorporating the uncertainties that exist in the global macroeconomic situation, it is certainly our expectation that the business' momentum is sustainable and supportive of both our multiyear framework and the 3-year margin expansion goal that we laid out this past December.
We're currently working through our 2017 budget process. But at this point in time, our expectations are that 2017 will be largely consistent with our multiyear framework, and we will provide a more detailed view of 2017 expectations in November.
I'll now turn the call back over to Eric for some closing remarks in advance of Q&A. Eric?"

So the underlying SG&A spend of the company is quite consistent. We continue to have year-over-year, we will have lower SG&A spending as we continue to look at the initiatives that Eric referenced earlier.

They've been privately held. They've got thousands of largely clients in the healthcare and education space. And again, what our objective is, is to take this, combine it with our own purchasing power, which we think allows us to strengthen our purchasing capabilities and ultimately, obviously, add scale immediately, but further exploit that scale over time. So more to come relative to the upside potential. But I would say that strategically, this was a very important move for us to strengthen our purchasing capabilities and one that we really think is a leverage-able asset for us."

I think as we look at the business, what we were trying to say is there's no debate in 2016 that we have a couple of headwinds. One of those headwinds are the strategic decisions that we made to either exit unprofitable geographies or unprofitable accounts. Second, like every company out there, there's no doubt that a second headwind has just been the global macro environment. I think third is, there's no doubt the energy sector has been under some pressure. And so as we talked about our top line focus, we continue to remain very, very positive about the pipeline, which looks very good. We continue to be confident in our growth prospects going forward. I think what we were trying to say is that our focus will be on profitable growth.

On a medium-term basis, we remain a -- I think we have opportunities in front of us to just consolidate control over some of the larger working capital levers, right. The historical decentralization of the company has put us in a position where we don't have a single source or a single point of contact where we collect all the money that's due to us or where we even disperse all of the funds. And so as we roll out a lot of the systems that we've alluded to earlier, that will provide greater transparency for us and will allow us to consolidate control over both receivables and payables that we don't have today. Now having said that, certainly in the short term, a continued general focus on things like DSO, DPO, et cetera, create opportunities for us. And we've made some progress there. And that's partially reflected in the year-over-year improvements we've had thus far in working capital. So I continue to think we have both short-term and medium-term opportunities for us, but they're going to be, to some extent, dependent on the timing that we roll out systems and consolidate functions behind the -- behind the scenes."

Now as we get closer to kind of a mid-3 sort of a number, we certainly will have more flexibility around how we would choose to allocate that capital. So my sense is if you look at just the rate of EBITDA improvement in general and the rate of free cash flow generation, you're probably looking at a largely deleveraging-focused initiative into the next fiscal year. And beyond that, if we achieve the objectives that we've set out for ourselves, I think we start to enter into a period where we'll have a little more flexibility around how we deploy that capital, but it's probably 12 months out."

Our investments tend to be front-end loaded, if you're looking at our fiscal calendar. And so if we are showing about a 50 basis point improvement on a year-over-year basis, if you just look at the productivity initiatives in the first half of the year, we would've reinvested probably about half of the productivity that we pulled out of the business, so kind of yielding about 50%. Our yield's up to somewhere 2/3, 75% of the productivity that we realized in the third quarter as the intensity of some of the investment starts to tail off in the second half of the year.

The -- our China business is largely a facilities business in the healthcare space. It's continued to perform very, very well.

So the international, the base business international is growing where we would really expect it to do, which is kind of that mid-single digits.

I'm happy to report strong third quarter financial results. We posted organic sales growth in the quarter of 4%, net of about a point of strategic actions that we discussed in our last earnings call. Said differently, our underlying business grew in the mid-single digits for the quarter. Solid productivity gains drove meaningful profitability expansion on a constant currency basis. Margins increased 50 basis points, adjusted operating income grew 15% and adjusted EPS was $0.34, a 17% increase from prior year.
Our outlook for the full year remains unchanged. So all in, a really good quarter on multiple fronts. Not only were our financial and operational results strong, we were also busy in the marketplace. We hosted and serviced multiple major sports playoff events, launched an innovative celebrity partnership that really enhances our product offerings. We hit the ground running in Yosemite National Park, provided food service to both the RNC and DNC conventions and also received more external recognition awards. Also in early August, we acquired HPSI, a company that will help strengthen our group purchasing capabilities, particularly in healthcare and the education sectors.
And I'd like to thank the 270,000-strong Aramark team members that are clearly rallying behind our focused strategy, which is driving increased customer and employee satisfaction and accelerating financial performance, which in turn is creating meaningful shareholder value.
So let me dive a bit deeper on our third quarter results. Looking at revenue and as I mentioned a moment ago, third quarter organic growth was 4%, net of about 150 basis points in previously identified headwinds, 100 basis points of strategic actions and roughly 50 basis points of energy pressures. The quarterly sales momentum was driven by our base business expansion, new business growth, we continued to see solid retention and to a lesser degree, about 0.5 point benefit from the timing of Easter. For the full year, both retention rates and new business wins are tracking consistently with the past few years, which indicates mid-90s retention and roughly $1 billion in new business wins for the year. Our North America business showed solid 5% organic sales growth in the quarter. New business wins remain strong, including the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the University of Pennsylvania and the Tennessee Department of Corrections. Notable performances were turned in by our education, as well as our sports and leisure sectors, as we scaled up our operations in Yosemite and saw strong playoff performance in both the NBA and the NHL.
And to that end, I'd like to congratulate our partners, the Pittsburgh Penguins, on their win of the NHL Stanley Cup as well as the Cleveland Cavaliers on their win of the NBA championship. We have now proudly served just about every major professional and college champion this past season. We started off the season with the Major League Baseball world champion, Kansas City Royals, followed by the Denver Broncos in the NFL and then the Penguins and the Cavs. In NCAA Football, the University of Alabama; NCAA Basketball, the Villanova Wildcats; men's and women lacrosse champions from the University of North Carolina; and the NCAA Baseball champion, Coastal Carolina University. And while a playoff spot for a client does not generally influence our quarterly financial results in a material way, it was quite an impressive run this year, and we are thrilled to serve and be the partner of champions.
Our international segment grew organic sales by 1%, net of about 200 basis points attributed to our exit of nonstrategic geographies. Absent those strategic decisions and energy headwinds, our underlying international segment continues to experience solid base sales growth led by China and Mexico, which were both up solid double-digit. We also saw good mid-single digit growth in Europe, led by Ireland, Germany and Spain.
The uniform segment performed well in the quarter and continues to benefit from our recent investments in capacity expansion, but did experience a modest slower demand from our energy clients, which resulted in organic sales growth of 2% in the quarter. Innovation and quality continue to be a major focal point for us across the entire business, particularly in the important area of health and wellness. During the quarter, we announced a strategic partnership with TV personality, restaurateur and Iron Chef, Cat Cora, to develop an exclusive concept called OLILO by Cat Cora, which focuses on healthy, made-your-way Mediterranean cuisine. We're also testing a healthy micromarket concept featuring 80% better-for-you offerings, which we expect to roll across our portfolio in the near future.
These initiatives and many more to come really support the goals of our Healthy for Life 20 by 20 partnership with the American Heart Association and stay on point with consumer market trends related to healthy eating.
Moving on to productivity. I'm pleased to report that our margin march continues. We continue to attack food and labor costs. On food, these gains are driven by focusing on reducing waste as well as complexity across our supply chain. We're doing that by simplifying our menu offerings and streamlining our supply chain with fewer SKUs. On the labor front, our ongoing efforts are focused on driving headcount productivity while ensuring we continue to reduce overtime and agency hours. And as we've mentioned previously, we continue to roll out new technology solutions. And that's a way for us to reduce complexity in the supply chain. In our Ariba pilot accounts, we've been able to trim the number of recipes by 30% and reduce the number of SKUs by more than 50%, while simultaneously improving electronic invoicing and payments by 40%.
Finally, we continue to ensure our above-unit costs are appropriate by continuing to look at spans and layers to facilitate clear roles and responsibilities. These productivity gains are tangible, and in the third quarter, they helped drive a 17% increase in North America constant currency adjusted operating income, which led to a 50 basis point increase in North American constant currency AOI margin.
Our international segment delivered a 7% increase in constant currency AOI and 30 basis points of constant currency margin expansion. And in uniforms, we saw a 5% increase in AOI, coupled with 50 basis points of margin expansion. As we communicated to you at our Investor Day, we are committed to expanding our margins 100 basis points over a 3-year time frame, and we're certainly on track to do so. One important driver of this opportunity is leveraging our purchasing power through both scale and technology. And with this strategic goal in mind, the HPSI acquisition we announced a few weeks ago gives us access to industry-leading and complementary supply chain management and technology in the group purchasing space, particularly in Healthcare and Education.
In the area of attracting and retaining talent, we continue to make gains and achieve external accolades. During the quarter, we were named to Latino Magazine's LATINO 100, an annual listing that spotlights companies providing the most viable business opportunities for Latinos. Aramark's support of its diverse family includes its many employee resource groups.
And a final note for the quarter, one of which I think helps illustrate the breadth of our business, TripAdvisor, the world's largest travel site, awarded 28 Aramark-managed lodges, restaurants and attractions, their 2016 Certificate of Excellence. A few of our locations that were recognized include: The Majestic Yosemite Hotel, park Lake Crescent Lodge in Olympic National Park and the Wahweap Campground at Lake Powell.
So all in, I feel good about both the quarter and our year-to-date progress. For the first 9 months of fiscal 2016, we've grown organic revenue by 3% net of strategic actions. AOI constant currency is up 9% year-over-year, and constant currency adjusted EPS is growing double-digit by 11%. The business is performing consistently with the multiyear goals that we identified at Investor Day, and we remain very encouraged with our transformative progress.
With that, let me turn the call over to Steve, who'll go a little more detail into the numbers."
1004106,378067107,1033287,"Aramark, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 10, 2016",2016-08-10,"Earnings Calls","Aramark","Executives","Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone.As Eric just described, we delivered both a strong operational and financial quarter, and we continue to make steady, solid progress against our targets. I'm going to start on Slide 4 and walk through the Q3 reve",1553,"Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone.
As Eric just described, we delivered both a strong operational and financial quarter, and we continue to make steady, solid progress against our targets. I'm going to start on Slide 4 and walk through the Q3 revenue reconciliation versus the prior year.
We reported third quarter sales of nearly $3.6 billion in 2016. As you can see, this is $100 million more than the $3.5 billion we reported in the third quarter of 2015, which equates to a 3% increase on a GAAP basis. As we get further into the year, we are seeing the headwinds from a stronger U.S. dollar start to dissipate. In the third quarter, translated revenue from our international countries was reduced by $45 million or approximately 1%. This compares to about a 2.5% headwind in the first half of the year from currency.
Moving down to reconciliation. We recorded approximately $16 million in revenue from our Irish acquisition, which was disclosed last quarter. We exclude material acquisition-related results from our calculation of organic for the first year of ownership. In the case of Avoca, we expect to record over $50 million in GAAP revenue by the conclusion of the fiscal year. Our organic revenue therefore increased approximately $130 million in the quarter or 4%. The revenue influences regarding Easter, energy and our strategic portfolio actions that we identified on our last call remain unchanged. Therefore, the 4% organic sales growth for the total company is net of about 100 basis points of strategic portfolio actions and 50 basis points of energy headwind year-over-year, but it is benefiting by about 50 basis points from the timing of Easter. Taking all of this together, the underlying base business grew in the mid-single digits.
Specific to the base business. In North America FSS, we had notable revenue gains in our sports, leisure and entertainment and higher education businesses. In the quarter, we on-boarded a number of new higher ed accounts, benefited from the first quarter of full operations at Yosemite, whereby we recorded approximately $45 million of revenue, and picked up about 0.5 point of sales from incremental year-on-year sports activity, largely driven by the NBA and the NHL playoffs.
Underlying sales in the international segment continued to grow nicely and were offset by previously announced strategic portfolio actions, which impacted the sector by about 200 basis points in the quarter. Our uniform segment recorded 2% growth in the quarter. Lower employment levels among certain clients in the energy-related industries reduced our revenue in this segment by approximately 1%.
Let's move on to Slide 5 to discuss the changes in adjusted operating income and profitability during the quarter. In general, we continue to make excellent progress in this regard, led by productivity initiatives and our strategic portfolio-pruning actions.
Third quarter 2016 adjusted operating income was $202 million, which is approximately 14% higher than the prior year's $178 million. However, we did incur a modest 1% currency headwind on earnings during the quarter, which is consistent with the revenue discussion of a few minutes ago. Therefore, on a constant currency basis, our adjusted operating income improved 15% year-over-year. Our AOI margin increased to 5.6%, which is a record level of profitability for us as a public company in the third quarter. All 3 segments reported solid improvement in adjusted operating income, with North America FSS up 17%, International FSS up 7% and uniforms up 5% on a currency-neutral year-over-year basis. Broad productivity initiatives favorably impacted all of our segments, while specific portfolio pruning further benefited North America and International.
Slide 6 provides a roll-forward to help bridge our adjusted EPS year-over-year. Our adjusted EPS increased to $0.34 per share in the quarter, versus the $0.29 per share we reported in the third quarter of 2015. And that's an increase of 17%. Currency translation was not material to the adjusted EPS calculation in the quarter. Adjusted interest expense was essentially flat for the quarter year-over-year, and the adjusted effective tax rate was modestly higher than the prior year quarter. As is our typical practice, our non-GAAP disclosures are reconciled in this morning's press release in the quarter. Standard adjustments were made for LBO-related amortization, stock-based compensation and transformation charges, which primarily consist of severance from the prior year's previously announced actions.
Two items of note here in the quarter. Consistent with our past practice, we have excluded the benefit of $11 million in gains related to our fuel hedging program, and in the calculation of adjusted net income, we've excluded $31 million in one-time costs related to the $1 billion refinancing transaction that was executed in May.
Moving to Slide 7. Our balance sheet and our financial flexibility continues to get stronger each and every quarter. We ended Q3 with almost $200 million of cash on hand, and our revolver was completely undrawn. Together, these provide over $900 million in available liquidity to us. Our leverage ratio, as measured by total debt to adjusted EBITDA, improved approximately 40 basis points year-on-year in the quarter to 4x.
Total debt was lower year-over-year by $185 million. As I referenced earlier, we did execute $1 billion worth of refinancing in the quarter through the reopening and upsizing by $500 million, our 5 1/8% notes that were due -- are due in 2024. In conjunction with issuing a new $500 million, 4 3/4% 10-year note due 2026, the average effective interest rate on the transaction was 4.6%, and I'm happy to report that's the best outcome in terms of coupon in the company's recent history for a long-term unsecured bond issue [ph]. In early August, as Eric mentioned, we closed the acquisition of HPSI for approximately $140 million, and we funded that transaction with cash on hand. We continue to expect our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at the end of the year to be a touch below 4x.
On Slide 8, I'll make a few comments regarding our outlook for the remainder of the year. To be succinct, our outlook for the year related to EPS is unchanged, the range of $1.65 to $1.75 per share. Given that we have 3 quarters of the year behind us, we would now expect to be approximately at the middle of that range by the time we close the year. Note, this will be after we've incurred a $0.03 headwind from currency versus the expectations we had at the time we gave guidance. Therefore, the underlying business performance will be at the higher end of our beginning-of-the-year expectations.
We often speak of the diverse nature and geographic mix of our client portfolio as a point of resiliency for our business model, and this is a mitigator -- this mitigator of concentration risk holds true for us in the context of Brexit as well. While there is no doubt the U.K. is an important geography for us, sterling-denominated sales represent about 3% of the total company sales. Therefore, at current sterling rates, we would expect about an annualized $60 million revenue reduction, several million dollars of lower EBIT, all of which would equate to about a $0.01. However, due to its timing in this fiscal year for the remainder of 2016, I would not expect direct Brexit impact to be material to our results.
I continue to expect capital spending for the year to be approximately 3.5% of sales at this point. We continue to see and we will continue to invest in growth-generating opportunities while remaining cognizant of the need to continue to drive higher returns on the capital that we invest. Our free cash flow is now expected to be at least $225 million, which would be 20% greater than our 2015 free cash flow. A number of factors are influencing this improvement. But in general, I can say we remain very focused on meaningfully impacting the various levers that are available to us to improve both working capital and free cash flow conversion as we look out into the future.
Our segment expectations for the second half of 2016 are on the right, and you will see they're unchanged from the last call, and they remain directionally consistent with our longer-term algorithm expectations for both broad-based and balanced improvement in the business, both in terms of revenue growth as well as margin expansion.
At current exchange rates, currency translation should not be material to us for the remainder of the year. On a full-year basis, our underlying organic revenue growth should be right in the center of our long-term framework. However, what we report as organic revenue for the year will be reduced by the 150 basis points of previously discussed strategic portfolio actions and energy headwinds. Looking into 2017, even after incorporating the uncertainties that exist in the global macroeconomic situation, it is certainly our expectation that the business' momentum is sustainable and supportive of both our multiyear framework and the 3-year margin expansion goal that we laid out this past December.
We're currently working through our 2017 budget process. But at this point in time, our expectations are that 2017 will be largely consistent with our multiyear framework, and we will provide a more detailed view of 2017 expectations in November.
I'll now turn the call back over to Eric for some closing remarks in advance of Q&A. Eric?"

So in summary, we continue to execute against our focused strategy. That strategy is driving stronger client relationships, moving us as a company to a best-in-class employer and improving our financial results across businesses and geographies. I think as our momentum illustrates, we've got the right people executing the right strategy, and that strategy balances the continuously improving financial performance with prudent reinvestment to maximize long-term shareholder value.
So taking our progress together with the promising dynamics of the industry and our upside potential, we continue to remain confident in our Right to Win and are really energized by the prospects going forward.
So with that, Caitlyn, we'll open the lines and are happy to take any questions."

So the underlying SG&A spend of the company is quite consistent. We continue to have year-over-year, we will have lower SG&A spending as we continue to look at the initiatives that Eric referenced earlier. But the quarter-to-quarter sequence of SG&A is going to be largely consistent. There's been no significant change in that."

They've been privately held. They've got thousands of largely clients in the healthcare and education space. And again, what our objective is, is to take this, combine it with our own purchasing power, which we think allows us to strengthen our purchasing capabilities and ultimately, obviously, add scale immediately, but further exploit that scale over time.

One of those headwinds are the strategic decisions that we made to either exit unprofitable geographies or unprofitable accounts. Second, like every company out there, there's no doubt that a second headwind has just been the global macro environment. I think third is, there's no doubt the energy sector has been under some pressure.

On a medium-term basis, we remain a -- I think we have opportunities in front of us to just consolidate control over some of the larger working capital levers, right. The historical decentralization of the company has put us in a position where we don't have a single source or a single point of contact where we collect all the money that's due to us or where we even disperse all of the funds. And so as we roll out a lot of the systems that we've alluded to earlier, that will provide greater transparency for us and will allow us to consolidate control over both receivables and payables that we don't have today.

So I continue to think we have both short-term and medium-term opportunities for us, but they're going to be, to some extent, dependent on the timing that we roll out systems and consolidate functions behind the -- behind the scenes."

I think the fourth thing that will have a little bit of an impact again in a quarter, is last year in fourth quarter, we benefited from 2 of our Major League Baseball teams going all the way to the World Series. That is not something that we're forecasting as part of fourth quarter. So I think it's the 3 things we've been dealing with all year, plus that one, that really goes into play relative to the top line in fourth quarter.

Relative to the margin expansion, we've continued, post, if you remember, early in the year in uniforms, we did have some capacity issues that we needed to address on the West Coast.

As it relates to the quarter impact to some of the strategic initiatives we've taken on the productivity front, as we have said several times, our investments -- we pull productivity out of the business in terms of the initiatives we have and then we'll reinvest a portion of that back into capabilities, either on the growth side or new business generation. Our investments tend to be front-end loaded, if you're looking at our fiscal calendar. And so if we are showing about a 50 basis point improvement on a year-over-year basis, if you just look at the productivity initiatives in the first half of the year, we would've reinvested probably about half of the productivity that we pulled out of the business, so kind of yielding about 50%. Our yield's up to somewhere 2/3, 75% of the productivity that we realized in the third quarter as the intensity of some of the investment starts to tail off in the second half of the year.

Europe has performed well, both in the quarter and year-to-date. I think if you look at lines of business within our international geography, you really have to go country by country. So obviously, the South America has been under a bit of pressure, given the mining situation connection to the energy sector. The -- our China business is largely a facilities business in the healthcare space. It's continued to perform very, very well. And then our business in Europe is largely, it's a little more broadly mixed.

Before starting, let me just take a moment to acknowledge the changing of the guard that you just heard in our Investor Relations function. Ian Bailey, whom you all know, has been promoted to our VP of Corporate Planning. Ian has led IR for us since the IPO, and I'd like to thank him for his leadership and invaluable service to everyone on both sides of this call.
I also want to welcome Kate, who just opened the call. Kate is our new Investor Relations leader and joins with a distinguished investor relations and finance background. You'll find Kate every bit as reliable and helpful as Ian, and we remain committed to communicating openly, transparently and proactively with you.
With that last point in mind, let me turn to our latest performance. This morning, we reported a strong quarter and a record fiscal 2016 financial and operating results with the highest margins and profitability in Aramark's history. The consistent execution of our clear and focused strategy resulted in strong 11% adjusted EPS growth on a constant currency basis and 80% improvement in free cash flow, and we continue to strengthen our balance sheet. 2016 marks our third consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth since taking the company public. And the board's recent decision to increase our dividend by 8% is a confirmation of the ongoing momentum in the business.
It really has been a great year and I'm very proud of and want to thank our 270,000 team members for their passion and commitment to deliver against our brand promise and to elevate the customer experience each and every day.
This year, we also completed 2 strategic tuck-in acquisitions. We acquired Avoca, a small Irish specialty food company, which brought a European brand and new offerings to our portfolio. And we also added HPSI, a company with industry-leading technology in the group purchasing space. While these transactions were smaller in nature, they're illustrative of the momentum that we'got in the business, the profitability, balance sheet and line of sight on food and productivity, and how that is giving us the ability to behave more strategically and longer-term-focused. We expect this focus to pay off meaningfully in areas such as portfolio optimization, pricing as well as group purchasing.
Turning to our financial results for the first year -- full year. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.71, an increase of 11% over prior year on a constant currency basis. Total company organic sales were up 2%, net of portfolio strategic actions of about 100 basis points as well as 50 basis points of energy headwinds that we have mentioned previously. When you take those factors into account, our underlying growth was roughly in the middle of our multiyear growth framework.
Turning to our focus on revenue. We continue to achieve strong mid-90s retention rates, with 2016 closing the year at 94% despite about a point of strategic portfolio actions. As a reminder, while a revenue headwind, these strategic actions are accretive to margins.
What is very encouraging from my perspective is that the growth in our business is broad-based across segments, which I think reflects the strength of our well-balanced portfolio. North America organic sales were up 2%, bolstered by new business wins in Education and Sports & Entertainment as well as increases in our base business. Our international organic sales increased 1% due to growth in both Europe and emerging markets. And I'm pleased to report our uniform business grew 3% in the year as we continue to leverage recent capacity expansion in our uniform business to support growth.
In addition to our revenue momentum, we drove significant improvements across food, labor and SG&A productivity while continuing to balance ongoing reinvestment in the business. As a result, we drove almost 40 basis points of margin expansion to 6.5% and an increase in adjusted operating income to $939 million, which is up 8% on a constant currency basis, with all reporting segments showing both margin expansion and improved profitability.
Our improvement in adjusted operating income also helped to strengthen our balance sheet with a 30 basis point reduction in our leverage ratio to 3.9x.
2016's results also reflect meaningful progress against our 3 key strategic tenets: Accelerating growth, activating productivity and attracting the best talent. As we've discussed, in the near-term, we will continue to place a strong margin filter on our growth strategy, but outsourcing prospects remain very robust and our sales pipeline remains encouraging.
As part of our accelerating growth pillar, we will continue to identify new growth opportunities as evidenced by some recent wins in our North America business. In our own backyard here in Philadelphia, we've recently signed 2 leading universities, Drexel University and Temple University, as well as the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections. In our uniform business, we added Publix, the largest employee-owned grocery retailer in the U.S. And outside of North America, we gained a new business dining client, Schaefer Technologies in Germany.
We've also kicked off another successful NFL season where we serve more than 6 million fans annually at 11 stadiums. We opened the new U.S. Bank Stadium, home of the Minnesota Vikings, and recently expanded our partnership with the Super Bowl champion, Denver Broncos, to manage their retail operations in their team's store.
And switching gears to the NHL. We opened the new Rogers Place Stadium in Edmonton, home of the Edmonton Oilers.
This quarter, we also went back to school with several new contracts in our K-12 business, with 250 new recipes based on student feedback and our own research. We're offering more options designed to meet current student preferences such as grab-and-go breakfast items and fresh made-to-order lunch entrées.
Innovating the everyday is what enables us to win both new clients as well as retaining and expanding our existing client relationships. And as we accelerate growth in our food business, we're doing that through an innovation framework centered around promotions, celebrity chef partnerships and proprietary concepts. This framework is driving revenue and consumer satisfaction and loyalty through quarterly, on trend, limited time offers as well as restaurant rotation and seasonal menu highlights.
In addition, we continue to expand our celebrity chef partnerships with celebrity chefs like Cat Cora, Andrew Zimmern, Jimmy Bannos and Danny Meyer, including the debut of the first-ever in-arena Shake Shack at the Wells Fargo Center, home of the Philadelphia Flyers and Philadelphia 76ers.
In our international segment, we're expanding our partnership with Chopped Ireland. Chopped is a successful, healthy food -- fast food franchise working with Aramark to expand its presence in the corporate, education and industry sectors in Ireland.
And turning to our own health and wellness initiatives, I'm pleased to report the year one results from our American Heart Association Healthy for Life 20 by 20 partnership are in. We've reduced -- over 30% of our main dishes now are vegetarian or vegan and over 50% of the entrées or sandwich items now contain 500 calories or less. And in our underserved communities where we're piloting this program, we've increased fruit and vegetable consumption by almost a cup per serving per day.
A critical component of our company's progress is reflected in our second strategic initiative, activating productivity. This year, we delivered substantial improvement in food, labor and SG&A productivity, resulting in almost 40 basis points of margin expansion. Our base productivity remains strong, which facilitated further investment in growth and capability.
It's important to note that the productivity improvement is broad-based across the portfolio as adjusted operating margins increased 30 basis points in North America, 30 basis points in our international business and 40 basis points in our uniform business.
We also continue in our efforts to establish a repeatable business model across the portfolio on -- that allows us to attack inefficiency across our supply chain, everything from menu design to reducing waste. We're also reducing our labor spend through a proactive approach that includes a standard labor model, a flexible model for scheduling and a relentless focus on managing overtime in agencies.
Finally, turning to our third strategic initiative, attracting the best talent. An engaged and productive workforce is critical to our ability to consistently deliver excellent customer service. Core to this is building diverse and inclusive culture where our team members are rewarded and recognized for selling and serving with passion. And one way we do this is through what we call our Ring of Stars program where we recognize front-line employees who embody Aramark's core values, and abiding commitment to customer service, a passion for innovating and a dedication to involvement in the communities we serve. I'm also proud that our engagement efforts were recently recognized by Black Enterprise magazine, which once again, named Aramark as a top 50 best employer for diversity. 
In closing, we're energized by the progress. We continue to make in 2016 along our transformation journey. We also achieved record profitability and we reported the third consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth, all while continuing to reinvest in the business for future growth and value creation. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Steve for a more detailed look at the numbers."

Quickly touching on the fourth quarter. Aside from a stronger than anticipated free cash flow generation, our results are broadly consistent with our previously communicated expectations. Organic growth was fla",1502,"Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Quickly touching on the fourth quarter. Aside from a stronger than anticipated free cash flow generation, our results are broadly consistent with our previously communicated expectations. Organic growth was flat as we continue to face headwinds from energy in all of our lines of business as well as the lingering impact of several strategic portfolio actions. In North America FSS, the incremental benefit of the Yosemite business, was partially offset by weaker top line performance in our health care sector. We delivered meaningful improvement in adjusted operating income and margins due to broad-based productivity gains. Reconciliations of adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter are provided in the appendix. In the interest of time, I will address the remainder of my comments to the full year. 
Before I begin, for those of you less familiar with our story, our multiyear framework for the company envisions 3% to 5% annual revenue growth, mid- to high-single-digit AOI growth, double-digit adjusted EPS growth and specifically by 2018, a 100-basis-point improvement of our AOI margins versus 2015 levels. 
Turning to Slide 5. We reported $14.4 billion in sales on a GAAP basis during 2016 compared to $14.3 billion last year. This is an increase of nearly 1%. As you can see from the slide, currency headwinds related to a stronger U.S. dollar reduced our sales by approximately 2% or $260 [ph] million. Our results were most affected by the Canadian dollar, the euro and the Chilean peso, each of which weaken to the mid and high single digits on average over the fiscal year. In addition, we are continuing to exclude from organic sales approximately $50 million in revenue related to the Avoca acquisition that we completed earlier in the year. 
Adjusting for the currency headwinds M&A impact, organic sales growth for the company was a positive 2%. Our strategic portfolio actions reduced growth by approximately 1%. Combined with about a 50 basis points headwind globally from energy clients in the year, this represents about 150 basis point headwind to growth. Therefore, our underlying organic growth was in the middle of our multiyear framework that I just mentioned. 
Let's now move to Slide 6 for a discussion of our adjusted operating income year-over-year performance. Given we are reporting record levels of adjusted earnings and profitability, we clearly made significant progress in 2016 driven by productivity initiatives and for strategic portfolio actions. In the center of the page, full year 2016 adjusted operating income was $939 million, which is approximately 7% higher than the prior year. We incurred a 1% currency headwind, which is the drop through of the revenue impact I mentioned earlier. Therefore, on a constant currency basis, our adjusted operating income increased 8% year-over-year, which is at the higher end of our framework. Our AOI margin on a constant currency basis increased to a company record of 6.5% for the full year, which was up 36 basis points versus the year-ago figure and a solid start versus our 3-year goal of 100 basis points improvement. 
All 3 segments delivered strong improvements in adjusted operating income with North America FSS up 7%, international FSS up 8%, and uniforms up 6% on a constant currency basis. Productivity momentum was broad-based across all the segments while the portfolio actions favorably impacted North America and international. 
Turning to Slide 7, which provides a roll forward of our adjusted EPS year-over-year. Our adjusted EPS increased to $1.71 in the year versus $1.57 in 2015. Taking into account approximately $0.03 of currency headwind, this represents an 11% increase on a constant currency basis. Both our adjusted tax rate and our interest expense, exclusive of refinancing-related costs were comparable to the prior year. 
Let me spend a minute discussing the reconciling items between our adjusted earnings per share and our GAAP results. We continue to experience the gradual decline in LBO-related intangible amortization and our share-based compensation figure was down as expected given a large amount of IPO-related activity in the prior year. As we get closer to the completion of our current transformation program, our severance-related charges continue to decline. 
On Slide 8. I'll comment on our cash flow and our balance sheet for the year. We grew free cash flow, which we define as cash from operations less CapEx, by 80% in large part due to an increase in net income, a reduction in pension contributions, the timing of certain capital expenditures and declining transformation spending. The record results reported today strongly contributed to strengthen our balance sheet and financial flexibility at the close of 2016. Our year-end liquidity remains strong, and our cash and revolver availability was approximately $865 million at the end of the year. Our total debt to covenant adjusted EBITDA declined by approximately 30 basis points to 3.9x and net capital expenditures for the year were $486 million or approximately 3.4% of sales. 
Our debt profile was significantly improved with approximately $1.4 billion in refinancings, extending maturities 8 to 10 years. We have no required refinancing needs before 2019. However, we will continue to look for attractive market opportunities and be opportunistic as conditions warrant. The increase in our dividend that Eric mentioned will allow us to maintain a payout ratio of approximately 20% to 25% of earnings. This is consistent with our commitment in past practice with regards to balanced capital allocation. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. Absent strategic priorities, we expect to allocate the majority of our 2017 free cash flow beyond what's required to serve as a dividend to debt repayment as we continue to approach our leverage targets. I expect leverage to end 2017 in the range of 3.6 to 3.7x, which will be achieved through a combination of both debt repayment and EBITDA growth. 
Slide 9 details our initial expectations for 2017. We're highly confident that 2017 will deliver another record year of performance for the company. And while the year is going to be quite solid, I will remind everyone that quarters will continue to be lumpy as the business does not, and it won't start, operating on a straight line. With this in mind, I will start on the left-hand side of the page with some 2017 modeling aids. Adjusted EPS is currently expected to be between $1.85 and $1.95 per share, although double-digit EPS improvement from the framework from higher adjusted operating income, combined with a modest tax rate benefit and slightly offset by $0.01 or $0.02 [ph] of currency headwind should land us near the center of that range. Capital spending should be consistent with the last few years in the range of 3.25% to 3.5% of sales. Interest expense should be comparable to 2016 levels, excluding the impact of the prior year's refinancing costs as lower debt levels will be offset by longer average maturities. We expect to see a modest decline in the tax rate. This is largely due to some tax planning coming to fruition as well as the adoption of new accounting standards related to employee share-based compensation. And we expect to generate at least $300 million in free cash flow. 
Turning to revenue expectations for the full year. We expect that the underlying growth in our business will be near the midpoint for the multi year framework. However, we do anticipate about 100 basis points of headwinds from the tail-end of our strategic portfolio action carryover, a less favorable Major League Baseball playoff schedule in our sports business and ongoing pressures in the energy sector, which are now affecting all lines business. Due to these headwinds, we expect reported revenue growth for 2017 at the lower end of the framework. The phasing of the various items impacting our revenue outlook for the year will be felt most heavily in the first half of the year. We'll likely incur several hundred basis points of revenue headwind early in the first half and our performance will improve as the year moves along. 
Therefore, for the first half, we're still expecting a modest revenue growth in all segments, except FSS International, which will be flat relative to the prior year period. In addition, we expect our uniform business to grow at a slightly slower pace in 2017. We're anticipating AOI growth across all segments due to our continued productivity initiatives. However, consistent with prior years, we expect our productivity gains to accelerate in the back half of the year due to higher investment levels in the first half as we continue to lean into margin drivers and opportunities aggressively. Adjusted EPS should follow the same pattern. 
And before I turn the call over to Eric again, I would like to thank Ian Bailey for his contributions to building out from scratch our Investor Relations function over the last 3 [ph] years. I'm thrilled to have someone of Kate's experience join the team, and I wish both of them good luck in their new roles. With that, I'll turn it back over to Eric."

And so I think the net of all of this is the pipeline continues to be -- look encouraged.

So I think we're likely to see for the next couple of quarters that pressure continue.

In Healthcare, sometimes you win or lose also based on the consolidation game and when 2 systems combine depending on the system is the winner of that, there's generally 2 providers and they tend to go to 1 and in the fourth quarter, we had a couple of those where it did not go our way. And so I would expect that for the next -- another couple of quarters, it'll take us to work through the fact that we've been on the wrong end of some of those consolidation place as well."

But essentially, relates to guidance that requires us to treat the tax benefit from share-based compensation a little bit differently than we had done in the past. And so historically, when we take deductions for share-based compensation, we would not have run that through the tax provision. And going forward, the guidance would have us recognize a portion of that -- how much a benefit we ultimately get is very much a function of how much activity there happens to be around equity exercises over the course of the year, and what the share price is, et cetera. So I think we're being -- trying not to get too far ahead of ourselves and trying to guess what people will do in that space. But I believe the planning certainly should -- will provide us a solid benefit on the year-over-year basis all by itself."

And as we talked about our margin march, I think the majority of that margin march is really kind of controlling what we can control, which is managing the existing buckets of food, labor and SG&A. So certainly, as we put that line of demarcation on 100 basis point march over the next 3 years, that is largely just through pure focus on productivity across those 3 levers. We obviously, currently are a big procurer of food. And we do all of that buying directly for ourselves. But as we get into some of these opportunities, we do believe GPO is an opportunity. While HPSI is small in nature, your point about the untapped opportunity I think, is correct. Steve you want to comment?"

I think the market's reaction certainly the last week has indicated that generally, it seems to be positive relative to the business climate. So from our perspective, we'll play a wait-and-see game relative to that. I think relative to your question on inflation again, we've seen, I think the last several years, certainly in 2016, a fairly benign inflationary environment when it comes to food. Again, we purchase a very diverse market basket and have a lot of levers to us, not just pricing lever. But because we have opportunities to change our menu, we can deal with any type of inflationary pressures pretty adeptly. On the labor side. I think as we said in the past, while there has been a lot of talk and even in some states, some action on this front, we feel like we've got a very good plan of action on how to deal with that. And we have been able to mitigate that with a lot of the productivity efforts that we put in place across the labor front. Everything from a more structured in-unit labor model to making sure we schedule our headcount appropriately. We flex that labor and attack overtime in agency labor. So I think when all is said and done relative to inflation, we expect to continue to be fairly benign and very manageable and within our controlled offsetting."

Also, a strategic actions is about 1% on the revenue side in terms of what we talked about from a headwind. And generally, they are accretive to us. But Eric is right. A much smaller proportion than what we do within a productivity side. From an energy perspective, our primarily energy exposure has been in our business in Canada where we do remote while sounds servicing in those fields as well as platforms in the North sea also the U.K. So I would say we felt the changes in levels where there's a higher cost of extraction which would make sense obviously, early to mid-2015 type of an experience. And then as energy stayed at lower levels that it had been moving into 2016, we started to see more of an impact in the European business where you had more fixed cost permanently I for platforms where there much slower to make decisions around deployment levels ultimately on those platforms. And so most of what we're talking about as energy in '17 is European-related. And then as Eric mentioned. Within our uniform business where we have probably the longest lag time on some of the employment and some of the oil service type of industries and those employment levels continue to come down based on what some of the coast companies are announcing versus a modest headwind there. And then finally on the the change in deferred taxes some of that is purely going to be accounting driven and the accounting of payments that we made various international stage related because of some of the equity that have been through the course of the year, we took some deductions are on the way some of our payments are made which influence that particular line item."

Before starting, let me just take a moment to acknowledge the changing of the guard that you just heard in our Investor Relations function.

Ian has led IR for us since the IPO, and I'd like to thank him for his leadership and invaluable service to everyone on both sides of this call.
I also want to welcome Kate, who just opened the call. Kate is our new Investor Relations leader and joins with a distinguished investor relations and finance background. You'll find Kate every bit as reliable and helpful as Ian, and we remain committed to communicating openly, transparently and proactively with you.
With that last point in mind, let me turn to our latest performance. This morning, we reported a strong quarter and a record fiscal 2016 financial and operating results with the highest margins and profitability in Aramark's history. The consistent execution of our clear and focused strategy resulted in strong 11% adjusted EPS growth on a constant currency basis and 80% improvement in free cash flow, and we continue to strengthen our balance sheet. 2016 marks our third consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth since taking the company public. And the board's recent decision to increase our dividend by 8% is a confirmation of the ongoing momentum in the business.
It really has been a great year and I'm very proud of and want to thank our 270,000 team members for their passion and commitment to deliver against our brand promise and to elevate the customer experience each and every day.
This year, we also completed 2 strategic tuck-in acquisitions. We acquired Avoca, a small Irish specialty food company, which brought a European brand and new offerings to our portfolio. And we also added HPSI, a company with industry-leading technology in the group purchasing space. While these transactions were smaller in nature, they're illustrative of the momentum that we'got in the business, the profitability, balance sheet and line of sight on food and productivity, and how that is giving us the ability to behave more strategically and longer-term-focused. We expect this focus to pay off meaningfully in areas such as portfolio optimization, pricing as well as group purchasing.
Turning to our financial results for the first year -- full year. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.71, an increase of 11% over prior year on a constant currency basis. Total company organic sales were up 2%, net of portfolio strategic actions of about 100 basis points as well as 50 basis points of energy headwinds that we have mentioned previously. When you take those factors into account, our underlying growth was roughly in the middle of our multiyear growth framework.
Turning to our focus on revenue. We continue to achieve strong mid-90s retention rates, with 2016 closing the year at 94% despite about a point of strategic portfolio actions. As a reminder, while a revenue headwind, these strategic actions are accretive to margins.
What is very encouraging from my perspective is that the growth in our business is broad-based across segments, which I think reflects the strength of our well-balanced portfolio. North America organic sales were up 2%, bolstered by new business wins in Education and Sports & Entertainment as well as increases in our base business. Our international organic sales increased 1% due to growth in both Europe and emerging markets. And I'm pleased to report our uniform business grew 3% in the year as we continue to leverage recent capacity expansion in our uniform business to support growth.
In addition to our revenue momentum, we drove significant improvements across food, labor and SG&A productivity while continuing to balance ongoing reinvestment in the business. As a result, we drove almost 40 basis points of margin expansion to 6.5% and an increase in adjusted operating income to $939 million, which is up 8% on a constant currency basis, with all reporting segments showing both margin expansion and improved profitability.
Our improvement in adjusted operating income also helped to strengthen our balance sheet with a 30 basis point reduction in our leverage ratio to 3.9x.
2016's results also reflect meaningful progress against our 3 key strategic tenets: Accelerating growth, activating productivity and attracting the best talent. As we've discussed, in the near-term, we will continue to place a strong margin filter on our growth strategy, but outsourcing prospects remain very robust and our sales pipeline remains encouraging.
As part of our accelerating growth pillar, we will continue to identify new growth opportunities as evidenced by some recent wins in our North America business. In our own backyard here in Philadelphia, we've recently signed 2 leading universities, Drexel University and Temple University, as well as the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections. In our uniform business, we added Publix, the largest employee-owned grocery retailer in the U.S. And outside of North America, we gained a new business dining client, Schaefer Technologies in Germany.
We've also kicked off another successful NFL season where we serve more than 6 million fans annually at 11 stadiums. We opened the new U.S. Bank Stadium, home of the Minnesota Vikings, and recently expanded our partnership with the Super Bowl champion, Denver Broncos, to manage their retail operations in their team's store.
And switching gears to the NHL. We opened the new Rogers Place Stadium in Edmonton, home of the Edmonton Oilers.
This quarter, we also went back to school with several new contracts in our K-12 business, with 250 new recipes based on student feedback and our own research. We're offering more options designed to meet current student preferences such as grab-and-go breakfast items and fresh made-to-order lunch entrées.
Innovating the everyday is what enables us to win both new clients as well as retaining and expanding our existing client relationships. And as we accelerate growth in our food business, we're doing that through an innovation framework centered around promotions, celebrity chef partnerships and proprietary concepts. This framework is driving revenue and consumer satisfaction and loyalty through quarterly, on trend, limited time offers as well as restaurant rotation and seasonal menu highlights.
In addition, we continue to expand our celebrity chef partnerships with celebrity chefs like Cat Cora, Andrew Zimmern, Jimmy Bannos and Danny Meyer, including the debut of the first-ever in-arena Shake Shack at the Wells Fargo Center, home of the Philadelphia Flyers and Philadelphia 76ers.
In our international segment, we're expanding our partnership with Chopped Ireland. Chopped is a successful, healthy food -- fast food franchise working with Aramark to expand its presence in the corporate, education and industry sectors in Ireland.
And turning to our own health and wellness initiatives, I'm pleased to report the year one results from our American Heart Association Healthy for Life 20 by 20 partnership are in. We've reduced -- over 30% of our main dishes now are vegetarian or vegan and over 50% of the entrées or sandwich items now contain 500 calories or less. And in our underserved communities where we're piloting this program, we've increased fruit and vegetable consumption by almost a cup per serving per day.
A critical component of our company's progress is reflected in our second strategic initiative, activating productivity. This year, we delivered substantial improvement in food, labor and SG&A productivity, resulting in almost 40 basis points of margin expansion. Our base productivity remains strong, which facilitated further investment in growth and capability.
It's important to note that the productivity improvement is broad-based across the portfolio as adjusted operating margins increased 30 basis points in North America, 30 basis points in our international business and 40 basis points in our uniform business.
We also continue in our efforts to establish a repeatable business model across the portfolio on -- that allows us to attack inefficiency across our supply chain, everything from menu design to reducing waste. We're also reducing our labor spend through a proactive approach that includes a standard labor model, a flexible model for scheduling and a relentless focus on managing overtime in agencies.
Finally, turning to our third strategic initiative, attracting the best talent. An engaged and productive workforce is critical to our ability to consistently deliver excellent customer service. Core to this is building diverse and inclusive culture where our team members are rewarded and recognized for selling and serving with passion. And one way we do this is through what we call our Ring of Stars program where we recognize frontline employees who embody Aramark's core values, an abiding commitment to customer service, a passion for innovating and a dedication to involvement in the communities we serve. I'm also proud that our engagement efforts were recently recognized by Black Enterprise magazine, which, once again, named Aramark as a top 50 best employer for diversity.
In closing, we're energized by the progress we continue to make in 2016 along our transformation journey. We also achieved record profitability and we've reported the third consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth, all while continuing to reinvest in the business for future growth and value creation.
With that, let me turn the call over to Steve for a more detailed look at the numbers."
1004106,408227482,1086658,"Aramark, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 15, 2016",2016-11-15,"Earnings Calls","Aramark","Executives","Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone.Quickly touching on the fourth quarter, aside from a stronger than anticipated free cash flow generation, our results are broadly consistent with our previously communicated expectations. Organic growth was fl",1505,"Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone.
Quickly touching on the fourth quarter, aside from a stronger than anticipated free cash flow generation, our results are broadly consistent with our previously communicated expectations. Organic growth was flat as we continue to face headwinds from energy in all of our lines of business as well as the lingering impact of several strategic portfolio actions.
In North America FSS, the incremental benefit of the Yosemite business was partially offset by weaker top line performance in our health care sector. We delivered meaningful improvement in adjusted operating income and margins due to broad-based productivity gains.
Reconciliations of adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter are provided in the appendix. In the interest of time, I will address the remainder of my comments to the full year.
Before I begin, for those of you less familiar with our story, our multiyear framework for the company envisions 3% to 5% annual revenue growth, mid- to high-single-digit AOI growth, double-digit adjusted EPS growth and specifically, by 2018, a 100 basis point improvement of our AOI margins versus 2015 levels.
Turning to Slide 5. We reported $14.4 billion in sales on a GAAP basis during 2016 compared to $14.3 billion last year. This is an increase of nearly 1%. As you can see from the slide, currency headwinds related to a stronger U.S. dollar reduced our sales by approximately 2% or $260 million. Our results were most affected by the Canadian dollar, the euro and the Chilean peso, each of which weakened in the mid to high single digits on average over our fiscal year. In addition, we are continuing to exclude from organic sales approximately $50 million in revenue related to the Avoca acquisition that we completed earlier in the year.
Adjusting for the currency headwinds and M&A impact, organic sales growth for the company was a positive 2%. Our strategic portfolio actions reduced growth by approximately 1%. Combined with about a 50 basis point headwind globally from energy clients in the year, this represents about 150 basis point headwind to growth. Therefore, our underlying organic growth was in the middle of our multiyear framework that I just mentioned.
Let's now move to Slide 6 for a discussion of our adjusted operating income year-over-year performance. Given we are reporting record levels of adjusted earnings and profitability, we clearly made significant progress in 2016, driven by productivity initiatives and our strategic portfolio actions.
In the center of the page, full year 2016 adjusted operating income was $939 million, which is approximately 7% higher than the prior year. We incurred a 1% currency headwind, which is the drop through of the revenue impact I mentioned earlier. Therefore, on a constant currency basis, our adjusted operating income increased 8% year-over-year, which is at the higher end of our framework.
Our AOI margin on a constant currency basis increased to a company record of 6.5% for the full year, which was up 36 basis points versus the year-ago figure and a solid start versus our 3-year goal of 100 basis points improvement.
All 3 segments delivered strong improvements in adjusted operating income with North America FSS up 7%, international FSS up 8% and uniforms up 6% on a constant currency basis. Productivity momentum was broad-based across all the segments, while the portfolio actions favorably impacted North America and international.
Turning to Slide 7, which provides a roll forward of our adjusted EPS year-over-year. Our adjusted EPS increased to $1.71 in the year versus $1.57 in 2015. Taking into account approximately $0.03 of currency headwind, this represents an 11% increase on a constant currency basis. Both our adjusted tax rate and our interest expense, exclusive of refinancing-related costs, were comparable to the prior year.
Let me spend a minute discussing the reconciling items between our adjusted earnings per share and our GAAP results. We continue to experience the gradual decline in LBO-related intangible amortization and our share-based compensation figure was down as expected given a large amount of IPO-related activity in the prior year. As we get closer to the completion of our current transformation program, our severance-related charges continue to decline.
On Slide 8, I'll comment on our cash flow and our balance sheet for the year. We grew free cash flow, which we define as cash from operations less CapEx, by 80%, in large part due to an increase in net income, a reduction in pension contributions, the timing of certain capital expenditures and declining transformation spending. The record results reported today strongly contributed to strengthen our balance sheet and financial flexibility at the close of 2016. Our year-end liquidity remains strong and our cash and revolver availability was approximately $865 million at the end of the year.
Our total debt to covenant adjusted EBITDA declined by approximately 30 basis points to 3.9x and net capital expenditures for the year were $486 million or approximately 3.4% of sales. Our debt profile was significantly improved with approximately $1.4 billion in refinancings, extending maturities 8 to 10 years. We have no required refinancing needs before 2019. However, we will continue to look for attractive market opportunities and be opportunistic as conditions warrant.
The increase in our dividend that Eric mentioned will allow us to maintain a payout ratio of approximately 20% to 25% of earnings. This is consistent with our commitment in past practice with regards to balanced capital allocation.
Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. Absent strategic opportunities, we expect to allocate the majority of our 2017 free cash flow beyond what's required to serve as a dividend to debt repayment as we continue to approach our leverage targets. I expect leverage at the end of 2017 in the range of 3.6 to 3.7x, which will be achieved through a combination of both debt repayment and EBITDA growth.
Slide 9 details our initial expectations for 2017. We're highly confident that 2017 will deliver another record year of performance for the company. And while the year is going to be quite solid, I will remind everyone that quarters will continue to be lumpy as the business does not and it won't start operating on a straight line.
With this in mind, I will start on the left-hand side of the page with some 2017 modeling aids. Adjusted EPS is currently expected to be between $1.85 and $1.95 per share, although double-digit EPS improvement from the framework from higher adjusted operating income combined with a modest tax rate benefit and slightly offset by $0.01 or $0.02 of currency headwind should land us near the center of that range. Capital spending should be consistent with the last few years in the range of 3.25% to 3.5% of sales. Interest expense should be comparable to 2016 levels, excluding the impact of the prior year's refinancing costs, as lower debt levels will be offset by longer average maturities. We expect to see a modest decline in the tax rate. This is largely due to some tax planning activity coming to fruition as well as the adoption of new accounting standards related to employee share-based compensation. And we expect to generate at least $300 million in free cash flow.
Turning to revenue expectations for the full year. We expect that the underlying growth in our business will be near the midpoint of the multiyear framework. However, we do anticipate about 100 basis points of headwinds from the tail end of our strategic portfolio action carryover, a less favorable Major League Baseball playoff schedule in our Sports business and ongoing pressures in the energy sector, which are now affecting all lines of business. Due to these headwinds, we expect reported revenue growth for 2017 at the lower end of the framework.
The phasing of the various items impacting our revenue outlook for the year will be felt most heavily in the first half of the year. We'll likely incur several hundred basis points of revenue headwind early in the first half, and our performance will improve as the year moves along.
Therefore, for the first half, we're still expecting modest revenue growth in all segments except FSS International, which will be flat relative to the prior year period. In addition, we expect our uniform business to grow at a slightly slower pace in 2017.
We're anticipating AOI growth across all segments due to our continued productivity initiatives. However, consistent with prior years, we expect our productivity gains to accelerate in the back half of the year due to higher investment levels in the first half as we continue to lean into margin drivers and opportunities aggressively. Adjusted EPS should follow the same pattern.
And before I turn the call over to Eric again, I would like to thank Ian Bailey for his contributions to building out from scratch our investor relations function over the last 3 years. I'm thrilled to have someone of Kate's experience join the team, and I wish both of them good luck in their new roles.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Eric."

I mentioned in my prepared comments, but let me go just a little bit deeper. Relative to new business, we'd had a pretty good run. I think we started the year pretty strong as well, particularly in the Education space. We've picked up a couple of new Departments of Corrections as well. And so I think the net of all of this is the pipeline continues to be -- look encouraged.

Having said that, I think as we look at our Healthcare business during the latter part of the year and going forward, again, there continues to be a large outsourcing opportunity. I think our Right to Win is pretty clear and I think our prospects look pretty bright. Steve?"

I would just add that with any given particular period of time, obviously the pace at which we grow in any of our segments is just a function of the new business we had relative to the existing business that we don't retain. And so we did see in the fourth quarter those numbers flip against us.
And as Eric referenced, the consolidation in the Healthcare space, we often say we tend to win or lose business based on the team that we have on the ground, based on our ability to innovate, based on our ability to provide a great customer experience. In Healthcare, sometimes you win or lose also based on the consolidation game. And when 2 systems combine, depending on the system that is the winner of that, there's generally 2 providers and they tend to go to one. And in the fourth quarter, we had a couple of those where it did not go our way. And so I would expect that for the next another couple of quarters it'll take us to work through the fact that we've been on the wrong end of some of those consolidation plays as well."

I believe the -- I think our rate will be lower in '17 for sure than it was in '16. And I think it's a combination of the 2. We will certainly get a benefit from the implementation of some of the planning that we're starting now. I think we've got further to go on some of our planning opportunities, but you're starting to see kind of the baby steps in that direction. The accounting change and the specific number will escape me, but essentially it relates to guidance that requires us to treat the tax benefit from share-based compensation a little bit differently than we had done in the past.
And so, historically, when we take deductions for share-based compensation, we would not have run that through the tax provision. And then, going forward, the guidance would have us recognize a portion of that. How much a benefit we ultimately get is very much a function of how much activity there happens to be around equity exercises over the course of the year and what the share price is, et cetera. So I think we're being -- trying not to get too far ahead of ourselves in trying to guess what people will do in that space, but I believe the planning certainly should -- will provide us a solid benefit on a year-over-year basis all by itself."

So certainly, as we put that line of demarcation on the 100 basis point march over the next 3 years, that is largely just through pure focus on productivity across those 3 levers.
We obviously currently are a big procurer of food and we do all of that buying directly for ourselves. But as we get into some of these opportunities, we do believe GPO is an opportunity. While HPSI is small in nature, your point about the untapped opportunity, I think, is correct.

Again, I think, from my perspective, at this point, relative to the election, I think it's really impossible to know any specific impacts on our business. I think the market's reaction certainly the last week has indicated that, generally, it seems to be positive relative to the business climate. So from our perspective, we'll play a wait and see game relative to that.
I think relative to your question on inflation, again, we've seen, I think, the last several years, certainly in 2016, a fairly benign inflationary environment when it comes to food. Again, we purchase a very diverse market basket and have a lot of levers to us, not just pricing lever, but because we have opportunities to change our menu, we can deal with any type of inflationary pressures pretty adeptly.
On the labor side, I think as we said in the past, while there has been a lot of talk and even, in some states, some action on this front, we feel like we've got a very good plan of action on how to deal with that. And we've been able to mitigate that with a lot of the productivity efforts that we've put in place across the labor front, everything from a more structured in-unit labor model to making sure we schedule our headcount appropriately. We flex that labor and attack overtime and agency labor.
So I think when all is said and done, relative to inflation, we would expect it to continue to be fairly benign and very manageable and within our controlled offsetting."

So, again, if you look at our North America business, as I said earlier, what we've got, anytime you have a business portfolio that is this diverse, you're going to have puts and takes across the portfolio. So the sectors that are performing well that we called out are sectors like education, sports, leisure, and the ones that are more pressured are kind of the B&I energy headwind impact and the Healthcare sector that we talked about.

Our, I'll say, strategic actions is about 1% on the revenue side in terms of what we've talked about from a headwind. And generally, they are accretive to us. But Eric's right, it's a much smaller proportion than what we do within the productivity side.
From an energy perspective, our primary energy exposure has been in our business in Canada where we do remote oil sands servicing in those fields as well as platforms in the North Sea, also the U.K. And so I would say we felt changes in employment levels in Canada first where there is the highest cost of extraction, which would make sense obviously. That was more of an early to mid-2015 type of an experience. And then, as energy stayed at lower levels that it had been moving into 2016, we started to see more of an impact in the European business where you have more fixed cost permanent type of platforms where they're much slower to make decisions around employment levels, ultimately, on those platforms. And so most of what we're talking about as energy in '17 is European-related.
And then, as Eric mentioned, within our uniform business where we have probably the longest lag time on some of the employment and some of the oil service type of industries, as those employment levels continue to come down just based on what some of those companies are announcing, we're seeing some modest headwind there.
And then, finally, on the free cash flow question, the change in the deferred taxes, some of that is purely going to be accounting-driven and the timing of payments that we made against various federal, state and international obligations. We also -- because of some of the equity activity that happened over the course of the year, we took some deductions around the way some of our payments were made, which influences that particular line item."

I also want to welcome Kate, who just opened the call. Kate is our new Investor Relations leader and joins with a distinguished investor relations and finance background. You'll find Kate every bit as reliable and helpful as Ian, and we remain committed to communicating openly, transparently and proactively with you.
With that last point in mind, let me turn to our latest performance. This morning, we reported a strong quarter and a record fiscal 2016 financial and operating results with the highest margins and profitability in Aramark's history. The consistent execution of our clear and focused strategy resulted in strong 11% adjusted EPS growth on a constant currency basis and 80% improvement in free cash flow, and we continue to strengthen our balance sheet. 2016 marks our third consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth since taking the company public. And the board's recent decision to increase our dividend by 8% is a confirmation of the ongoing momentum in the business.
It really has been a great year and I'm very proud of and want to thank our 270,000 team members for their passion and commitment to deliver against our brand promise and to elevate the customer experience each and every day.
This year, we also completed 2 strategic tuck-in acquisitions. We acquired Avoca, a small Irish specialty food company, which brought a European brand and new offerings to our portfolio. And we also added HPSI, a company with industry-leading technology in the group purchasing space. While these transactions were smaller in nature, they're illustrative of the momentum that we've got in the business, the profitability, balance sheet and line of sight on food and productivity, and how that is giving us the ability to behave more strategically and longer-term-focused. We expect this focus to pay off meaningfully in areas such as portfolio optimization, pricing as well as group purchasing.
Turning to our financial results for the first year -- full year. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.71, an increase of 11% over prior year on a constant currency basis. Total company organic sales were up 2%, net of portfolio strategic actions of about 100 basis points as well as 50 basis points of energy headwinds that we have mentioned previously. When you take those factors into account, our underlying growth was roughly in the middle of our multiyear growth framework.
Turning to our focus on revenue. We continue to achieve strong mid-90s retention rates, with 2016 closing the year at 94% despite about a point of strategic portfolio actions. As a reminder, while a revenue headwind, these strategic actions are accretive to margins.
What is very encouraging from my perspective is that the growth in our business is broad-based across segments, which I think reflects the strength of our well-balanced portfolio. North America organic sales were up 2%, bolstered by new business wins in Education and Sports & Entertainment as well as increases in our base business. Our international organic sales increased 1% due to growth in both Europe and emerging markets. And I'm pleased to report our uniform business grew 3% in the year as we continue to leverage recent capacity expansion in our uniform business to support growth.
In addition to our revenue momentum, we drove significant improvements across food, labor and SG&A productivity while continuing to balance ongoing reinvestment in the business. As a result, we drove almost 40 basis points of margin expansion to 6.5% and an increase in adjusted operating income to $939 million, which was up 8% on a constant currency basis, with all reporting segments showing both margin expansion and improved profitability.
Our improvement in adjusted operating income also helped to strengthen our balance sheet with a 30 basis point reduction in our leverage ratio to 3.9x.
2016's results also reflect meaningful progress against our 3 key strategic tenets: Accelerating growth; activating productivity; and attracting the best talent. As we've discussed, in the near-term, we will continue to place a strong margin filter on our growth strategy, but outsourcing prospects remain very robust and our sales pipeline remains encouraging.
As part of our accelerating growth pillar, we will continue to identify new growth opportunities as evidenced by some recent wins in our North America business. In our own backyard here in Philadelphia, we've recently signed 2 leading universities, Drexel University and Temple University, as well as the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections. In our uniform business, we added Publix, the largest employee-owned grocery retailer in the U.S. And outside of North America, we gained a new business dining client, Schaefer Technologies in Germany.
We've also kicked off another successful NFL season where we serve more than 6 million fans annually at 11 stadiums. We opened the new U.S. Bank Stadium, home of the Minnesota Vikings, and recently expanded our partnership with the Super Bowl champion, Denver Broncos, to manage their retail operations in their team store.
And switching gears to the NHL. We opened the new Rogers Place Stadium in Edmonton, home of the Edmonton Oilers.
This quarter, we also went back to school with several new contracts in our K-12 business, with 250 new recipes based on student feedback and our own research. We're offering more options designed to meet current student preferences such as grab-and-go breakfast items and fresh made-to-order lunch entrées.
Innovating the everyday is what enables us to win both new clients as well as retaining and expanding our existing client relationships. And as we accelerate growth in our food business, we're doing that through an innovation framework centered around promotions, celebrity chef partnerships and proprietary concepts. This framework is driving revenue and consumer satisfaction and loyalty through quarterly, on trend, limited time offers as well as restaurant rotation and seasonal menu highlights.
In addition, we continue to expand our celebrity chef partnerships with celebrity chefs like Cat Cora, Andrew Zimmern, Jimmy Bannos and Danny Meyer, including the debut of the first-ever in-arena Shake Shack at the Wells Fargo Center, home of the Philadelphia Flyers and Philadelphia 76ers.
In our international segment, we're expanding our partnership with Chopped Ireland. Chopped is a successful, healthy food -- fast food franchise working with Aramark to expand its presence in the corporate, education and industry sectors in Ireland.
And turning to our own health and wellness initiatives, I'm pleased to report the year one results from our American Heart Association Healthy for Life 20 by 20 partnership are in. We've reduced -- over 30% of our main dishes now are vegetarian or vegan and over 50% of the entrées or sandwich items now contain 500 calories or less. And in our underserved communities where we're piloting this program, we've increased fruit and vegetable consumption by almost a cup per serving per day.
A critical component of our company's progress is reflected in our second strategic initiative, activating productivity. This year, we delivered substantial improvement in food, labor and SG&A productivity, resulting in almost 40 basis points of margin expansion. Our base productivity remains strong, which facilitated further investment in growth and capability.
It's important to note that the productivity improvement is broad-based across our portfolio as adjusted operating margins increased 30 basis points in North America, 30 basis points in our international business and 40 basis points in our uniform business.
We also continue in our efforts to establish a repeatable business model across the portfolio on -- that allows us to attack inefficiency across our supply chain, everything from menu design to reducing waste. We're also reducing our labor spend through a proactive approach that includes a standard labor model, a flexible model for scheduling and a relentless focus on managing overtime in agencies.
Finally, turning to our third strategic initiative, attracting the best talent. An engaged and productive workforce is critical to our ability to consistently deliver excellent customer service. Core to this is building diverse and inclusive culture where our team members are rewarded and recognized for selling and serving with passion. And one way we do this is through what we call our Ring of Stars program where we recognize frontline employees who embody Aramark's core values, an abiding commitment to customer service, a passion for innovating and a dedication to involvement in the communities we serve. I'm also proud that our engagement efforts were recently recognized by Black Enterprise magazine, which, once again, named Aramark as a top 50 best employer for diversity.
In closing, we're energized by the progress we continue to make in 2016 along our transformation journey. We also achieved record profitability and we've reported the third consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth, all while continuing to reinvest in the business for future growth and value creation.
With that, let me turn the call over to Steve for a more detailed look at the numbers."

Organic growth was fl",1505,"Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone.
Quickly touching on the fourth quarter, aside from a stronger than anticipated free cash flow generation, our results are broadly consistent with our previously communicated expectations. Organic growth was flat as we continue to face headwinds from energy in all of our lines of business as well as the lingering impact of several strategic portfolio actions.
In North America FSS, the incremental benefit of the Yosemite business was partially offset by weaker top line performance in our health care sector. We delivered meaningful improvement in adjusted operating income and margins due to broad-based productivity gains.
Reconciliations of adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter are provided in the appendix. In the interest of time, I will address the remainder of my comments to the full year.
Before I begin, for those of you less familiar with our story, our multiyear framework for the company envisions 3% to 5% annual revenue growth, mid- to high-single-digit AOI growth, double-digit adjusted EPS growth and specifically, by 2018, a 100 basis point improvement of our AOI margins versus 2015 levels.
Turning to Slide 5. We reported $14.4 billion in sales on a GAAP basis during 2016 compared to $14.3 billion last year. This is an increase of nearly 1%. As you can see from the slide, currency headwinds related to a stronger U.S. dollar reduced our sales by approximately 2% or $260 million. Our results were most affected by the Canadian dollar, the euro and the Chilean peso, each of which weakened in the mid to high single digits on average over our fiscal year. In addition, we are continuing to exclude from organic sales approximately $50 million in revenue related to the Avoca acquisition that we completed earlier in the year.
Adjusting for the currency headwinds and M&A impact, organic sales growth for the company was a positive 2%. Our strategic portfolio actions reduced growth by approximately 1%. Combined with about a 50 basis point headwind globally from energy clients in the year, this represents about 150 basis point headwind to growth. Therefore, our underlying organic growth was in the middle of our multiyear framework that I just mentioned.
Let's now move to Slide 6 for a discussion of our adjusted operating income year-over-year performance. Given we are reporting record levels of adjusted earnings and profitability, we clearly made significant progress in 2016, driven by productivity initiatives and our strategic portfolio actions.
In the center of the page, full year 2016 adjusted operating income was $939 million, which is approximately 7% higher than the prior year. We incurred a 1% currency headwind, which is the drop through of the revenue impact I mentioned earlier. Therefore, on a constant currency basis, our adjusted operating income increased 8% year-over-year, which is at the higher end of our framework.
Our AOI margin on a constant currency basis increased to a company record of 6.5% for the full year, which was up 36 basis points versus the year-ago figure and a solid start versus our 3-year goal of 100 basis points improvement.
All 3 segments delivered strong improvements in adjusted operating income with North America FSS up 7%, international FSS up 8% and uniforms up 6% on a constant currency basis. Productivity momentum was broad-based across all the segments, while the portfolio actions favorably impacted North America and international.
Turning to Slide 7, which provides a roll forward of our adjusted EPS year-over-year. Our adjusted EPS increased to $1.71 in the year versus $1.57 in 2015. Taking into account approximately $0.03 of currency headwind, this represents an 11% increase on a constant currency basis. Both our adjusted tax rate and our interest expense, exclusive of refinancing-related costs, were comparable to the prior year.
Let me spend a minute discussing the reconciling items between our adjusted earnings per share and our GAAP results. We continue to experience the gradual decline in LBO-related intangible amortization and our share-based compensation figure was down as expected given a large amount of IPO-related activity in the prior year. As we get closer to the completion of our current transformation program, our severance-related charges continue to decline.
On Slide 8, I'll comment on our cash flow and our balance sheet for the year. We grew free cash flow, which we define as cash from operations less CapEx, by 80%, in large part due to an increase in net income, a reduction in pension contributions, the timing of certain capital expenditures and declining transformation spending. The record results reported today strongly contributed to strengthening our balance sheet and financial flexibility at the close of 2016. Our year-end liquidity remains strong and our cash and revolver availability was approximately $865 million at the end of the year.
Our total debt to covenant adjusted EBITDA declined by approximately 30 basis points to 3.9x and net capital expenditures for the year were $486 million or approximately 3.4% of sales. Our debt profile was significantly improved with approximately $1.4 billion in refinancings, extending maturities 8 to 10 years. We have no required refinancing needs before 2019. However, we will continue to look for attractive market opportunities and be opportunistic as conditions warrant.
The increase in our dividend that Eric mentioned will allow us to maintain a payout ratio of approximately 20% to 25% of earnings. This is consistent with our commitment and past practice with regards to balanced capital allocation.
Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. Absent strategic opportunities, we expect to allocate the majority of our 2017 free cash flow beyond what's required to serve as a dividend to debt repayment as we continue to approach our leverage targets. I expect leverage at the end of 2017 in the range of 3.6x to 3.7x, which will be achieved through a combination of both debt repayment and EBITDA growth.
Slide 9 details our initial expectations for 2017. We're highly confident that 2017 will deliver another record year of performance for the company. And while the year is going to be quite solid, I will remind everyone that quarters will continue to be lumpy as the business does not and it won't start operating on a straight line.
With this in mind, I will start on the left-hand side of the page with some 2017 modeling aids. Adjusted EPS is currently expected to be between $1.85 and $1.95 per share, although double-digit EPS improvement from the framework from higher adjusted operating income combined with a modest tax rate benefit and slightly offset by $0.01 or $0.02 of currency headwind should land us near the center of that range. Capital spending should be consistent with the last few years in the range of 3.25% to 3.5% of sales. Interest expense should be comparable to 2016 levels, excluding the impact of the prior year's refinancing costs, as lower debt levels will be offset by longer average maturities. We expect to see a modest decline in the tax rate. This is largely due to some tax planning activity coming to fruition as well as the adoption of new accounting standards related to employee share-based compensation. And we expect to generate at least $300 million in free cash flow.
Turning to revenue expectations for the full year. We expect that the underlying growth in our business will be near the midpoint of the multiyear framework. However, we do anticipate about 100 basis points of headwinds from the tail end of our strategic portfolio action carryover, a less favorable Major League Baseball playoff schedule in our Sports business and ongoing pressures in the energy sector, which are now affecting all lines of business. Due to these headwinds, we expect reported revenue growth for 2017 at the lower end of the framework.
The phasing of the various items impacting our revenue outlook for the year will be felt most heavily in the first half of the year. We'll likely incur several hundred basis points of revenue headwind early in the first half, and our performance will improve as the year moves along.
Therefore, for the first half, we're still expecting modest revenue growth in all segments except FSS International, which will be flat relative to the prior year period. In addition, we expect our uniform business to grow at a slightly slower pace in 2017.
We're anticipating AOI growth across all segments due to our continued productivity initiatives. However, consistent with prior years, we expect our productivity gains to accelerate in the back half of the year due to higher investment levels in the first half as we continue to lean into margin drivers and opportunities aggressively. Adjusted EPS should follow the same pattern.
And before I turn the call over to Eric again, I would like to thank Ian Bailey for his contributions to building out, from scratch, our investor relations function over the last 3 years. I'm thrilled to have someone of Kate's experience join the team, and I wish both of them good luck in their new roles.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Eric."

I think we saw strong performance out of our Education, Sports and Leisure business. So those trends continue and we would expect to continue as we get into 2017.
I mentioned in my prepared comments, but let me go just a little bit deeper. Relative to new business, we've had a pretty good run. I think we've started the year pretty strong as well, particularly in the Education space. We've picked up a couple of new Departments of Corrections as well. And so I think the net of all of this is the pipeline continues to be -- look encouraged. And as we think about 2017, we would expect -- there's no doubt we're going to face some headwinds relative to the strategic decisions and as well as the energy sector. But I think as we look at our North America growth, we would expect to see, again, continued strong performance in 2017.
From a pricing perspective, I think there's really nothing that has changed. I mean, we continue to be -- the pricing approach has been consistent with past years."

What drives that growth is really our ability to onboard new business and obviously retain our existing business.
In Q4, we began to see that shift a little bit. And again, I think we continue to see that sector probably be impacted a little bit by some disruption and consolidation. So I think we're likely to see for the next couple of quarters that pressure continue. Having said that, I think as we look at our Healthcare business during the latter part of the year and going forward, again, there continues to be a large outsourcing opportunity.

And so we did see, in the fourth quarter, those numbers flip against us.
And as Eric referenced, the consolidation in the Healthcare space, we often say we tend to win or lose business based on the team that we have on the ground, based on our ability to innovate, based on our ability to provide a great customer experience. In Healthcare, sometimes you win or lose also based on the consolidation game. And when 2 systems combine, depending on the system that is the winner of that, there's generally 2 providers and they tend to go to one. And in the fourth quarter, we had a couple of those where it did not go our way. And so I would expect that for the next another couple of quarters it'll take us to work through the fact that we've been on the wrong end of some of those consolidation plays as well."

I think we've got further to go on some of our planning opportunities, but you're starting to see kind of the baby steps in that direction. The accounting change and the specific number will escape me, but essentially it relates to guidance that requires us to treat the tax benefit from share-based compensation a little bit differently than we had done in the past.
And so, historically, when we take deductions for share-based compensation, we would not have run that through the tax provision. And then, going forward, the guidance would have us recognize a portion of that. How much a benefit we ultimately get is very much a function of how much activity there happens to be around equity exercises over the course of the year or what the share price is, et cetera. So I think we're being -- trying not to get too far ahead of ourselves in trying to guess what people will do in that space, but I believe the planning certainly should -- will provide us a solid benefit on a year-over-year basis all by itself."

So certainly, as we put that line of demarcation on the 100 basis point march over the next 3 years, that is largely just through pure focus on productivity across those 3 levers.
We obviously currently are a big procurer of food and we do all of that buying directly for ourselves. But as we get into some of these opportunities, we do believe GPO is an opportunity. While HPSI is small in nature, your point about the untapped opportunity, I think, is correct.

I think the market's reaction certainly the last week has indicated that, generally, it seems to be positive relative to the business climate. So from our perspective, we'll play a wait and see game relative to that.
I think relative to your question on inflation, again, we've seen, I think, the last several years, certainly in 2016, a fairly benign inflationary environment when it comes to food. Again, we purchase a very diverse market basket and have a lot of levers to us, not just pricing lever, but because we have opportunities to change our menu, we can deal with any type of inflationary pressures pretty adeptly.
On the labor side, I think as we said in the past, while there has been a lot of talk and even, in some states, some action on this front, we feel like we've got a very good plan of action on how to deal with that and have been able to mitigate that with a lot of the productivity efforts that we've put in place across the labor front, everything from a more structured in-unit labor model to making sure we schedule our headcount appropriately. We flex that labor and attack overtime and agency labor.
So I think when all is said and done, relative to inflation, we would expect it to continue to be fairly benign and very manageable and within our control to offset it."

Our, I'll say, strategic actions is about 1% on the revenue side in terms of what we've talked about from a headwind. And generally, they are accretive to us. But Eric's right, it's a much smaller proportion than what we do within the productivity side.
From an energy perspective, our primary energy exposure has been in our business in Canada where we do remote oil sands servicing in those fields, as well as platforms in the North Sea, also the U.K. And so I would say we felt changes in employment levels in Canada first where there is the highest cost of extraction, which would make sense obviously. That was more of an early to mid-2015 type of an experience. And then, as energy stayed at lower levels than it had been moving into 2016, we started to see more of an impact in the European business where you have more fixed cost permanent type of platforms where they're much slower to make decisions around employment levels, ultimately, on those platforms. And so most of what we're talking about as energy in '17 is European-related.
And then, as Eric mentioned, within our uniform business where we have probably the longest lag time on some of the employment and some of the oil service type of industries, as those employment levels continue to come down just based on what some of those companies are announcing, we're seeing some modest headwind there.
And then, finally, on the free cash flow question, the change in the deferred taxes, some of that is purely going to be accounting-driven and the timing of payments that we make against various federal, state and international obligations. We also -- because of some of the equity activity that happened over the course of the year, we took some deductions around the way some of our payments were made, which influences that particular line item."

You'll find Kate every bit as reliable and helpful as Ian, and we remain committed to communicating openly, transparently and proactively with you.
With that last point in mind, let me turn to our latest performance. This morning, we reported a strong quarter and a record fiscal 2016 financial and operating results with the highest margins and profitability in Aramark's history. The consistent execution of our clear and focused strategy resulted in strong 11% adjusted EPS growth on a constant currency basis and 80% improvement in free cash flow, and we continue to strengthen our balance sheet. 2016 marks our third consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth since taking the company public. And the board's recent decision to increase our dividend by 8% is a confirmation of the ongoing momentum in the business.
It really has been a great year and I'm very proud of and want to thank our 270,000 team members for their passion and commitment to deliver against our brand promise and to elevate the customer experience each and every day.
This year, we also completed 2 strategic tuck-in acquisitions. We acquired Avoca, a small Irish specialty food company, which brought a European brand and new offerings to our portfolio. And we also added HPSI, a company with industry-leading technology in the group purchasing space. While these transactions were smaller in nature, they're illustrative of the momentum that we've got in the business, the profitability, balance sheet and line of sight on food and productivity, and how that is giving us the ability to behave more strategically and longer-term-focused. We expect this focus to pay off meaningfully in areas such as portfolio optimization, pricing as well as group purchasing.
Turning to our financial results for the first year -- full year. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.71, an increase of 11% over prior year on a constant currency basis. Total company organic sales were up 2%, net of portfolio strategic actions of about 100 basis points as well as 50 basis points of energy headwinds that we have mentioned previously. When you take those factors into account, our underlying growth was roughly in the middle of our multiyear growth framework.
Turning to our focus on revenue. We continue to achieve strong mid-90s retention rates, with 2016 closing the year at 94% despite about a point of strategic portfolio actions. As a reminder, while a revenue headwind, these strategic actions are accretive to margins.
What is very encouraging from my perspective is that the growth in our business is broad-based across segments, which I think reflects the strength of our well-balanced portfolio. North America organic sales were up 2%, bolstered by new business wins in Education and Sports & Entertainment as well as increases in our base business. Our international organic sales increased 1% due to growth in both Europe and emerging markets. And I'm pleased to report our uniform business grew 3% in the year as we continue to leverage recent capacity expansion in our uniform business to support growth.
In addition to our revenue momentum, we drove significant improvements across food, labor and SG&A productivity while continuing to balance ongoing reinvestment in the business. As a result, we drove almost 40 basis points of margin expansion to 6.5% and an increase in adjusted operating income to $939 million, which was up 8% on a constant currency basis, with all reporting segments showing both margin expansion and improved profitability.
Our improvement in adjusted operating income also helped to strengthen our balance sheet with a 30 basis point reduction in our leverage ratio to 3.9x.
2016's results also reflect meaningful progress against our 3 key strategic tenets: Accelerating growth; activating productivity; and attracting the best talent. As we've discussed, in the near-term, we will continue to place a strong margin filter on our growth strategy, but outsourcing prospects remain very robust and our sales pipeline remains encouraging.
As part of our accelerating growth pillar, we will continue to identify new growth opportunities as evidenced by some recent wins in our North America business. In our own backyard here in Philadelphia, we've recently signed 2 leading universities, Drexel University and Temple University as well as the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections. In our uniform business, we added Publix, the largest employee-owned grocery retailer in the U.S. And outside of North America, we gained a new business dining client, Schaefer Technologies in Germany.
We've also kicked off another successful NFL season where we serve more than 6 million fans annually at 11 stadiums. We opened the new U.S. Bank Stadium, home of the Minnesota Vikings, and recently expanded our partnership with the Super Bowl champion, Denver Broncos, to manage their retail operations in their team store.
And switching gears to the NHL. We opened the new Rogers Place Stadium in Edmonton, home of the Edmonton Oilers.
This quarter, we also went back to school with several new contracts in our K-12 business, with 250 new recipes based on student feedback and our own research. We're offering more options designed to meet current student preferences such as grab-and-go breakfast items and fresh made-to-order lunch entrées.
Innovating the everyday is what enables us to win both new clients as well as retaining and expanding our existing client relationships. And as we accelerate growth in our food business, we're doing that through an innovation framework centered around promotions, celebrity chef partnerships and proprietary concepts. This framework is driving revenue and consumer satisfaction and loyalty through quarterly, on trend, limited time offers as well as restaurant rotation and seasonal menu highlights.
In addition, we continue to expand our celebrity chef partnerships with celebrity chefs like Cat Cora, Andrew Zimmern, Jimmy Bannos and Danny Meyer, including the debut of the first-ever in-arena Shake Shack at the Wells Fargo Center, home of the Philadelphia Flyers and Philadelphia 76ers.
In our international segment, we're expanding our partnership with Chopped Ireland. Chopped is a successful, healthy food -- fast food franchise working with Aramark to expand its presence in the corporate, education and industry sectors in Ireland.
And turning to our own health and wellness initiatives, I'm pleased to report the year one results from our American Heart Association Healthy for Life 20 by 20 partnership are in. We've reduced -- over 30% of our main dishes now are vegetarian or vegan and over 50% of the entrées or sandwich items now contain 500 calories or less. And in our underserved communities where we're piloting this program, we've increased fruit and vegetable consumption by almost a cup per serving per day.
A critical component of our company's progress is reflected in our second strategic initiative, activating productivity. This year, we delivered substantial improvement in food, labor and SG&A productivity, resulting in almost 40 basis points of margin expansion. Our base productivity remains strong, which facilitated further investment in growth and capability.
It's important to note that the productivity improvement is broad-based across our portfolio as adjusted operating margins increased 30 basis points in North America, 30 basis points in our international business and 40 basis points in our uniform business.
We also continue in our efforts to establish a repeatable business model across the portfolio on -- that allows us to attack inefficiency across our supply chain, everything from menu design to reducing waste. We're also reducing our labor spend through a proactive approach that includes a standard labor model, a flexible model for scheduling and a relentless focus on managing overtime in agencies.
Finally, turning to our third strategic initiative, attracting the best talent. An engaged and productive workforce is critical to our ability to consistently deliver excellent customer service. Core to this is building diverse and inclusive culture where our team members are rewarded and recognized for selling and serving with passion. And one way we do this is through what we call our Ring of Stars program where we recognize frontline employees who embody Aramark's core values, an abiding commitment to customer service, a passion for innovating and a dedication to involvement in the communities we serve. I'm also proud that our engagement efforts were recently recognized by Black Enterprise magazine, which, once again, named Aramark as a top 50 best employer for diversity.
In closing, we're energized by the progress we continue to make in 2016 along our transformation journey. We also achieved record profitability and we've reported the third consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth, all while continuing to reinvest in the business for future growth and value creation.
With that, let me turn the call over to Steve for a more detailed look at the numbers."

Organic growth was fl",1505,"Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone.
Quickly touching on the fourth quarter, aside from a stronger than anticipated free cash flow generation, our results are broadly consistent with our previously communicated expectations. Organic growth was flat as we continue to face headwinds from energy in all of our lines of business as well as the lingering impact of several strategic portfolio actions.
In North America FSS, the incremental benefit of the Yosemite business was partially offset by weaker top line performance in our health care sector. We delivered meaningful improvement in adjusted operating income and margins due to broad-based productivity gains.
Reconciliations of adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter are provided in the appendix. In the interest of time, I will address the remainder of my comments to the full year.
Before I begin, for those of you less familiar with our story, our multiyear framework for the company envisions 3% to 5% annual revenue growth, mid- to high-single-digit AOI growth, double-digit adjusted EPS growth and specifically, by 2018, a 100 basis point improvement of our AOI margins versus 2015 levels.
Turning to Slide 5. We reported $14.4 billion in sales on a GAAP basis during 2016 compared to $14.3 billion last year. This is an increase of nearly 1%. As you can see from the slide, currency headwinds related to a stronger U.S. dollar reduced our sales by approximately 2% or $260 million. Our results were most affected by the Canadian dollar, the euro and the Chilean peso, each of which weakened in the mid to high single digits on average over our fiscal year. In addition, we are continuing to exclude from organic sales approximately $50 million in revenue related to the Avoca acquisition that we completed earlier in the year.
Adjusting for the currency headwinds and M&A impact, organic sales growth for the company was a positive 2%. Our strategic portfolio actions reduced growth by approximately 1%. Combined with about a 50 basis point headwind globally from energy clients in the year, this represents about 150 basis point headwind to growth. Therefore, our underlying organic growth was in the middle of our multiyear framework that I just mentioned.
Let's now move to Slide 6 for a discussion of our adjusted operating income year-over-year performance. Given we are reporting record levels of adjusted earnings and profitability, we clearly made significant progress in 2016, driven by productivity initiatives and our strategic portfolio actions.
In the center of the page, full year 2016 adjusted operating income was $939 million, which is approximately 7% higher than the prior year. We incurred a 1% currency headwind, which is the drop through of the revenue impact I mentioned earlier. Therefore, on a constant currency basis, our adjusted operating income increased 8% year-over-year, which is at the higher end of our framework.
Our AOI margin on a constant currency basis increased to a company record of 6.5% for the full year, which was up 36 basis points versus the year-ago figure and a solid start versus our 3-year goal of 100 basis points improvement.
All 3 segments delivered strong improvements in adjusted operating income with North America FSS up 7%, international FSS up 8% and uniforms up 6% on a constant currency basis. Productivity momentum was broad-based across all the segments, while the portfolio actions favorably impacted North America and international.
Turning to Slide 7, which provides a roll forward of our adjusted EPS year-over-year. Our adjusted EPS increased to $1.71 in the year versus $1.57 in 2015. Taking into account approximately $0.03 of currency headwind, this represents an 11% increase on a constant currency basis. Both our adjusted tax rate and our interest expense, exclusive of refinancing-related costs, were comparable to the prior year.
Let me spend a minute discussing the reconciling items between our adjusted earnings per share and our GAAP results. We continue to experience the gradual decline in LBO-related intangible amortization and our share-based compensation figure was down as expected given a large amount of IPO-related activity in the prior year. As we get closer to the completion of our current transformation program, our severance-related charges continue to decline.
On Slide 8, I'll comment on our cash flow and our balance sheet for the year. We grew free cash flow, which we define as cash from operations less CapEx, by 80%, in large part due to an increase in net income, a reduction in pension contributions, the timing of certain capital expenditures and declining transformation spending. The record results reported today strongly contributed to strengthening our balance sheet and financial flexibility at the close of 2016. Our year-end liquidity remains strong and our cash and revolver availability was approximately $865 million at the end of the year.
Our total debt to covenant adjusted EBITDA declined by approximately 30 basis points to 3.9x and net capital expenditures for the year were $486 million or approximately 3.4% of sales. Our debt profile was significantly improved with approximately $1.4 billion in refinancings, extending maturities 8 to 10 years. We have no required refinancing needs before 2019. However, we will continue to look for attractive market opportunities and be opportunistic as conditions warrant.
The increase in our dividend that Eric mentioned will allow us to maintain a payout ratio of approximately 20% to 25% of earnings. This is consistent with our commitment and past practice with regards to balanced capital allocation.
Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. Absent strategic opportunities, we expect to allocate the majority of our 2017 free cash flow beyond what's required to serve as a dividend to debt repayment as we continue to approach our leverage targets. I expect leverage at the end of 2017 in the range of 3.6 to 3.7x, which will be achieved through a combination of both debt repayment and EBITDA growth.
Slide 9 details our initial expectations for 2017. We're highly confident that 2017 will deliver another record year of performance for the company. And while the year is going to be quite solid, I will remind everyone that quarters will continue to be lumpy as the business does not and it won't start operating on a straight line.
With this in mind, I will start on the left-hand side of the page with some 2017 modeling aids. Adjusted EPS is currently expected to be between $1.85 and $1.95 per share, although double-digit EPS improvement from the framework from higher adjusted operating income combined with a modest tax rate benefit and slightly offset by $0.01 or $0.02 of currency headwind should land us near the center of that range. Capital spending should be consistent with the last few years in the range of 3.25% to 3.5% of sales. Interest expense should be comparable to 2016 levels, excluding the impact of the prior year's refinancing costs, as lower debt levels will be offset by longer average maturities. We expect to see a modest decline in the tax rate. This is largely due to some tax planning activity coming to fruition as well as the adoption of new accounting standards related to employee share-based compensation. And we expect to generate at least $300 million in free cash flow.
Turning to revenue expectations for the full year. We expect that the underlying growth in our business will be near the midpoint of the multiyear framework. However, we do anticipate about 100 basis points of headwinds from the tail end of our strategic portfolio action carryover, a less favorable Major League Baseball playoff schedule in our Sports business and ongoing pressures in the energy sector, which are now affecting all lines of business. Due to these headwinds, we expect reported revenue growth for 2017 at the lower end of the framework.
The phasing of the various items impacting our revenue outlook for the year will be felt most heavily in the first half of the year. We'll likely incur several hundred basis points of revenue headwind early in the first half, and our performance will improve as the year moves along.
Therefore, for the first half, we're still expecting modest revenue growth in all segments except FSS International, which will be flat relative to the prior year period. In addition, we expect our uniform business to grow at a slightly slower pace in 2017.
We're anticipating AOI growth across all segments due to our continued productivity initiatives. However, consistent with prior years, we expect our productivity gains to accelerate in the back half of the year due to higher investment levels in the first half as we continue to lean into margin drivers and opportunities aggressively. Adjusted EPS should follow the same pattern.
And before I turn the call over to Eric again, I would like to thank Ian Bailey for his contributions to building out, from scratch, our investor relations function over the last 3 years. I'm thrilled to have someone of Kate's experience join the team, and I wish both of them good luck in their new roles.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Eric."

And so I think the net of all of this is the pipeline continues to be -- look encouraged.

So I think we're likely to see for the next couple of quarters that pressure continue.

And as Eric referenced, the consolidation in the Healthcare space, we often say we tend to win or lose business based on the team that we have on the ground, based on our ability to innovate, based on our ability to provide a great customer experience. In Healthcare, sometimes you win or lose also based on the consolidation game. And when 2 systems combine, depending on the system that is the winner of that, there's generally 2 providers and they tend to go to one. And in the fourth quarter, we had a couple of those where it did not go our way. And so I would expect that for the next another couple of quarters it'll take us to work through the fact that we've been on the wrong end of some of those consolidation plays as well."

I think we've got further to go on some of our planning opportunities, but you're starting to see kind of the baby steps in that direction. The accounting change and the specific number will escape me, but essentially it relates to guidance that requires us to treat the tax benefit from share-based compensation a little bit differently than we had done in the past. And so historically, when we take deductions for share-based compensation, we would not have run that through the tax provision. And then, going forward, the guidance would have us recognize a portion of that. How much a benefit we ultimately get is very much a function of how much activity there happens to be around equity exercises over the course of the year or what the share price is, et cetera. So I think we're being -- trying not to get too far ahead of ourselves in trying to guess what people will do in that space, but I believe the planning certainly should -- will provide us a solid benefit on a year-over-year basis all by itself."

I think the market's reaction certainly the last week has indicated that, generally, it seems to be positive relative to the business climate. So from our perspective, we'll play a wait and see game relative to that. I think relative to your question on inflation, again, we've seen, I think, the last several years, certainly in 2016, a fairly benign inflationary environment when it comes to food. Again, we purchase a very diverse market basket and have a lot of levers to us, not just pricing lever, but because we have opportunities to change our menu, we can deal with any type of inflationary pressures pretty adeptly. On the labor side, I think as we said in the past, while there has been a lot of talk and even, in some states, some action on this front, we feel like we've got a very good plan of action on how to deal with that and have been able to mitigate that with a lot of the productivity efforts that we've put in place across the labor front, everything from a more structured in-unit labor model to making sure we schedule our headcount appropriately. We flex that labor and attack overtime and agency labor. So I think when all is said and done, relative to inflation, we would expect it to continue to be fairly benign and very manageable and within our control to offset it."

And as a result of some of the strategic actions, as a result of some of the energy sector pressures and as a result of some of the sports, you did see in Q4, and will continue to see the early part of 2017, those headwinds. So again, if you look at our North America business, as I said earlier, what we've got -- anytime you have a business portfolio that is this diverse, you're going to have puts and takes across the portfolio. So the sectors that are performing well that we called out are sectors like education, sports, leisure, and the ones that are more pressured are kind of the B&I energy headwind and impact and the Healthcare sector that we talked about.

Our, I'll say, strategic actions is about 1% on the revenue side in terms of what we've talked about from a headwind. And generally, they are accretive to us. But Eric's right, it's a much smaller proportion than what we do within the productivity side. From an energy perspective, our primary energy exposure has been in our business in Canada where we do remote oil sands servicing in those fields, as well as platforms in the North Sea, also the U.K. And so I would say we felt changes in employment levels in Canada first where there is the highest cost of extraction, which would make sense obviously. That was more of an early to mid-2015 type of an experience. And then, as energy stayed at lower levels than it had been moving into 2016, we started to see more of an impact in the European business where you have more fixed cost permanent type of platforms where they're much slower to make decisions around employment levels, ultimately, on those platforms. And so most of what we're talking about as energy in '17 is European-related. And then, as Eric mentioned, within our uniform business where we have probably the longest lag time on some of the employment and some of the oil service type of industries, as those employment levels continue to come down just based on what some of those companies are announcing, we're seeing some modest headwind there. And then, finally, on the free cash flow question, the change in the deferred taxes, some of that is purely going to be accounting-driven and the timing of payments that we make against various federal, state and international obligations. We also -- because of some of the equity activity that happened over the course of the year, we took some deductions around the way some of our payments were made, which influences that particular line item."
