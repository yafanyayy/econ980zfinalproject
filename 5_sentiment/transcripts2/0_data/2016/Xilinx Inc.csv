Xilinx sales were $566 million, up 7% sequentially and at the high end of our guidance. We experienced exceptional new product growth during the quarter, driven by our 28-nanometer 7 Series products and 20-nanometer UltraScale products. In market strength was broad-based with Communications and industrial and aerospace and defense recovering as anticipated. The broadcast consumer automotive category was down slightly driven primarily by automotive, which was impacted by the timing of customer purchases. We expect automotive to post strong growth in the March quarter and to increase by 30% in the full fiscal year '16. 
Gross margin was 68.5% for the quarter. In addition to the expected impact of customer mix shift to our larger customers, gross margin was impacted by higher-than-anticipated production ramp costs associated with the aggressive introduction of our new products. Our March quarter guidance incorporates a small impact from these costs. 
Operating expenses, including $2 million of amortization expense were $228 million, slightly lower-than-expected as a result of disciplined spending. Other income with a net expense of $5 million, better than anticipated due primarily to higher investment income. The tax rate for the quarter was 15.6%. There were 2 discrete tax items impacting the rate. There was a $0.03 per share benefit from the retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit and a 5 -- excuse me, $0.05 per share negative impact due to a change in the amount of foreign earnings for which U.S. tax is provided. 
Net income for the quarter was $131 million or $0.49 per diluted share. Operating cash flow for the December quarter was $290 million before $6 million in CapEx. Strong cash flow for the quarter was positively impacted by net improvement in working capital driven by a reduction in receivables and inventories. Diluted shares for the quarter were 270 million, there was a 10.6 million share diluted -- dilutive effect from our convertible notes. For questions related to dilution associated with our convertible debt, please visit our Investor Relations website at www.investor.xilinx.com. 
We repurchased 2.1 million shares for $100 million during the quarter, and paid $80 million in dividends. Let me now comment on the balance sheet. 
Cash and investments were $3.6 billion. We had $600 million in convertible debt and $1 billion in fixed-rate debt resulting in a net cash position of approximately $2 billion. Inventory dollars at Xilinx decreased by $17 million sequentially. We expect inventories to be down again in the March quarter. Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the March quarter of fiscal year '16. Our backlog heading into the March quarter is up slightly. We are forecasting continued growth in 28-nanometer and 20-nanometer products. We expect Communications to be flat with increases in wireless offsetting decreases in wired. Industrial, aerospace and defense is forecasted to be down slightly the decreases in IAS offsetting increases in defense. 
Lastly, we are expecting consumer, auto and broadcast to be up to and by automotive, which is forecasted to have a record quarter. As a result, we are expecting total sales to be approximately flat sequentially. In the midpoint of this guidance is predicated on turns rate of approximately 48%. Gross margin is expected to be between 68% and 69%. Operating expenses for the March quarter are expected to be approximately $220 million, including $1 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. Other income and expense for the March quarter will be a net expense of $6 million. The share count is expected to be approximately 267 million shares. The tax rate for the March quarter is expected to be between 13% and 14%, the increase in the tax rate forecast is a result of the previously stated changes. 
Let me now turn the call over to Moshe."

I'm very pleased to be delivered significant growth quarter with revenue hitting the high-end of our guidance. Overall, 6 of our 8 end markets grew demonstrating the strength of our highly diversified anti-market portfolio. Particular and gratified that this growth was driven by an exceptionally strong third from our new products category, primarily our latest 20-nanometer and 28-nanometer production node, which delivered an 18% sequential quarterly increase. The December quarter of 28-nanometer sales grew significantly obtaining a new record lever new level. 28-nanometer revenue growth benefited from broad-based sales contributions from industrial broadcast, defense, test and measurements and consumer markets in conjunction with a significant forecast of recovery in the communications markets. The current March quarter driven, again, by a majority of our end markets. We expect to repeat this trend and set a new quarterly 28-nanometer revenue record. 
Similarly, 20-nanometer revenue in December quarter significantly exceeded the $20 million target we had set last quarter. No 20-nanometer competition, the Virtex UltraScale high-end family continues to represent the largest percentage of our 20-nanometer sales. Additionally, our Kintex UltraScale family demonstrated significant sales momentum since revenue doubling in the quarter. 
Looking forward to the March quarter, driven by many of our end markets and led by test and measurement, defense and consumer, we expect 20-nanometer sales to exceed our new $25 million quarterly target. These business successes both the 20- and 28 nodes are being bolstered by the significant milestones we of achieved with our 16-nanometer UltraScale+ family extending our clear industry and technology leadership. 
Since the September quarter, we've already shipped the industry's first 16-nanometer All Programmable MPSoC to tend these customers. This broad customer shipment milestone was achieved a quarter ahead of schedule, enabled by the excellent functionality of our first 16-nanometer silicon. More recently, we received silicon of our 16-nanometer Virtex silicon, which is exhibiting similarly pristine functionality. Consequently, we plan to ship to customers by the end of January, significantly ahead of our original schedule. 
In addition, we take out 2 additional 16-nanometer devices last quarter, and we fully expect to continue this accelerated ramp of new product takeout throughout fiscal year '17 to buildup upon and extend our time-to-market advantage. The silicon leadership position is being complemented on the software front by our enabling broad public access to design to support the 16-nanometer UltraScale+ families. The breakthrough capabilities of the 16-nanometer UltraScale+ product family, coupled with our very significant advantage make it uniquely suited to high-growth applications ranging from next generation driver systems, industrial Internet of Things to 5G wireless. 
Lastly, following the October announcement of our strategic partnership with QUALCOMM for computer acceleration in our [indiscernible], Xilinx and IBM announced a similar collaboration to enable computer acceleration in servers based on the power architecture. This collaboration is expected to enable high-performance and energy-efficient FPGA-enabled workload acceleration of rapidly growing applications. Notwithstanding the recent turbulence in the global market, continued focus and deliver upon the elements which we can control namely our total technology execution, our ability to expand the serviceable market, utilizing our leadership portfolio and our emphasis on maximizing shareholder value. Now I'll turn the call back to the operator for the Q&A."

We're a multi-market company, we're very diversified and I think, that's generally good, but the 2 challenges we had were on the A&D front and on the wireless front. And wireless, depending on the point in time, is typically north of 20% and A&D can be in the mid-teens depending on the cycle. And those 2 markets hits low points. The low point for wireless, we believe, was in the June quarter and the low point for A&D was in the September quarter. And so those 2 markets, which were a bit of a drag now, we believe, are in recovery mode. And what we're seeing is generally speaking, on most through all of our markets we're seeing growth isn't linear. So it sort of goes up, goes down a little. But generally speaking, we think the worst is behind us, and we expect to see over the next 2 quarters, better results than we have seen in the past. And it's driven by a very strong technology cycle, so it's driven by the 28-nanometer and the 20-nanometer now hitting record revenue. As they hit records in the December quarter, we expect them to the prior records in the March quarter. Note, there's sort of impacts of the 14 weeks versus 13 weeks, you could sort of -- we've generally model that as between 2% to 3% in terms of benefiting from that this past during that obviously won't -- we won't have that in the current March quarter. So we think that what you're seeing is regardless of that, you're actually seeing some growth on an apples-to-apples comparison. Beyond March, we're allowed to give predictions, and we're probably going to give predictions are the quarter-by-quarter basis. Going forward, because of the choppiness in the market. So that's sort of the Reader's Digest version all hour. Hopefully that helps."

So, no, I believe that, that market, there's growth opportunity for us. I would say that definitely it's a market where Intel has the full position. It will be hardly to state anything than that with regards to that market in the x86 world. In the non-x86 world, it's sort of ours, by and large. With regard to the other markets, I think, it's fundamentally driven by the customers looking for who has the best technology solution, which at this point, as you look at the 28-nanometer and 20 and our position on 16, we clearly have tremendous leadership and sure has grown there. We have leadership on the software front and clearly have the service, the meter, which is important to this customer -- to customers in these markets. So, I think, that it's a growth opportunity for us. We don't take anything for granted. We need to continue to deliver leadership and the best support and our intention is to continue doing that.

And then the forecast, the guide was to have industrial down, test and measurement down and aerospace and defense, up. So I was just wasn't 100% sure which quarter you were referring to when you made this comment so I just want to be clear on that. Aerospace and defense, as Moshe pointed out earlier, has did bottom out in the September quarter, and we're starting to see strength in that business, particularly in many of the defense areas, the movement and the change and some of the things going on and the budget -- and budgetary process is starting to -- we start to see some general goodness in terms of programs and emerging things going on there, but most of our business comes from existing programs -- current business comes from existing programs. And we're just seeing a very good -- continued very good penetration of products there. They're quite frankly, our 65-nanometer products are growing in that category as you know, is the big latency issue relative to the revenue ramp. But we're also seeing really good 28-nanometer growth over and above what we've seen maybe historically for a new product category growing. So I think our strength there is continuing to build and grow for aerospace and defense. From a -- and that's a U.S. and European statement more than it is as any other geographies from the military perspective. Then in industrial, its pretty choppy. We're seeing overall growth in industrial from a full year to full year basis but by geography, it is kind of up and down. In this particular quarters, past quarter, we had stronger numbers out of Japan than anywhere else and everything else was kind of flattish to -- flat to down kind of situation. So it continues to be challenging in China and Asia-Pacific, as well as Europe where we have a significant string set of consumers.

And I agree with your comments on it we have been disappointed vis-à-vis growth of few years. I think, as a result, there's a point in time where the general expectation was that you could deliver and sustain double-digit growth, and we're -- we believe that, that is unlikely. No, it could happen, but it's unlikely to be compound annual growth rate, so we're talking about single-digit growth. Even that, we obviously still need to deliver and as John indicated, we do expect fiscal year '17 to be the growth year. On the general question, which we'll try to answer probably a little better at our Analyst Day, the point that I would like to make is that, except for high-volume, very high-volume markets, ASICs and ASSPs, and this is no longer a wet dream, this is documented known and happening and has happened over the past few years of our becoming less and less viable. And that opens a serviceable market and it requires the right silicone, and it requires the right software. And we move forward and we continue to move forward with and being at the leading-edge. There's less and less to compete with and if we have the right silicone, we have the right level of integration, and we can enable a broader set of customers to use our technology, we should be able to benefit from that. That's sort of the very high-level answer. I'd love to give you a more profound answer but that, that isn't something we can do now. We will try to address it a little bit during our Analyst Day and explain what we're doing in order to exploit the opportunities. And amongst other things, just a snippet if you look at the our product line, that enables us to service a market, which up to when it was available, we couldn't even touch, right, and that's the ASSP market. And we've gone from to it already being approaching 20% of our revenue in the U.S. node, right, and that just sort of shows you that it's an expansion play. We'll try and give more examples anything that in the future."

Xilinx sales were $566 million, up 7% sequentially and at the high end of our guidance. We experienced exceptional new product growth during the quarter, driven by our 28-nanometer 7 Series products and 20-nanometer UltraScale products. End market strength was broad based, with communications and Industrial, Aerospace & Defense recovering as anticipated. The Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive category was down slightly driven primarily by automotive, which was impacted by the timing of customer purchases. We expect automotive to post strong growth in the March quarter and to increase by 30% in the full fiscal year '16.
Gross margin was 68.5% for the quarter. In addition to the expected impact of customer mix shift to our larger customers, gross margin was impacted by higher-than-anticipated production ramp costs associated with the aggressive introduction of our new products. Our March quarter guidance incorporates a small impact from these costs.
Operating expenses, including $2 million of amortization expense, were $228 million, slightly lower-than-expected as a result of disciplined spending. Other income was a net expense of $5 million, better than anticipated due primarily to higher investment income. The tax rate for the quarter was 15.6%. There were 2 discrete tax items impacting the rate. There was a $0.03 per share benefit from the retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit and a 5 -- excuse me, $0.05 per share negative impact due to a change in the amount of foreign earnings for which U.S. tax is provided.
Net income for the quarter was $131 million or $0.49 per diluted share. Operating cash flow for the December quarter was $290 million before $6 million in CapEx. Strong cash flow for the quarter was positively impacted by net improvement in working capital driven by a reduction in receivables and inventories. Diluted shares for the quarter were 270 million, there was a 10.6 million share diluted -- dilutive effect from our convertible notes. For questions related to dilution associated with our convertible debt, please visit our Investor Relations website at www.investor.xilinx.com.
We repurchased 2.1 million shares for $100 million during the quarter and paid $80 million in dividends. Let me now comment on the balance sheet.
Cash and investments were $3.6 billion. We had $600 million in convertible debt and $1 billion in fixed-rate debt, resulting in a net cash position of approximately $2 billion. Inventory dollars at Xilinx decreased by $17 million sequentially. We expect inventories to be down again in the March quarter. Let me now turn to discussion of guidance for the March quarter of fiscal year '16. Our backlog heading into the March quarter is up slightly. We are forecasting continued growth in 28-nanometer and 20-nanometer products. We expect communications to be flat with increases in wireless offsetting decreases in wired. Industrial, Aerospace & Defense is forecasted to be down slightly with decreases in IAs offsetting increases in defense.
Lastly, we are expecting consumer, auto and broadcast to be up, driven by automotive, which is forecasted to have a record quarter. As a result, we are expecting total sales to be approximately flat sequentially. The midpoint of this guidance is predicated on turns rate of approximately 48%. Gross margin is expected to be between 68% and 69%. Operating expenses for the March quarter are expected to be approximately $220 million, including $1 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. Other income and expense for the March quarter will be a net expense of $6 million. The share count is expected to be approximately 267 million shares. The tax rate for the March quarter is expected to be between 13% and 14%. The increase in the tax rate forecast is a result of the previously stated changes.

I'm very pleased that we delivered a significant growth quarter with revenue hitting the high end of our guidance.

I'm very pleased that we delivered a significant growth quarter with revenue hitting the high end of our guidance. Overall, 6 of our 8 end markets grew demonstrating the strength of our highly diversified anti-market portfolio. Particularly, I'm gratified that this growth was driven by an exceptionally strong surge from our new products category, primarily our latest 20-nanometer and 28-nanometer production node, which delivered an 18% sequential quarterly increase. The December quarter 28-nanometer sales grew significantly, obtaining a new record revenue level. 28-nanometer revenue growth benefited from broad-based sales contributions from industrial, broadcast, defense, test and measurements and consumer markets in conjunction with a significant forecasted recovery in the communications markets. The current March quarter, driven again by a majority of our end markets, we expect to repeat this trend and set a new quarterly 28-nanometer revenue record.
Similarly, 20-nanometer revenue in December quarter significantly exceeded the $20 million target we had set last quarter. With no 20-nanometer competition, the Virtex UltraScale high-end family continues to represent the largest percentage of our 20-nanometer sales. Additionally, our Kintex UltraScale family demonstrated significant sales momentum with revenue doubling in the quarter.
Looking forward to the March quarter, driven by many of our end markets and led by test and measurement, defense and consumer, we expect 20-nanometer sales to exceed our new $25 million quarterly target. These business successes, both the 20 and 28 nodes, are being bolstered by the significant milestones we have achieved with our 16-nanometer UltraScale+ family, extending our clear industry and technology leadership.
Since the September quarter, we've already shipped the industry's first 16-nanometer All Programmable MPSoC to tens of customers. This broad customer shipment milestone was achieved a quarter ahead of schedule, enabled by the excellent functionality of our first 16-nanometer silicon. More recently, we received silicon of our 16-nanometer Virtex silicon, which is exhibiting similarly pristine functionality. Consequently, we plan to ship it to customers by the end of January, significantly ahead of our original schedule.
In addition, we taped out 2 additional 16-nanometer devices last quarter, and we fully expect to continue this accelerated ramp of new product taped out throughout fiscal year '17 to build up upon and extend our time-to-market advantage. The silicon leadership position is being complemented on the software front by our enabling broad public access to design tool support the 16-nanometer UltraScale+ family. 
The breakthrough capabilities of the 16-nanometer UltraScale+ product family, coupled with our very significant first-mover advantage, make it uniquely suited for high-growth applications, ranging from next-generation trans-drive resistance, industrial Internet of Things to 5G wireless.
Lastly, following the October announcement of our strategic partnership with Qualcomm for compute acceleration in our base servers, Xilinx and IBM announced a similar collaboration to enable compute acceleration in servers based on the POWER architecture. This collaboration is expected to enable high-performance and energy-efficient FPGA-enabled workload acceleration of rapidly growing applications. Notwithstanding the recent turbulence in the global market, we continue to focus and deliver upon the elements we can control, namely, our total technology execution, our ability to expand the serviceable market, utilizing our leadership portfolio and our emphasis on maximizing shareholder value.

Well, as you look over the past couple of years, clearly, we had a challenge in terms of our revenue, and what we identified was there were 2 elements -- significant elements which were challenges for us. We're a multi-market company, so we're very diversified, and I think that's generally good. But the 2 challenges we had were on the A&D front and on the wireless front. And wireless, depending on the point in time, is typically north of 20% and A&D can be in the mid-teens depending on the cycle. And those 2 markets hit low points. The low point for wireless, we believe, was in the June quarter, and the low point for A&D was in the September quarter. And so those 2 markets, which were a bit of a drag now, we believe, are in recovery mode. And what we're seeing is, generally speaking, on most or all of our markets we're seeing growth isn't linear. So it sort of goes up, goes down a little. But generally speaking, we think the worst is behind us, and we expect to see over the next 2 quarters better results than we have seen in the past. And it's driven by a very strong technology cycle, so it's driven by the 28-nanometer and the 20-nanometer now hitting record revenue. They hit records in the December quarter. We expect them to the prior records in the March quarter. There's sort of impacts of the 14 weeks versus 13 weeks, you could sort of -- we've generally modeled that as between 2% to 3% in terms of benefiting from that this past -- during that obviously won't -- we won't have that in the current March quarter. So we think that what you're seeing is -- regardless of that, you're actually seeing some growth on an apples-to-apples comparison. Beyond March, we're loathe to give predictions, and we're probably going to give predictions on a quarter-by-quarter basis going forward because of the choppiness in the market. So that's sort of the Reader's Digest version. I'll spend the whole hour. Hopefully that helped."

It's emerging market for everyone. It would be very correct to say that Intel is, by far, the market leader due to their very strong position on high-performance servers, and that helps them. And undoubtedly, they will leverage that to help them keep as much as they can of that market. Our expectation is that, notwithstanding that element, there is an expectation of competing solutions coming to market, be they competing architectures. The 2 that are obvious are the ARM and the power ones. But even on the x86 front, we believe that we can provide a lot of the big players in the market a differentiated solution. So no, I believe that, that market, there's growth opportunity for us. I would say that definitely it's a market where Intel has the full position. It will be foolhardy to state anything other than that with regards to that market in the x86 world. In the non-x86 world, it's sort of ours, by and large. With regard to the other markets I think it's fundamentally driven by the customers looking for who has the best technology solution, which, at this point, as you look at the 28-nanometer and 20 and our position on 16, we clearly have tremendous leadership, and our market share has grown there. We have leadership on the software front, and we clearly have the service demeanor, which is important to this customer -- to customers in these markets. So I think that it's a growth opportunity for us. We don't take anything for granted. We need to continue to deliver leadership and the best support, and our intention is to continue doing that. So that's another rather long answer."

In this past quarter, both the Industrial, Aerospace & Defense and test and measurement were all up sequentially. And in the forecast, the guide was to have industrial down, test and measurement down and aerospace and defense, up. So I was just wasn't 100% sure of which quarter you were referring to when you made those comments, so I just want to be clear on that. So aerospace and defense, as Moshe pointed out earlier, has -- did bottom out in the September quarter. And we're starting to see strength in that business, particularly in many of the defense areas. The movement and the change and some of the things going on in the budget -- budgetary process is starting to -- we're starting to see some general goodness in terms of programs and emerging things going on there. But most of our business comes from existing programs -- current business comes from existing programs, and we're just seeing a very good -- continued very good penetration of products there. As our -- quite frankly, our 65-nanometer products are growing in that category. As you know, there's a big latency issue relative to the revenue ramp. But we're also seeing really good 28-nanometer growth over and above what we've seen maybe historically for a new product category growing. So I think our strength there is continuing to build and grow for Aerospace And & Defense. From a -- and that's a U.S. and European statement more than it is as any other geography from the military perspective. Then in industrial, it's pretty choppy. We're seeing overall growth in industrial from a full-year-to-full-year basis, but by geography, it is kind of up and down. In this particular quarter, this past quarter, we had stronger numbers out of Japan than anywhere else, and everything else was kind of flattish to -- flat to down kind of situation. So it continues to be challenging in China and Asia-Pacific, as well as Europe, where we have a significant string -- set of consumers. So it's not like it's cratering and going down, it's just kind of a very choppy environment for us in industrial."

And then as we mentioned in Moshe's remarks, the uptake in terms of shipments of samples and early products has been extremely brisk for our customers, which demonstrates a lot of interest. And of course, we're hopeful that those turn into real significant revenue dollars downstream. From a margin perspective, we've been running, kind of bouncing around a little between 68 to 70 bps. Still confident we're in the 68 to 70 range in any sort of near term, plus or minus a few other things that bumped us up to 70, and now down to 68.5.

But we had -- there are ordinary design wins in the quarter in automotive, but I'm just not at liberty to provide the name of the ultimate manufacturer at this point in time. We are seeing the designs. We have 1 ramped very strongly, and those -- again, the ADAS application being the biggest driver of growth. There is a growing percentage of that ADAS that has an our ARM core in it. In some cases, we end up having more simple applications, just straight FPGAs in there. But the ARM core is growing very dramatically. So if you say that we talked last quarter about a 50 -- about 50% of our revenue from automotive was ADAS-related, I would say at least 1/2 of that is associated with some level of ARM core, and that will be growing over time."

Whereas in the 2020 timeframe, it's more likely to go into full-fledged production with the 7-nanometer. So those are 3 target markets which are driving the design wins in the 16-nanometer.

And that opens a serviceable market, and it requires the right silicone, and it requires the right software.

And if we have the right silicone, we have the right level of integration, and we can enable a broader set of customers to use our technology, we should be able to benefit from that.

We will try to address it a little better during our Analyst Day and explain what we're doing in order to exploit the opportunities.

And yes, there was some replenishment of inventory going on this quarter, but we also see some growth next quarter in the wireless business. And some of that is related to the China market as well."

So what we see is the continuing opportunity and actually a growing opportunity for FPGA content in wireless. We're seeing the number of players who can effectively design ASICs, which is the other option, because there really isn't a viable ASSP solution at this point in time. We don't see that happening anytime soon. So it's ASIC versus FPGAs. We're seeing less and less players with the capacity to do that. And so the role of FPGAs' growth and with each generation, generally speaking, the average ASP per system is a little higher. It doesn't reflect the much-larger role the FPGA has in the system, so it's an integration play. We replaced a lot of other components. We have more major part, but the ASP does not go out at the same level to reflect the value the FPGA provides. But generally speaking, it's one of those markets, where the role of the FPGA continues to grow. And the major competition is the very, very, very few, and actually diminished number of players who can design ASIC alternatives. And that number continues, with each generation of production, to go lower and lower."

Xilinx sales were $566 million, up 7% sequentially and at the high end of our guidance. We experienced exceptional new product growth during the quarter, driven by our 28-nanometer 7 Series products and 20-nanometer UltraScale products. End market strength was broad based, with communications and Industrial, Aerospace & Defense recovering as anticipated. The Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive category was down slightly driven primarily by automotive, which was impacted by the timing of customer purchases. We expect automotive to post strong growth in the March quarter and to increase by 30% in the full fiscal year '16.
Gross margin was 68.5% for the quarter. In addition to the expected impact of customer mix shift to our larger customers, gross margin was impacted by higher-than-anticipated production ramp costs associated with the aggressive introduction of our new products. Our March quarter guidance incorporates a small impact from these costs.
Operating expenses, including $2 million of amortization expense, were $228 million, slightly lower-than-expected as a result of disciplined spending. Other income was a net expense of $5 million, better than anticipated due primarily to higher investment income. The tax rate for the quarter was 15.6%. There were 2 discrete tax items impacting the rate. There was a $0.03 per share benefit from the retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit and a 5 -- excuse me, $0.05 per share negative impact due to a change in the amount of foreign earnings for which U.S. tax is provided.
Net income for the quarter was $131 million or $0.49 per diluted share. Operating cash flow for the December quarter was $290 million before $6 million in CapEx. Strong cash flow for the quarter was positively impacted by net improvement in working capital driven by a reduction in receivables and inventories. Diluted shares for the quarter were 270 million. There was a 10.6 million share diluted -- dilutive effect from our convertible notes. For questions related to dilution associated with our convertible debt, please visit our Investor Relations website at www.investor.xilinx.com.
We repurchased 2.1 million shares for $100 million during the quarter and paid $80 million in dividends. Let me now comment on the balance sheet.
Cash and investments were $3.6 billion. We have $600 million in convertible debt and $1 billion in fixed-rate debt, resulting in a net cash position of approximately $2 billion. Inventory dollars at Xilinx decreased by $17 million sequentially. We expect inventories to be down again in the March quarter. Let me now turn to discussion of guidance for the March quarter of fiscal year '16. Our backlog heading into the March quarter is up slightly. We are forecasting continued growth in 28-nanometer and 20-nanometer products. We expect communications to be flat with increases in wireless offsetting decreases in wired. Industrial, Aerospace & Defense is forecasted to be down slightly with decreases in IAs offsetting increases in defense.
Lastly, we are expecting consumer, auto and broadcast to be up, driven by automotive, which is forecasted to have a record quarter. As a result, we are expecting total sales to be approximately flat sequentially. The midpoint of this guidance is predicated on turns rate of approximately 48%. Gross margin is expected to be between 68% and 69%. Operating expenses for the March quarter are expected to be approximately $220 million, including $1 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. Other income and expense for the March quarter will be a net expense of $6 million. The share count is expected to be approximately 267 million shares. The tax rate for the March quarter is expected to be between 13% and 14%. The increase in the tax rate forecast is a result of the previously stated changes.
Let me now turn the call over to Moshe."

I'm very pleased that we delivered a significant growth quarter with revenue hitting the high end of our guidance.

I'm very pleased that we delivered a significant growth quarter with revenue hitting the high end of our guidance. Overall, 6 of our 8 end markets grew demonstrating the strength of our highly diversified anti-market portfolio. Particularly, I'm gratified that this growth was driven by an exceptionally strong surge from our new products category, primarily our latest 20-nanometer and 28-nanometer production node, which delivered an 18% sequential quarterly increase. The December quarter 28-nanometer sales grew significantly, obtaining a new record revenue level. 28-nanometer revenue growth benefited from broad-based sales contributions from industrial, broadcast, defense, test and measurements and consumer markets in conjunction with a significant forecasted recovery in the communications markets. The current March quarter, driven again by a majority of our end markets, we expect to repeat this trend and set a new quarterly 28-nanometer revenue record.
Similarly, 20-nanometer revenue in December quarter significantly exceeded the $20 million target we had set last quarter. With no 20-nanometer competition, the Virtex UltraScale high-end family continues to represent the largest percentage of our 20-nanometer sales. Additionally, our Kintex UltraScale family demonstrated significant sales momentum with revenue doubling in the quarter.
Looking forward to the March quarter, driven by many of our end markets and led by test and measurement, defense and consumer, we expect 20-nanometer sales to exceed our new $25 million quarterly target. These business successes, both the 20 and 28 nodes, are being bolstered by the significant milestones we have achieved with our 16-nanometer UltraScale+ family, extending our clear industry and technology leadership.
Since the September quarter, we've already shipped the industry's first 16-nanometer All Programmable MPSoC to tens of customers. This broad customer shipment milestone was achieved a quarter ahead of schedule, enabled by the excellent functionality of our first 16-nanometer silicon. More recently, we received silicon of our 16-nanometer Virtex silicon, which is exhibiting similarly pristine functionality. Consequently, we plan to ship it to customers by the end of January, significantly ahead of our original schedule.
In addition, we taped out 2 additional 16-nanometer devices last quarter, and we fully expect to continue this accelerated ramp of new product taped out throughout fiscal year '17 to build up upon and extend our time-to-market advantage. The silicon leadership position is being complemented on the software front by our enabling broad public access to design tool support the 16-nanometer UltraScale+ family. 
The breakthrough capabilities of the 16-nanometer UltraScale+ product family, coupled with our very significant first-mover advantage, make it uniquely suited for high-growth applications, ranging from next-generation trans-drive resistance, industrial Internet of Things to 5G wireless.
Lastly, following the October announcement of our strategic partnership with Qualcomm for compute acceleration in our base servers, Xilinx and IBM announced a similar collaboration to enable compute acceleration in servers based on the POWER architecture. This collaboration is expected to enable high-performance and energy-efficient FPGA-enabled workload acceleration of rapidly growing applications. Notwithstanding the recent turbulence in the global market, we continue to focus and deliver upon the elements we can control, namely, our total technology execution, our ability to expand the serviceable market, utilizing our leadership portfolio and our emphasis on maximizing shareholder value.

Well, as you look over the past couple of years, clearly, we had a challenge in terms of our revenue, and what we identified was there were 2 elements -- significant elements which were challenges for us. We're a multi-market company, so we're very diversified, and I think that's generally good. But the 2 challenges we had were on the A&D front and on the wireless front. And wireless, depending on the point in time, is typically north of 20% and A&D can be in the mid-teens depending on the cycle. And those 2 markets hit low points. The low point for wireless, we believe, was in the June quarter, and the low point for A&D was in the September quarter. And so those 2 markets, which were a bit of a drag now, we believe, are in recovery mode. And what we're seeing is, generally speaking, on most or all of our markets we're seeing growth isn't linear. So it sort of goes up, goes down a little. But generally speaking, we think the worst is behind us, and we expect to see over the next 2 quarters better results than we have seen in the past. And it's driven by a very strong technology cycle, so it's driven by the 28-nanometer and the 20-nanometer now hitting record revenue. They hit records in the December quarter. We expect them to the prior records in the March quarter. There's sort of impacts of the 14 weeks versus 13 weeks, you could sort of -- we've generally modeled that as between 2% to 3% in terms of benefiting from that this past -- during that obviously won't -- we won't have that in the current March quarter. So we think that what you're seeing is -- regardless of that, you're actually seeing some growth on an apples-to-apples comparison. Beyond March, we're loathe to give predictions, and we're probably going to give predictions on a quarter-by-quarter basis going forward because of the choppiness in the market. So that's sort of the Reader's Digest version. I could spend the whole hour. Hopefully that helped."

Our expectation is that, notwithstanding that element, there is an expectation of competing solutions coming to market, be they competing architectures. The 2 that are obvious are the ARM and the power ones. But even on the x86 front, we believe that we can provide a lot of the big players in the market a differentiated solution. So no, I believe that, that market, there's growth opportunity for us. I would say that definitely it's a market where Intel has the pole position. It will be foolhardy to state anything other than that with regards to that market in the x86 world. In the non-x86 world, it's sort of ours, by and large. With regard to the other markets I think it's fundamentally driven by the customers looking for who has the best technology solution, which, at this point, as you look at the 28-nanometer and 20 and our position on 16, we clearly have tremendous leadership, and our market share has grown there. We have leadership on the software front, and we clearly have the service demeanor, which is important to this customer -- to customers in these markets. So I think that it's a growth opportunity for us. We don't take anything for granted. We need to continue to deliver leadership and the best support, and our intention is to continue doing that.

And in the forecast, the guide was to have industrial down, test and measurement down and aerospace and defense, up. So I was just wasn't 100% sure of which quarter you were referring to when you made those comments, so I just want to be clear on that. So aerospace and defense, as Moshe pointed out earlier, has -- did bottom out in the September quarter. And we're starting to see strength in that business, particularly in many of the defense areas. The movement and the change and some of the things going on in the budget -- budgetary process is starting to -- we're starting to see some general goodness in terms of programs and emerging things going on there. But most of our business comes from existing programs -- current business comes from existing programs, and we're just seeing a very good -- continued very good penetration of products there. As our -- quite frankly, our 65-nanometer products are growing in that category. As you know, there's a big latency issue relative to the revenue ramp. But we're also seeing really good 28-nanometer growth over and above what we've seen maybe historically for a new product category growing. So I think our strength there is continuing to build and grow for Aerospace & Defense. From a -- and that's a U.S. and European statement more than it is as any other geography from the military perspective. Then in industrial, it's pretty choppy. We're seeing overall growth in industrial from a full-year-to-full-year basis, but by geography, it is kind of up and down. In this particular quarter, this past quarter, we had stronger numbers out of Japan than anywhere else, and everything else was kind of flattish to -- flat to down kind of situation. So it continues to be challenging in China and Asia-Pacific, as well as Europe, where we have a significant string -- set of consumers. So it's not like it's cratering and going down, it's just kind of a very choppy environment for us in industrial."

So we aren't really giving -- prepared to give any real long-term guidance or longer-term guidance, as Moshe mentioned a little earlier today. But we clearly expect growth next year for us as the strength of our new products overall are going to drive us there. We seem to be in such a really strong position, even at the latest generation of product, the 16-nanometer products, vis-à-vis competition. We're getting very strong interest and demand, interest from our customers for 20 and 16-nanometer products. And then as we mentioned in Moshe's remarks, the uptake in terms of shipments of samples and early products has been extremely brisk for our customers, which demonstrates a lot of interest. And of course, we're hopeful that those turn into real significant revenue dollars downstream. From a margin perspective, we've been running, kind of bouncing around a little between 68 to 70 bps. Still confident we're in the 68 to 70 range in any sort of near term, plus or minus a few of the things that bumped us up to 70, and now down to 68.5. But I we're solidly in the 68 to 70 range, and we're going to provide more spending guidance at a later point. We really haven't gone through our plan fully and gone through all that entire exercise. So to summarize, I do believe in top-line growth year-on-year for next year and stable margin."

And once we have the debug done, then we can start turning the crank. What has happened is the level of functionality was so high on the initial silicon that we actually could sample it to customers, and we could almost immediately start taping out the other versions. And so the answer to your question is, we're basically exploiting the high quality of the engineering execution and it behooves us to capitalize on that because now as we take -- tape-out all of the other versions, we expect to extend our market leadership in terms of breadth of products and in terms of being -- having first-mover advantage. So it's that element which we're capitalizing on, and it will manifest itself with tape-out -- more tape-outs happening faster than we had expected, which is good news because there's more products out."

That you know it could happen, but it's unlikely to be the compound annual growth rate. So we're talking about single-digit growth. Even that, we obviously still need to deliver. And as John indicated, we do expect fiscal year '17 to be a growth year. On the general question, which we'll try to answer probably a little better at our Analyst Day, the point that I would like to make is that, except with high volume -- very high-volume markets, ASICs and ASSPs, and this is no longer a wet dream, right, this is documented, known and happening, and has happened over the past few years of becoming less and less viable. And that opens a serviceable market, and it requires the right silicone, and it requires the right software. And if we move forward and we continue to move forward with -- and being at the leading edge, there's less and less to compete with. And if we have the right silicone, we have the right level of integration, and we can enable a broader set of customers to use our technology, we should be able to benefit from that. That's sort of the very high-level answer. I'd love to give you a more profound answer, but that isn't something we can do now. We will try to address it a little better during our Analyst Day and explain what we're doing in order to exploit the opportunities. And amongst other things, just a snippet is, if you look at the ARM product line, that enables us to service a market, which up to when it was available, we couldn't even touch, right? And that's the ASSP market. And we've gone from -- to it already being approaching 20% of our revenue in the U.S. node, right, and that just sort of shows you that it's an expansion play. We'll try and give more examples when explaining that in the future."

And so the role of FPGAs' growth and with each generation, generally speaking, the average ASP per system is a little higher. It doesn't reflect the much-larger role the FPGA has in the system, so it's an integration play. We replaced a lot of other components. We have more major part, but the ASP does not go up at the same level to reflect the value the FPGA provides. But generally speaking, it's one of those markets, where the role of the FPGA continues to grow.

Fiscal year '16 is another profitable year for Xilinx, although revenue did not meet our expectations going into the year. Revenue was $2.2 billion for the year, down 7% from last year but strengthening throughout FY '16. Gross margin remains strong through the year, averaging 69.7% as our pricing and cost management efforts continue to have a positive impact.
Operating margin exceeded 30% based on these margin management efforts and prudent spending. Professional margin was 33%, the same as last year. Though our lower revenues contributed to lower operating cash flow of $730 million. We repurchased 9.7 million shares for $423 million and paid $390 million in dividends, a total return of $761 million. This is the second straight year we have returned over 100% of cash flow and another straight year of dividend increase.
Turning now to a discussion of the fourth quarter. Xilinx sales were 571 [indiscernible] up 1% as new products continue to grow and we saw stabilizing trends across our end markets segments.
Communications was flat with the small growth in wireless offsetting a small decline in wired. Industrial and MD was down slightly with strengthened Aerospace & Defense, offsetting declines in [indiscernible] measurement. Broadcast consumer automotive grew 6% powered by another record quarter in automotive, demonstrating our strength in ASSPs.
Gross margin in Q4 was 69.2%, higher than last quarter and higher than expected due to the mix of customers and products in addition to lower products and expenses. We continued to aggressively manage both the pricing and cost sides of gross margin.
Operating expense at $270 million were slightly lower than our guidance. A reminder here that a significant part of the decline from Q3 was due to the 14th week in our Q3. The increase in revenue gross margin and lower operating expense drove an increase of more than 10% in operating income for the quarter up to $178 million.
Other income and expense was an expense of $8 million, higher than forecasted, due to and equity investment write off. The tax rate was 14.6% for the quarter.
Our net income for Q4 was $126 million or $0.54 per share. Operating cash flow was $127 million, down from last quarter, primarily due to an increase in accounts receivables. Diluted shares were $268 million or 1 million shares, including 10.5 million shares from the convertible. During the quarter, we repurchased 3 million shares for $143 million that we paid $80 million in dividends.
Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the year with $3.6 billion in gross cash and $2 billion a net cash after our debt. As mentioned above, we saw an increase in accounts receivable to $307 million, this is entirely due to the timing of customer shipments in the quarter and we see no credit or accountability issues.
Inventory was $179 million, down from $17 million from the prior quarter and down $52 million from the beginning of the year as we continue to manage inventory down.
Let me now turn the call over to Moshe."

I'm very pleased with both the financial and operating results for the fourth quarter. Our revenue has rebounded to its highest level in over a year by expanding the growth momentum which started in the fiscal third quarter. As Jon discuss",813,"Thank you, Jon. I'm very pleased with both the financial and operating results for the fourth quarter. Our revenue has rebounded to its highest level in over a year by expanding the growth momentum which started in the fiscal third quarter. As Jon discussed, both profitability and cash flow remains robust throughout the entire year, reflecting our strong business model.
Our execution on the 28-, 20- and 16-nanometer nodes has been exceptional. The realignment driven in our sales organization is leading stronger customer relationships and expanding our reach. We are confident this will translate into revenue growth for both market share gain and market expansion, following some achievement which illustrate the strength of our position.
Our product leadership has translated to 4 points of PLD market share gains over the past 5 years. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year '16, we delivered record sales on the 28-nanometer node and expect to set a significant new record in the June quarter.
Our 20-nanometer family approached $100 million in revenue in fiscal year '16, both significantly exceeding our target in all 4 quarters of fiscal year '16. We expect to ship well over $30 million of 20-nanometer product in the June quarter.
In a successful demonstration of our market expansion effort, revenue from our Zynq product line more than doubled in fiscal year '16. Zynq is particularly strong in the automotive, wireless and industrial market. For example, our automotive business has grown over 60% over the past 2 years, driven by employment of advanced driver systems applications and over 60 automobile models.
At the 16-nanometer node, we have delivered all 3 UltraScale + product family ahead of schedule and already shipped 6 unique products to several types of customers. Our 1 year-plus leadership in 16-nanometer product has generated multi-$100 million design wins on customer platforms, which in the past have traditionally been speed base. We have established data-centric partnership and data-centric acceleration initiatives with both IBM and Qualcomm, and now deeply engaged with multiple hyper-scale data center customers.
Lastly, we completed the rollout of the SDx family of software defined development environment. This is a key capability to significantly expanding our user base beyond traditional PLD designers to a much larger community systems and software engineers.
We finished fiscal year '16 with undisputed product leadership in the silicon, software and IP fronts. Very welcomed session in multiple markets coupled with much deeper engagement with key customers and partners. Our excellent execution could not have come to a more opportune time. The consolidation and semiconductor industry is leading to rationalization and elimination of competing product lines at both traditional ASIC and ASSPs companies. This phenomenon has opened up new growth opportunities for Xilinx is vendor of choice for new customers. This is a carpe diem opportunity. The time is right for us to capitalize on the 3 successive generation of leadership to expand our market position. We intend to do this by simultaneously pursuing on the following forefront. On the 16-nanometer UltraScale+ front due to its excellent software and pristine silicon functionality, we have elected to both accelerate our current lead plan 16-nanometer and expand original product portfolio. These multi-market 16-nanometer products complements our successful 20-nanometer family with its estimated 80% market share. The address each revenue growth opportunities in the data center market are tailored for the first wave of 5G deployments in the 2018 timeframe while positioning us for longer-term massive 5G deployments. After that, serve the automotive market and form a basis for expanding our platform wins in industrial Internet of Things.
Similarly, we are executing on our plans to deliver our 7-nanometer product offering. This capitalizes on our extremely tight relationship with our absolutely outstanding foundry partner, TSMC, to satisfy the advanced technology needs of our leading edge customers. This is another pillar of our sound expansion strategy. And parallel, we are committed to providing our customers with an attractive high volume [indiscernible] 7 family. This family would be implemented in 20-nanometer and will expand on our market position in the price-sensitive parts of the market. On the software front, we have enabled market expansion by breakout and integration and programming models targeted to high-growth segment driven by cloud computing, vision processing, including but not limited to industrial Internet of Things and 5G. Our plans for fiscal year '17 while aggressive, are based on the financial principles we have consistently demonstrated. We are committed to continue to investment prudently to preserve and extend our market position while delivering longer-term a 30%-plus operating margin and preserving our commitment to return cash to our shareholders.
Before I turn the call over to Lourenco who will discuss the financial guidance for Q1 for the rest of fiscal year '17. I would like to give this opportunity to personally thank Jon for his 11 years of extremely significant contribution and exemplary partnering for Xilinx. [indiscernible]"

And I also would like to thank Jon, specifically for the leadership function over the past 11 years. Moshe has established the opportunity for Xilinx and now, I want to provide you all with the financial guidance aligned to our taking advantage of that opportunity.
Starting with Q1. Revenue will be approximately flat. We entered the quarter with backlog down slightly and are expecting turns to be about 49%. We expect new products to continue to grow with 28-nanometer growing to a new record and 20-nanometer exceeding $30 million.
With respect to end markets, communications and data center growth were offset a decline in industrial and AMD. Communications and data center growth reflects a continued ramp of our customers wire designs and a near-term firming in wireless. The decline in industrial and AMD is primarily due to program timing in AMD. Broadcast automotive and consumer will be down slightly, reflecting a small inventory cycle in automotive and a small decline in broadcast. Our gross margin will be between 69% and 70%, and our operating expense will be approximately $220 million, including $1 million of amortization. Other income and expense will be an expense of $5 million, and our tax rate is expected to be 14%. Share count is expected to be $266 million.
As we move into the discussion of our full year guidance, I want to remind the audience that we have our Analyst Day on the 23rd of May in Boston. While I expect there will be questions on the full year guidance, we will give further details at our Analyst Day.
First, on revenue. We see actual revenue growth to be in the range of 48%. This will be driven by growth and communications and data center and Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive and to a lesser degree, by industrial in AMD. Within communications and data center, all end markets will show growth including wireless as it is recovered from the low points in FY '16. In Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive we expect automotive to continue to grow strongly, although at a reduced rate, with the other end markets showing some growth. In industrial and AMD, the overall growth of the segment will be mitigated by program timing factors in AMD, although the underlying business in AMD remains healthy. We see the growth of our overall business weighted into the second half of the fiscal year.
For gross margin we expect to remain in the range of 68% to 70%. Our price and cost management efforts will continue to support our gross margin, though we expect some pressure from product ramp expenses in cost per mix through the year.
For the past few years, we have been deliberately increasing our relative emphasis on R&D while extracting efficiency from SG&A. This has provided the resourcing for the execution we have seen on 28-, 20- and now 16-nanometer, and has put us in the advantageous position OSHA has described. We are continuing that approach with an investment level and focus consistent with addressing the opportunity we see in front of us. In order to capitalize on and extend our market position, operating expenses expected to grow 7% to 9% with almost all of the growth being in research and development. This growth provides the expansion of our leadership position with a 28-nanometer Spartan 7, significant increases in other expenses to accelerate our lead in 16-nanometer and our leading 7-nanometer product developer. Other income and expense will decline slightly through the year from the $5 million quarterly level in the first quarter. This will mean that we will see approximately half the expense we saw in fiscal year '16, a significant improvement driven by last year's interest rate increases and a small anticipated increase in interest rate in FY '17.
Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 14%.
With the growth in revenue and the operating assumptions I've described, we anticipate low-single digit growth in earnings per share in fiscal year '17.

So we actually have design wins and 20-nanometer, 16-nanometer and [indiscernible] we would expect to have significant disclaimer in 7-nanometer too. With 7-nanometer is typically high level of integration, higher performance, lower power, all of these things are important to this market where every 2 to 3 years, there's a total refresh of the data centers due to the rapid rate of evolvement. So data center is a big driver of a 7-nanometer business but, actually part of expansion, our 16-nanometer we expect to have significant benefit starting with our data center too. So you don't need to wait until 7-nanometer in order to see our revenue growth and it should come ahead of that. Given the nature of our business, after we take out the device, it usually takes a year to move into production and the deployment is very market specific. So there are markets that deploy very quickly. Emulation is an example of the one which deployed fastest. But data centers also first time-to-market for us. So it's probably 7-nanometer, our data center product should be generating revenue 2019, 2020, that sort of timeframe. Hopefully, that answers your question."

With that incremental improvement in every quarter to continuate in Aerospace & Defense, it ships out when you look at the full year was still shipped quite of few products in our first quarter last year that is dragging the year-on-year comparison down. So it's a modest growth in Aerospace & Defense. It is actually a very stable strong comeback for us, and when the redesign of the F-35 capabilities starts kicking in more towards the end of the next fiscal year, I think you're going to see some acceleration there. Industrial has been more about timing issue for us for certain customers A. And then some recent softness particularly in APAC that we're seeing softness in industrial and a couple of our regions, and that's going to grow a little more slowly than we thought, but we still are expecting pretty significant growth on a year-on-year basis."

And so when we delivered on that, you see the massive changes which are happening in a market. And no way I am minimizing the challenges of competing with very large corporations like Intel and new [indiscernible] et cetera. The only thing what's happening is that semiconductor market has matured, it's changing radically and it's changing in a way where a lot of applications, which in the past, could justify namesake or the small and medium-sized ASP company that would provide a complete solution. The basics are particularly viable and most of those little companies and medium-size companies have gone, they've disappeared, and some emerge, some just no longer viable. Both in reality, a lot of those product line do not have a path going forward. So we sort of looked at -- and this is a multi-market trend, right, so I wouldn't say it's in every single market, but is doing a lot of the market we service that we actually now finding that we have the much larger firm we can address through our product offering because our product offerings have evolved in the same product line in the like and the integrated capabilities we can provide an alternative to ASSPs. And so both through our technology, through our market leadership and through the fact of consolidation, largely is eliminating solutions for a lot of these markets which might not be multibillion-dollar markets, but they're nice markets for us we are the best game in town, and the customers are telling that. So I'm sitting in front of this great opportunity saying: ""okay, we have that technology leadership and these opportunities are coming up. Do I take my foot off the gas? Do I keep my foot on the gas, but where it was? Do I push the pedal, all the way down to the metal? And this was a strategic discussion we had. And we figured out that we can still remain at 30-plus percent operating margin frowth grow that point in and around and over time grow beyond it. And we'll talk a little more about that in May but we are still at the high and of profitability. So we might as well exploit this and in a nutshell this is an opportunity we think it would be [indiscernible] not to pursue it. As I said, we can do this while retaining a fabulous return of cash to investors with almost best-in-class operating margin. We can still do all of that. So yes, that's sort of -- that's the message we try to deliver and we will provide a little more clarity on that, and that's why you're seeing the investment grow, and it's almost all in R&D because we have to do more takeouts and we have to develop 2 or more things in parallel. One more thing of encapsulating this and this could be viewed as being arrogant, we do it because we can. The other way of looking at it is we're doing it because we can't afford not to exploit this great opportunity, right? That's the thinking behind this. So hopefully, again, that clarifies the strategic question. On the issue and data centers. So again, this is an evolving market which is [indiscernible] at this point in time and it's a market which traditionally has been serviced by CPUs and also the past several years NVidia in particular, has identified that there are segments that was serviced by GPUs and may actually have established a strong foothold in the market. What has become very clear and there's a lot of papers from third-parties, there's 1 from Microsoft which analyze what happened with these massively parallel applications and how they -- how well they do instead of just using a CPU or a GPU, you actually use an SPGA or program of logic. And what we found is for a lot of very critical applications is anywhere between potentially a 10x to a 35x improvement in performance per watt if you use programmable logic. And that's the essence that market is evolving. It's a market which is unique because most of it at this point in time is controlled by very large independent companies that actually control the ecosystem for this. So it doesn't require a Microsoft with all of the applications, it's actually a very -- it could be thought of as an embedded application, which is controlled by these very large companies and these very large companies are looking for alternatives to Intel and alternatives to GPUs. And this was cited by Intel, justifiably as one of the reasons that they acquired Altera and paid what they did for Altera, it was worth that much for them. Going forward, we expect the market to bifurcate into a an Intel x86 [indiscernible] and everyone else. With everyone else regardless of their x86 or powerbase or on-base and for most of these other players, this is significant growth market, then we are realistically the only game in town. Hence, we believe that's very possible for us. On the Intel x86 side, we do believe that Intel will do all sorts of integration things. Regardless of that, as we talk to these hyper scale customers, they're indicating to us that for a lot of their requirements, actually, a nonintegrated solution which they totally control is more attractive than one which is dictated to them from above. And so we are investing heavily. We think we have a big lead on the technology side and we do expect this to be a multi-hundred million dollar opportunity but again, this is in a 5-year time frame. This is -- we have design wins, we have several options, we are going to go into production soon and this is both likely in North America and outside America. But it's still early days and again, being a multi-market company, we believe that this will be a significant growth opportunity for us.

So we'll give a little more clarity as to when you can expect that in May. But this is not -- you're not going to need to wait several years for that. This year is particularly significant in terms of growth because to be totally open, we have so overachieved on the functionality of the 16-nanometer that we are just accelerating the takeouts when each of these takeouts is a multimillion dollar cost to us. So realistically, we're sort of pulling several of the names which is a good news because that means that over time, it will translate revenue quickly. But what you're seeing now, this rate of growth in R&D, which potentially could be larger than the top line, we do not expect that to continue in the future. And again, in May, we'll give you more."

It sort of what sort of happen in the past few years is we're in a business where most of the markets we serve takes a long time to come to fruition. And so if you look at 28-nanometer, which we take out 6 years ago, it is now approaching $200 million a quarter, it hasn't quite reached that level. At $200 million a quarter, is give or take, only 1/3, in or around, it's about 30% of revenue. So what you are seeing is the time it takes for the new nodes starting from 28 and now, 20 which as we said, we shipped close to 100 million relatively quickly for us during the past fiscal year. They're in their continued growth phase and also to the product line is now in its more accelerated growth phase, for example, automotive is driven by Zynq product lines, which is an expansion phase. So we're in a point in time where all of the headwinds we had which are all technology some execution challenges we have had in the past which we are paying the price for, et cetera. They're tailing off and the new technologies where we have much higher market share and where expansion plays are starting to pick up. And so, I think, your question is very fair and a very good one, but the reason is that we now see that the headwinds are tailing off and hence, the growth from the new products will happen and we're also seeing the changes in the industry. For example, I'll just throw one thing at you. 5 years ago, we predicted that the Japanese ASIC vendors would depart the stage, right? And at the time, that was considered an heresy, right, because it also market for the longest period of time. And to a large extent, they're gone, right? So that's an opportunity for us. So a lot of the other ASIC vendors is gone. I mean, it's not that there are no ASIC companies but there are fewer and fewer of them. The same thing is true on the ASSPs side. So the serviceable market is now growing and in order to exploit that, we are making this larger investments."

So sort of 2 peak to [indiscernible], it was almost 1/2 of the peak or maybe even less than 1/2 of the peak. And what we've seen is it's recovering. We think that there's a lot of things that happened because wireless is a multi-geography, multi-generation phenomenon on the infrastructure side. What we saw was there's the combination of all the bad news on all of the fronts happening at the same time for us. Since then, it has improved. We're seeing renewed deployment in China. We're seeing deployment in India, and this is all triggered around, this is not 5G, this is largely LTE. We think that LTE still has a lot of deployment left, and that will probably for the next few years, continue to carry things. What we're seeing which is very encouraging to us, is you go back 1 year or 1.5 years ago, the general feeling was that there would be rush towards 5G, and that is sort of totally changed. Now we've been in the past year. And then now seems to be a race towards 5G with an amazing amount of prototyping and proof of concept being done now and we actually have a great footprint there. We expect a quasi 5G or an early 5G to be deployed in 2018 at a minimum in Korea. But actually, there's no surprise that some early signs in North America. And then 2020 onwards, we expect it to grow, its expected to be a very large market and there's a lot of applications which are driving it. Smartphones even though they're not growing, their footprint in terms of bandwidth is increasing, all right? So maybe there's not that many new smartphones, but the refresh cycle is one which have [indiscernible] bandwidth, which actually require more bandwidth and significantly bigger load on the infrastructure and the applications of driving that. The other one is the Internet of Things both on the consumer and the industrial side, and that's expected to generate totally a new set of needs for infrastructure. So we think it's a big market. Again, we'll shed some more light on that in people with more expert in the field."

Fiscal year '16 is another profitable year for Xilinx, although revenue did not meet our expectations going into the year. Revenue was $2.2 billion for the year, down 7% from last year, but strengthening throughout FY '16. Gross margin remains strong through the year, averaging 69.7% as our pricing and cost management efforts continue to have a positive impact.
Operating margin exceeded 30% based on these margin management efforts and prudent spending. Cash flow margin was 33%, the same as last year, though our lower revenues contributed to a lower operating cash flow of $730 million. 
We repurchased 9.7 million shares for $423 million and paid $390 million in dividends, a total return of $761 million. This is the second straight year we have returned over 100% of cash flow and another straight year of dividend increase.
Turning now to a discussion of the fourth quarter. Xilinx' sales were $571 million, up 1% as new products continue to grow and we saw stabilizing trends across our end markets segments.
Communications was flat with the small growth in wireless offsetting a small decline in wired. Industrial and AMD was down slightly with strengthened Aerospace & Defense offsetting declines in industrial and test and measurement. 
Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive grew 6% powered by another record quarter in automotive, demonstrating our strength in ADAS.
Gross margin in Q4 was 69.2%, higher than last quarter and higher than expected due to the mix of customers and products in addition to lower product ramp expenses. We continued to aggressively manage both the pricing and cost sides of gross margin.
Operating expense at $270 million were slightly lower than our guidance. A reminder here that a significant part of the decline from Q3 was due to the 14th week in our Q3. The increase in revenue gross margin and lower operating expense drove an increase of more than 10% in operating income for the quarter up to $178 million.
Other income and expense was an expense of $8 million, higher than forecasted due to an equity investment write off. The tax rate was 14.6% for the quarter.
Our net income for Q4 was $126 million or $0.54 per share. Operating cash flow was $127 million, down from last quarter, primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable. Diluted shares were 268 million shares, including 10.5 million shares from the convertible. During the quarter, we repurchased 3 million shares for $143 million, and we paid $80 million in dividends.
Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the year with $3.6 billion in gross cash and $2 billion in net cash after our debt. As mentioned above, we saw an increase in accounts receivable to $307 million. This is entirely due to the timing of customer shipments in the quarter, and we see no credit or profitability issues.
Inventory was $179 million, down from $17 million from the prior quarter and down $52 million from the beginning of the year as we continue to manage inventory down.
Let me now turn the call over to Moshe."

I am very pleased with both the financial and operating results for the fourth quarter. Our revenue has rebounded to its highest level in over a year but expanding the growth momentum which started in the fiscal third quarter. As Jon discussed, both profitability and cash flow remained robust throughout the entire year, reflecting our strong business model.
Our execution on the 28-, 20- and 16-nanometer nodes has been exceptional. The realignment driven in our sales organization is leading to stronger customer relationships and expanding our reach. We are confident this will translate into revenue growth from both market share gains and market expansion, following some achievement which illustrate the strength of our position.
Our technology and product leadership has translated to 4 points of PLD market share gains over the past 5 years. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year '16, we delivered record sales on the 28-nanometer node and expect to set a significant new record in the June quarter.
Our 20-nanometer family approached $100 million in revenue in fiscal year '16 whilst significantly exceeding our targets in all 4 quarters of fiscal year '16. We expect to ship well over $30 million of 20-nanometer product in the June quarter.
In a successful demonstration of our market expansion efforts, revenue from our Zynq product line more than doubled in fiscal year '16. Zynq is particularly strong in the automotive, wireless and industrial markets. For example, our automotive business has grown over 60% over the past 2 years, driven by deployment of advanced driver systems applications in over 60 automobile models.
At the 16-nanometer node, we've delivered all 3 UltraScale + product families ahead of schedule and have already shipped 6 unique products to several tens of customers. Our 1 year-plus leadership in 16-nanometer products has generated multi-$100 million design wins on customer platforms, which in the past have traditionally been ASSP based. We have established data center partnership targeting data center acceleration initiatives with both IBM and Qualcomm and are deeply engaged with multiple hyper-scale data center customers.
Lastly, we completed the rollout of the SDx family of software defined development environment. This is a key capability to significantly expanding our user base beyond traditional PLD designers to a much larger community of systems and software engineers.
We finished fiscal year '16 with undisputed product leadership on the silicon, software and IP fronts, very well positioned in multiple markets coupled with much deeper engagements with key customers and partners. Our excellent execution could not have come at a more opportune time. The consolidation in the semiconductor industry is leading to rationalization and elimination of competing product lines at both traditional ASIC and ASSP companies. This phenomenon has opened up new growth opportunities for Xilinx as the vendor of choice to our existing and new customers. This is a carpe diem opportunity. The time is ripe -- right for us to capitalize on the 3 successive generations of leadership to expand our market position. We intend to do this by simultaneously pursuing on the following forefront. On the 16-nanometer UltraScale+ front, due to its excellent software and pristine silicon functionality, we have elected to both accelerate our current preplanned 16-nanometer tapeouts and expand our original product portfolio. These multi-market 16-nanometer products complement our successful 20-nanometer family with its estimated 80% market share. They address near-term revenue growth opportunities in the data center market, are tailored for the first wave of 5G deployments in the 2018 timeframe while positioning us for longer-term massive 5G deployments after that, serve the automotive market and form the basis for expanding our platform wins in industrial Internet of Things.
Similarly, we are executing on our plans to deliver our 7-nanometer product offering. This capitalizes on our extremely tight relationship with our absolutely outstanding foundry partner, TSMC, to satisfy the advanced technology needs of our bleeding-edge customers. This is another pillar of our sound expansion strategy. 
In parallel, we are committed to providing our customers with an attractive high volume Spartan-7 family. This family will be implemented in 20-nanometers and will expand our market position in the price-sensitive parts of the market. On the software front, we have enabled market expansion by a breakout in integration and programming models targeted to high-growth segments driven by cloud computing, vision processing, including but not limited to ADAS, the industrial Internet of Things and 5G. Our plans for fiscal year '17, while aggressive, are based on the financial principles we have consistently demonstrated. We are committed to continue to investment prudently to preserve and extend our market position while delivering longer-term a 30%-plus operating margin and preserving our commitment to return cash to our shareholders.
Before I turn the call over to Lorenzo, who will discuss the financial guidance for Q1 and the rest of fiscal year '17, I would like to use this opportunity to personally thank Jon for his 11 years of extremely significant contributions and exemplary partnering the home of Xilinx. Lorenzo, you have to [indiscernible]."

Moshe has established the compelling opportunity for Xilinx, and now I want to provide you all with the financial guidance aligned to our taking advantage of that opportunity.
Starting with Q1. Revenue will be approximately flat. We entered the quarter with backlog down slightly and are expecting turns to be about 49%. We expect new products to continue to grow, with 28-nanometer growing to a new record and 20-nanometer exceeding $30 million.
With respect to end markets, communications and data center growth will offset a decline in industrial and AMD. Communications and data center growth reflects a continued ramp of our customers wire designs and a near-term firming in wireless. The decline in industrial and AMD is primarily due to program timing in AMD. Broadcast, automotive and consumer will be down slightly, reflecting a small inventory cycle in automotive and a small decline in broadcast. Our gross margin will be between 69% and 70%, and our operating expense will be approximately $220 million, including $1 million of amortization. Other income and expense will be an expense of $5 million, and our tax rate is expected to be 14%. Share count is expected to be 266 million.
As we move into the discussion of our full year guidance, I want to remind the audience that we have our Analyst Day on the 23rd of May in Boston. While I expect there will be questions on the full year guidance, we will give further details at our Analyst Day.
First, on revenue. We see annual revenue growth to be in the range of 4% to 8%. This will be driven by growth in communications and data center and Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive and, to a lesser degree, by industrial and AMD. Within communications and data center, all end markets will show growth, including wireless as it has recovered from the low points in FY '16. In Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive, we expect automotive to continue to grow strongly although at a reduced rate, with the other end markets showing some growth. In industrial and AMD, the overall growth of the segment will be mitigated by program timing factors in AMD, although the underlying business in AMD remains healthy. We see the growth of our overall business weighted into the second half of the fiscal year.
For gross margin, we expect to remain in the range of 68% to 70%. Our price and cost management efforts will continue to support our gross margin, though we expect some pressure from product ramp expenses and customer mix through the year.
For the past few years, we have been deliberately increasing our relative emphasis on R&D while extracting efficiency from SG&A. This has provided the resourcing for the execution we have seen on 28-, 20- and now 16-nanometer, and has put us in the advantageous position Moshe has described. We are continuing that approach with an investment level and focus consistent with addressing the opportunity we see in front of us. In order to capitalize on and extend our market position, operating expense is expected to grow 7% to 9%, with almost all of the growth being in research and development. This growth flamed the expansion of our leadership position with the 28-nanometer Spartan 7, significant increases in tapeout expenses to accelerate our lead in 16-nanometer and our leading 7-nanometer product development. Other income and expense will decline slightly through the year from the $5 million quarter level in the first quarter. This will mean that we will see approximately half the expense we saw in fiscal year '16, a significant improvement driven by last year's interest rate increases and a small anticipated increase in interest rates in FY '17. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 14%.
With the growth in revenue and the operating assumptions I've described, we anticipate low-single digit growth in earnings per share in fiscal year '17.

So it's a market which we expect, over the next 5 years, to grow [indiscernible] for us. It could be significant. And in that sort of timeframe, as we execute, we believe that it could be a multi-hundred million dollar market which, for us, is a big number. We can service it and we are servicing it already with our existing product portfolio. So we actually have design wins in 20-nanometer, 16-nanometer. And [indiscernible] we would expect to have significant design wins in 7-nanometer too. What you will get from 7-nanometer is typically higher level of integration, higher performance, lower power. All of these things are important to this market where, every 2 to 3 years, there's a total refresh of the data centers due to the rapid rate of evolvement. So data center is a big driver of our 7-nanometer business, but actually part of the expansion on our 16-nanometer, we expect to have significant benefits started with the data center too. So you don't need to wait until 7-nanometer in order to see our revenue growth in data center, it should come ahead of that. Given the nature of our business, after we take out the device, this typically takes a year to move into production, and then the deployment is very market specific. So there are markets that deploy very quickly. Emulation is an example of the one which deploys fastest. But data center is also a fast time-to-market for us. So probably 7-nanometer our data center product should be generating revenue 2019, 2020, that sort of time frame. Hopefully, that answers your question."

And so when you've delivered on that, and you see the massive changes which are happening in the market, and no way am I minimizi",1075,"It has been in the past and I think our 3 generations of leadership, we -- allow me to sort of feel vindicated on that topic. And so when you've delivered on that, and you see the massive changes which are happening in the market, and no way am I minimizing the challenges of competing with very large corporations, like Intel, like the new Broadcomm et cetera, but relative what is happening is the semiconductor market has matured, is changing radically. And it's changing in a way where a lot of applications which, in the past, could justify namesake [ph] or there would be a small and medium-sized ASSP company that would provide a complete solution, neither the ASICs are particularly viable and most of those little companies and medium-size companies have gone, they've disappeared and some have merged, some just are no longer viable. But in reality, a lot of those product lines do not have a path going forward. So we sort of looked at -- and this is a multi-market trend, right, so I wouldn't say that it's true in every single market, but it's true in a lot of the markets that we service that we actually now are finding that we have the much -- it's a much larger fam we can address through our product offering because our product offerings have evolved and with the same product line and the like and the integrated capabilities we can provide an alternative to ASSPs. And so both through our technology, through our market leadership and through the fact that the consolidation largely is eliminating solutions for a lot of these markets, which might not be multibillion-dollar markets, but they're nice markets for us, we are the best game in town. And the customers are telling us that. So I'm sitting in front of this great opportunity saying, ""Okay, we have the technology leadership and these opportunities are coming up. Do I take my foot off the gas? Do I keep my foot on the gas but -- where it was? Or I -- do I push the pedal all the way down to the metal?"" And this was a strategic decision discussion we had. And we figured out that we can still remain at 30-plus percent operating margin grow to that point and in and around and over time grow beyond it. And we'll talk a little more about that in May. But we're sort of at the high end of profitability, so we might as well exploit this. And in a nutshell, this is an opportunity and we think it would be foolhardy not to pursue it. And as I said, we can do this while retaining a fabulous return of cash to investors with almost best-in-class operating margin. We can still do all of that. So yes, that's sort of -- that's the message we try to deliver and we will provide a little more clarity on that. And that's why you're seeing the investment grow, and it's almost all in R&D because we have to do more tapeouts, and we have to develop a few more things in parallel. So one way of doing it, of encapsulating this, and this could be viewed as being arrogant, we're doing it because we can. The other way of looking at it is we're doing it because we can't afford not to exploit this great opportunity, right. And that's the thinking behind this. So hopefully, again, that clarifies the strategic question. On the architectural issue and data centers. So again, this is an evolving market which is nascent at this point in time, and it's a market which traditionally has been serviced by CPUs. And over the past several years, NVIDIA, in particular, has identified that there are segments that are well serviced by GPUs and may actually have established a strong foothold in the market. What has become very clear, and there's a lot of papers from third-parties, there's one from Microsoft, which analyzed what happens with these massively parallel applications and how they -- how well they do if instead of just using a CPU or a GPU, you actually use an FPGA or programmable logic. And what they found is that for a lot of very critical applications, there's anywhere between potentially a 10x to a 35x improvement in performance per watt if you use programmable logic. And that's the essence that market is evolving. It's a market which is unique because most of it at this point in time is controlled by very large independent companies that actually control the ecosystem for this. So it doesn't require a Microsoft with all of the x86 applications. It's actually a very -- it can be thought of as an embedded application, which is controlled by these very large companies. And these very large companies are looking for alternatives to Intel and alternatives to GPUs. And this was cited by Intel justifiably as one of the reasons that they acquired Altera and paid what they did for Altera. It was worth that much for them. Going forward, we expect the market to bifurcate into an Intel x86 camp and everyone else, where the everyone else, regardless of their x86 or power-based or ARM-based and for most of these other players, this is a significant growth market, and we are realistically the only game in town. Hence, we believe that that's very possible for us. On the Intel x86 side, we do believe that Intel will do all sorts of integration things. Regardless of that, as we talk to these hyper-scale customers, they're indicating to us that, for a lot of their requirements, actually a nonintegrated solution which they totally control is more attractive than one which is dictated to them from above. And so we are investing heavily. We think we have a big lead on the technology side, and we do expect this to be a multi-hundred million dollar opportunity. But again, this is -- in a 5-year time frame, this is -- we have design wins. We have several of them. They are going to go into production soon. And this is both likely in North America and outside America. But it's still early days. And again, being a multi-market company, we believe that this will be a significant growth opportunity for us. So I apologize for the verbose answer, but there's a lot to cover on both."

So realistically, we're sort of pulling several of the name [ph] which is good news because that means that, over time, it should translate to revenue quickly.

What sort of happened over the past few years is we're in a business where most of the markets we serve take a long time to come to fruition. So if you look at 28-nanometer, which we taped out 6 years ago, it is now approaching $200 million a quarter. It hasn't quite reached that level. And $200 million a quarter is, give or take, only 1/3. In or around, it's about 30% of our overall revenue. So what you're seeing is the time it takes for the new nodes, starting from 28 and now at 20 which, as we said, we shipped close to 100 million relatively quickly for us during the past fiscal year. They're in their continued growth phase and also the Zynq product line is now in its more accelerated growth phase. For example, automotive is driven by the Zynq product line, which is an expansion play. And so we're at a point in time where all of the headwinds we had, which are old technologies, some execution challenges we have had in the past which we are paying the price for, et cetera, they're tailing off and the new technologies where we have much higher market share and where the expansion plays are starting to pick up. And so, I think your question is very fair and a very good one, but the reason is that we now see that the headwinds are tailing off and, hence, the growth from the new products will happen. And we're also seeing the changes in the industry. For example, I'll just throw one thing at you. 5 years ago, we predicted that the Japanese ASIC vendors would depart the stage, right. And at the time, that was considered heresy, right, because it owned the market for the longest period of time. And to a large extent, they're gone, right, so that's an opportunity for us. So a lot of the other ASIC vendors have gone. I mean, it's not that there are no ASIC companies, but there are fewer and fewer of them. The same thing is true on the ASSP side. So the serviceable market is now growing. And in order to exploit that, we are making these larger investments."

So it's only 9 months since we taped it out, and we already are shipping 6 derivative unique products, so that means that we've done 6 tapeouts which we said it's really in very good shape. And you're right that if we sort of sit back and we have a very worthy competitor and we just let them -- don't exploit that, we're likely to compromise the potential here. So yes, there is an element of that. That's on a core programmable logic business, but this goes beyond programmable logic because with 16-nanometer and with 7, and with Zynq, we can provide an alternative to ASICs and ASSPs, and those are nontraditional competitors.

We think there was a -- there's a lot of things that happened because wireless is a multi-geography, multi-generation phenomenon on the infrastructure side. What we saw was there's the combination of all of the bad news on all of the fronts happened at the same time for us. Since then, it has improved. We're seeing renewed deployment in China. We're seeing deployment in India. And this is all triggered around -- this is not 5G, this is largely LTE. We think that LTE still has a lot of deployment left. And that will probably, for the next few years, continue to carry things. What we're seeing, which is very encouraging to us, is if you go back 1 year or 1.5 years ago, the general feeling was that there would be no rush towards 5G. And that has sort of totally changed. Now we've been in the past year, and then now seems to be a race towards 5G with an amazing amount of prototyping and proof of concept being done now and we actually have a great footprint there. We expect a quasi 5G or an early 5G to be deployed in 2018 at a minimum in Korea. But actually, there's no -- don't be surprised if there's some early signs in North America. And then 2020 onward, we expect it to grow. It's expected to be a very large market, and there's a lot of applications which are driving it. Smartphones, even though they are not growing their footprint in terms of bandwidth, is increasing, right. So maybe there's not that many new smartphones, but the refresh cycle is one which have yield bandwidth -- which require more bandwidth and significantly bigger load on the infrastructure and the applications of driving that. The other one is the Internet of Things both on the consumer and the industrial side. And that's expected to generate totally a new set of needs for infrastructure. So we think it's a big market. Again, we'll shed some more light on that in May from people who are more expert in the field."

And then, my guess is you'll address this in a lot more detail at the Analyst Day, and I'm not a huge fan of looking at seasonality because there's so much variance around seasonality. But if I just pivot seasonally off your June guidance, I'm getting fiscal revenue year growth in '17 that's more flattish versus kind of the 6% midpoint guidance you gave. I'm just kind of curious, can you give us some broad strokes as to what end markets or what product portfolios you think are going to start driving sort of better than seasonal growth as you go throughout the year?"

And I know you acknowledged that up front, John, but I think what you were really saying in this market environment, it is the continued growth of our new products, which you can view as not being terribly impacted by seasonality and the expansion into new markets which also are not impacted by seasonality, they are driving our overall growth for the year. And those would be the continued ramp of new products in our wired business, like I -- and I made in my commentary, there's relative firmness in wireless, expansion in the data center, continued growth in the expansion opportunity we've developed in automotive.

Fiscal year '16 is another profitable year for Xilinx, although revenue did not meet our expectations going into the year. Revenue was $2.2 billion for the year, down 7% from last year, but strengthening throughout FY '16. Gross margin remains strong through the year, averaging 69.7% as our pricing and cost management efforts continue to have a positive impact.
Operating margin exceeded 30% based on these margin management efforts and prudent spending. Cash flow margin was 33%, the same as last year, though our lower revenues contributed to a lower operating cash flow of $730 million. 
We repurchased 9.7 million shares for  $443 million and paid $390 million in dividends, a total return of $761 million. This is the second straight year we have returned over 100% of cash flow and another straight year of dividend increase.
Turning now to a discussion of the fourth quarter. Xilinx' sales were $571 million, up 1% as new products continue to grow and we saw stabilizing trends across our end markets segments.
Communications was flat with a small growth in wireless offsetting a small decline in wired. Industrial and A&D was down slightly with strengthened Aerospace & Defense offsetting declines in industrial and test and measurement. 
Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive grew 6% powered by another record quarter in automotive, demonstrating our strength in ADAS.
Gross margin in Q4 was 69.2%, higher than last quarter and higher than expected due to the mix of customers and products in addition to lower product ramp expenses. We continued to aggressively manage both the pricing and cost sides of gross margin.
Operating expense at $270 million were slightly lower than our guidance. A reminder here that a significant part of the decline from Q3 was due to the 14th week in our Q3. The increase in revenue gross margin and lower operating expense drove an increase of more than 10% in operating income for the quarter up to $178 million.
Other income and expense was an expense of $8 million, higher than forecasted due to an equity investment write off. The tax rate was 14.6% for the quarter.
Our net income for Q4 was $146 million [sic $145] or $0.54 per share. Operating cash flow was $127 million, down from last quarter, primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable. Diluted shares were 268 million shares, including 10.5 million shares from the convertible. During the quarter, we repurchased 3 million shares for $143 million, and we paid $80 million in dividends.
Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the year with $3.6 billion in gross cash and $2 billion in net cash after our debt. As mentioned above, we saw an increase in accounts receivable to $307 million. This is entirely due to the timing of customer shipments in the quarter, and we see no credit or collectibility issues.
Inventory was $179 million, down from $17 million from the prior quarter and down $52 million from the beginning of the year as we continue to manage inventory down.

I am very pleased with both the financial and operating results for the fourth quarter.

I am very pleased with both the financial and operating results for the fourth quarter. Our revenue has rebounded to its highest level in over a year but expanding the growth momentum which started in the fiscal third quarter. As Jon discussed, both profitability and cash flow remained robust throughout the entire year, reflecting our strong business model.
Our execution on the 28-, 20- and 16-nanometer nodes has been exceptional. The realignment driven in our sales organization is leading to stronger customer relationships and expanding our reach. We are confident this will translate into revenue growth from both market share gains and market expansion, following some achievement which illustrate the strength of our position.
Our technology and product leadership has translated to 4 points of PLD market share gains over the past 5 years. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year '16, we delivered record sales on the 28-nanometer node and expect to set a significant new record in the June quarter.
Our 20-nanometer family approached $100 million in revenue in fiscal year '16 whilst significantly exceeding our targets in all 4 quarters of fiscal year '16. We expect to ship well over $30 million of 20-nanometer product in the June quarter.
In a successful demonstration of our market expansion efforts, revenue from our Zynq product line more than doubled in fiscal year '16. Zynq is particularly strong in the automotive, wireless and industrial markets. For example, our automotive business has grown over 60% over the past 2 years, driven by deployment of advanced driver systems applications in over 60 automobile models.
At the 16-nanometer node, we've delivered all 3 UltraScale + product families ahead of schedule and have already shipped 6 unique products to several tens of customers. Our 1 year-plus leadership in 16-nanometer products has generated multi-$100 million design wins on customer platforms, which in the past have traditionally been ASSP based. We have established data center partnership targeting data center acceleration initiatives with both IBM and Qualcomm and are deeply engaged with multiple hyper-scale data center customers.
Lastly, we completed the rollout of the SDx family of software defined development environments. This is a key capability to significantly expanding our user base beyond traditional PLD designers to a much larger community of systems and software engineers.
We finished fiscal year '16 with undisputed product leadership on the silicon, software and IP fronts, very well positioned in multiple markets coupled with much deeper engagements with key customers and partners. Our excellent execution could not have come at a more opportune time. The consolidation in the semiconductor industry is leading to rationalization and elimination of competing product lines at both traditional ASIC and ASSP companies. This phenomenon has opened up new growth opportunities for Xilinx as the vendor of choice to our existing and new customers. This is a carpe diem opportunity. The time is ripe -- ripe for us to capitalize on the 3 successive generations of leadership to expand our market position. We intend to do this by simultaneously pursuing on the following forefront. On the 16-nanometer UltraScale+ front, due to its excellent software and pristine silicon functionality, we have elected to both accelerate our current preplanned 16-nanometer tapeouts and expand our original product portfolio. These multi-market 16-nanometer products complement our successful 20-nanometer family with its estimated 80% market share. They address near-term revenue growth opportunities in the data center market, are tailored for the first wave of 5G deployments in the 2018 timeframe while positioning us for longer-term massive 5G deployments after that, serve the automotive market and form the basis for expanding our platform wins in industrial Internet of Things.
Similarly, we are executing on our plans to deliver our 7-nanometer product offering. This capitalizes on our extremely tight relationship with our absolutely outstanding foundry partner, TSMC, to satisfy the advanced technology needs of our bleeding-edge customers. This is another pillar of our sound expansion strategy. 
In parallel, we are committed to providing our customers with an attractive high volume Spartan-7 family. This family will be implemented in 20-nanometers and will expand our market position in the price-sensitive parts of the market. On the software front, we have enabled market expansion by a breakout in integration and programming models targeted to high-growth segments driven by cloud computing, vision processing, including but not limited to ADAS, the industrial Internet of Things and 5G. Our plans for fiscal year '17, while aggressive, are based on the financial principles we have consistently demonstrated. We are committed to continue to investment prudently to preserve and extend our market position while delivering longer-term a 30%-plus operating margin and preserving our commitment to return cash to our shareholders.
Before I turn the call over to Lorenzo, who will discuss the financial guidance for Q1 and the rest of fiscal year '17, I would like to use this opportunity to personally thank Jon for his 11 years of extremely significant contributions and exemplary partnering the home of Xilinx. Lorenzo, you have big shoes to fill."

Moshe has established the compelling opportunity for Xilinx, and now I want to provide you all with the financial guidance aligned to our taking advantage of that opportunity.
Starting with Q1. Revenue will be approximately flat. We entered the quarter with backlog down slightly and are expecting turns to be about 49%. We expect new products to continue to grow, with 28-nanometer growing to a new record and 20-nanometer exceeding $30 million.
With respect to end markets, communications and data center growth will offset a decline in industrial and A&D. Communications and data center growth reflects a continued ramp of our customers wire designs and a near-term firming in wireless. The decline in industrial and A&D is primarily due to program timing in A&D. Broadcast, automotive and consumer will be down slightly, reflecting a small inventory cycle in automotive and a small decline in broadcast. Our gross margin will be between 69% and 70%, and our operating expense will be approximately $220 million, including $1 million of amortization. Other income and expense will be an expense of $5 million, and our tax rate is expected to be 14%. Share count is expected to be 266 million.
As we move into the discussion of our full year guidance, I want to remind the audience that we have our Analyst Day on the 23rd of May in Boston. While I expect there will be questions on the full year guidance, we will give further details at our Analyst Day.
First, on revenue. We see annual revenue growth to be in the range of 4% to 8%. This will be driven by growth in communications and data center and Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive and, to a lesser degree, by industrial and A&D. Within communications and data center, all end markets will show growth, including wireless as it has recovered from the low points in FY '16. In Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive, we expect automotive to continue to grow strongly although at a reduced rate, with the other end markets showing some growth. In industrial and A&D, the overall growth of the segment will be mitigated by program timing factors in A&D, although the underlying business in A&D remains healthy. We see the growth of our overall business weighted into the second half of the fiscal year.
For gross margin, we expect to remain in the range of 68% to 70%. Our price and cost management efforts will continue to support our gross margin, though we expect some pressure from product ramp expenses and customer mix through the year.
For the past few years, we have been deliberately increasing our relative emphasis on R&D while extracting efficiency from SG&A. This has provided the resourcing for the execution we have seen on 28-, 20- and now 16-nanometer, and has put us in the advantageous position Moshe has described. We are continuing that approach with an investment level and focus consistent with addressing the opportunity we see in front of us. In order to capitalize on and extend our market position, operating expense is expected to grow 7% to 9%, with almost all of the growth being in research and development. This growth flamed the expansion of our leadership position with the 28-nanometer Spartan 7, significant increases in tapeout expenses to accelerate our lead in 16-nanometer and our leading 7-nanometer product development. Other income and expense will decline slightly through the year from the $5 million quarter level in the first quarter. This will mean that we will see approximately half the expense we saw in fiscal year '16, a significant improvement driven by last year's interest rate increases and a small anticipated increase in interest rates in FY '17. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 14%.
With the growth in revenue and the operating assumptions I've described, we anticipate low-single digit growth in earnings per share in fiscal year '17.

So it's a market which we expect, over the next 5 years, to grow at a rapid rate for us. It could be significant. And in that sort of timeframe, as we execute, we believe that it could be a multi-hundred million dollar market which, for us, is a big number. We can service it and we are servicing it already with our existing product portfolio. So we actually have design wins in 20-nanometer and 16-nanometer. And [indiscernible] we would expect to have significant design wins in 7-nanometer too. What you will get from 7-nanometer is typically higher level of integration, higher performance, lower power. All of these things are important to this market where, every 2 to 3 years, there's a total refresh of the data centers due to the rapid rate of evolvement. So data center is a big driver of our 7-nanometer business, but actually part of the expansion on our 16-nanometer, we expect to have significant benefits started with the data center too. So you don't need to wait until 7-nanometer in order to see our revenue growth in data center, it should come ahead of that. Given the nature of our business, after we take out the device, this typically takes a year to move into production, and then the deployment is very market specific. So there are markets that deploy very quickly. Emulation is an example of the one which deploys fastest. But data center is also a fast time-to-market for us. So probably 7-nanometer our data center product should be generating revenue 2019, 2020, that sort of time frame. Hopefully, that answers your question."

So the -- I think well you've been -- you're familiar with the fact that we characterize, we had a roll off of a very large program, and we bottomed out I think in our June quarter of this past year for Aerospace & Defense. And we have had incremental improvement in each quarter from that point -- actually bottomed out in September -- excuse me, in the September quarter, not the June quarter. We've had incremental improvement in every quarter, and we do expect that incremental improvement to continue in Aerospace & Defense. It's just that when you look at the full year, we still shipped quite a bit of product in our first quarter of last year that is dragging the year-on-year comparison down, so it's a modest growth in Aerospace & Defense. It is actually a very stable strong comeback for us. And when the redesign of the F-35 capabilities starts kicking in more towards the end of the next fiscal year, I think you're going to see some acceleration there. Industrial has been more a bit of a timing issue for us with certain customers, a, and then some recent softness, particularly in APAC, that we're seeing softness in industrial in a couple of our regions. And that's going to grow a little more slowly than we thought, but we still are expecting pretty significant growth on a year-on-year basis."

And so when you've delivered on that, and you see the massive changes which are happening in the market, and no way am I minimizing the challenges of competing with very large corporations, like Intel, like the new Broadcomm et cetera, but relative what is happening is the semiconductor market has matured, is changing radically. And it's changing in a way where a lot of applications which, in the past, could justify an ASIC or there would be a small and medium-sized ASSP company that would provide a complete solution, neither the ASICs are particularly viable and most of those little companies and medium-size companies have gone, they've disappeared and some have merged, some just are no longer viable. But in reality, a lot of those product lines do not have a path going forward. So we sort of look at what -- and this is a multi-market trend, right, so I wouldn't say that it's true in every single market, but it's true in a lot of the markets that we service that we actually now are finding that we have the -- it's a much larger fam we can address through our product offering because our product offerings have evolved and with the same product line and the like and the integrated capabilities we can provide an alternative to ASSPs. And so both through our technology, through our market leadership and through the fact that the consolidation largely is eliminating solutions for a lot of these markets, which might not be multibillion-dollar markets, but they're nice markets for us, we are the best game in town. And the customers are telling us that. So I'm sitting in front of this great opportunity saying, ""Okay, we have the technology leadership and these opportunities are coming up. Do I take my foot off the gas? Do I keep my foot on the gas but -- where it was? Or I -- do I push the pedal all the way down to the metal?"" And this was a strategic decision discussion we had. And we figured out that we can still remain at 30-plus percent operating margin and grow to that point and in and around and over time grow beyond it. And we'll talk a little more about that in May. But we're sort of at the high end of profitability, so we might as well exploit this. And in a nutshell, this is an opportunity and we think it would be foolhardy not to pursue it. And as I said, we can do this while retaining a fabulous return of cash to investors with almost best-in-class operating margin. We can still do all of that. So yes, that's sort of -- that's the message we try to deliver and we will provide a little more clarity on that. And that's why you're seeing the investment grow, and it's almost all in R&D because we have to do more tapeouts, and we have to develop a few more things in parallel. So one way of doing it, of encapsulating this, and this could be viewed as being arrogant, we're doing it because we can. The other way of looking at it is we're doing it because we can't afford not to exploit this great opportunity, right. And that's the thinking behind this. So hopefully, again, that clarifies the strategic question. On the architectural issue and data centers. So again, this is an evolving market which is nascent at this point in time, and it's a market which traditionally has been serviced by CPUs. And over the past several years, NVIDIA, in particular, has identified that there are segments that are well serviced by GPUs and may actually have established a strong foothold in the market. What has become very clear, and there's a lot of papers from third-parties, there's one from Microsoft, which analyzed what happens with these massively parallel applications and how they -- how well they do if instead of just using a CPU or a GPU, you actually use an FPGA or programmable logic. And what they found is that for a lot of very critical applications, there's anywhere between potentially a 10x to a 35x improvement in performance per watt if you use programmable logic. And that's the essence that market is evolving. It's a market which is unique because most of it at this point in time is controlled by very large independent companies that actually control the ecosystem for this. So it doesn't require a Microsoft with all of the x86 applications. It's actually a very -- it can be thought of as an embedded application, which is controlled by these very large companies. And these very large companies are looking for alternatives to Intel and alternatives to GPUs. And this was cited by Intel justifiably as one of the reasons that they acquired Altera and paid what they did for Altera. It was worth that much for them. Going forward, we expect the market to bifurcate into an Intel x86 camp and everyone else, where the everyone else, regardless of their x86 or power-based or ARM-based and for most of these other players, this is a significant growth market, and we are realistically the only game in town. Hence, we believe that that's very profitable for us. On the Intel x86 side, we do believe that Intel will do all sorts of integration things. Regardless of that, as we talk to these hyper-scale customers, they're indicating to us that, for a lot of their requirements, actually a nonintegrated solution which they totally control is more attractive than one which is dictated to them from above. And so we are investing heavily. We think we have a big lead on the technology side, and we do expect this to be a multi-hundred million dollar opportunity. But again, this is -- in a 5-year time frame, this is -- we have design wins. We have several of them. They are going to go into production soon. And this is both likely in North America and outside America. But it's still early days. And again, being a multi-market company, we believe that this will be a significant growth opportunity for us. So I apologize for the verbose answer, but there's a lot to cover on both."

What sort of happened over the past few years is we're in a business where most of the markets we serve take a long time to come to fruition. So if you look at 28-nanometer, which we taped out 6 years ago, it is now approaching $200 million a quarter. It hasn't quite reached that level. And $200 million a quarter is, give or take, only 1/3. In or around, it's about 30% of our overall revenue. So what you're seeing is the time it takes for the new nodes, starting from 28 and now at 20 which, as we said, we shipped close to 100 million relatively quickly for us during the past fiscal year. They're in their continued growth phase and also the Zynq product line is now in its more accelerated growth phase. For example, automotive is driven by the Zynq product line, which is an expansion play. And so we're at a point in time where all of the headwinds we had, which are old technologies, some execution challenges we have had in the past which we are paying the price for, et cetera, they're tailing off and the new technologies where we have much higher market share and where the expansion plays are starting to pick up. And so, I think your question is very fair and a very good one, but the reason is that we now see that the headwinds are tailing off and, hence, the growth from the new products will happen. And we're also seeing the changes in the industry. For example, I'll just throw one thing at you. 5 years ago, we predicted that the Japanese ASIC vendors would depart the stage, right. And at the time, that was considered heresy, right, because they had owned the market for the longest period of time. And to a large extent, they're gone, right, so that's an opportunity for us. So a lot of the other ASIC vendors have gone. I mean, it's not that there are no ASIC companies, but there are fewer and fewer of them. The same thing is true on the ASSP side. So the serviceable market is now growing. And in order to exploit that, we are making these larger investments."

What we saw was there's the combination of all of the bad news on all of the fronts happened at the same time for us. Since then, it has improved. We're seeing renewed deployment in China. We're seeing deployment in India. And this is all triggered around -- this is not 5G, this is largely LTE. We think that LTE still has a lot of deployment left.

We expect a quasi 5G or an early 5G to be deployed in 2018 at a minimum in Korea. But actually, there's no -- don't be surprised if there's some early signs in North America. And then 2020 onward, we expect it to grow. It's expected to be a very large market, and there's a lot of applications which are driving it. Smartphones, even though they are not growing their footprint in terms of bandwidth, is increasing, right. So maybe there's not that many new smartphones, but the refresh cycle is one which have yield bandwidth -- which require more bandwidth and significantly bigger load on the infrastructure and the applications of driving that. The other one is the Internet of Things both on the consumer and the industrial side. And that's expected to generate totally a new set of needs for infrastructure. So we think it's a big market. Again, we'll shed some more light on that in May from people who are more expert in the field."

As expected, core products declined on a sequential and year-over-year basis. Communications increased 4% sequentially, with growth from both wired and wireless. Communications has stayed a modest but consistent recovery since bottoming in the June quarter a year ago and is up 22% on a year-over-year basis. 
Industrial and A&D was down slightly, with strength and test measurement and emulation not quite offsetting expected declines in industrial and aerospace and defense. 
Broadcast consumer and automotive was flat on a sequential basis, slightly better than anticipated due to stronger orders from Zynq driven ADAS applications. Both automotive and test and measurements reach record levels for the company in the June quarter. 
Gross margin in Q1 was 70.7%, higher than guided due to the mix of customers and products in addition to increased manufacturing efficiencies. We continue to aggressively optimize gross margin across our product portfolio. 
Operating expense at $220 million was in line with our guidance. Operating income for the quarter was $186 million or 32.4%. Other income and expense was an expense of $5 million as guided. 
The tax rate was 10% for the quarter, better than guided. This included the impact of the early adoption of an accounting standard related to the treatment of stock-based compensation. Our net income for Q1 was $163 million or $0.61 a share. This included a positive $0.02 a share impact associated with the accounting standard I just referenced. 
Operating cash flow was $339 million, driven primarily by strong profitability and a significant reduction in accounts receivable. Diluted shares were $266 million, including $10.5 million from the convertible. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares for $100 million and we paid $84 million in dividends. 
Some key points on the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $3.7 billion in gross cash and $2.1 billion net cash after our debt. Inventory was $195 million, up $17 million from the prior quarter and down $27 million from the same quarter a year ago. We continue to manage our inventory by balancing levels against expect the demand and potential upside from customers. 
Accounts receivable declined $90 million to $217 million, reflecting ordering patterns during the quarter. 
Now turning to our September quarter guidance. We expect revenue to be approximately flat. We entered the quarter with backlog that is down sequentially, but we have forecasted demand from key customers tat is not currently reflected in our backlog. As a result, we expect turns in the quarter to be approximately 54%. We expect advanced products to continue to grow with 28-nanometer sales increasing to a new record, 20-nanometer exceeding $40 million and our 16-nanometer UltraScale+ family demonstrating material growth. 
With respect to end markets, communications and data center is expected to decline after 4 consecutive quarters of growth. An increase in wired business will not conclude the offset a decrease in wireless sales. 
Industrial and A&D is expected to grow, driven primarily by strength in test measurement and immolation, along with growth in aerospace and defense and ISM. 
Broadcast consumer and -- broadcast automotive and consumer will be flat sequentially. 
Our gross margin will be approximately 70% and our operating expense will be approximately $230 million, including $1 million of amortization. The increase in operating expense is in line with the investments in accelerating our leadership position as we discussed at our Analyst Day. 
Other income and expense will be an expense of $4 million, and our tax rate is expected to be 14%. Share count is expected to be $266 million. 
Finally, at our Analyst Day in May, we discussed our expectations for 4% to 8% growth in revenue for FY '17, along with gross margins in 68% to 70% range, and the accelerated investments I just mentioned. As and our first quarter, we believe we are on track on all of these elements.

Overall, this demonstrated the strength of our diversified multi-market portfolio, with 5 of our [indiscernible]  Markets growing in the quarter. 
Gross margin reached 70.7% resulting in an operating margin of 32.4%, the highest level in the year. We generated a record level of cash in the quarter, continue to demonstrate a commitment to shareholder return through both dividend and share repurchase. Our exceptional execution on the 28-, 20- and 16-nanometer nodes has now delivered 3 consecutive generations of unquestionable technology leadership. This is a testament to the success of our engineering and operations team, working in concert with our world-class industry-leading foundry partner, TSMC. 
The June quarter, for the third quarter in a row, our overall 28-nanometer sales delivered a new record. The overall 28-nanometer sales growth benefited from broad sales contribution from communications, industrial, automotive, tests and measurements and consumers. In addition, our Zynq product family, a significant element of our market expansion efforts, reached a new sales record in the June quarter. Overall, 28-nanometer sales, including our Zynq offering are expected to grow again in the September quarter. 
20-nanometer revenue again reached a record level at sales in the quarter significantly exceeded our $30 million forecast. UltraScale, the industry's only high-end 20-nanometer product offering, continues to grow at a very significant grade, as do sales from our Kintex UltraScale product family. We expect to ship over $40 million of 20-nanometer product in the September quarter. This accelerated 20-nanometer ramp continues to exceed our original expectations. 
At the 16-nanometer node, we have delivered all 3 UltraScale+ products family ahead of schedule. We are already shipping 6 units of product so well over 100 customers, and getting excellent feedback, in particular, with regards to its production level quality, further extending our industry lead to well over a year. 
Consequently, we are accelerating our 16-nanometer tapeouts schedules and broadening our offering at this node. This broad 16-nanometer product offering is being designed into applications in all of our major end markets and is enabling more platform-based designs than any previous generation. 
This advanced products are building significant momentum, enabled by 4 multi market industry growth drivers: Cloud computing, embedded vision, industrial IoT and 5G wireless. In cloud computing, we are in production with 3 of the largest type of scale data center customers, with 2 more in extensive trials. Additionally, we led the formation of the very broad CCIX consortium for the single the role of bringing a high performance, open acceleration framework to data centers. We're winning in fast-growing embedded vision applications, across numerous markets, including industrial, aerospace and defense automotive, broadcast and consumer. In particular, our ADAS penetration in automotive will reach 85 models this year. 
With regards industrial IoT, we have seen continued success with both Zynq and Zynq UltraScale+ family, securing platform design wins with the largest Tier 1 players. 
Lastly, in 5G wireless, we have 90% market share in pre-5G proof of concept deployments and 5G prototyping. We have attained an unprecedented position of strength, opportunity and momentum, this is driven by our exceptional execution, leadership product and customer adoption in the form of multi market drivers, which will fuel long-term revenue growth. We are committed to maintaining this leadership, while delivering 30%-plus operating margin in the long-term and continuing a strong commitment to shareholder return.

It's market which is fast emerging, it's expected to be a very large market going forward and the expectation is it will get split between additional players as competitive products are available from these players. Now these come from a variety of architectures. They can come from x86 solutions, they can come from power-based solutions and then they can come from the numerous players who are committed to the architecture. Those additional ones are still to emerge at the performance level, which will enable them to penetrate the market. CCIX is basically an opportunity, which now has been identified by all of these other players as the need to have a common interface standard that can integrate and support the -- from our perspective, we did, at the Analyst Meeting, talk about one product which conceptually will targets this market, which will be implemented in the 16-nanometer. And then we'll have traditional all-programmable devices at 16- and also a whole host of solutions at 7-nanometer that address thes markets. For us, we believe this has the potential of being several  hundred million dollars in the 2020 timeframe. In order to get to that, going to -- it was really essential to have this multi-partner opportunity, open multi-partner opportunity, in order to enable us to participate broadly in it. And so at this point in time, our revenue in data center does not yet comprehend this opportunity. It's more in traditional storage and networking data center applications. Over the next few years, we expect our business to grow to that. So that's about as much information I can give at this point in time. I hope it helps."

And so we do expect this market, which is a large market and will grow rapidly over the next few years to be serviced by numerous solutions from numerous players. GPUs definitely will be one. But they have a whole host of applications where, due to power and a whole host of other issues, they don't provide an optimum solution and programmable logic, actually can provide much higher fulfillment for what the dollar, the most -- the best solution in that regard, and that's why we're talking to all 7 major hyperscale players and a few other players, too, and we believe that our solution will have a value for a whole host of these new applications.

Wireless tends to be more choppy, wired tends to be more gradual in terms of its growth. What we've seen is on the wired side, basically driven by very strong technology portfolio. That business has been growing now consistently and, in particular, it's being driven by 28- and 20-nanometer shipments. On the wireless side, it is volatile. It had its [indiscernible] point in the June quarter of last year. And since then, it has recovered, it's grown by about 40% since that low point. It hasn't gotten back to its peak, and we don't necessarily expect it to get back to its peak. Its peak was about 2x higher than its low point. But it's hovering just about in the middle, and we expect it to continue to go up and down, but more around this new number, right, as opposed to the low point, and it will be based on deployments during the past quarter. China was steady, India was up, EMEA was weak, and North America was steady, it tends to change from quarter-to-quarter as the deployments geographically spreads around the world.

It's still -- it's not the high end, it's not Virtex products, but it's Kintex and Zynq products. And generally speaking, the percentage of the dollar content, which is implemented in programmable logic, be it Zynq or be it a nonprogrammable solution has grown up from generation to generation. What we're seeing -- and so if you look at the numbers, on average, 4G was higher than 3G. Best we can tell, 5G is an incredibly sophisticated requirement with -- and as we're being used in the vast majority of the early deployments, these are not going to be the massive deployments, those are still 3 or 4 years ahead of us. But we're sort of seeing the level of complexity is very high. And then unquestionably, the level of integration is high, and I would say, generally speaking, the average price what we realize has gone up with a  significantly higher level of optionality. The volatility is due to markets happening at different rates, in particular, China is very difficult to predict. But I wouldn't say that, overall, we've seen the dollar content shrink at all.

On the overhead side, that will swing from time to time with the different factors than what we're doing from the inventory strategy.

You sort of -- if you look at our entire offering, there's several generation that are now contributing. The first generation where there was a, I think, product line was the 28-nanometer, and that's providing nearly all of that number. It's driven by 3 markets as Lorenzo mentioned, wireless, automotive and industrial markets. What those 3 wireless has gone into production or automotive is going into production, it should grow very rapidly, and the industrial market tends to move quite a bit slower. So that is ahead of us. What you will see is as the 28-nanometer grows, then the next growth sector, which is driven by the Zynq product line, will be a 16-nanometer, where we have a lot of design wins. You could assume that, that will follow a similar pattern to what we've seen at 28-. And this will drive our market expansion, it will just be delayed by 3 or 4 years, vis-à-vis what you saw at the 28-nanometer in terms of its significance. And that's the nature of the businesses we're in. They move at a slower rate. So as it's a new product line with the new role and the customer systems, it has now starting to be significant, but in the same way, the 28-nanometer took several years to get to where it is now. Zynq, which is a subset of that and was late with the last part of the product offering we rolled out is now starting to hit its stride market-by-market. And the next growth in 28- is going to be in automotive than by industrial, we actually see a lot of aerospace and defense growing going forward, and then we'll start seeing the 16-nanometer version.

We were far ahead on 28-, definitely very far ahead in 20- and we appear to clearly have this one-plus year advantage on 16- versus their offering. We are pursuing this with gusto. I think, that by the end of the year, it will be clear how Intel will decide to maximize their return on the $17 billion investment. But at this point in time, I would say that the -- as I check with our sales force, they appear to be winning based on the very strong technology portfolio, both on the silicon and the software and IP that we have. And at that is a multi-year investments we have made, which has come to fruition now. And I believe that most of the success we're seeing now is a result of that as opposed to anything else. I do believe the jury is still out with regards to how Intel will pursue the market long-term. There are various options that they have from which we make more sense to them than the others. But when you look at the consumer base, we're seeing consumer base becoming more and more interested as this [indiscernible] consolidation in the semiconductor industry, which everyone, including ourself, commented on numerous times. The customers are recognizing that they need to align with companies who are around and are committed to perpetuating their model. And that, I believe, has benefited as over the past year. And it's becoming clear and clear that we are committed to this business and be committed to technology leadership. And I think that's the other thing, which may be has changed in the competitive environment is actually, the customer's approaches quite different, and that's not only due to Intel, but it's due to other things that has happened in the industry, which are highlighting that there are fewer and fewer players who are going to be around the advanced nodes and [indiscernible] that it can and it will do that and our increased investments is another proof point that we're going to be there for them. Any more questions?"

In the June quarter, Xilinx sales were $575 million, up 1% sequentially and up 5% on a year-over-year basis. Advanced products increased 10% sequentially and 60% year-over-year, with 28-nanometer and 20-nanometer products each reaching record sales and 16-nanometer beginning it's revenue ramp. 
As expected, core products declined on a sequential and year-over-year basis. Communications increased 4% sequentially, with growth from both wired and wireless. Communications has stayed a modest but consistent recovery since bottoming in the June quarter a year ago and is up 22% on a year-over-year basis. 
Industrial and A&D was down slightly, with strength in test measurement and emulation not quite offsetting expected declines in industrial and aerospace and defense. 
Broadcast, consumer and automotive was flat on a sequential basis, slightly better than anticipated due to stronger orders from Zynq-driven ADAS applications. Both automotive and test and measurement reached record levels for the company in the June quarter. 
Gross margin in Q1 was 70.7%, higher than guided due to the mix of customers and products in addition to increased manufacturing efficiencies. We continue to aggressively optimize gross margin across our product portfolio. 
Operating expense at $220 million was in line with our guidance. Operating income for the quarter was $186 million or 32.4%. Other income and expense was an expense of $5 million as guided. 
The tax rate was 10% for the quarter, better than guided. This included the impact of the early adoption of an accounting standard related to the treatment of stock-based compensation. Our net income for Q1 was $163 million or $0.61 a share. This included a positive $0.02 a share impact associated with the accounting standard I just referenced. 
Operating cash flow was $339 million, driven primarily by strong profitability and a significant reduction in accounts receivable. Diluted shares were $266 million, including $10.5 million from the convertible. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares for $100 million, and we paid $84 million in dividends. 
Some key points on the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $3.7 billion in gross cash and $2.1 billion net cash after our debt. Inventory was $195 million, up $17 million from the prior quarter and down $27 million from the same quarter a year ago. We continued to manage our inventory by balancing levels against expected demand and potential upsides from customers. 
Accounts receivable declined $90 million to $217 million, reflecting ordering patterns during the quarter. 
Now turning to our September quarter guidance. We expect revenue to be approximately flat. We entered the quarter with backlog that is down sequentially, but we have forecasted demand from key customers that is not currently reflected in our backlog. As a result, we expect turns for the quarter to be approximately 54%. We expect advanced products to continue to grow, with 28-nanometer sales increasing to a new record, 20-nanometer exceeding $40 million and our 16-nanometer UltraScale+ family demonstrating material growth. 
With respect to end markets, communications and data center is expected to decline after 4 consecutive quarters of growth. An increase in wired business will not completely offset a decrease in wireless sales. Industrial and A&D is expected to grow, driven primarily by strength in test measurement and emulation, along with growth in aerospace and defense and ISM. Broadcast, consumer and -- broadcast, automotive and consumer will be flat sequentially. 
Our gross margin will be approximately 70%, and our operating expense will be approximately $230 million, including $1 million of amortization. The increase in operating expense is in line with the investment in accelerating our leadership position as we discussed at our Analyst Day. 
Other income and expense will be an expense of $4 million, and our tax rate is expected to be 14%. Share count is expected to be $266 million. 
Finally, at our Analyst Day in May, we discussed our expectations for 4% to 8% growth in revenue for FY '17, along with gross margins in the 68% to 70% range and the accelerated investment I just mentioned. As we end our first quarter, we believe we are on track on all of these elements.

We delivered revenue growth which was above the midpoint of our guidance, and profitability was very strong. Our overall revenue growth was driven by sales of our advanced products, which increased 60% year-over-year and reached a new quarterly record. Overall, this demonstrated the strength of our diversified multi-market portfolio, with 5 of our 8 end markets growing in the quarter. 
Gross margin reached 70.7% resulting in an operating margin of 32.4%, the highest level in a year. We generated a record level of cash in the quarter, continued to demonstrate a commitment to shareholder return through both dividend and share repurchase. Our exceptional execution on the 28-, 20- and 16-nanometer nodes has now delivered 3 consecutive generations of unquestionable technology leadership. This is a testament to the success of our engineering and operations teams working in concert with our world-class, industry-leading foundry partner, TSMC. 
The June quarter, for the third quarter in a row, our overall 28-nanometer sales delivered a new record. The overall 28-nanometer sales growth benefited from broad sales contribution from communications, industrial, automotive, test and measurement and consumer. In addition, our Zynq product family, a significant element of our market expansion efforts, reached a new sales record in the June quarter. Overall, 28-nanometer sales, including our Zynq offering, are expected to grow again in the September quarter. 
20-nanometer revenue, again, reached a record level as sales in the quarter significantly exceeded our $30 million forecast. Virtex UltraScale, the industry's only high-end 20-nanometer product offering, continues to grow at a very significant rate, as do sales from our Kintex UltraScale product family. We expect to ship over $40 million of 20-nanometer product in the September quarter. This accelerated 20-nanometer ramp continues to exceed our original expectations. 
At the 16-nanometer node, we have delivered all 3 UltraScale+ product families ahead of schedule. We are already shipping 6 unique products to well over 100 customers and getting excellent feedback, in particular, with regards to its production level quality, further extending our industry lead to well over a year. Consequently, we are accelerating our 16-nanometer tapeouts schedules and broadening our offering at this node. This broad 16-nanometer product offering is being designed into applications in all of our major end markets and is enabling more platform-based designs than any previous generation. 
These advanced products are building significant momentum, enabled by 4 multi-market industry growth drivers: cloud computing, embedded vision, industrial IoT and 5G wireless. 
In cloud computing, we are in production with 3 of the largest hyperscale data center customers, with 2 more in extensive trials. Additionally, we led the formation of the very broad CCIX consortium with the singular role of bringing a high-performance, open acceleration framework to data centers. We're winning in fast-growing embedded vision applications across numerous markets, including industrial, aerospace and defense, automotive, broadcast and consumer. In particular, our ADAS penetration in automotive will reach 85 models this year. 
With regards to industrial IoT, we're seeing continued success with both Zynq and Zynq UltraScale+ families, securing platform design wins with the largest Tier 1 players. 
Lastly, in 5G wireless, we have 90% market share in pre-5G proof-of-concept deployments and 5G prototyping. We have attained an unprecedented position of strength, opportunity and momentum. This is driven by our exceptional execution, leadership product and customer adoption in the 4 multi-market drivers, which will fuel long-term revenue growth. We are committed to maintaining this leadership while delivering 30%-plus operating margin in the long term and continuing a strong commitment to shareholder return.

Now these come from a variety of architectures. They can come from x86 solutions. They can come from power-based solutions, and then they can come from the numerous players who are committed to the ARM architecture. Those additional ones are still to emerge at a performance level, which will enable them to penetrate the market. CCIX is basically an opportunity, which now has been identified by all of these other players as the need to have a common interface standard that all can integrate and support. The -- from our perspective, we did, at the Analyst Meeting, talk about one product, at least conceptually, which targets this market, which will be implemented in 16-nanometer. And then we'll have our traditional All-Programmable Devices at 16- and also a whole host of solutions at 7-nanometer that address the markets. For us, we believe this has the potential of being several hundred million dollars in the 2020 time frame. In order to get to that point, it was really essential to have this multi-partner opportunity -- open multi-partner opportunity in order to enable us to participate broadly in it. And so at this point in time, our revenue in data center does not yet comprehend this opportunity. It's more in traditional storage and networking data center applications. Over the next few years, we expect our business to grow to reflect that. So that's about as much information as I can give at this point in time. I hope it helps."

Wireless tends to be more choppy. Wired tends to be more gradual in terms of its growth. What we've seen is on the wired side, basically driven by very strong technology portfolio. That business has been growing now consistently and, in particular, it's being driven by 28- and 20-nanometer shipments. On the wireless side, it is volatile. It had its ebb and flows point in the June quarter of last year. And since then, it has recovered. It's grown by about 40% since that low point. It hasn't gotten back to its peak, and we don't necessarily expect it to get back to its peak. Its peak was about 2x higher than its low point, but it's hovering just about in the middle. And we expect it to continue to go up and down but more around this new number, right, as opposed to the low point, and it will be based on deployments. During the past quarter, China was steady, India was up, EMEA was weak, North America was steady. It sort of tends to change from quarter-to-quarter as the deployments are -- geographically spreads around the world, but we do expect communications generally to continue to grow. And if you can neutralize the wireless volatility or sort of flatten it out, we do see that the communications market overall, including data center, to be a long-term growth driver for us.

And generally speaking, the percentage of the dollar content, which is implemented in programmable logic, be it Zynq or be it a all-programmable solution, has gone up from generation to generation. What we're seeing -- and so if you look at the numbers, on average, 4G was higher than 3G. Best we can tell, 5G is an incredibly sophisticated requirement with -- and as we're being used in a vast majority of the early deployments, these are not going to be the massive deployments, those are still 3 or 4 years ahead of us, but we're sort of seeing the level of complexity is very high. And then unquestionably, the level of integration is high. And I would say, generally speaking, the average price that we realize has gone up with a significantly higher level of functionality.

And we just -- we try to balance that and continue to get the broad savings to manifest themselves in our overall gross margin.

You sort of -- if you look at our entire offering, there's several generations that are now contributing. The first generation where there was a Zynq product line was the 28-nanometer, and that's providing nearly all of that number. It's driven by 3 markets as Lorenzo mentioned: wireless, automotive and industrial market. Of those 3, wireless has gone into production. Automotive is going into production and should grow very rapidly. And the industrial market tends to move quite a bit slower. So that is ahead of us. What you will see is as the 28-nanometer grows, then the next growth vector, which is driven by the Zynq product line, will be a 16-nanometer where we have a lot of design wins. You could assume that, that will follow a similar pattern to what we've seen at 28. So -- and this will drive our market expansion. It will just be delayed by 3 or 4 years vis-à-vis what you saw at the 28-nanometer in terms of its significance. And that's the nature of the businesses we're in. They move at a slower rate. So as it's a new product line with a new role in the customer systems, it has now starting to be significant. But in the same way, the 28-nanometer took several years to get to where it is now. Zynq, which is a subset of that and was late with the last part of the product offering we rolled out, is now starting to hit its stride market by market. And the next growth in 28 is going to be in automotive, then by industrial. We actually see a lot of aerospace and defense growing going forward, and then we'll start seeing the 16-nanometer version. Would I like for it to be faster? I would. But reality is that's the nature of the business we're in. Hope that answered your question."

I do believe the jury is still out with regards to how Intel will pursue the market long term. There are various options they have from which may make more sense to them than the others. But when you look at the customer base, we're seeing the customer base becoming more and more interested as there's massive consolidation in the semiconductor industry, which everyone, including yourself, have commented on numerous times. The customers are recognizing that they need to align with companies who are around and are committed to perpetuating their model. And that, I believe, has benefited us over the past year.

And I think that's the other thing, which maybe has changed in the competitive environment, is actually the customer's approach is quite different.

We're very comfortable with the absolute results we're delivering, and we're very comfortable that our market share on new nodes, now for 3 nodes in a row, is substantially, and that is substantially above the natural market share in the past. The analysis of that and what the outcome is, is pretty clear."

In the June quarter, Xilinx sales were $575 million, up 1% sequentially and up 5% on a year-over-year basis. Advanced products increased 10% sequentially and 60% year-over-year, with 28-nanometer and 20-nanometer products each reaching record sales and 16-nanometer beginning it's revenue ramp. 
As expected, core products declined on a sequential and year-over-year basis. Communications increased 4% sequentially, with growth from both wired and wireless. Communications has staged a modest but consistent recovery since bottoming in the June quarter a year ago and is up 22% on a year-over-year basis. 
Industrial and A&D was down slightly, with strength in test, measurement and emulation not quite offsetting expected declines in industrial and aerospace and defense. 
Broadcast, consumer and automotive was flat on a sequential basis, slightly better than anticipated due to stronger orders from Zynq-driven ADAS applications. Both automotive and test and measurement reached record levels for the company in the June quarter. 
Gross margin in Q1 was 70.7%, higher than guided due to the mix of customers and products in addition to increased manufacturing efficiencies. We continue to aggressively optimize gross margin across our product portfolio. 
Operating expense at $220 million was in line with our guidance. Operating income for the quarter was $186 million or 32.4%. Other income and expense was an expense of $5 million as guided. 
The tax rate was 10% for the quarter, better than guided. This included the impact of the early adoption of an accounting standard related to the treatment of stock-based compensation. Our net income for Q1 was $163 million or $0.61 a share. This included a positive $0.02 a share impact associated with the accounting standard I just referenced. 
Operating cash flow was $339 million, driven primarily by strong profitability and a significant reduction in accounts receivable. Diluted shares were $266 million, including $10.5 million from the convertible. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares for $100 million, and we paid $84 million in dividends. 
Some key points on the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $3.7 billion in gross cash and $2.1 billion net cash after our debt. Inventory was $195 million, up $17 million from the prior quarter and down $27 million from the same quarter a year ago. We continued to manage our inventory by balancing levels against expected demand and potential upsides from customers. 
Accounts receivable declined $90 million to $217 million, reflecting ordering patterns during the quarter. 
Now turning to our September quarter guidance. We expect revenue to be approximately flat. We entered the quarter with backlog that is down sequentially, but we have forecasted demand from key customers that is not currently reflected in our backlog. As a result, we expect turns for the quarter to be approximately 54%. We expect advanced products to continue to grow, with 28-nanometer sales increasing to a new record, 20-nanometer exceeding $40 million and our 16-nanometer UltraScale+ family demonstrating material growth. 
With respect to end markets, communications and data center is expected to decline after 4 consecutive quarters of growth. An increase in wired business will not completely offset a decrease in wireless sales. Industrial and A&D is expected to grow, driven primarily by strength in test measurement and emulation, along with growth in aerospace and defense and ISM. Broadcast, consumer and -- broadcast, automotive and consumer will be flat sequentially. 
Our gross margin will be approximately 70%, and our operating expense will be approximately $230 million, including $1 million of amortization. The increase in operating expense is in line with the investment in accelerating our leadership position as we discussed at our Analyst Day. 
Other income and expense will be an expense of $4 million, and our tax rate is expected to be 14%. Share count is expected to be $266 million. 
Finally, at our Analyst Day in May, we discussed our expectations for 4% to 8% growth in revenue for FY '17, along with gross margins in the 68% to 70% range and the accelerated investment I just mentioned. As we end our first quarter, we believe we are on track on all of these elements. 
Let me now turn the call over to Moshe."

We delivered revenue growth which was above the midpoint of our guidance, and profitability was very strong. Our overall revenue growth was driven by sales of our advanced products, which increased 60% year-over-year and reached a new quarterly record. Overall, this demonstrated the strength of our diversified multi-market portfolio, with 5 of our 8 end markets growing in the quarter. 
Gross margin reached 70.7% resulting in an operating margin of 32.4%, the highest level in a year. We generated a record level of cash in the quarter, continued to demonstrate a commitment to shareholder return through both dividend and share repurchase. Our exceptional execution on the 28-, 20- and 16-nanometer nodes has now delivered 3 consecutive generations of unquestionable technology leadership. This is a testament to the success of our engineering and operations teams working in concert with our world-class, industry-leading foundry partner, TSMC. 
The June quarter, for the third quarter in a row, our overall 28-nanometer sales delivered a new record. The overall 28-nanometer sales growth benefited from broad sales contribution from communications, industrial, automotive, test and measurement and consumer. In addition, our Zynq product family, a significant element of our market expansion efforts, reached a new sales record in the June quarter. Overall, 28-nanometer sales, including our Zynq offering, are expected to grow again in the September quarter. 
20-nanometer revenue, again, reached a record level as sales in the quarter significantly exceeded our $30 million forecast. Virtex UltraScale, the industry's only high-end 20-nanometer product offering, continues to grow at a very significant rate, as do sales from our Kintex UltraScale product family. We expect to ship over $40 million of 20-nanometer product in the September quarter. This accelerated 20-nanometer ramp continues to exceed our original expectations. 
At the 16-nanometer node, we have delivered all 3 UltraScale+ product families ahead of schedule. We are already shipping 6 unique products to well over 100 customers and getting excellent feedback, in particular, with regards to its production level quality, further extending our industry lead to well over a year. Consequently, we are accelerating our 16-nanometer tapeouts schedules and broadening our offering at this node. This broad 16-nanometer product offering is being designed into applications in all of our major end markets and is enabling more platform-based designs than any previous generation. 
These advanced products are building significant momentum, enabled by 4 multi-market industry growth drivers: cloud computing, embedded vision, industrial IoT and 5G wireless. 
In cloud computing, we are in production with 3 of the largest hyperscale data center customers, with 2 more in extensive trials. Additionally, we led the formation of the very broad CCIX consortium with the singular role of bringing a high-performance, open acceleration framework to data centers. We're winning in fast-growing embedded vision applications across numerous markets, including industrial, aerospace and defense, automotive, broadcast and consumer. In particular, our ADAS penetration in automotive will reach 85 models this year. 
With regards to industrial IoT, we're seeing continued success with both Zynq and Zynq UltraScale+ families, securing platform design wins with the largest Tier 1 players. 
Lastly, in 5G wireless, we have 90% market share in pre-5G proof-of-concept deployments and 5G prototyping. We have attained an unprecedented position of strength, opportunity and momentum. This is driven by our exceptional execution, leadership product and customer adoption in the 4 multi-market drivers, which will fuel long-term revenue growth. We are committed to maintaining this leadership while delivering 30%-plus operating margin in the long term and continuing a strong commitment to shareholder return.

So this is a market, which, today, is dominated by Intel's very strong position on the server space. It's a market which is fast emerging. It's expected to be a very large market going forward, and the expectation is it will get split between additional players as competitive products are available from these players. Now these come from a variety of architectures. They can come from x86 solutions. They can come from power-based solutions, and then they can come from the numerous players who are committed to the ARM architecture. Those additional ones are still to emerge at a performance level, which will enable them to penetrate the market. CCIX is basically an opportunity, which now has been identified by all of these other players as the need to have a common interface standard that all can integrate and support. The -- from our perspective, we did, at the Analyst Meeting, talk about one product, at least conceptually, which targets this market, which will be implemented in 16-nanometer. And then we'll have our traditional All-Programmable Devices at 16- and also a whole host of solutions at 7-nanometer that address the markets. For us, we believe this has the potential of being several hundred million dollars in the 2020 time frame. In order to get to that point, it was really essential to have this multi-partner opportunity -- open multi-partner opportunity in order to enable us to participate broadly in it. And so at this point in time, our revenue in data center does not yet comprehend this opportunity. It's more in traditional storage and networking data center applications. Over the next few years, we expect our business to grow to reflect that. So that's about as much information as I can give at this point in time. I hope it helps."

Wireless tends to be more choppy. Wired tends to be more gradual in terms of its growth. What we've seen is on the wired side, basically driven by very strong technology portfolio. That business has been growing now consistently and, in particular, it's being driven by 28- and 20-nanometer shipments. On the wireless side, it is volatile. It had its ebb, its lowest point in the June quarter of last year. And since then, it has recovered. It's grown by about 40% since that low point. It hasn't gotten back to its peak, and we don't necessarily expect it to get back to its peak. Its peak was about 2x higher than its low point, but it's hovering just about in the middle. And we expect it to continue to go up and down but more around this new number, right, as opposed to the low point, and it will be based on deployments. During the past quarter, China was steady, India was up, EMEA was weak, North America was steady. It sort of tends to change from quarter-to-quarter as the deployments are -- geographically spreads around the world, but we do expect communications generally to continue to grow.

So from generation to generation, the level of integration is much higher, and the power-reduction requirements are becoming more and more significant. And as such, we're seeing a higher level of integration, and our customers are moving to the higher end of a product offering. It's still -- it's not the high end. It's not Virtex products, but it's Kintex and Zynq products. And generally speaking, the percentage of the dollar content, which is implemented in programmable logic, be it Zynq or be it a all-programmable solution, has gone up from generation to generation. What we're seeing -- and so if you look at the numbers, on average, 4G was higher than 3G. Best we can tell, 5G is an incredibly sophisticated requirement with -- and as we're being used in a vast majority of the early deployments, these are not going to be the massive deployments, those are still 3 or 4 years ahead of us, but we're sort of seeing the level of complexity is very high. And then unquestionably, the level of integration is high. And I would say, generally speaking, the average price that we realize has gone up with a significantly higher level of functionality. The volatility is due to markets happening at different rates, in particular, China is very difficult to predict. And -- but I wouldn't say that, overall, we've seen the dollar content shrink at all. We've -- it's gone the other way at this point per unit."

And we have a portfolio of customers, a portfolio of end markets, and the customers all take a -- take, in those end markets, a portfolio of different products. So what we see across the board is a continued drive toward manufacturing side efficiencies, getting our products at lower cost over time. We see continued price pressure from our customers across the board; in larger customers, obviously assert more price pressure. And we just -- we try to balance that and continue to get the broad savings to manifest themselves in our overall gross margin. On the overhead side, that will swing from time to time with different factors and what we're doing with inventory strategy. But in general, we're approaching manufacturing efficiencies there very, very aggressively as well. So the -- as it's common in the semiconductor industry, costs continue to go down, but price pressure continues to increase. And we, again, try to manage that through the broad portfolio that we have."

So there's probably going to be some up and some down, and I cannot at this point in time. But as you look into the second half of the year, if I had to guess, we do expect communications to continue to grow slightly. We expect A&D to be flat. We expect automotive to be up significantly, driven by the large number of design wins we have. And we expect ISM also to get back into a growth mode.

You sort of -- if you look at our entire offering, there's several generations that are now contributing. The first generation where there was a Zynq product line was the 28-nanometer, and that's providing nearly all of that number. It's driven by 3 markets as Lorenzo mentioned: wireless, automotive and industrial market. Of those 3, wireless has gone into production. Automotive is going into production and should grow very rapidly. And the industrial market tends to move quite a bit slower. So that is ahead of us. What you will see is as the 28-nanometer grows, then the next growth vector, which is driven by the Zynq product line, will be a 16-nanometer where we have a lot of design wins. You could assume that, that will follow a similar pattern to what we've seen at 28. So -- and this will drive our market expansion. It will just be delayed by 3 or 4 years vis-à-vis what you saw at the 28-nanometer in terms of its significance. And that's the nature of the businesses we're in. They move at a slower rate. So as it's a new product line with a new role in the customer systems, it has now starting to be significant. But in the same way, the 28-nanometer took several years to get to where it is now. Zynq, which is a subset of that and was late with the last part of the product offering we rolled out, is now starting to hit its stride market by market. And the next growth in 28 is going to be in automotive, then by industrial. We actually see a lot of aerospace and defense growing going forward, and then we'll start seeing the 16-nanometer version. Would I like for it to be faster? I would. But reality is that's the nature of the business we're in. Hope that answered your question."

We were far ahead on 28, definitely very far ahead on 20, and we appear to clearly have this 1-plus-year advantage on 16 versus their offering. We are pursuing this with gusto. I think that by the end of the year, it will be clear how Intel will decide to maximize their return on the $17 billion investment. And -- but at this point in time, I would say that the -- as I check with our sales force, they appear to be winning based on the very strong technology portfolio, both on the silicon and the software and the IP that we have. And that is a multi-year investment we have made, which has come to fruition now. And I believe that most of the success we're seeing now is a result of that as opposed to anything else. I do believe the jury is still out with regards to how Intel will pursue the market long term. There are various options they have, some of which may make more sense to them than the others. But when you look at the customer base, we're seeing the customer base becoming more and more interested as there's massive consolidation in the semiconductor industry, which everyone, including yourself, have commented on numerous times. The customers are recognizing that they need to align with companies who are around and are committed to perpetuating their model. And that, I believe, has benefited us over the past year. And it's become clearer and clearer that we're committed to this business, and we're committed to technology leadership. And I think that's the other thing, which maybe has changed in the competitive environment, is actually the customer's approach is quite different. And that's not only due to Intel, but it's due to other things that have happened in the industry, which are highlighting that there are fewer and fewer players who are going to be around the advanced nodes. And Xilinx has demonstrated that it can and will do that, and our increased investment is another proof point that we're going to be there for them. Any more questions?"

As expected, core products declined on a sequential and year-over-year basis. Communications increased 4% sequentially, with growth from both wired and wireless. Communications has staged a modest but consistent recovery since bottoming in the June quarter a year ago and is up 22% on a year-over-year basis. 
Industrial and A&D was down slightly, with strength in test, measurement and emulation not quite offsetting expected declines in industrial and aerospace and defense. 
Broadcast, consumer and automotive was flat on a sequential basis, slightly better than anticipated due to stronger orders from Zynq-driven ADAS applications. Both automotive and test and measurement reached record levels for the company in the June quarter. 
Gross margin in Q1 was 70.7%, higher than guided due to the mix of customers and products in addition to increased manufacturing efficiencies. We continue to aggressively optimize gross margin across our product portfolio. 
Operating expense at $220 million was in line with our guidance. Operating income for the quarter was $186 million or 32.4%. Other income and expense was an expense of $5 million as guided. 
The tax rate was 10% for the quarter, better than guided. This included the impact of the early adoption of an accounting standard related to the treatment of stock-based compensation. Our net income for Q1 was $163 million or $0.61 a share. This included a positive $0.02 a share impact associated with the accounting standard I just referenced. 
Operating cash flow was $339 million, driven primarily by strong profitability and a significant reduction in accounts receivable. Diluted shares were $266 million, including $10.5 million from the convertible. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares for $100 million, and we paid $84 million in dividends. 
Some key points on the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $3.7 billion in gross cash and $2.1 billion net cash after our debt. Inventory was $195 million, up $17 million from the prior quarter and down $27 million from the same quarter a year ago. We continued to manage our inventory by balancing levels against expected demand and potential upsides from customers. 
Accounts receivable declined $90 million to $217 million, reflecting ordering patterns during the quarter. 
Now turning to our September quarter guidance. We expect revenue to be approximately flat. We entered the quarter with backlog that is down sequentially, but we have forecasted demand from key customers that is not currently reflected in our backlog. As a result, we expect turns for the quarter to be approximately 54%. We expect advanced products to continue to grow, with 28-nanometer sales increasing to a new record, 20-nanometer exceeding $40 million and our 16-nanometer UltraScale+ family demonstrating material growth. 
With respect to end markets, communications and data center is expected to decline after 4 consecutive quarters of growth. An increase in wired business will not completely offset a decrease in wireless sales. Industrial and A&D is expected to grow, driven primarily by strength in test measurement and emulation, along with growth in aerospace and defense and ISM. Broadcast, consumer and -- broadcast, automotive and consumer will be flat sequentially. 
Our gross margin will be approximately 70%, and our operating expense will be approximately $230 million, including $1 million of amortization. The increase in operating expense is in line with the investment in accelerating our leadership position as we discussed at our Analyst Day. 
Other income and expense will be an expense of $4 million, and our tax rate is expected to be 14%. Share count is expected to be $266 million. 
Finally, at our Analyst Day in May, we discussed our expectations for 4% to 8% growth in revenue for FY '17, along with gross margins in the 68% to 70% range and the accelerated investment I just mentioned. As we end our first quarter, we believe we are on track on all of these elements. 
Let me now turn the call over to Moshe."

We delivered revenue growth which was above the midpoint of our guidance, and profitability was very strong. Our overall revenue growth was driven by sales of our advanced products, which increased 60% year-over-year and reached a new quarterly record. Overall, this demonstrated the strength of our diversified multi-market portfolio, with 5 of our 8 end markets growing in the quarter. 
Gross margin reached 70.7% resulting in an operating margin of 32.4%, the highest level in a year. We generated a record level of cash in the quarter, continued to demonstrate a commitment to shareholder return through both dividend and share repurchase. Our exceptional execution on the 28-, 20- and 16-nanometer nodes has now delivered 3 consecutive generations of unquestionable technology leadership. This is a testament to the success of our engineering and operations teams working in concert with our world-class, industry-leading foundry partner, TSMC. 
The June quarter, for the third quarter in a row, our overall 28-nanometer sales delivered a new record. The overall 28-nanometer sales growth benefited from broad sales contribution from communications, industrial, automotive, test and measurement and consumer. In addition, our Zynq product family, a significant element of our market expansion efforts, reached a new sales record in the June quarter. Overall, 28-nanometer sales, including our Zynq offering, are expected to grow again in the September quarter. 
20-nanometer revenue, again, reached a record level as sales in the quarter significantly exceeded our $30 million forecast. Virtex UltraScale, the industry's only high-end 20-nanometer product offering, continues to grow at a very significant rate, as do sales from our Kintex UltraScale product family. We expect to ship over $40 million of 20-nanometer product in the September quarter. This accelerated 20-nanometer ramp continues to exceed our original expectations. 
At the 16-nanometer node, we have delivered all 3 UltraScale+ product families ahead of schedule. We are already shipping 6 unique products to well over 100 customers and getting excellent feedback, in particular, with regards to its production level quality, further extending our industry lead to well over a year. Consequently, we are accelerating our 16-nanometer tapeouts schedules and broadening our offering at this node. This broad 16-nanometer product offering is being designed into applications in all of our major end markets and is enabling more platform-based designs than any previous generation. 
These advanced products are building significant momentum, enabled by 4 multi-market industry growth drivers: cloud computing, embedded vision, industrial IoT and 5G wireless. 
In cloud computing, we are in production with 3 of the largest hyperscale data center customers, with 2 more in extensive trials. Additionally, we led the formation of the very broad CCIX consortium with the singular role of bringing a high-performance, open acceleration framework to data centers. We're winning in fast-growing embedded vision applications across numerous markets, including industrial, aerospace and defense, automotive, broadcast and consumer. In particular, our ADAS penetration in automotive will reach 85 models this year. 
With regards to industrial IoT, we're seeing continued success with both Zynq and Zynq UltraScale+ families, securing platform design wins with the largest Tier 1 players. 
Lastly, in 5G wireless, we have 90% market share in pre-5G proof-of-concept deployments and 5G prototyping. We have attained an unprecedented position of strength, opportunity and momentum. This is driven by our exceptional execution, leadership product and customer adoption in the 4 multi-market drivers, which will fuel long-term revenue growth. We are committed to maintaining this leadership while delivering 30%-plus operating margin in the long term and continuing a strong commitment to shareholder return.

Now these come from a variety of architectures. They can come from x86 solutions. They can come from power-based solutions, and then they can come from the numerous players who are committed to the ARM architecture. Those additional ones are still to emerge at a performance level, which will enable them to penetrate the market. CCIX is basically an opportunity, which now has been identified by all of these other players as the need to have a common interface standard that all can integrate and support. The -- from our perspective, we did, at the Analyst Meeting, talk about one product, at least conceptually, which targets this market, which will be implemented in 16-nanometer. And then we'll have our traditional All-Programmable Devices at 16- and also a whole host of solutions at 7-nanometer that address the markets. For us, we believe this has the potential of being several hundred million dollars in the 2020 time frame. In order to get to that point, it was really essential to have this multi-partner opportunity -- open multi-partner opportunity in order to enable us to participate broadly in it. And so at this point in time, our revenue in data center does not yet comprehend this opportunity. It's more in traditional storage and networking data center applications. Over the next few years, we expect our business to grow to reflect that. So that's about as much information as I can give at this point in time. I hope it helps."

Wireless tends to be more choppy. Wired tends to be more gradual in terms of its growth. What we've seen is on the wired side, basically driven by very strong technology portfolio. That business has been growing now consistently and, in particular, it's being driven by 28- and 20-nanometer shipments. On the wireless side, it is volatile. It had its ebb, its lowest point in the June quarter of last year. And since then, it has recovered. It's grown by about 40% since that low point. It hasn't gotten back to its peak, and we don't necessarily expect it to get back to its peak. Its peak was about 2x higher than its low point, but it's hovering just about in the middle. And we expect it to continue to go up and down but more around this new number, right, as opposed to the low point, and it will be based on deployments. During the past quarter, China was steady, India was up, EMEA was weak, North America was steady. It sort of tends to change from quarter-to-quarter as the deployments are -- geographically spreads around the world, but we do expect communications generally to continue to grow.

So there's probably going to be some up and some down, and I cannot at this point in time. But as you look into the second half of the year, if I had to guess, we do expect communications to continue to grow slightly. We expect A&D to be flat. We expect automotive to be up significantly, driven by the large number of design wins we have. And we expect ISM also to get back into a growth mode. So that's the best forecast we can give your for the second half based on what we know now. And just for the upcoming quarter, I think Lorenzo gave some of our prognostication there.

You sort of -- if you look at our entire offering, there's several generations that are now contributing. The first generation where there was a Zynq product line was the 28-nanometer, and that's providing nearly all of that number. It's driven by 3 markets as Lorenzo mentioned: wireless, automotive and industrial market. Of those 3, wireless has gone into production. Automotive is going into production and should grow very rapidly. And the industrial market tends to move quite a bit slower. So that is ahead of us. What you will see is as the 28-nanometer grows, then the next growth vector, which is driven by the Zynq product line, will be a 16-nanometer where we have a lot of design wins. You could assume that, that will follow a similar pattern to what we've seen at 28. So -- and this will drive our market expansion. It will just be delayed by 3 or 4 years vis-à-vis what you saw at the 28-nanometer in terms of its significance. And that's the nature of the businesses we're in. They move at a slower rate. So as it's a new product line with a new role in the customer systems, it has now starting to be significant. But in the same way, the 28-nanometer took several years to get to where it is now. Zynq, which is a subset of that and was late with the last part of the product offering we rolled out, is now starting to hit its stride market by market. And the next growth in 28 is going to be in automotive, then by industrial. We actually see a lot of aerospace and defense growing going forward, and then we'll start seeing the 16-nanometer version. Would I like for it to be faster? I would. But reality is that's the nature of the business we're in. Hope that answered your question."

I think that by the end of the year, it will be clear how Intel will decide to maximize their return on the $17 billion investment. And -- but at this point in time, I would say that the -- as I check with our sales force, they appear to be winning based on the very strong technology portfolio, both on the silicon and the software and the IP that we have. And that is a multi-year investment we have made, which has come to fruition now. And I believe that most of the success we're seeing now is a result of that as opposed to anything else. I do believe the jury is still out with regards to how Intel will pursue the market long term. There are various options they have, some of which may make more sense to them than the others. But when you look at the customer base, we're seeing the customer base becoming more and more interested as there's massive consolidation in the semiconductor industry, which everyone, including yourself, have commented on numerous times. The customers are recognizing that they need to align with companies who are around and are committed to perpetuating their model. And that, I believe, has benefited us over the past year. And it's become clearer and clearer that we're committed to this business, and we're committed to technology leadership. And I think that's the other thing, which maybe has changed in the competitive environment, is actually the customer's approach is quite different. And that's not only due to Intel, but it's due to other things that have happened in the industry, which are highlighting that there are fewer and fewer players who are going to be around the advanced nodes. And Xilinx has demonstrated that it can and will do that, and our increased investment is another proof point that we're going to be there for them. Any more questions?"

Sales for the first 6 months of the fiscal year were up 7% versus the same period of the prior year. Our Advanced Products increased 10% sequentially and 61% year-over-year with 28-nanometer, 20-nanometer and 16-nanometer sales all reaching new records. Sales from our 16-nanometer UltraScale+ family were significant and exceeded our expectations.
Our sales in the September quarter demonstrated the resilience of our multi-market model. Growth in industrial and A&D and broadcast consumer and automotive [ph] categories more than offset the expected decline in communications.
The industrial on A&D category stood out with strength in test, measurement and emulation as well as aerospace and defense. [ph] 
In fact, sales from test measurement and emulation [ph] reached a record during the quarter. 
Broadcast, consumer and automotive was up slightly, better than expected, due primarily to strength from AVB.
Gross margin in Q2 was 69.6%, lower than guided due to the impact of a licensing agreement with Rambus. Moving forward, the impact of this agreement is expected to be immaterial to our gross margin.
Operating expense was $227 million, lower than guided due to lower compensation expenses.
Operating income for the quarter was $177 million or 30.5%.
Other income and expense was an expense of $1 million, lower than guided due primarily to an investment distribution.
The tax rate for the quarter was 7%, which included the previously disclosed benefit of $9 million or $0.03 per diluted share related to the closure of the audits of fiscal years 2012 through 2014 and a $0.02 per diluted share benefit related to other discrete tax items.
Our net income for Q2 was $164 million or $0.61 per share. Operating cash flow was $184 million. Diluted shares were $270 million, including $14.8 million from the convertible, higher than guided due to the impact of our higher share price. We repurchased 1.9 million shares for $100 million, and we paid $84 million in dividends. 
Now some key points on the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $3.7 billion in gross cash and $2.1 billion in net cash after our debt. Inventory was $197 million, approximately flat with the prior quarter and down $16 million from the same quarter a year ago.
As I turn to our guidance, I would like to refresh the key points of the annual guidance from our Analyst Day in May. At the Analyst Day, we forecasted our revenue growth to be between 4% and 8%, our gross margin to be between 60% [ph] and 70% and our operating expense to be between $930 million and $950 million.
Our performance for the first 2 fiscal quarters, our guidance for Q3 and our expectations for Q4 indicate that we remain centered in the range of the guidance provided at our Analyst Meeting.
In the December quarter, we are expecting sales to be flat sequentially. Our backlog is slightly down heading into the quarter. We expect Advanced Products will continue to grow, and we are expecting communications [ph] to increase with both -- with growth in both wireless and wired.
Industrial and A&D is expected to decline as test and measurement comes off of 2 consecutive record quarters. Broadcast, consumer and automotive [ph] is expected to be approximately flat sequentially.
Our gross margin will be approximately 69%. For operating expense, we continue to invest in accelerating our leadership position as discussed at our Analyst Day. We expect to see operating expense increase to approximately $245 million with a significant portion of the increase coming from tape-out expenses.
Our operating expense outlook includes $1 million of amortization.
Other income and expense will be an expense of $2 million and will likely approximate this level again in Q4. Finally, our tax rate is expected to be 14%.
Now I'd like to say a few words on our capital allocation strategy. We are confident in our long-term growth strategy and expect to continue to generate healthy cash flows. Note our operating cash flow year-to-date exceeds $500 million. 
Our capital allocation priorities remain the same. Invest in our business that capitalize on our leadership position and return capital to our shareholders with a commitment to an increasing dividend over time and through share repurchases.
With respect to share repurchases, as we previously announced in May of this year, the Xilinx Board of Directors increased the repurchase authorization by $1 billion. Our plan is to take a more deliberate approach on share repurchases with the intention of exhausting the $1 billion authorization over the next several quarters.
Let me now turn the call over to Moshe."

I'm very pleased with the financial results in the second quarter. We delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of revenue growth resulting in operating profit in excess of 30% for the third consecutive quarter.
Our overall revenue growth was, as in the previous quarter, driven by our Advanced Products. These increased again by over 60% year-over-year, delivering yet another significant quarterly record and now accounts for 46% of our total sales. 
Overall, 5 of our 8 end markets grew in the quarter, demonstrating the robustness of our diversified multi-market portfolio.
Our unparalleled execution on the 28-, 20- and 16-nanometer nodes has now delivered three consecutive generations of very significant technology leadership.
Our world-class partnership with TSMC, a foundry technology [ph] and market leader, has been key to this success. In the September quarter, for the fourth consecutive quarter, 28-nanometer sales delivered a new record. 28-nanometer sales growth was enabled by our Zynq product line, which is a significant component of our market expansion efforts. Zynq product sales increased 25% sequentially driven by automotive, wireless, industrial and consumer applications. 20-nanometer revenue again reached a record level, very significantly exceeding our $40 million target.
Sales were driven by strong contributions from our test and measurement, wired and wireless [ph] markets. We expect to ship over $50 million of 20-nanometer products in the December quarter.
16-nanometer sales grew significantly in the September quarter, similarly exceeding our forecast while shipping to a broad base of end markets, including automotive, data center and communications. [ph] 
At our Analyst Day in May, we discussed a strategic increase in our R&D investment in fiscal year 2017 to both solidify our leadership position and expand our product portfolio.
We recently highlighted two significant accomplishments that demonstrate the early fruits [ph] from that investment decision. 
First and foremost, we reached ahead of schedule the critical production milestone with our 16-nanometer UltraScale+ portfolio, further expanding our product product sleeve [ph] to well beyond the year. We're already shipping 9 unique revenue generating products to approaching 200 active customers.
As per Lorenzo's earlier comments, we expect to deliver multiple production tape-outs in the current quarter to solidify this lead. In addition, we announced the expansion of our cost optimized Spartan, Altix and Zynq 28-nanometer product family, targeting a wide range of applications including embedded vision and industrial IoT.
We recently made two announcements illustrating our significant momentum in cloud computing, another of our key emerging market expansion opportunities.
Baidu has adopted Xilinx to accelerate machine learning applications in the data center and to leverage our platform in their initiatives to develop commercially viable autonomous cars.
In addition, the CCIX technology consortium, formed [ph] to bring a high-performance open acceleration framework to data centers, tripled its membership, as [ph] released the specification to consortium members.
We're uniquely positioned to capitalize on our excellent execution and innovative and game-changing products to both accelerate share gains and drive market expansion. We remain committed to maintaining and extending our leadership while delivering to our long-term operating margin target of 30%-plus, [ph] and per Lorenzo's earlier comments, underlying our commitment to returning cash to shareholders.

So our automotive business historically was more on the entertainment side. And I think product offering was defined specifically to address track [ph] resistance, and that is a huge step towards delivering autonomous vehicles. What is happening now is the part that is growing is the advanced driver [ph] resistance and we actually shared that we expect to have 85 models in production in this year, and we remain on target for delivering those 85 models. If you noticed, I had mentioned that quite a bit of our early revenue on 16-nanometer was in automotive, and that comes from the second generation of our Zynq product, which is MPSoC. It's so more powerful element. Now in parallel to that, being in a [ph] position for this market, we are working on the next generation, which is the 7-nanometer product. And there, we expect that as the world moves to -- from driver systems [ph] to autonomous driving, we expect it to move in phases, there's question marks with regards to how quickly it will happen. There's a whole host of barriers regards to safety, security and legislation that will modulate and throttle that growth. And so we believe that a lot of the work is being done now and there's been a lot of early deployment. And what we're seeing is that, that market is expanding beyond the traditional suppliers between -- beyond the Tier 1 providers to those suppliers and there's a whole host of new players who are entering the market in addition and are deploying technologies, which they have developed for their data center applications. And so we expect this to continue to unfold, to be honest, over the next 10 years. We don't think it's going to -- all happen tomorrow. We do think there's going to be a lot of proof of concepts and very limited deployments over the next year or 2. But we think that the massive volume will actually come in the 7-nanometer in the 2020 and beyond time frame, and there will be a lot of different approaches. We believe that our technology and our solutions will be relevant to most, if not all of those targets, right? And there's quite a bit of fragmentation. There's a lot of different approaches there. But our technology fundamentally should be very viable to address all of those. And our early position with ADAS gives us good understanding, a good relationship to -- with the providers to address that market."

I would say that first quarter effect is, are you winning, are you not winning at a certain node? And to be honest, the decline in the old product is because there's two significant generations where we did not do well, right? And if you look at the 40-nanometer, at the high end, we were late where the product had some issues. And prior to that, there's also a generation which had its challenges. And so as a result, that is now declining at a fast rate. The good news is now we have 3 nodes in a row that we've had great execution and significant market share. And because it takes a long time, and you're absolutely right in that, it takes time for that to compensate for the old nodes. The good news is once you get to 50%, right, and we're very close to that 50%, then you have a bigger, much stronger tailwind and the headwind is diminishing. And so what you should see is the percentage, which has the tailwind, is growing now at a faster rate and will soon reach magnitude that it can compensate and actually more than compensate for the product, which are not growing. And so your analysis is correct, but I think you need to take that first order [ph] impact is, did you have a good node or not have a good node. If you have 3 good nodes in succession and they are recent nodes, then once that gets to 50% of the revenue, that should more than compensate for the shrinkage of the old portion."

In certain cases, we are very, very large customers and large and more public deals, like the [indiscernible] A&D, we have fairly good visibility up until the actual letting of the purchase orders on when you can see the business. But in general, we can map those over time. Test and measurement, to a large degree, we have some customer concentration, we know we're doing extremely well there based on our leadership products. It's just unmatched, there's no competition for the capability we bring there. And so we have relatively good visibility to the program. What we actually can be positively surprised by in that area is the success of our customers as their platforms win in the market. Industrial. Industrial is a lot of customers for us. And so what we are typically doing is looking at a few for specific opportunities at customers and then looking at an aggregate -- aggregation on the broader customer base and seeing what we believe there. So each of these actually has relatively strong growth prospects, not defined by the markets they serve. Industrial, as we said before, driven by the an industrial Internet of Things and platform adoption will be broad-based and grow at the nature of that business is more slowly over time. A&D has actually been a relative bright spot for us. We continue to win broadly in design outside of the joint strike fighter and the joint strike fighter follow-on technology insertions. And so we're seeing a lot of a broader program strength there. And test, measurement and emulation, what you'll see is that our leading products will gain share and grow relatively rapidly and then we'll be filled in by other elements of that category, like semiconductor test business as that broadens out our footprint. So it's going to -- it's a very complex category for us to provide one answer to. Hopefully, I gave some color."

The -- and there's a lot of ways of skimming the cat. You can do it through just using a lot of processors. The issue there the -- a lot of the applications tend to be extremely parallel. And then if you try to do it through processors, you can only achieve so much, right, and what typically kill a few is the power there. There's a certain class of applications, which require tremendous amount of floating point, and that's clearly the area where GPUs have the edge and in video, in particular, has targeted this market for several years and has established a very good position and I believe are shipping hundreds of millions of dollars. What is clear is that for a whole host of applications, the parallelism inside the FPGAs and in particular the fact that it's dynamically reconfigurable, in other words, if you can change the way the programmable logic believes to adapt to the payloads and what the customer is doing provide a significant advantage. And what we're doing is we are focusing on enabling that target market and those sorts of applications to use programmable logic. The key to enabling them to achieve that is actually to abstract the design because these -- if you look at the several [ph] large players, they're not renounced happening having a lot of software engineers and system engineers, but no -- but very small number of FPGA designers. So at this point, the biggest issue is not in the architecture of the programmable logic. It's actually in enabling the abstraction so the target users can expand, and that's what we're focusing on. And as we have a whole range of products, which are called FDX product, system design products, which are targeted to pull that, and we believe that those are the key to enabling us to unlocking the potential of the programmable logic. And over the next 2 to 3 years, we're going to make tremendous drives to address that and to broaden that the set of customers. At this point, we need to do it one by one and it's based more on the skill sets that our customers have, which are limited."

So at the core of our business is we're a diversified multi-market company, and that actually provides us with significant strength because markets go up and down and the fact that we have a lot shields from some of that volatility. As you look at the 8 markets we play in, there is now an emergence of new markets, which sometimes are part of existing markets that benefits significantly from the parallelism, which is inherent in the programmable logic. And wherever you talk about artificial intelligence, and that's clearly an area which has involved now, there probably isn't any architecture out there which is more powerful than programmable logic and has that ability for reconfiguration. So you can architect in ASSP, which is very, very parallel, but then it typically isn't reconfigurable, right? So if the target application changes, then -- or the payload changes, then you tend to have a mismatch. And so as you look at these, then clearly data center and automotive fall into emerging applications, which benefit from that inherent parallelism. And then for each of those, you need to have a different approach, but sometimes a similar underlying technology, which is market specific. And if you look at these is not a total coincidence that the data center companies are now expanding into autonomous driving, right, because there are technologies which are an extension of what they're developing that can be deployed there. And so we see these areas as expansion place for us. We tried to be very realistic with regards to the growth of those markets and we gave the number that, for us, we expect it to be the expansion place, generally speaking, in a 5-year time frame, will enable us to expand by $500 million [ph], right? And those 2 markets are 2 of the major ones. And if you look at our comments on data center for Xilinx for it to be a $200 million to $300 million market, then you can see that we believe that automotive can also be a $200 million to $300 million market in that general time frame."

In the September quarter, Xilinx sales were $579 million, up 1% sequentially and up 10% on a year-over-year basis. Sales for the first 6 months of the fiscal year were up 7% versus the same period of the prior year. Our Advanced Products increased 10% sequentially and 61% year-over-year with 28-nanometer, 20-nanometer and 16-nanometer sales all reaching new records. Sales from our 16-nanometer UltraScale+ family were significant and exceeded our expectations.
Our sales in the September quarter demonstrated the resilience of our multi-market model. Growth in Industrial and A&D, and Broadcast, Consumer and Automotive categories more than offset the expected decline in communications.
The Industrial and A&D category stood out with strength in test, measurement and emulation as well as Aerospace and Defense. In fact, sales from test, measurement and emulation reached a record during the quarter. Broadcast, Consumer and Automotive was up slightly, better than expected, due primarily to strength from AVB.
Gross margin in Q2 was 69.6%, lower than guided due to the impact of a licensing agreement with Rambus. Moving forward, the impact of this agreement is expected to be immaterial to our gross margin.
Operating expense was $227 million, lower than guided due to lower compensation expenses. Operating income for the quarter was $177 million or 30.5%. Other income and expense was an expense of $1 million, lower than guided due primarily to an investment distribution.
The tax rate for the quarter was 7%, which included the previously disclosed benefit of $9 million or $0.03 per diluted share related to the closure of the audits of fiscal years 2012 through 2014 and a $0.02 per diluted share benefit related to other discrete tax items.
Our net income for Q2 was $164 million or $0.61 per share. Operating cash flow was $184 million. Diluted shares were $270 million, including $14.8 million from the convertible, higher than guided due to the impact of our higher share price. We repurchased 1.9 million shares for $100 million, and we paid $84 million in dividends. 
Now some key points on the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $3.7 billion in gross cash and $2.1 billion in net cash after our debt. Inventory was $197 million, approximately flat with the prior quarter and down $16 million from the same quarter a year ago.
As I turn to our guidance, I would like to refresh the key points of the annual guidance from our Analyst Day in May. At the Analyst Day, we forecasted our revenue growth to be between 4% and 8%, our gross margin to be between 60% [ph] and 70% and our operating expense to be between $930 million and $950 million.
Our performance for the first 2 fiscal quarters, our guidance for Q3 and our expectations for Q4 indicate that we remain centered in the range of the guidance provided at our Analyst Meeting.
In the December quarter, we are expecting sales to be flat sequentially. Our backlog is slightly down heading into the quarter. We expect Advanced Products will continue to grow, and we are expecting Communications to increase with both -- with growth in both wireless and wired.
Industrial and A&D is expected to decline as test and measurement comes off of 2 consecutive record quarters. Broadcast, Consumer and Automotive is expected to be approximately flat sequentially.
Our gross margin will be approximately 69%. For operating expense, we continue to invest in accelerating our leadership position as discussed at our Analyst Day. We expect to see operating expense increase to approximately $245 million with a significant portion of the increase coming from tape-out expenses.
Our operating expense outlook includes $1 million of amortization. Other income and expense will be an expense of $2 million and will likely approximate this level again in Q4. Finally, our tax rate is expected to be 14%.
Now I'd like to say a few words on our capital allocation strategy. We are confident in our long-term growth strategy and expect to continue to generate healthy cash flows. Note our operating cash flow year-to-date exceeds $500 million. 
Our capital allocation priorities remain the same. Invest in our business that capitalize on our leadership position and return capital to our shareholders with a commitment to an increasing dividend over time and through share repurchases.
With respect to share repurchases, as we previously announced in May of this year, the Xilinx Board of Directors increased the repurchase authorization by $1 billion. Our plan is to take a more deliberate approach on share repurchases with the intention of exhausting the $1 billion authorization over the next several quarters.
Let me now turn the call over to Moshe."

I'm very pleased with the financial results in the second quarter. We delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of revenue growth resulting in operating profit in excess of 30% for the third consecutive quarter.
Our overall revenue growth was, as in the previous quarter, driven by our Advanced Products. These increased again by over 60% year-over-year, delivering yet another significant quarterly record and now accounts for 46% of our total sales. 
Overall, 5 of our 8 end markets grew in the quarter, demonstrating the robustness of our diversified multi-market portfolio.
Our unparalleled execution on the 28-, 20- and 16-nanometer nodes has now delivered three consecutive generations of very significant technology leadership.
Our world-class partnership with TSMC, the foundry technology and market leader, has been key to this success. In the September quarter, for the fourth consecutive quarter, 28-nanometer sales delivered a new record. 28-nanometer sales growth was enabled by our Zynq product line, which is a significant component of our market expansion efforts. Zynq product sales increased 25% sequentially driven by automotive, wireless, industrial and consumer applications. 20-nanometer revenue again reached a record level, very significantly exceeding our $40 million target.
Sales were driven by strong contributions from our test and measurement, wired and wireless markets. We expect to ship over $50 million of 20-nanometer products in the December quarter.
16-nanometer sales grew significantly in the September quarter, similarly exceeding our forecast while shipping to a broad base of end markets, including Automotive, Data Center and Communications.
At our Analyst Day in May, we discussed a strategic increase in our R&D investment in fiscal year 2017 to both solidify our leadership position and expand our product portfolio.
We recently highlighted two significant accomplishments that demonstrate the early fruits from that investment decision. 
First and foremost, we reached ahead of schedule the critical production milestone with our 16-nanometer UltraScale+ portfolio, further extending our products' lead to well beyond the year. We're already shipping 9 unique revenue generating products to approaching 200 active customers.
As per Lorenzo's earlier comments, we expect to deliver multiple production tape-outs in the current quarter to solidify this lead. In addition, we announced the expansion of our cost optimized Spartan, Altix and Zynq 28-nanometer product family, targeting a wide range of applications including embedded vision and industrial IoT.
We recently made two announcements illustrating our significant momentum in cloud computing, another of our key emerging market expansion opportunities.
Baidu has adopted Xilinx to accelerate machine learning applications in the data center and to leverage our platform in their initiatives to develop commercially viable autonomous cars.
In addition, the CCIX technology consortium, formed to bring a high-performance, open acceleration framework to data centers, tripled its membership, has released the specification to consortium members.
We're uniquely positioned to capitalize on our excellent execution and innovative and game-changing products to both accelerate share gains and drive market expansion. We remain committed to maintaining and extending our leadership while delivering to our long-term operating margin target of 30% plus, and per Lorenzo's earlier comments, underlying our commitment to returning cash to shareholders.

It was in such pristine condition that at that point in time, we were able to demonstrate devices working and achieving the specs, which for, first, silicon, immediately in the first day is as good as it gets and probably better than nearly everyone else. And we sampled the parts to our customers and we have been shipping them to numerous customers in a whole host of applications. And the feedback we're getting is between the software, the silicon and IP, customers have never seen from anyone, anything up to this level of functionality. And as a result, what we have done is we now have 9 products that are shipping and we're moving into production, and part of the bump that is happening this quarter, the current quarter we're in, in terms of R&D and the quarter after that will be a whole slew of tape-outs, which indicate that we're going to move into production at an early point. So in terms of sampling, we believe we are clearly a year ahead in terms of the maturity of the product. And from what we're hearing from our customers, we're much more than that. And that's the position we're in. It's a very enviable position and that's why we're increasing our investment to exploit it. Hopefully, that answers your question."

So our automotive business historically was more on the entertainment side. And I think product offering was defined specifically to address driver assistance, and that is a huge step towards delivering autonomous vehicles. What is happening now is the part that is growing is the advanced driver assistance and we actually shared that we expect to have 85 models in production in this year, and we remain on target for delivering those 85 models. If you noticed, I had mentioned that quite a bit of our early revenue on 16-nanometer was in automotive, and that comes from the second generation of our Zynq product, which is MPSoC. It's so more powerful element. Now in parallel to that, being in a pole position for this market, we are working on the next generation, which is the 7-nanometer product. And there, we expect that as the world moves to -- from driver assistance to autonomous driving, we expect it to move in phases, there's question marks with regards to how quickly it will happen. There's a whole host of barriers regards to safety, security and legislation that will modulate and throttle that growth. And so we believe that a lot of the work is being done now and there's been a lot of early deployment. And what we're seeing is that, that market is expanding beyond the traditional suppliers between -- beyond the Tier 1 providers to those suppliers and there's a whole host of new players who are entering the market in addition and are deploying technologies, which they have developed for their data center applications. And so we expect this to continue to unfold, to be honest, over the next 10 years. We don't think it's going to -- all happen tomorrow. We do think there's going to be a lot of proof of concepts and very limited deployments over the next year or 2. But we think that the massive volume will actually come in the 7-nanometer in the 2020 and beyond time frame, and there will be a lot of different approaches. We believe that our technology and our solutions will be relevant to most, if not all of those targets, right? And there's quite a bit of fragmentation. There's a lot of different approaches there. But our technology fundamentally should be very viable to address all of those. And our early position with ADAS gives us good understanding, a good relationship to -- with the providers to address that market."

I would say that first quarter effect is, are you winning, are you not winning at a certain node? And to be honest, the decline in the old product is because there's two significant generations where we did not do well, right? And if you look at the 40-nanometer, at the high end, we were late where the product had some issues. And prior to that, there's also a generation which had its challenges. And so as a result, that is now declining at a fast rate. The good news is now we have 3 nodes in a row that we've had great execution and significant market share. And because it takes a long time, and you're absolutely right in that, it takes time for that to compensate for the old nodes. The good news is once you get to 50%, right, and we're very close to that 50%, then you have a bigger, much stronger tailwind and the headwind is diminishing. And so what you should see is the percentage, which has the tailwind, is growing now at a faster rate and will soon reach magnitude that it can compensate and actually more than compensate for the product, which are not growing. And so your analysis is correct, but I think you need to take that first order impact is, did you have a good node or not have a good node. If you have 3 good nodes in succession and they are recent nodes, then once that gets to 50% of the revenue, that should more than compensate for the shrinkage of the old portion."

And in certain cases, with very, very large customers and large and more public deals, like the Joint Strike Fighter and A&D. We have fairly good visibility up until the actual letting of the purchase orders on when you can see the business. But in general, we can map those over time. Test and measurement, to a large degree, we have some customer concentration, we know we're doing extremely well there based on our leadership products. It's just unmatched, there's no competition for the capability we bring there. And so we have relatively good visibility to the program health. What we actually can be positively surprised by in that area is the success of our customers as their platforms win in the market. Industrial. Industrial is a lot of customers for us. And so what we are typically doing is looking at a few specific opportunities at customers and then looking at an aggregate -- aggregation on the broader customer base and seeing what we behaved there. So each of these actually has relatively strong growth prospects, not defined by the markets they serve. Industrial, as we've said before, driven by the industrial Internet of Things and platform adoption will be broad-based and grow, but the nature of that business is more slowly over time. A&D has actually been a relative bright spot for us. We continue to win broadly in designs outside of the Joint Strike Fighter and the Joint Strike Fighter follow-on technology insertions. And so we're seeing a lot of a broader program strength there. And in test, measurement and emulation, what you'll see is that our leading products will gain share and grow relatively rapidly and then we'll be filled in by other elements of that category, like semiconductor test business as that broadens out our footprint. So it's going to -- it's a very complex category for us to provide one answer to. Hopefully, I gave you some color."

The -- and there's a lot of ways of scheming the cat. You can do it through just using a lot of processors. The issue there is the -- a lot of the applications tend to be extremely parallel. And then if you try to do it through processors, you can only achieve so much, right, and what typically kills you is the power there. There's a certain class of applications, which require tremendous amount of floating point, and that's clearly the area where GPUs have the edge. And in video, in particular, has targeted this market for several years and has established a very good position and I believe is shipping hundreds of millions of dollars. What is clear is that for a whole host of applications, the parallelism inside the FPGAs, and in particular the fact that it's dynamically reconfigurable, in other words, you can change the way the programmable logic behaves to adapt to the payloads and what the customer is doing, provide a significant advantage. And what we're doing is we are focusing on enabling that target market and those sorts of applications to use programmable logic. The key to enabling them to achieve that is actually to abstract the design because these -- if you look at the 7 large players, they're not renowned for having FPGA design or [indiscernible] they have a lot of software engineers and system engineers but no -- but very small number of FPGA designers. So at this point, the biggest issue is not in the architecture of the programmable logic. It's actually in enabling the extraction so the target users can expand, and that's what we're focusing on. And as we have a whole range of products, which are called our SDx products, system design products, which are targeted to pull that, and we believe that those are the key to enabling us to unlocking the potential of the programmable logic. And over the next 2 to 3 years, we're going to make tremendous strides to address that and to broaden the set of customers. At this point, we need to do it one by one and it's based more on the skill sets that our customers have, which are limited."

But I mean, I'll try to do it in a couple of minutes, which is basically what we have. So at the core of our business is we're a diversified multi-market company, and that actually provides us with significant strength because markets go up and down and the fact that we have a lot shields us from some of that volatility. If you look at the 8 markets we play in, there is now an emergence of new markets, which sometimes are part of existing markets that benefits significantly from the parallelism, which is inherent in the programmable logic. And wherever you talk about artificial intelligence, and that's clearly an area which is in vogue now, there probably isn't any architecture out there which is more parallel than programmable logic and has that ability for reconfiguration. So you can architect an ASSP, which is very, very parallel, but then it typically isn't reconfigurable, right? So if the target application changes, then -- or the payload changes, then you tend to have a mismatch. And so as you look at these, then clearly data center and automotive fall into emerging applications, which benefit from that inherent parallelism. And then for each of those, you need to have a different approach, but sometimes a similar underlying technology, which is market specific. And if you look at these [indiscernible], it's not a total coincidence that the data center companies are now expanding into autonomous driving, right, because there are technologies which are an extension of what they're developing that can be deployed there. And so we see these areas as expansion places for us. We try to be very realistic with regards to the growth of those markets and we gave the number that, for us, we expect that these expansion plays, generally speaking, in a 5-year time frame, will enable us to expand by $500 million, right? And those two markets are two of the major ones. And if you look at our comments on data center for Xilinx for it to be a $200 million to $300 million market, then you could see that we believe that automotive can also be a $200 million to $300 million market in that general time frame."

And then looking forward to our ability to invest in the business, support the continually growing dividend and have the strategic flexibility around dealing with the debt that we have in FY '17 -- I mean, sorry, in calendar '17, '19 and '21. And what then to do in terms of addressing questions we're getting from our shareholder base in terms of the total capital we have and what our plans for, and our decision was really to be more deliberate about the utilization of the authorization as well as be able to be more open in the communication about our plans on doing it. So that we communicate to our shareholders what we're doing, and we go off and do it. That's the broad context of what we did."

In the September quarter, Xilinx sales were $579 million, up 1% sequentially and up 10% on a year-over-year basis. Sales for the first 6 months of the fiscal year were up 7% versus the same period of the prior year. Our Advanced Products",775,"Thank you, Rick. In the September quarter, Xilinx sales were $579 million, up 1% sequentially and up 10% on a year-over-year basis. Sales for the first 6 months of the fiscal year were up 7% versus the same period of the prior year. Our Advanced Products increased 10% sequentially and 61% year-over-year with 28-nanometer, 20-nanometer and 16-nanometer sales all reaching new records. Sales from our 16-nanometer UltraScale+ family were significant and exceeded our expectations.
Our sales in the September quarter demonstrated the resilience of our multi-market model. Growth in Industrial and A&D, and Broadcast, Consumer and Automotive categories more than offset the expected decline in communications.
The Industrial and A&D category stood out with strength in test, measurement and emulation as well as Aerospace and Defense. In fact, sales from test, measurement and emulation reached a record during the quarter. Broadcast, Consumer and Automotive was up slightly, better than expected, due primarily to strength from AVB.
Gross margin in Q2 was 69.6%, lower than guided due to the impact of a licensing agreement with Rambus. Moving forward, the impact of this agreement is expected to be immaterial to our gross margin.
Operating expense was $227 million, lower than guided due to lower compensation expenses. Operating income for the quarter was $177 million or 30.5%. Other income and expense was an expense of $1 million, lower than guided due primarily to an investment distribution.
The tax rate for the quarter was 7%, which included the previously disclosed benefit of $9 million or $0.03 per diluted share related to the closure of the audits of fiscal years 2012 through 2014 and a $0.02 per diluted share benefit related to other discrete tax items.
Our net income for Q2 was $164 million or $0.61 per share. Operating cash flow was $184 million. Diluted shares were 270 million, including 14.8 million from the convertible, higher than guided due to the impact of our higher share price. We repurchased 1.9 million shares for $100 million, and we paid $84 million in dividends. 
Now some key points on the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $3.7 billion in gross cash and $2.1 billion in net cash after our debt. Inventory was $197 million, approximately flat with the prior quarter and down $16 million from the same quarter a year ago.
As I turn to our guidance, I would like to refresh the key points of the annual guidance from our Analyst Day in May. At the Analyst Day, we forecasted our revenue growth to be between 4% and 8%, our gross margin to be between 68% and 70% and our operating expense to be between $930 million and $950 million.
Our performance for the first 2 fiscal quarters, our guidance for Q3 and our expectations for Q4 indicate that we remain centered in the range of the guidance provided at our Analyst Meeting.
In the December quarter, we are expecting sales to be flat sequentially. Our backlog is slightly down heading into the quarter. We expect Advanced Products will continue to grow, and we are expecting Communications to increase with both -- with growth in both wireless and wired.
Industrial and A&D is expected to decline as test and measurement comes off of 2 consecutive record quarters. Broadcast, Consumer and Automotive is expected to be approximately flat sequentially.
Our gross margin will be approximately 69%. For operating expense, we continue to invest in accelerating our leadership position as discussed at our Analyst Day. We expect to see operating expense increase to approximately $245 million with a significant portion of the increase coming from tape-out expenses.
Our operating expense outlook includes $1 million of amortization. Other income and expense will be an expense of $2 million and will likely approximate this level again in Q4. Finally, our tax rate is expected to be 14%.
Now I'd like to say a few words on our capital allocation strategy. We are confident in our long-term growth strategy and expect to continue to generate healthy cash flows. Note our operating cash flow from year-to-date exceeds $500 million. 
Our capital allocation priorities remain the same. Invest in our business to capitalize on our leadership position and return capital to our shareholders with a commitment to an increasing dividend over time and through share repurchases.
With respect to share repurchases, as we previously announced in May of this year, the Xilinx Board of Directors increased the repurchase authorization by $1 billion. Our plan is to take a more deliberate approach on share repurchases with the intention of exhausting the $1 billion authorization over the next several quarters.
Let me now turn the call over to Moshe."

I'm very pleased with the financial results of the second quarter. We delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of revenue growth resulting in operating profit in excess of 30% for the third consecutive quarter.
Our overall revenue growth was, as in the previous quarter, driven by our Advanced Products. These increased again by over 60% year-over-year, delivering yet another significant quarterly record and now accounts for 46% of our total sales. 
Overall, 5 of our 8 end markets grew in the quarter, demonstrating the robustness of our diversified multi-market portfolio.
Our unparalleled execution on the 28-, 20- and 16-nanometer nodes has now delivered three consecutive generations of very significant technology leadership.
Our world-class partnership with TSMC, the foundry technology and market leader, has been key to this success. In the September quarter, for the fourth consecutive quarter, 28-nanometer sales delivered a new record. 28-nanometer sales growth was enabled by our Zynq product line, which is a significant component of our market expansion efforts. Zynq product sales increased 25% sequentially driven by automotive, wireless, industrial and consumer applications. 20-nanometer revenue again reached a record level, very significantly exceeding our $40 million target.
Sales were driven by strong contributions from our test and measurement, wired and wireless markets. We expect to ship over $50 million of 20-nanometer products in the December quarter.
16-nanometer sales grew significantly in the September quarter, similarly exceeding our forecast while shipping to a broad base of end markets, including Automotive, Data Center and Communications.
At our Analyst Day in May, we discussed a strategic increase in our R&D investment in fiscal year 2017 to both solidify our leadership position and expand our product portfolio.
We recently highlighted two significant accomplishments that demonstrate the early fruits from that investment decision. 
First and foremost, we reached ahead of schedule the critical production milestone with our 16-nanometer UltraScale+ portfolio, further extending our products' lead to well beyond the year. We're already shipping 9 unique revenue generating products to approaching 200 active customers.
As per Lorenzo's earlier comments, we expect to deliver multiple production tape-outs in the current quarter to solidify this lead. In addition, we announced the expansion of our cost optimized Spartan, Altix and Zynq 28-nanometer product family, targeting a wide range of applications including embedded vision and industrial IoT.
We recently made two announcements illustrating our significant momentum in cloud computing, another of our key emerging market expansion opportunities.
Baidu has adopted Xilinx to accelerate machine learning applications in the data center and to leverage our platform in their initiatives to develop commercially viable autonomous cars.
In addition, the CCIX technology consortium formed to bring a high-performance, open acceleration framework to data centers, tripled its membership, has released the specification to consortium members.
We're uniquely positioned to capitalize on our excellent execution and innovative and game-changing products to both accelerate share gains and drive market expansion. We remain committed to maintaining and extending our leadership while delivering to our long-term operating margin target of 30% plus, and per Lorenzo's earlier comments, underlying our commitment to returning cash to shareholders.

And the feedback we're getting is between the software, the silicon and IP, customers have never seen from anyone, anything up to this level of functionality. And as a result, what we have done is we now have 9 products that are shipping and we're moving into production, and part of the bump that is happening this quarter, the current quarter we're in, in terms of R&D and the quarter after that will be a whole slew of tape-outs, which indicate that we're going to move into production at an early point.

So our automotive business historically was more on the entertainment side. And I think product offering was defined specifically to address driver assistance, and that is a huge step towards delivering autonomous vehicles. What is happening now is the part that is growing is the advanced driver assistance and we actually shared that we expect to have 85 models in production in this year, and we remain on target for delivering those 85 models. If you noticed, I had mentioned that quite a bit of our early revenue on 16-nanometer was in automotive, and that comes from the second generation of our Zynq product, which is the MPSoC. It's a more powerful element. Now in parallel to that, being in a pole position for this market, we are working on the next generation, which is the 7-nanometer product. And there, we expect that as the world moves to -- from driver assistance to autonomous driving, we expect it to move in phases, there's question marks with regards to how quickly it will happen. There's a whole host of barriers regards to safety, security and legislation that will modulate and throttle that growth. And so we believe that a lot of the work is being done now and there's been a lot of early deployment. And what we're seeing is that, that market is expanding beyond the traditional suppliers between -- beyond the Tier 1 providers to those suppliers and there's a whole host of new players who are entering the market in addition and are deploying technologies, which they have developed for their data center applications. And so we expect this to continue to unfold, to be honest, over the next 10 years. We don't think it's going to all happen tomorrow. We do think there's going to be a lot of proof of concepts and very limited deployments over the next year or 2. But we think that the massive volume will actually come in the 7-nanometer in the 2020 and beyond time frame, and there will be a lot of different approaches. We believe that our technology and our solutions will be relevant to most, if not all of those targets, right? And there's quite a bit of fragmentation. There's a lot of different approaches there. But our technology fundamentally should be very viable to address all of those. And our early position with ADAS gives us good understanding, a good relationship to -- with the providers to address that market."

I would say that first quarter effect is, are you winning, are you not winning at a certain node? And to be honest, the decline in the old product is because there's two significant generations where we did not do well, right? And if you look at the 40-nanometer, at the high end, we were late where the product had some issues. And prior to that, there's also a generation which had its challenges. And so as a result, that is now declining at a fast rate. The good news is now we have 3 nodes in a row that we've had great execution and significant market share. And because it takes a long time, and you're absolutely right in that, it takes time for that to compensate for the old nodes. The good news is once you get to 50%, right, and we're very close to that 50%, then you have a bigger, much stronger tailwind and the headwind is diminishing. And so what you should see is the percentage, which has the tailwind, is growing now at a faster rate and will soon reach magnitude that it can compensate and actually more than compensate for the products which are not growing. And so your analysis is correct, but I think you need to take that first order impact is, did you have a good node or not have a good node. If you have 3 good nodes in succession and they are recent nodes, then once that gets to 50% of the revenue, that should more than compensate for the shrinkage of the old portion."

It's just unmatched, there's no competition for the capability we bring there. And so we have relatively good visibility to the program health.

And so what we are typically doing is looking at a few specific opportunities at customers and then looking at an aggregate -- aggregation on the broader customer base and seeing what we behaved there. So each of these actually has relatively strong growth prospects defined by the markets they serve. Industrial, as we've said before, driven by the industrial Internet of Things and platform adoption will be broad-based and grow, but the nature of that business is more slowly over time. A&D has actually been a relative bright spot for us. We continue to win broadly in designs outside of the Joint Strike Fighter and the Joint Strike Fighter follow-on technology insertions. And so we're seeing a lot of a broader program strength there. And in test, measurement and emulation, what you'll see is that our leading products will gain share and grow relatively rapidly and then we'll be filled in by other elements of that category, like semiconductor test business as that broadens out our footprint.

The -- our expectation is that there's a level of densification which is happening even in 4G, part of which we're benefiting from, and then we're already benefiting from the 5G early deployment, but that tends to be not huge volumes, but nonetheless, it's nice revenue for us. So we expect -- the takeaway on wireless is we expect it to continue to be choppy. What we are seeing is on wired communications that now is growing at a nice rate, and that's where our technology lead -- and that tends to be a less volatile market anyway, and that's where the technology leadership, in particular, initially in 20 and now even in 16 is helping grow our business. So we do expect communications overall to grow. I don't expect it to grow as a percentage of our business, generally speaking, over the next few years. And it's been fluctuating between 40% to 45%, and I don't expect it to grow beyond the 45%, neither do I expect it to shrink below the 40%. And that's sort of the general element.

The -- and there's a lot of ways of skinning the cat. You can do it through just using a lot of processors. The issue there is the -- a lot of the applications tend to be extremely parallel. And then if you try to do it through processors, you can only achieve so much, right, and what typically kills you is the power there. There's a certain class of applications which require tremendous amount of floating point, and that's clearly the area where GPUs have the edge. And in video, in particular, has targeted this market for several years and has established a very good position and I believe is shipping hundreds of millions of dollars. What is clear is that for a whole host of applications, the parallelism inside the FPGAs, and in particular the fact that it's dynamically reconfigurable, in other words, you can change the way the programmable logic behaves to adapt to the payloads and what the customer is doing, provides a significant advantage. And what we're doing is we are focusing on enabling that target market and those sorts of applications to use programmable logic. The key to enabling them to achieve that is actually to abstract the design because these -- if you look at the 7 large players, they're not renown for having FPGA design or trying to then have a lot of software engineers and system engineers but no -- but very small number of FPGA designers. So at this point, the biggest issue is not in the architecture of the programmable logic. It's actually in enabling the extraction so the target users can expand, and that's what we're focusing on. And as we have a whole range of products, which are called our SDx products, our system design products which are targeted to pull that, and we believe that those are the key to enabling us to unlocking the potential of the programmable logic. And over the next 2 to 3 years, we're going to make tremendous strides to address that and to broaden the set of customers. At this point, we need to do it one by one and it's based more on the skill sets that our customers have, which are limited."

But I mean, I'll try to do it in a couple of minutes, which is basically what we have. So at the core of our business is we're a diversified multi-market company, and that actually provides us with significant strength because markets go up and down and the fact that we have a lot shields us from some of that volatility. As you look at the 8 markets we play in, there is now an emergence of new markets, which sometimes are part of existing markets that benefits significantly from the parallelism which is inherent in the programmable logic. And wherever you talk about artificial intelligence, and that's clearly an area which is in vogue now, there probably isn't any architecture out there which is more parallel than programmable logic and has that ability for reconfiguration. So you can architect an ASSP, which is very, very parallel, but then it typically isn't reconfigurable, right? So if the target application changes, then -- or the payload changes, then you tend to have a mismatch. And so as you look at these, then clearly data center and automotive fall into emerging applications, which benefit from that inherent parallelism. And then for each of those, you need to have a different approach, but sometimes a similar underlying technology, which is market specific. And if you look at these players, it's not a total coincidence that the data center companies are now expanding into autonomous driving, right, because there are technologies which are an extension of what they're developing that can be deployed there. And so we see these areas as expansion plays for us. We try to be very realistic with regards to the growth of those markets and we gave the number that, for us, we expect that these expansion plays, generally speaking, in a 5-year time frame, will enable us to expand by $500 million, right? And those two markets are two of the major ones. And if you look at our comments on data center for Xilinx for it to be a $200 million to $300 million market, then you can see that we believe that automotive can also be a $200 million to $300 million market in that general time frame."

In the September quarter, Xilinx sales were $579 million, up 1% sequentially and up 10% on a year-over-year basis. Sales for the first 6 months of the fiscal year were up 7% versus the same period of the prior year. Our Advanced Products increased 10% sequentially and 61% year-over-year with 28-nanometer, 20-nanometer and 16-nanometer sales all reaching new records. Sales from our 16-nanometer UltraScale+ family were significant and exceeded our expectations.
Our sales in the September quarter demonstrated the resilience of our multi-market model. Growth in Industrial and A&D, and Broadcast, Consumer and Automotive categories more than offset the expected decline in communications.
The Industrial and A&D category stood out with strength in test, measurement and emulation as well as Aerospace and Defense. In fact, sales from test, measurement and emulation reached a record during the quarter. Broadcast, Consumer and Automotive was up slightly, better than expected, due primarily to strength from AVB.
Gross margin in Q2 was 69.6%, lower than guided due to the impact of a licensing agreement with Rambus. Moving forward, the impact of this agreement is expected to be immaterial to our gross margin.
Operating expense was $227 million, lower than guided due to lower compensation expenses. Operating income for the quarter was $177 million or 30.5%. Other income and expense was an expense of $1 million, lower than guided due primarily to an investment distribution.
The tax rate for the quarter was 7%, which included the previously disclosed benefit of $9 million or $0.03 per diluted share related to the closure of the audits of fiscal years 2012 through 2014 and a $0.02 per diluted share benefit related to other discrete tax items.
Our net income for Q2 was $164 million or $0.61 per share. Operating cash flow was $184 million. Diluted shares were 270 million, including 14.8 million from the convertible, higher than guided due to the impact of our higher share price. We repurchased 1.9 million shares for $100 million, and we paid $84 million in dividends. 
Now some key points on the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $3.7 billion in gross cash and $2.1 billion in net cash after our debt. Inventory was $197 million, approximately flat with the prior quarter and down $16 million from the same quarter a year ago.
As I turn to our guidance, I would like to refresh the key points of the annual guidance from our Analyst Day in May. At the Analyst Day, we forecasted our revenue growth to be between 4% and 8%, our gross margin to be between 68% and 70% and our operating expense to be between $930 million and $950 million.
Our performance for the first 2 fiscal quarters, our guidance for Q3 and our expectations for Q4 indicate that we remain centered in the range of the guidance provided at our Analyst Meeting.
In the December quarter, we are expecting sales to be flat sequentially. Our backlog is slightly down heading into the quarter. We expect Advanced Products will continue to grow, and we are expecting Communications to increase with both -- with growth in both wireless and wired.
Industrial and A&D is expected to decline as test and measurement comes off of 2 consecutive record quarters. Broadcast, Consumer and Automotive is expected to be approximately flat sequentially.
Our gross margin will be approximately 69%. For operating expense, we continue to invest in accelerating our leadership position as discussed at our Analyst Day. We expect to see operating expense increase to approximately $245 million with a significant portion of the increase coming from tape-out expenses.
Our operating expense outlook includes $1 million of amortization. Other income and expense will be an expense of $2 million and will likely approximate this level again in Q4. Finally, our tax rate is expected to be 14%.
Now I'd like to say a few words on our capital allocation strategy. We are confident in our long-term growth strategy and expect to continue to generate healthy cash flows. Note our operating cash flow from year-to-date exceeds $500 million. 
Our capital allocation priorities remain the same. Invest in our business to capitalize on our leadership position and return capital to our shareholders with a commitment to an increasing dividend over time and through share repurchases.
With respect to share repurchases, as we previously announced in May of this year, the Xilinx Board of Directors increased the repurchase authorization by $1 billion. Our plan is to take a more deliberate approach on share repurchases with the intention of exhausting the $1 billion authorization over the next several quarters.
Let me now turn the call over to Moshe."

We delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of revenue growth resulting in operating profit in excess of 30% for the third consecutive quarter.
Our overall revenue growth was, as in the previous quarter, driven by our Advanced Products. These increased again by over 60% year-over-year, delivering yet another significant quarterly record and now accounts for 46% of our total sales. 
Overall, 5 of our 8 end markets grew in the quarter, demonstrating the robustness of our diversified multi-market portfolio.
Our unparalleled execution on the 28-, 20- and 16-nanometer nodes has now delivered three consecutive generations of very significant technology leadership.
Our world-class partnership with TSMC, the foundry technology and market leader, has been key to this success. In the September quarter, for the fourth consecutive quarter, 28-nanometer sales delivered a new record. 28-nanometer sales growth was enabled by our Zynq product line, which is a significant component of our market expansion efforts. Zynq product sales increased 25% sequentially driven by automotive, wireless, industrial and consumer applications. 20-nanometer revenue again reached a record level, very significantly exceeding our $40 million target.
Sales were driven by strong contributions from our test and measurement, wired and wireless markets. We expect to ship over $50 million of 20-nanometer products in the December quarter.
16-nanometer sales grew significantly in the September quarter, similarly exceeding our forecast while shipping to a broad base of end markets, including Automotive, Data Center and Communications.
At our Analyst Day in May, we discussed a strategic increase in our R&D investment in fiscal year 2017 to both solidify our leadership position and expand our product portfolio.
We recently highlighted two significant accomplishments that demonstrate the early fruits from that investment decision. 
First and foremost, we reached ahead of schedule the critical production milestone with our 16-nanometer UltraScale+ portfolio, further extending our products' lead to well beyond the year. We're already shipping 9 unique revenue generating products to approaching 200 active customers.
As per Lorenzo's earlier comments, we expect to deliver multiple production tape-outs in the current quarter to solidify this lead. In addition, we announced the expansion of our cost optimized Spartan, Altix and Zynq 28-nanometer product family, targeting a wide range of applications including embedded vision and industrial IoT.
We recently made two announcements illustrating our significant momentum in cloud computing, another of our key emerging market expansion opportunities.
Baidu has adopted Xilinx to accelerate machine learning applications in the data center and to leverage our platform in their initiatives to develop commercially viable autonomous cars.
In addition, the CCIX technology consortium formed to bring a high-performance, open acceleration framework to data centers, tripled its membership, has released the specification to consortium members.
We're uniquely positioned to capitalize on our excellent execution and innovative and game-changing products to both accelerate share gains and drive market expansion. We remain committed to maintaining and extending our leadership while delivering to our long-term operating margin target of 30% plus, and per Lorenzo's earlier comments, underlying our commitment to returning cash to shareholders.
Let me now turn the call back to the operator for Q&A."

And we sampled the parts to our customers and we have been shipping them to numerous customers in a whole host of applications. And the feedback we're getting is between the software, the silicon and IP, customers have never seen from anyone, anything up to this level of functionality. And as a result, what we have done is we now have 9 products that are shipping and we're moving into production, and part of the bump that is happening this quarter, the current quarter we're in, in terms of R&D and the quarter after that will be a whole slew of tape-outs, which indicate that we're going to move into production at an early point. So in terms of sampling, we believe we are clearly a year ahead in terms of the maturity of the product. And from what we're hearing from our customers, we're much more than that.

So our automotive business historically was more on the entertainment side. And I think product offering was defined specifically to address driver assistance, and that is a huge step towards delivering autonomous vehicles. What is happening now is the part that is growing is the advanced driver assistance and we actually shared that we expect to have 85 models in production in this year, and we remain on target for delivering those 85 models. If you noticed, I had mentioned that quite a bit of our early revenue on 16-nanometer was in automotive, and that comes from the second generation of our Zynq product, which is the MPSoC. It's a more powerful element. Now in parallel to that, being in a pole position for this market, we are working on the next generation, which is the 7-nanometer product. And there, we expect that as the world moves to -- from driver assistance to autonomous driving, we expect it to move in phases, there's question marks with regards to how quickly it will happen. There's a whole host of barriers regards to safety, security and legislation that will modulate and throttle that growth. And so we believe that a lot of the work is being done now and there's been a lot of early deployment. And what we're seeing is that, that market is expanding beyond the traditional suppliers between -- beyond the Tier 1 providers to those suppliers and there's a whole host of new players who are entering the market in addition and are deploying technologies, which they have developed for their data center applications. And so we expect this to continue to unfold, to be honest, over the next 10 years. We don't think it's going to all happen tomorrow. We do think there's going to be a lot of proof of concepts and very limited deployments over the next year or 2. But we think that the massive volume will actually come in the 7-nanometer in the 2020 and beyond time frame, and there will be a lot of different approaches. We believe that our technology and our solutions will be relevant to most, if not all of those targets, right? And there's quite a bit of fragmentation. There's a lot of different approaches there. But our technology fundamentally should be very viable to address all of those. And our early position with ADAS gives us good understanding, a good relationship to -- with the providers to address that market."

I would say that first quarter effect is, are you winning, are you not winning at a certain node? And to be honest, the decline in the old product is because there's two significant generations where we did not do well, right? And if you look at the 40-nanometer, at the high end, we were late where the product had some issues. And prior to that, there's also a generation which had its challenges. And so as a result, that is now declining at a fast rate. The good news is now we have 3 nodes in a row that we've had great execution and significant market share. And because it takes a long time, and you're absolutely right in that, it takes time for that to compensate for the old nodes. The good news is once you get to 50%, right, and we're very close to that 50%, then you have a bigger, much stronger tailwind and the headwind is diminishing. And so what you should see is the percentage, which has the tailwind, is growing now at a faster rate and will soon reach magnitude that it can compensate and actually more than compensate for the products which are not growing. And so your analysis is correct, but I think you need to take that first order impact is, did you have a good node or not have a good node. If you have 3 good nodes in succession and they are recent nodes, then once that gets to 50% of the revenue, that should more than compensate for the shrinkage of the old portion."

And in certain cases, with very, very large customers and large and more public deals like the Joint Strike Fighter and A&D. We have fairly good visibility up until the actual letting of the purchase orders on when you can see the business. But in general, we can map those over time. Test and measurement, to a large degree, we have some customer concentration, we know we're doing extremely well there based on our leadership products. It's just unmatched, there's no competition for the capability we bring there. And so we have relatively good visibility to the program health. What we actually can be positively surprised by in that area is the success of our customers as their platforms win in the market. Industrial. Industrial is a lot of customers for us. And so what we are typically doing is looking at a few specific opportunities at customers and then looking at an aggregate -- aggregation on the broader customer base and seeing what we behaved there. So each of these actually has relatively strong growth prospects defined by the markets they serve. Industrial, as we've said before, driven by the industrial Internet of Things and platform adoption will be broad-based and grow, but the nature of that business is more slowly over time. A&D has actually been a relative bright spot for us. We continue to win broadly in designs outside of the Joint Strike Fighter and the Joint Strike Fighter follow-on technology insertions. And so we're seeing a lot of a broader program strength there. And in test, measurement and emulation, what you'll see is that our leading products will gain share and grow relatively rapidly and then we'll be filled in by other elements of that category, like semiconductor test business as that broadens out our footprint.

What we do expect is that the method deployment will start in 2020 onward and that the initial deployments between now and 2020 are happening, and they will -- there's various flavors, 4.5, 4.9, there's a whole host of numbers which are being thrown around, pre-5G, 5G prototypes, but we're in a good position for all of those, but we can tell just based on our technology position.

The -- and there's a lot of ways of skinning the cat. You can do it through just using a lot of processors. The issue there is the -- a lot of the applications tend to be extremely parallel. And then if you try to do it through processors, you can only achieve so much, right, and what typically kills you is the power there. There's a certain class of applications which require tremendous amount of floating point, and that's clearly the area where GPUs have the edge. And in video, in particular, has targeted this market for several years and has established a very good position and I believe is shipping hundreds of millions of dollars. What is clear is that for a whole host of applications, the parallelism inside the FPGAs, and in particular the fact that it's dynamically reconfigurable, in other words, you can change the way the programmable logic behaves to adapt to the payloads and what the customer is doing, provides a significant advantage. And what we're doing is we are focusing on enabling that target market and those sorts of applications to use programmable logic. The key to enabling them to achieve that is actually to abstract the design because these -- if you look at the 7 large players, they're not renown for having FPGA design or trying to then have a lot of software engineers and system engineers but no -- but very small number of FPGA designers. So at this point, the biggest issue is not in the architecture of the programmable logic. It's actually in enabling the extraction so the target users can expand, and that's what we're focusing on. And as we have a whole range of products, which are called our SDx products, our system design products which are targeted to pull that, and we believe that those are the key to enabling us to unlocking the potential of the programmable logic. And over the next 2 to 3 years, we're going to make tremendous strides to address that and to broaden the set of customers. At this point, we need to do it one by one and it's based more on the skill sets that our customers have, which are limited."

But I mean, I'll try to do it in a couple of minutes, which is basically what we have. So at the core of our business is we're a diversified multi-market company, and that actually provides us with significant strength because markets go up and down and the fact that we have a lot shields us from some of that volatility. As you look at the 8 markets we play in, there is now an emergence of new markets, which sometimes are part of existing markets that benefits significantly from the parallelism which is inherent in the programmable logic. And wherever you talk about artificial intelligence, and that's clearly an area which is in vogue now, there probably isn't any architecture out there which is more parallel than programmable logic and has that ability for reconfiguration. So you can architect an ASSP, which is very, very parallel, but then it typically isn't reconfigurable, right? So if the target application changes, then -- or the payload changes, then you tend to have a mismatch. And so as you look at these, then clearly data center and automotive fall into emerging applications, which benefit from that inherent parallelism. And then for each of those, you need to have a different approach, but sometimes a similar underlying technology, which is market specific. And if you look at these players, it's not a total coincidence that the data center companies are now expanding into autonomous driving, right, because there are technologies which are an extension of what they're developing that can be deployed there. And so we see these areas as expansion plays for us. We try to be very realistic with regards to the growth of those markets and we gave the number that, for us, we expect that these expansion plays, generally speaking, in a 5-year time frame, will enable us to expand by $500 million, right? And those two markets are two of the major ones. And if you look at our comments on data center for Xilinx for it to be a $200 million to $300 million market, then you can see that we believe that automotive can also be a $200 million to $300 million market in that general time frame."
