Thanks, Janet. Good morning and thanks for joining us on today's call. This morning, I'll spend a few minutes recapping our full year 2015 results and our progress on the transformation we've been working on the company since 2010 then, Sue will take you through the fourth quarter results and I'll end up with our outlook for 2016 before we open it up to your questions. 
Starting with full year 2015. It was a year that I would characterize best by one word and that word is volatility, volatility in energy markets, in foreign exchange rates, in industrial markets, in emerging markets and, of course, in the stock market. During this period of volatility, while the individual pieces might not each have ended exactly how we had forecast some 12 months ago, our headlines results were essentially right in the forecast we gave you 1 year ago. 
The 2015 forecast we gave you 1 year ago was: For 4% to 5% organic growth and we came in at 5%, our adjusted EPS forecast was a midpoint of $3.74, or actuals $3.73 and that performance was significantly more FX headwind. We had included a $0.17 earnings headwind in currency and guidance and ended up being over $0.30. Our free cash flow forecast was $950 million to $1 billion and we delivered $985 million. 
We focused on executing within our business operating system and on the things that we can control, while doing our best to anticipate the things that we couldn't control and made adjustments accordingly. 
2015 demonstrated continued progress in the implementation of our multiyear strategy for growth, operational excellence and shareholder value. We invested in core businesses, key strategic capabilities and delivered on our financial commitments, all while navigating shifts and challenges in global markets. 
We have consistently delivered on our commitments, even in volatile times and we hope that you agree that the company's coverage that have done this. I'm very proud of our team and the great people in our company that delivered another solid year. 
If I look back over a longer horizon over the last, say, 24 months, it's a similar story with the exception of a single quarter almost 5 years ago, we met or exceeded earnings commitments regardless of market conditions. 
For the year, our organic revenues, which excludes OpEx and acquisitions, were up 5%. Markets were uneven around the globe, growth in North America was in the mid-single digits, while revenues overseas, taken collectively, increased low single digits. 
Adjusted earnings per share were $3.73, a year-over-year increase of 12%. And the [indiscernible] diversified industrial peer group, we achieved top quartile performance in EPS growth again in 2015. We grew adjusted operating margins 40 basis points in 2015. Our organic operating leverage, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange and M&A, was 35% which is above our target range of 25% to 30%. And Climate margins improved 50 basis points. 
We generated $985 million of cash flow. Our capital allocation strategy remains focused on maximizing shareholder value, and it's consistent with our overall financial strategy. We continue to increase our dividend with a 16% increase in 2015 and we announced an additional 10% increase for dividend last week. 
We repurchased 4.4 million shares for $250 million in 2015 and more recently, we took advantage of some of the volatility in the stock market and accelerated our share repurchases this year, repurchasing 4.9 million shares for $250 million in January of this year. We finalized an agreement with the IRS for the years 2002 through 2011. In December, we announced agreement to sell our remaining stake in Huntmans [ph] and we expect that to close in April. Our performance in 2015 gives further conviction to our strategy and position us well as we go into a challenging global economic backdrop in 2016. 
Please go to Slide 4. We delivered steady improvements in operating margins. Shown here are the last 5 years where operating margins are up 270 basis points since 2011, despite tough years in Industrial in 2014 and 2015. During this same period, our adjusted operating leverage has averaged over 35%. 
Please go to Slide 5. This chart walks through the change in operating margin from 2014 of 10.9% to 2015, which was 11%. This chart has shown on a reported basis so it includes restructuring and [indiscernible] step-up cost, which are excluded from adjusted margins. We had 20 basis points of higher restructuring year-over-year and also had 20 basis point impact [indiscernible] step-up on acquisitions. Adjusted margins, which excludes those items, expanded 40 basis points from 11% to 11.4%. 
The 40 basis points of margin expansion was delivered from a combination of organic growth, maintaining a positive gap between pricing and material implication through value pricing and pricing analytics and productivity from strategic sourcing, implementing our Lean operating system and overhead cost discipline together outpacing other inflation. 
Foreign exchange was a drag to margin of 50 basis points. We continue to invest in new products, IT infrastructure and systems and service and sales footprint underpinned the future growth of the business and those collectively were 30 basis point investment year-over-year. 
So Now, Sue will take you through the fourth quarter and I'll come back to take you through 2016 outlook."

Residential and commercial HVAC organic revenues were each up 5-plus percent. Adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $0.94, up 15% versus last year. Consistent with Mike's commentary for the full year, the fourth quarter was in line with our earnings guidance. A slightly lower tax rate was offset by slightly higher compensation and benefit costs. Our adjusted operating margins were up 50 basis points. Operating leverage in the quarter was excellent at 34% on an adjusted basis and 55% on an organic basis. 
Climate margins increased 70 basis points in the quarter. Adjusted Industrial margins were down 200 basis points but were only slightly down on 2% lower organic revenues when excluding the impact of currency and a rolling in the first year of Cameron's Centrifugal operating income and amortization. 
Finally, as Mike mentioned, given the impending closing of the sale of our Hussmann stake expected on April 1 and to take advantage of market volatility, we repurchased 4.9 million shares in January 2016 for $250 million. 
Please go to Slide 7. Orders for the fourth quarter of 2015 were up 1% on a reported basis and up 4%, excluding currency. Organic orders were up 2%. 
Climate orders were up 5% organically. Organic global commercial HVAC bookings were up low single digits with a high single-digit increase in North America and declines in Asia and Europe. 
Organic transport orders were up low single digits with increases in global trailer, truck and auxiliary power units, partially offset by lower marine container orders. 
Orders in the Industrial segment were down 4% on a reported basis and down 7% organically. We saw high single-digit order decline in air and industrial products and a mid-single-digit increase in Club Car. 
Please go to Slide 8. Here's a look at the revenue trends by segment and region. The top half of this chart shows revenue change for each segment. For the total company, fourth quarter revenues were up 3% versus last year on a reported basis and also up 3% on an organic basis. 
Climate revenues increased 2% on a reported basis and 5% on an organic basis. 
Organic commercial HVAC revenues were up mid-single digits with increases in all major geographic region. Residential HVAC revenues were up mid-single digits. 
Organic transport revenues were down low single digits as higher truck and trailer revenues were more than offset by lower revenues in marine and APUs. 
Industrial revenues were up 5% on a reported basis and down 2% organically. Air and industrial products organic revenues were down low single digits and Club Car was up slightly. 
The bottom chart shows revenue change on a geographic basis as reported and on an organic basis. Organic revenues were up 3% in the Americas, up 2% in EMEA and Asia was up 9% with strong growth outside of China. 
Please go to Slide 9. Operating margin on a reported basis was up 10 basis points from fourth quarter 2014 to fourth quarter of 2015. We spiked out the restructuring impact to get you to adjusted margins as well. Adjusted margins increased 50 basis points from 10.8% to 11.3%. 
Volume, mix and foreign exchange collectively reflect with 40 basis points of positive margin from volume and mix being offset by foreign exchange. Net pricing versus direct material inflation was favorable by 30 basis points driven by commodity deflation. Productivity versus other inflation was positive 80 basis points driven by strong productivity in the quarter. Year-over-year investments and other items reduced margins by 100 basis points. 
In the box, you can see that it was comprised of 20 basis points from investments, 50 basis points from higher restructuring costs and 30 basis points from acquisitions. In the gray box at the top of the page, overall leverage on an adjusted basis was 34% and if calculated on an organic basis, which excludes foreign exchange and acquisitions, was 55%. 
Now please go to Slide 10. Total fourth quarter revenues for the Climate segment were $2.5 billion, that is up 2% versus last year on a reported basis and up 5%, excluding currency. Acquisitions in Climate do not change that rounding, so organic revenue is also up 5%. 
Organic commercial HVAC fourth quarter revenues were up mid-single digits and were up in all geographic regions. North America was up mid-single digits, while EMEA and Latin America were both up low single digits. Asia was up low-teens. The growth in Asia was led by some large HVAC projects in Southeast Asia. 
Commercial HVAC equipment organic revenues were up low single digits, while HVAC parts, services and solutions revenue were up high single digits versus prior year. 
Thermo King organic revenues were down low single digits with truck, trailer revenue up high single digits with growth in both North America and Europe. Marine and APU revenues declined against difficult comparisons to the fourth quarter of last year. 
Residential HVAC revenues were up mid-single digits versus last year. 
The adjusted operating margin for Climate was 12.9% in the quarter, 70 basis points higher than fourth quarter of 2014 due to volume and productivity, partially offset by currency and other inflation. Climate's operating leverage was over 50% in the quarter. 
Now please go to Slide 11. Fourth quarter revenues for the Industrial segment were $834 million, up 5% on a reported basis but down 2% on an organic basis. 
Compression technologies and services, Power Tools, fluid management and Material Handling organic revenues were down low single digits versus last year. Organic revenues in the Americas were down high single digits, while revenues in EMEA were down low single digits and were up high single digits in Asia due to some large project deliveries. 
Club Car revenues, excluding foreign exchange, were up slightly versus prior year. 
Industrial's adjusted operating margin of 13.8% was down 200 basis points compared with last year. When excluding the impact of acquisition and currency, adjusted margins were down 20 basis points year-over-year on lower over organic revenues. 
The Engineered Centrifugal Compressor business, or ECC, which we purchased from Cameron in January of 2015, executed well and came in essentially on forecast in the fourth quarter. In 2015, revenues were impacted by weakened industrial markets however, synergies were above our acquisition model and EBITDA and cash EPS were both accretive. 
Please go to Slide 12. For the full year, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 4.2%. We had strong collections in the quarter with our DSO improving over the prior year. Going forward, we expect working capital to be in the 4% range. 
Now go to Slide 13, please. Adjusted cash flow generation was excellent at $985 million in 2015. Cash conversion as a percent of adjusted net earnings was 101% for the year. As you can see when we look at 2016, we expect adjusted free cash flow in the range of $950 million to $1 billion. That rang excludes the proceeds from the sale of our stake in Hussmann. Our balance sheet remains very strong. We have no debt maturities until 2018. 
Please go to Slide 14. Over the last 5 years, we've returned over $6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The employees' dynamic for capital allocation, which are just based on market conditions to put our strong free cash flow to the right use for shareholder value. Last week, we announced a 10% increase to our dividend. Our dividend increases over the last 5 years has been a 24% CAGR. Our payout ratio is in line with peers. 
We repurchased 103 million shares in the past 5 years from 2011 to 2015. As we said earlier for 2016, we anticipated some market volatility in January and we're able to accelerate our minimum share repurchase of $250 million to the beginning of the year. We repurchased 4.9 million shares in January. To remind you, our free cash flow generation is heavily weighted to the second half due t the seasonality of our businesses, namely the HVAC businesses, so our normal timing for share repurchases would have been in second half, but given we had the proceeds from the sale of our Hussmann stake coming in April, we thought it was opportunistic and still within our leverage range to accelerate the minimum repurchase and get that done earlier in the year.
For the balance of 2016, we will use the same approach as the last couple of years, applying a toggle switch between value-accretive acquisitions and share repurchases based upon relative valuations and risk-adjusted returns. We will apply our same decision-making framework to the situation at that time and leave the door open to pivot to share repurchase or M&A as it makes business sense for our shareholders. For ease of modeling purposes, you'll see that for the 2016 share count, we've applied excess cash to repurchases in the second half of 2016 as we turn cash flow positive. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Mike to take you through 2016 guidance."

As always our intention is to give you our view of what we're seeing in our market, sitting here today and what that translates to our revenue outlook for 2016. We've broken it down by major end markets and geographies and as you can see by the variation of colors and symbols, [indiscernible] markets seeing a wide variation in trends. 
North American commercial HVAC and residential HVAC, as well as transport and commercial HVAC markets in Europe, are generally positive while global industrial markets remained weak. Transport markets in the Americas was down -- flat to down as lower trailer volumes will be largely offset by higher auxiliary power units, small truck refrigeration and other products. 
Asia HVAC markets are expected to be flat to down and industrial markets in Asia remained under pressure. Gulf utility vehicle markets are generally flat to slightly up.
All the growth forecasts shown our on an organic basis. We're forecasting low single digit growth in commercial HVAC in total, mid-single-digit growth in residential HVAC, which essentially an all North American business for us and flat revenues in transport. 
We expect air and industrial products, which includes our compression technologies, Power Tools, Material Handling and fluid management HVUs to be down low single digits and we expect Club Car to be up low single digits. 
Please go to Slide 16. Aggregating those market backdrops, we expect our reported revenues for 2016 to be flat, up 2% versus 2015. Overall, foreign exchange will be a headwind of about 2 percentage points as we've now completed a full year of Cameron division and our results organic revenue growth and excluding FX are the same in this forecast. Translating that to the segments, we expect Climate revenues to be up 1% to 3% on a reported basis and 3% to 5%, excluding currency. 
The Industrial segment revenues were forecast to be down in the range of 2% to 4% on a reported basis and down 1% to up 1%, excluding foreign exchange. 
Industrial also has a higher proportion of revenues outside of the U.S. and Climate on an industrial experience is more impacted to FX as compared to Climate 3 points of impact versus 2 points in Climate. 
For operating margins, excluding restructuring cost adjusted margins, we expect Climate adjusted operating margins to be in the range of 13.25% to 13.75%, we expect Industrial adjusted margins to be in the range of 13% to 13.75% and for the enterprise, we expect adjusted operating margins of 11.5% to 12% and EBITDA margins of 14.2% to 14.7%. Operating leverage would be about 60% all in and about 30%, excluding currency. Margin expansion would be 10 to 60 basis points on an adjusted basis. 
Please go to Slide 17. Transitioning to earnings, reported earnings per share range is estimated to be $3.75 to $3.95. Excluding restructuring, the range is $3.80 to $4, an increase of 2% to 7% versus 2015.  As a note, for 2016, FX, as a headwind, of about 2% to revenue and $0.19 to earnings. 
For this forecast, we reflected consensus foreign exchange rate forecast. So for example, the euro, average rate for the euro is 1.03% [ph] but for the first quarter, the euro forecast rate is 1.06% [ph]. This reflects a full year tax rate of 24% to 25% and an average share count of 260 million shares for the full year. 
As Sue explained, for ease of modeling, we allocate an all excess cash share buyback and phased that to the back half of the year when we turn cash flow positive. This is not to necessarily mean that this will be the actual deployment for the cash but was down to simplify modeling. 
The EPS outlook does not include the impact of divestitures of our stake in Hussmann and we expect the transaction to close April 1 and the result in gain of approximately $400 million, which will be recorded in other income in the second quarter. We'll update our guidance in April to reflect the closing but we'll address out the gain for comparability. 
First quarter 2016 revenues are forecast to be flat to 2% on a reported basis and 3% to 5%, excluding currency. Reported first quarter earnings per share are forecast to be $0.28 to $0.33, adding back $0.05 of restructuring. Again, on an adjusted basis, the EPS range was $0.33 to $0.38. There are EPS bridges in the appendix for both the full year and the first quarter's guidance. 
For the full year 2016, we expect to generate adjusted free cash flow, which excludes restructuring cash and proceeds from Hussmann at $950 million to $1 billion. As we said earlier, we increased the dividend last week and have already completed $250 million in share repurchases, which will offset dilution from equity issuances. We had $143 million of commercial paper at year end. And after paying that down, at least about $675 million of cash for deployment that we utilize for additional share repurchase or towards M&A. 
We continue to build a pipeline of opportunities related to our core businesses and we weight those risk adjusted opportunities against buyback in terms of returns and shareholder value. 
In closing, we're pleased to deliver those solid year with top quartile performance in revenue, earnings growth. Our strategies for growth and operational excellence delivered a multiyear trend excellent operating leverage, margins and earnings improvement. And our focus is to continue to grow earnings and cash flow to further implementation of these strategies. 
We practically work to deliver productivity to make prudent investments for the future. We continue to invest in new products and service offerings, our IT infrastructure and systems as well as further developing people and our operating capabilities. We continue to execute a consistent, value-maximizing capital allocation program. So I'm proud of the progress we've made and results we've delivered and I believe we're well positioned in 2016 to again, deliver on our commitments. 
With that, Sue and I will be pleased to take your questions."

Our operating results are really going to be in the range of, and this includes the restructuring, negative $0.01 to a positive $0.04. We've got a little bit of lower share count. But when you think about what's happening in the headwinds, the first quarter is going to be part of that currency headwind that we talked about, particularly on the Industrial business. And the revenues we expect in the first quarter and margins for industrial, we expect to be even lower than where we ended the year. So in other words, we're looking at a low revenue base. We're looking at headwinds from currency. And so, I think the first quarter is just going to be tough compares and then I think we get better as we go through the remainder of the year."

That being said, when you look at areas of the business, particularly around compression technology, there is restructuring taking place there and largely it's the areas of headcount,  and things that we can do on a nonqualified way. So tremendous focused on both corporate and cost within each of the businesses, so there is a sort of drumbeat over time of doing but it's an effective, efficient -- incredibly effective and efficient footprint. One of the things that we find is the better we got in, that further we've gotten into that, the longer and harder is to get a payback on a closure, which is a good thing.

Also, we had really good service growth, kind of high single-digit growth in services. Controls was up nearly double digits there. So it feels like we've call it a little bit of a lift in terms of institutional markets.

We look at the APUs, we had good growth in the year, we had 16% growth in APUs over the full year. We had good growth in bookings in the fourth quarter. We've got a strategy for higher attachment rate to nonrefrigerated trailers, about a 3 to 1 ratio. If we sell 3 APUs, it's equal to one North American trailer. So there is, between APU and some of the air businesses and other businesses that we have the ability to offset that decline. And then I point you back to the European trailer was up nicely. As that moves up, that's actually given more healthful North American trailer. So net-net, we're good. Actually, what's down for us pretty big is container. We had a big year last year in container. Our container is soft. The market, in general, we're against a tough comp. But container is an area where frankly, less container is helpful on the mix. So net-net, we think we can grow margins."

One of the other points, and you didn't ask this, but I think it's relevant when we're having the discussion about price and direct material inflation, when we think about the differences between Climate and the Industrial businesses, the largest pieces of the benefit on material deflation do go to the Climate business. There is some and there's still is a positive spread in the Industrial businesses, but it's much less than what you would see in Climate.

But what it really doesn't do is it doesn't really affect the overall effective tax rate. So what you have to do in order to make that tax rate move is you to continue to refine your strategy. Now having all of those issues off the table, certainly does give you an opportunity and we are certainly involved in looking at that strategy in terms of the different areas that we're looking at. So we have a good trading hub that is in Europe. We're looking at Asia and Panama for trading hubs. We're looking at all of our intercompany debt and making sure that we're as balanced as we go into 2016 as we would like to be. But we do also have a slight headwind, if you will, on tax rates. And that is when you look around the globe and you think about our revenue growth in 2016, the areas that are growing the most are in North America, which does pressure the tax rate. So there's a long way around saying, we absolutely have a goal of looking at every opportunity to bring that rate down. We're still going to be just as conscientious about the items we take on as we've always been. But I do think we'll see some opportunities in 2016. We'll continue to work that strategy and continue to communicate. Like I say, it's also a good thing that we have a little pressure on that rate coming out of the North America growth."

It's a little bit tough to compare comps against competition heavily denominated in different currencies. But we did very well there on the product and services side of the business, so that's a great example. I would say that where we try to leverage in the gross margin range of 25% and 30%. We're looking to deleverage within the gross margin range of not to exceed to 25% to 30%. So that would be sort of the essence of that. It depend a bit on the business. I mean, TK has fundamentally I think more opportunity. It doesn't leverage up nearly as high as people think. It doesn't deleverage nearly as poorly as people think largely because the distribution base of that business is independent. And so we're really turning on and off factor production, and we've got very flexible plants and labor forces that work with us on that.

But Industrial has an outsized impact from foreign exchange. So over a 50% of the revenues are impacted or they're non-U.S. and are impacted by foreign exchange. So you have that headwind going against them. We do have the amortization from the accounting on the acquisition Cameron, again took that on -- we took that on, but it does impact what we're looking at in 2015. And then, as I pointed out earlier when you think about they don't get the benefit or the big benefit coming out of direct material deflation with commodity prices because that's just not how that segment works, the air business gets benefit out of some of that but the other businesses within the segment do not. And so when you say you've got outsized foreign exchange, less direct material deflation and we put an acquisition in there with some additional amortization.

However, I would say that as you look at that business from the time that we looked at the acquisition until we completed 2015, I would say that, that road map just we talked about with the entire company has a few different components. So if you think about the revenue side of that business, you certainly have the 4 components of the business with the plant air side of the business being really hit by the weakened industrial market. And so that definitely, that book in turn business, differently took a downturn in 2015. You also have tough, tough markets with oil prices and so on the processed gas side and on the engineered air side, you've got fewer projects, you've got same number of competitors. And so you've got some tough markets there and then you've got an aftermarket, which is an opportunity. Having said all of that, what we did with the business in 2015 with a top line that wasn't perhaps as strong as what we wanted is we accelerated some of the synergies in the business and in fact, overdrove the operating synergies, net revenue synergies, but the operating synergies in the business, and we're going to continue to do that. So the point wasn't that it's operating exactly as we would have called it a year ago but I think as we look to the business and with what we were going to do with that, we ended up with a pretty good result on the acquisition."

This morning, I'll spend a few minutes recapping our full year 2015 results and our progress on the transformation we've been working on in the company since 2010. Then, Sue wi",890,"Great. Thanks, Janet. Good morning, and thanks for joining us on today's call. This morning, I'll spend a few minutes recapping our full year 2015 results and our progress on the transformation we've been working on in the company since 2010. Then, Sue will take you through the fourth quarter results, and I'll end up with our outlook for 2016 before we open it up to your questions. 
So starting with full year 2015. It was a year that I could characterize best by one word, and that word is volatility: volatility in energy markets, in foreign exchange rates, in industrial markets, in emerging markets and, of course, in the stock market. During this period of volatility, while the individual pieces might not each have ended exactly how we had forecast some 12 months ago, our headlines results were essentially right in the forecast we gave you a year ago. 
The 2015 forecast we gave you a year ago was for 4% to 5% organic growth, and we came in at 5%. Our adjusted EPS forecast was a midpoint of $3.74 or actuals $3.73. that performance was significantly more FX headwind. We had included a $0.17 earnings headwind in currency and guidance and ended up being over $0.30. Our free cash flow forecast was $950 million to $1 billion, and we delivered $985 million. 
We focused on executing within our business operating system and on the things that we can control, while doing our best to anticipate the things that we couldn't control, and we made adjustments accordingly. 
2015 demonstrated continued progress in the implementation of our multiyear strategy for growth, operational excellence and shareholder value. We invested in core businesses, matured in key strategic capabilities and delivered on our financial commitments, all while navigating shifts and challenges in global markets. 
We have consistently delivered on our commitments, even in volatile times, and we hope that you agree that there are very few companies in your coverage that have done this. I'm very proud of our team and the great people in our company that delivered another solid year. 
If I look back over a longer horizon over the last, say, 24 months, it's a similar story. With the exception of a single quarter almost 5 years ago, we met or exceeded our earnings commitments regardless of market conditions. 
For the year, our organic revenues, which excludes OpEx and acquisitions, were up 5%. Markets were uneven around the globe. Growth in North America was in the mid-single digits, while revenues overseas, taken collectively, increased low single digits. 
Adjusted earnings per share were $3.73, a year-over-year increase of 12%. Within our diversified industrial peer group, we achieved top quartile performance in EPS growth again in 2015. We grew adjusted operating margins 40 basis points in 2015. Our organic operating leverage, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange and M&A, was 35%, which is above our target range of 25% to 30%. And Climate margins improved 60 basis points. 
We generated $985 million of cash flow. Our capital allocation strategy remains focused on maximizing shareholder value, and it's consistent with our overall financial strategy. We continued to increase our dividend, with a 16% increase in 2015, and we announced an additional 10% increase in the dividend last week. 
We repurchased 4.4 million shares for $250 million in 2015, and more recently, we took advantage of some of the volatility in the stock market and accelerated our share repurchases this year, repurchasing 4.9 million shares for $250 million in January of this year. We finalized an agreement with the IRS for the years 2002 through 2011. In December, we announced an agreement to sell our remaining stake in Hussmann, and we expect that to close in April. Our performance in 2015 gives further conviction to our strategy and positions us well as we go into a challenging global economic backdrop in 2016. 
Please go to Slide 4. We delivered steady improvements in operating margins. Shown here are the last 5 years where operating margins were up 270 basis points since 2011, despite tough years in Industrial in 2014 and 2015. During this same period, our adjusted operating leverage has averaged over 35%. 
Please go to Slide 5. This chart walks through the change in operating margin from 2014 of 10.9% to 2015, which was 11%. This chart has shown on a reported basis. So it includes restructuring, inventory step-up costs, which were excluded from adjusted margins.
We had 20 basis points of higher restructuring year-over-year and also had a 20 basis point impact inventory step-up on acquisitions. Adjusted margins, which exclude those items, expanded 40 basis points from 11% to 11.4%. 
The 40 basis points of margin expansion was delivered from the combination of organic growth, maintaining a positive gap between pricing and material inflation through value pricing and pricing analytics and productivity from strategic sourcing, implementing our Lean operating system and overhead cost discipline together outpacing other inflation. 
Foreign exchange was a drag to margin of 50 basis points. We continued to invest in new products, IT infrastructure and systems and service and sales footprint to underpin the future growth of the business, and those collectively were 30 basis point investment year-over-year. 
So now, Sue will take you through the fourth quarter, and I'll come back to take you through 2016's outlook."

Residential and commercial HVAC organic revenues were each up 5-plus percent. Adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $0.94, up 15% versus last year.
Consistent with Mike's commentary, for the full year, the fourth quarter was in line with our earnings guidance. A slightly lower tax rate was offset by slightly higher compensation and benefit costs. Our adjusted operating margins were up 50 basis points. Operating leverage in the quarter was excellent at 34% on an adjusted basis and 55% on an organic basis. 
Climate margins increased 70 basis points in the quarter. Adjusted Industrial margins were down 200 basis points but were only slightly down on 2% lower organic revenues, when excluding the impact of currency and a rolling in the first year of Cameron Centrifugal operating income and amortization. 
Finally, as Mike mentioned, given the impending closing of the sale of our Hussmann stake expected on April 1 and to take advantage of market volatility, we repurchased 4.9 million shares in January 2016 for $250 million. 
Please go to Slide 7. Orders for the fourth quarter of 2015 were up 1% on a reported basis and up 4%, excluding currency. Organic orders were up 2%.
Climate orders were up 5% organically. Organic global commercial HVAC bookings were up low single digits, with a high single-digit increase in North America and declines in Asia and Europe. 
Organic transport orders were up low single digits with increases in global trailer, truck and auxiliary power units, partially offset by lower marine container orders. Orders in the Industrial segment were down 4% on a reported basis and down 7% organically. We saw high single-digit order decline in Air and Industrial products and a mid-single-digit increase in Club Car. 
Please go to Slide 8. Here's a look at the revenue trends by segment and region. The top half of the chart shows revenue change for each segment. For the total company, fourth quarter revenues were up 3% versus last year on a reported basis and also up 3% on an organic basis. 
Climate revenues increased 2% on a reported basis and 5% on an organic basis. Organic commercial HVAC revenues were up mid-single digits with increases in all major geographic region. Residential HVAC revenues were up mid-single digits. 
Organic transport revenues were down low single digits, as higher truck and trailer revenues were more than offset by lower revenues in marine and APUs. Industrial revenues were up 5% on a reported basis and down 2% organically. Air and Industrial products organic revenues were down low single digits, and Club Car was up slightly. 
The bottom chart shows revenue change on a geographic basis as reported and on an organic basis. Organic revenues were up 3% in the Americas, up 2% in EMEA and Asia was up 9% with strong growth outside of China. 
Please go to Slide 9. Operating margin on a reported basis was up 10 basis points from fourth quarter 2014 to fourth quarter of 2015. We've spiked out the restructure impact to get you to adjusted margins as well. Adjusted margins increased 50 basis points from 10.8% to 11.3%. 
Volume, mix and foreign exchange collectively reflect with 40 basis points of positive margin from volume and mix being offset by foreign exchange. Net pricing versus direct material inflation was favorable by 30 basis points, driven by commodity deflation. Productivity versus other inflation was positive 80 basis points, driven by strong productivity in the quarter. Year-over-year investments and other items reduced margins by 100 basis points. 
In the box, you can see that it was comprised of 20 basis points from investments, 50 basis points from higher restructuring costs and 30 basis points from acquisitions. In the gray box at the top of the page, overall leverage on an adjusted basis was 34% and if calculated on an organic basis, which excludes foreign exchange and acquisitions, was 55%. 
Now please go to Slide 10. Total fourth quarter revenues for the Climate segment were $2.5 billion. That is up 2% versus last year on a reported basis and up 5%, excluding currency. Acquisitions in Climate do not change that rounding. So organic revenue is also up 5%. 
Organic commercial HVAC fourth quarter revenues were up mid-single digits and were up in all geographic regions. North America was up mid-single digits, while EMEA and Latin America were both up low single digits. Asia was up low-teens. The growth in Asia was led by some large HVAC projects in Southeast Asia. Commercial HVAC equipment organic revenues were up low single digits, while HVAC parts, services and solutions revenue were up high single digits versus prior year. 
Thermo King organic revenues were down low single digits, with truck, trailer revenue up high single digits with growth in both North America and Europe. Marine and APU revenues declined against difficult comparisons to the fourth quarter of last year. Residential HVAC revenues were up mid-single digits versus last year. 
The adjusted operating margin for Climate was 12.9% in the quarter, 70 basis points higher than fourth quarter of 2014 due to volume and productivity, partially offset by currency and other inflation. Climate's operating leverage was over 50% in the quarter. 
Now please go to Slide 11. Fourth quarter revenues for the Industrial segment were $834 million, up 5% on a reported basis but down 2% on an organic basis.
Compression technologies and services, Power Tools, fluid management and Material Handling organic revenues were down low single digits versus last year. Organic revenues in the Americas were down high single digits, while revenues in EMEA were down low single digits and were up high single digits in Asia due to some large project deliveries. 
Club Car revenues, excluding foreign exchange, were up slightly versus prior year. Industrial's adjusted operating margin of 13.8% was down 200 basis points compared with last year. When excluding the impact of acquisitions and currency, adjusted margins were down 20 basis points year-over-year on lower over organic revenues. 
The Engineered Centrifugal Compressor business, or ECC, which we purchased from Cameron in January of 2015, executed well and came in essentially on forecast in the fourth quarter. In 2015, revenues were impacted by weakened industrial markets; however, synergies were above our acquisition model, and EBITDA and cash EPS were both accretive. 
Please go to Slide 12. For the full year, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 4.2%. We have strong collections in the quarter with our DSO improving over the prior year. Going forward, we expect working capital to be in the 4% range. 
Now go to Slide 13, please. Adjusted cash flow generation was excellent at $985 million in 2015. Cash conversion, as a percent of adjusted net earnings, was 101% for the year. As you can see, when we look at 2016, we expect adjusted free cash flow in the range of $950 million to $1 billion. That rang excludes the proceeds from the sale of our stake in Hussmann. Our balance sheet remains very strong. We have no debt maturities until 2018.
Please go to Slide 14. Over the last 5 years, we've returned over $6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We employ dynamic model for capital allocation, which are just based on market conditions to put our strong free cash flow to the right use for shareholder value. Last week, we announced a 10% increase to our dividend. Our dividend increases over the last 5 years has been a 24% CAGR. Our payout ratio is in line with peers. 
We've repurchased 103 million shares in the past 5 years from 2011 to 2015. As we said earlier, for 2016, we anticipated some market volatility in January, and we're able to accelerate our minimum share repurchase of $250 million to the beginning of the year. We've repurchased 4.9 million shares in January. To remind you, our free cash flow generation is heavily weighted to the second half due to the seasonality of our businesses, namely the HVAC businesses, so our normal timing for share repurchases would have been in second half. But given we have the proceeds from the sale of our Hussmann stake coming in April, we thought it was opportunistic and still within our leverage range to accelerate the minimum repurchase and get that done earlier in the year.
For the balance of 2016, we will use the same approach as the last couple of years, applying a toggle switch between value-accretive acquisitions and share repurchases, based upon relative valuations and risk-adjusted returns. We will apply our same decision-making framework to the situation at that time and leave the door open to pivot to share repurchase or M&A as it makes best sense for our shareholders. For ease of modeling purposes, you'll see that for the 2016 share count, we've applied excess cash to repurchases in the second half of 2016 as we turn cash flow positive. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Mike to take you through 2016 guidance."

As always our intention is to give you our best view of what we're seeing in our end markets sitting here today and how that translates to our revenue outlook for 2016. We've broken it down by major end markets and geographies. And as you can see by the variation of colors and symbols, our end markets are seeing a wide variation in trends. 
North American commercial HVAC and residential HVAC, as well as transport and commercial HVAC markets in Europe are generally positive while global industrial markets remained weak. Transport markets in the Americas will be down -- flat to down, as lower trailer volumes will be largely offset by higher auxiliary power units, small truck refrigeration and other products.
The Asian HVAC markets are expected to be flat down, and industrial markets in the Asia remain under pressure. Golf and utility vehicle markets are generally flat to slightly up.
All the growth forecasts shown are on an organic basis. We're forecasting low single-digit growth in commercial HVAC in total, mid-single-digit growth in residential HVAC, which is essentially an all North American business for us, and flat revenues in Transport. 
We expect Air and Industrial products, which includes our compression technologies, Power Tools, Material Handling and fluid management SBUs to be down low single digits, and we expect Club Car to be up low single digits. 
Please go to Slide 16. Aggregating those market backdrops, we expect our reported revenues for full year 2016 to be flat, up 2% versus 2015. Overall, foreign exchange will be a headwind of about 2 percentage points as we've now completed a full year of Cameron centrifugal compressor division and our results organic revenue growth and excluding FX are the same in this forecast.
Translating that to the segments, we expect Climate revenues to be up 1% to 3% on a reported basis and 3% to 5% excluding currency. The Industrial segment revenues are forecast to be down in the range of 2% to 4% on a reported basis and down 1% to up 1%, excluding foreign exchange. Industrial also has a higher proportion of revenues outside of the U.S. than Climate. So Industrial experiences more impact from FX as compared to Climate, 3 points adverse impact versus 2 points in Climate. 
For operating margins, we're excluding restructuring cost to get to adjusted margins. We expect Climate adjusted operating margins to be in the range of 13.25% to 13.75%. We expect Industrial adjusted margins to be in the range of 13% to 13.75%. And for the enterprise, we expect adjusted operating margins of 11.5% to 12% and EBITDA margins of 14.2% to 14.7%. Operating leverage would be about 60% all in and about 30%, excluding currency. Margin expansion would be 10 to 60 basis points on an adjusted basis. 
Please go to Slide 17. Transitioning to earnings, the reported earnings per share range is estimated to be $3.75 to $3.95. Excluding restructuring, the range is $3.80 to $4, an increase of 2% to 7% versus 2015.  As a note, for 2016, FX is a headwind of about 2% to revenue and $0.19 to earnings. For this forecast, we reflected consensus foreign exchange rate forecast. So for example, the euro average rate for the year is $1.03, but for the first quarter the euro forecast rate is $1.06. This reflects a full year tax rate of 24% to 25% and an average diluted share count of 260 million shares for the full year. 
As Sue explained, for ease of modeling, we allocated all excess cash to share buyback and phased it to the back half of the year when we turn cash flow positive. This does not to necessarily mean that this will be the actual deployment for the cash, but it was done to simplify modeling. 
The EPS outlook does not include the impact of divestiture of our stake in Hussmann, and we expect that transaction to close April 1 and result in a gain of approximately $400 million, which will be recorded in other income in the second quarter. We'll update our guidance in April to reflect the closing, but we'll address out the gain for comparability. 
First quarter 2016 revenues are forecast to be flat to 2% on a reported basis and 3% to 5%, excluding currency. Reported first quarter earnings per share are forecast to be $0.28 to $0.33. Adding back $0.05 of restructuring will get to an adjusted basis the EPS range of $0.33 to $0.38. There are EPS bridges in the appendix for both the full year and the first quarter's guidance. 
For the full year 2016, we expect to generate adjusted free cash flow, which excludes restructuring cash and proceeds from Hussmann, of $950 million to $1 billion. As we said earlier, we increased the dividend last week and have already completed $250 million in share repurchases, which will offset more than offset dilution from equity issuances. We had $143 million of commercial paper at year-end. And after paying that down, it leaves about $675 million of cash for deployment that we utilize for the additional share repurchase or towards M&A. 
We continue to build a pipeline of acquisition opportunities related to our core businesses, and we weight those risk-adjusted opportunities against buyback in terms of returns and shareholder value. 
In closing, we're pleased to have delivered on a solid year, with top quartile performance in revenue and earnings growth. Our strategies for growth and operational excellence have delivered a multiyear trend of excellent operating leverage, margin and earnings improvement. Our focus is to continue to grow earnings and cash flow through further implementation of these strategies. 
We practically work to deliver productivity and make prudent investments for the future. We continue to invest in new products and service offerings, our IT infrastructure and systems as well as further developing our people and our operating capabilities. We continue to execute a consistent, value-maximizing capital allocation program. So I'm proud of the progress we've made and results we've delivered, and I believe we're well positioned in 2016 to again deliver on our commitments. 
With that, Sue and I will be pleased to take your questions."

Our operating results are really going to be in the range of, and this includes the restructuring, negative $0.01 to a positive $0.04. We've got a little bit of lower share count. But when you think about what's happening in the headwinds, the first quarter is going to be part of that currency headwind that we talked about, particularly on the Industrial business. And the revenues we expect in the first quarter and margins for Industrial, we expect to be even lower than where we ended the year. So in other words, we're looking at a low revenue base. We're looking at headwinds from currency. And so I think the first quarter is just going to be tough compares, and then I think we get better as we go through the remainder of the year."

And that's sort of place right now where I think is very productive. It's well utilized. And when we look at ideas around that's coming to 2016, paybacks are in the range of, say, 5 to 8 years, which is just outside the range of what we thought in this environment was doable. That being said, when you look at areas of business, particularly around compression technology, there is restructuring taking place there and largely it's the areas of headcount and things that we can do on a non-qualified way. So tremendous focus on both corporate and cost within each of the businesses. So there is a sort of a drumbeat over time of doing that but it's an effective, efficient -- relatively effective and efficient footprint. One of the things that we find is the better we've gotten that in Lean, that further we've gotten into that, the longer and harder is to get a payback on a closure, which is a good thing. So we remain, I think, open-minded, Steve. If, in fact, things deteriorated further, if, in fact, we saw an opportunity, we certainly will look at that. We'll keep an open mind on that. But rather than putting a big placeholder out there with no specifics, we wanted to just keep it to the known actions and the announcements that we made internally inside the company to this point."

So as a backdrop, going into the first half of the year, it feels like we've at least got enough out there for us to see in terms of visibility to see that. Also, we had really good service growth, kind of high single-digit growth in services. Controls was up nearly double digits there. So it feels like we've -- call it a little bit of a lift in terms of institutional markets. Commercial hasn't turned down fully. That's why we're seeing good unitary, although some unitary spills in through K-12 as well. So that continues. And then, as you'd expect just the investments in the service network and service footprint have been good for us. So it's a pretty good backdrop from the fourth quarter going into the first part of the year."

I think it's a point often lost on investors is the amount of margin improvement we get in residential businesses. So good residential growth, it's good for us. It's fine. On the Transport side, if you look at Transport North America trailer, the industry being down 10%, our guidance embeds more of a 15% decline. We look at APUs. We had good growth in the year. We had 16% growth in APUs over the full year. We had good growth in bookings in the fourth quarter. We've got a strategy for higher attachment rate to non-refrigerated trailers, about a 3:1 ratio. If we sell 3 APUs, it's equal to one North American trailer. So there is, between APU and some of the Air businesses and other businesses that we have within TK, the ability to offset that decline. And then I point you back to the fact that European trailer was up nicely. And as that moves up, that's actually even more helpful to North American trailer. So net-net, we're good. Actually, what's down for us pretty big is container. We had a big year last year in container. Container is soft market in general. We're against a tough comp. But container is an area, where, frankly, less container is helpful on the mix. So net-net, we think we can grow margins."

But I think as we think about the push and take between price and direct material inflation, we think all in all it's going to come back to about that the same 30 to 40 basis points range in 2016 as what we saw. One of the other points, and you didn't ask this, but I think it's relevant when we're having the discussion about price and direct material inflation, when we think about the differences between Climate and the Industrial businesses, the largest pieces of the benefit on material deflation do go to the Climate business. There is some, and there's still is a positive spread in the Industrial businesses, but it's much less than what you would see in Climate. And so as you're trying to come year-over-year, you also don't have that nice benefit coming out of commodities and the direct material deflation on the Industrial side."

So we were probably a little conservative on the 24% to 25% effective tax rate guidance for 2016.

But what it really doesn't do is it doesn't really affect the overall effective tax rate. So what you have to do in order to make that tax rate move is you have to continue to refine your strategy. Now having all of those issues off the table certainly does give you an opportunity, and we are certainly involved in looking at that strategy in terms of the different areas that we're looking at. So we have a good trading hub that is in Europe. We're looking at Asia and Panama for trading hubs. We're looking at all of our intercompany debt and making sure that we're as balanced as we go into 2016 as we would like to be. But we do also have a slight headwind, if you will, on tax rates. And that is when you look around the globe and you think about our revenue growth in 2016, the areas that are growing the most are in North America, which does pressure the tax rate. So there's a long way around saying, we absolutely have a goal of looking at every opportunity to bring that rate down. We're still going to be just as conscientious about the items we take on as we've always been. But I do think we'll see some opportunities in 2016. We'll continue to work that strategy and continue to communicate. But like I say, it's also a good thing that we have a little pressure on that rate coming out of the North America growth."

There are some investments that we need to continue to make around our IT infrastructure, around cybersecurity, and we also have on the corporate aside. So we talked about pension in total for Ingersoll Rand being about flat year-over-year. However, with a lot of puts and takes in element of pension, pension is a little higher on the corporate side in 2016. So it's not just rounding, it's not just putting things back in, but I'll also tell you that we're going to be very conscientious about what that spend is.

It's a little bit tough to compare comps against competition, particularly denominated in different currencies. But we did fairly well there on the product and services side of the business. So that's a great example. I would say that where we try to leverage in the gross margin range of 25% and 30%, we're certainly looking to deleverage within the gross margin range of not to exceed to 25% to 30%. So that would be sort of the essence of that. It could depend a bit on the business. I mean, TK has fundamentally, I think, more opportunity. It doesn't leverage up nearly as high as people think. It doesn't deleverage nearly as poorly as people think largely because the distribution base of that business is independent. And so we're really turning on and off sort of factory production, and we've got very flexible plants and labor forces that work with us on that.

Again, no excuses, the decrementals need to be at the same level as the incrementals when we go forward. But Industrial has an outsized impact from foreign exchange. So over 50% of their revenues are impacted or they're non-U.S. and are impacted by foreign exchange. So you have that headwind going against them. We do have the amortization from the accounting on the acquisition of Cameron, again took that on -- we took that on, but it does impact what we're looking at in 2015. And then, as I pointed out earlier, when you think about -- they don't get the benefit or the big benefit coming out of direct material deflation with commodity prices because that's just not how that segment works. The Air business gets benefit out of some of that, but the other businesses within the segment do not. And so when I say you've got outsized foreign exchange, less direct material deflation, and we put an acquisition in there with some additional amortization.

And so let's talk about the ECC business for just a little bit. And so I think the overarching point that we wanted to make when we were talking about that business is that it was EBITDA and EPS accretive, which is where we had hoped to go. However, I would say that as you look at that business from the time that we looked at the acquisition until we completed 2015, I would say that, that road map, just like we talked about with the entire company, has a few different components. So if you think about the revenue side of that business, you certainly have the 4 components of the business with the plant air side of the business being really hit by the weakened Industrial market. And so that definitely, that book in term business differently took a downturn in 2015. You also have tough, tough markets with oil prices and so on the processed gas side and on the engineered air side, you've got fewer projects, you've got same number of competitors. And so you've got some tough markets there and then you've got an aftermarket, which is an opportunity. Having said all of that, what we did with the business in 2015 with a top line that wasn't perhaps as strong as what we wanted is, we accelerated some of the synergies in the business and, in fact, overdrove the operating synergies, not revenue synergies, but the operating synergies in the business, and we're going to continue to do that. So the point wasn't that it's operating exactly as we would have called it a year ago, but I think as we look to the business and with what we were going to do with it, we ended up with a pretty good result on the acquisition."

Good morning, and thanks for joining us on today's call. This morning, I'll spend a few minutes recapping our full year 2015 results and our progress on the transformation we've been working on in the company since 2010. Then, Sue wi",890,"Great. Thanks, Janet. Good morning, and thanks for joining us on today's call. This morning, I'll spend a few minutes recapping our full year 2015 results and our progress on the transformation we've been working on in the company since 2010. Then, Sue will take you through the fourth quarter results, and I'll end up with our outlook for 2016 before we open it up to your questions. 
So starting with full year 2015. It was a year that I could characterize best by one word, and that word is volatility: volatility in energy markets, in foreign exchange rates, in industrial markets, in emerging markets and, of course, in the stock market. During this period of volatility, while the individual pieces might not each have ended exactly how we had forecast some 12 months ago, our headlines results were essentially right in the forecast we gave you a year ago. 
The 2015 forecast we gave you a year ago was for 4% to 5% organic growth, and we came in at 5%. Our adjusted EPS forecast was a midpoint of $3.74 or actuals $3.73. that performance was significantly more FX headwind. We had included a $0.17 earnings headwind in currency and guidance and ended up being over $0.30. Our free cash flow forecast was $950 million to $1 billion, and we delivered $985 million. 
We focused on executing within our business operating system and on the things that we can control, while doing our best to anticipate the things that we couldn't control, and we made adjustments accordingly. 
2015 demonstrated continued progress in the implementation of our multiyear strategy for growth, operational excellence and shareholder value. We invested in core businesses, matured in key strategic capabilities and delivered on our financial commitments, all while navigating shifts and challenges in global markets. 
We have consistently delivered on our commitments, even in volatile times, and we hope that you agree that there are very few companies in your coverage that have done this. I'm very proud of our team and the great people in our company that delivered another solid year. 
If I look back over a longer horizon over the last, say, 24 months, it's a similar story. With the exception of a single quarter almost 5 years ago, we met or exceeded our earnings commitments regardless of market conditions. 
For the year, our organic revenues, which excludes OpEx and acquisitions, were up 5%. Markets were uneven around the globe. Growth in North America was in the mid-single digits, while revenues overseas, taken collectively, increased low single digits. 
Adjusted earnings per share were $3.73, a year-over-year increase of 12%. Within our diversified industrial peer group, we achieved top quartile performance in EPS growth again in 2015. We grew adjusted operating margins 40 basis points in 2015. Our organic operating leverage, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange and M&A, was 35%, which is above our target range of 25% to 30%. And Climate margins improved 60 basis points. 
We generated $985 million of cash flow. Our capital allocation strategy remains focused on maximizing shareholder value, and it's consistent with our overall financial strategy. We continued to increase our dividend, with a 16% increase in 2015, and we announced an additional 10% increase in the dividend last week. 
We repurchased 4.4 million shares for $250 million in 2015, and more recently, we took advantage of some of the volatility in the stock market and accelerated our share repurchases this year, repurchasing 4.9 million shares for $250 million in January of this year. We finalized an agreement with the IRS for the years 2002 through 2011. In December, we announced an agreement to sell our remaining stake in Hussmann, and we expect that to close in April. Our performance in 2015 gives further conviction to our strategy and positions us well as we go into a challenging global economic backdrop in 2016. 
Please go to Slide 4. We delivered steady improvements in operating margins. Shown here are the last 5 years where operating margins were up 270 basis points since 2011, despite tough years in Industrial in 2014 and 2015. During this same period, our adjusted operating leverage has averaged over 35%. 
Please go to Slide 5. This chart walks through the change in operating margin from 2014 of 10.9% to 2015, which was 11%. This chart has shown on a reported basis. So it includes restructuring, inventory step-up costs, which were excluded from adjusted margins.
We had 20 basis points of higher restructuring year-over-year and also had a 20 basis point impact inventory step-up on acquisitions. Adjusted margins, which exclude those items, expanded 40 basis points from 11% to 11.4%. 
The 40 basis points of margin expansion was delivered from the combination of organic growth, maintaining a positive gap between pricing and material inflation through value pricing and pricing analytics and productivity from strategic sourcing, implementing our Lean operating system and overhead cost discipline together outpacing other inflation. 
Foreign exchange was a drag to margin of 50 basis points. We continued to invest in new products, IT infrastructure and systems and service and sales footprint to underpin the future growth of the business, and those collectively were 30 basis point investment year-over-year. 
So now, Sue will take you through the fourth quarter, and I'll come back to take you through 2016's outlook."

Residential and commercial HVAC organic revenues were each up 5-plus percent. Adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $0.94, up 15% versus last year.
Consistent with Mike's commentary, for the full year, the fourth quarter was in line with our earnings guidance. A slightly lower tax rate was offset by slightly higher compensation and benefit costs. Our adjusted operating margins were up 50 basis points. Operating leverage in the quarter was excellent at 34% on an adjusted basis and 55% on an organic basis. 
Climate margins increased 70 basis points in the quarter. Adjusted Industrial margins were down 200 basis points but were only slightly down on 2% lower organic revenues, when excluding the impact of currency and a rolling in the first year of Cameron Centrifugal operating income and amortization. 
Finally, as Mike mentioned, given the impending closing of the sale of our Hussmann stake expected on April 1 and to take advantage of market volatility, we repurchased 4.9 million shares in January 2016 for $250 million. 
Please go to Slide 7. Orders for the fourth quarter of 2015 were up 1% on a reported basis and up 4%, excluding currency. Organic orders were up 2%.
Climate orders were up 5% organically. Organic global commercial HVAC bookings were up low single digits, with a high single-digit increase in North America and declines in Asia and Europe. 
Organic transport orders were up low single digits with increases in global trailer, truck and auxiliary power units, partially offset by lower marine container orders. Orders in the Industrial segment were down 4% on a reported basis and down 7% organically. We saw high single-digit order decline in Air and Industrial products and a mid-single-digit increase in Club Car. 
Please go to Slide 8. Here's a look at the revenue trends by segment and region. The top half of the chart shows revenue change for each segment. For the total company, fourth quarter revenues were up 3% versus last year on a reported basis and also up 3% on an organic basis. 
Climate revenues increased 2% on a reported basis and 5% on an organic basis. Organic commercial HVAC revenues were up mid-single digits with increases in all major geographic regions. Residential HVAC revenues were up mid-single digits. 
Organic transport revenues were down low single digits, as higher truck and trailer revenues were more than offset by lower revenues in marine and APUs. Industrial revenues were up 5% on a reported basis and down 2% organically. Air and Industrial products organic revenues were down low single digits, and Club Car was up slightly. 
The bottom chart shows revenue change on a geographic basis as reported and on an organic basis. Organic revenues were up 3% in the Americas, up 2% in EMEA and Asia was up 9% with strong growth outside of China. 
Please go to Slide 9. Operating margin on a reported basis was up 10 basis points from fourth quarter 2014 to fourth quarter of 2015. We've spiked out the restructure impact to get you to adjusted margins as well. Adjusted margins increased 50 basis points from 10.8% to 11.3%. 
Volume, mix and foreign exchange collectively reflect with 40 basis points of positive margin from volume and mix being offset by foreign exchange. Net pricing versus direct material inflation was favorable by 30 basis points, driven by commodity deflation. Productivity versus other inflation was positive 80 basis points, driven by strong productivity in the quarter. Year-over-year investments and other items reduced margins by 100 basis points. 
In the box, you can see that it was comprised of 20 basis points from investments, 50 basis points from higher restructuring costs and 30 basis points from acquisitions. In the gray box at the top of the page, overall leverage on an adjusted basis was 34% and if calculated on an organic basis, which excludes foreign exchange and acquisitions, was 55%. 
Now please go to Slide 10. Total fourth quarter revenues for the Climate segment were $2.5 billion. That is up 2% versus last year on a reported basis and up 5%, excluding currency. Acquisitions in Climate do not change that rounding. So organic revenue is also up 5%. 
Organic commercial HVAC fourth quarter revenues were up mid-single digits and were up in all geographic regions. North America was up mid-single digits, while EMEA and Latin America were both up low single digits. Asia was up low-teens. The growth in Asia was led by some large HVAC projects in Southeast Asia. Commercial HVAC equipment organic revenues were up low single digits, while HVAC parts, services and solutions revenue were up high single digits versus prior year. 
Thermo King organic revenues were down low single digits, with truck, trailer revenue up high single digits with growth in both North America and Europe. Marine and APU revenues declined against difficult comparisons to the fourth quarter of last year. Residential HVAC revenues were up mid-single digits versus last year. 
The adjusted operating margin for Climate was 12.9% in the quarter, 70 basis points higher than fourth quarter of 2014 due to volume and productivity, partially offset by currency and other inflation. Climate's operating leverage was over 50% in the quarter. 
Now please go to Slide 11. Fourth quarter revenues for the Industrial segment were $834 million, up 5% on a reported basis but down 2% on an organic basis.
Compression technologies and services, Power Tools, fluid management and Material Handling organic revenues were down low single digits versus last year. Organic revenues in the Americas were down high single digits, while revenues in EMEA were down low single digits and were up high single digits in Asia due to some large project deliveries. 
Club Car revenues, excluding foreign exchange, were up slightly versus prior year. Industrial's adjusted operating margin of 13.8% was down 200 basis points compared with last year. When excluding the impact of acquisitions and currency, adjusted margins were down 20 basis points year-over-year on lower over organic revenues. 
The Engineered Centrifugal Compressor business, or ECC, which we purchased from Cameron in January of 2015, executed well and came in essentially on forecast in the fourth quarter. In 2015, revenues were impacted by weakened industrial markets; however, synergies were above our acquisition model, and EBITDA and cash EPS were both accretive. 
Please go to Slide 12. For the full year, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 4.2%. We have strong collections in the quarter with our DSO improving over the prior year. Going forward, we expect working capital to be in the 4% range. 
Now go to Slide 13, please. Adjusted cash flow generation was excellent at $985 million in 2015. Cash conversion, as a percent of adjusted net earnings, was 101% for the year. As you can see, when we look at 2016, we expect adjusted free cash flow in the range of $950 million to $1 billion. That range excludes the proceeds from the sale of our stake in Hussmann. Our balance sheet remains very strong. We have no debt maturities until 2018.
Please go to Slide 14. Over the last 5 years, we've returned over $6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We employ dynamic model for capital allocation, which adjusts based on market conditions to put our strong free cash flow to the right use for shareholder value. Last week, we announced a 10% increase to our dividend. Our dividend increases over the last 5 years has been a 24% CAGR. Our payout ratio is in line with peers. 
We've repurchased 103 million shares in the past 5 years from 2011 to 2015. As we said earlier, for 2016, we anticipated some market volatility in January, and were able to accelerate our minimum share repurchase of $250 million to the beginning of the year. We've repurchased 4.9 million shares in January. To remind you, our free cash flow generation is heavily weighted to the second half due to the seasonality of our businesses, namely the HVAC businesses, so our normal timing for share repurchases would have been in second half. But given we have the proceeds from the sale of our Hussmann stake coming in April, we thought it was opportunistic and still within our leverage range to accelerate the minimum repurchase and get that done earlier in the year.
For the balance of 2016, we will use the same approach as the last couple of years, applying a toggle switch between value-accretive acquisitions and share repurchases, based upon relative valuations and risk-adjusted returns. We will apply our same decision-making framework to the situation at that time and leave the door open to pivot to share repurchase or M&A as it makes best sense for our shareholders. For ease of modeling purposes, you'll see that for the 2016 share count, we've applied excess cash to repurchases in the second half of 2016 as we turn cash flow positive. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Mike to take you through 2016 guidance."
280944,322182516,929558,"Ingersoll-Rand Plc, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2016",2016-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Trane Technologies plc","Executives","Great. Thanks, Sue. And please go to Slide 15.

As always our intention is to give you our best view of what we're seeing in our end markets sitting here today and how that translates to our revenue outlook for 2016. We've broken it down by major end markets and geographies. And as you can see by the variation of colors and symbols, our end markets are seeing a wide variation in trends. 
North American commercial HVAC and residential HVAC, as well as transport and commercial HVAC markets in Europe are generally positive while global industrial markets remain weak. Transport markets in the Americas will be down -- flat to down, as lower trailer volumes will be largely offset by higher auxiliary power units, small truck refrigeration and other products.
The Asian HVAC markets are expected to be flat down, and industrial markets in the Asia remain under pressure. Golf and utility vehicle markets are generally flat to slightly up.
All the growth forecasts shown are on an organic basis. We're forecasting low single-digit growth in commercial HVAC in total, mid-single-digit growth in residential HVAC, which is essentially an all North American business for us, and flat revenues in Transport. 
We expect Air and Industrial products, which includes our compression technologies, Power Tools, Material Handling and fluid management SBUs to be down low single digits, and we expect Club Car to be up low single digits. 
Please go to Slide 16. Aggregating those market backdrops, we expect our reported revenues for full year 2016 to be flat, up 2% versus 2015. Overall, foreign exchange will be a headwind of about 2 percentage points as we've now completed a full year of Cameron centrifugal compressor division and our results organic revenue growth and excluding FX are the same in this forecast.
Translating that to the segments, we expect Climate revenues to be up 1% to 3% on a reported basis and 3% to 5% excluding currency. The Industrial segment revenues are forecast to be down in the range of 2% to 4% on a reported basis and down 1% to up 1%, excluding foreign exchange. Industrial also has a higher proportion of revenues outside of the U.S. than Climate. So Industrial experiences more impact from FX as compared to Climate, 3 points adverse impact versus 2 points in Climate. 
For operating margins, we're excluding restructuring cost to get to adjusted margins. We expect Climate adjusted operating margins to be in the range of 13.25% to 13.75%. We expect Industrial adjusted margins to be in the range of 13% to 13.75%. And for the enterprise, we expect adjusted operating margins of 11.5% to 12% and EBITDA margins of 14.2% to 14.7%. Operating leverage would be about 60% all in and about 30%, excluding currency. Margin expansion would be 10 to 60 basis points on an adjusted basis. 
Please go to Slide 17. Transitioning to earnings, the reported earnings per share range is estimated to be $3.75 to $3.95. Excluding restructuring, the range is $3.80 to $4, an increase of 2% to 7% versus 2015.  As a note, for 2016, FX is a headwind of about 2% to revenue and $0.19 to earnings. For this forecast, we reflected consensus foreign exchange rate forecast. So for example, the euro average rate for the year is $1.03, but for the first quarter the euro forecast rate is $1.06. This reflects a full year tax rate of 24% to 25% and an average diluted share count of 260 million shares for the full year. 
As Sue explained, for ease of modeling, we allocated all excess cash to share buyback and phased it to the back half of the year when we turn cash flow positive. This does not to necessarily mean that this will be the actual deployment for the cash, but it was done to simplify modeling. 
The EPS outlook does not include the impact of divestiture of our stake in Hussmann, and we expect that transaction to close April 1 and result in a gain of approximately $400 million, which will be recorded in other income in the second quarter. We'll update our guidance in April to reflect the closing, but we'll adjust out the gain for comparability. 
First quarter 2016 revenues are forecast to be flat to 2% on a reported basis and 3% to 5%, excluding currency. Reported first quarter earnings per share are forecast to be $0.28 to $0.33. Adding back $0.05 of restructuring will get to an adjusted basis the EPS range of $0.33 to $0.38. There are EPS bridges in the appendix for both the full year and the first quarter's guidance. 
For the full year 2016, we expect to generate adjusted free cash flow, which excludes restructuring cash and proceeds from Hussmann, of $950 million to $1 billion. As we said earlier, we increased the dividend last week and have already completed $250 million in share repurchases, which will offset more than offset dilution from equity issuances. We had $143 million of commercial paper at year-end. And after paying that down, it leaves about $675 million of cash for deployment that we utilize for the additional share repurchase or towards M&A. 
We continue to build a pipeline of acquisition opportunities related to our core businesses, and we weigh those risk-adjusted opportunities against buyback in terms of returns and shareholder value. 
In closing, we're pleased to have delivered on a solid year, with top quartile performance in revenue and earnings growth. Our strategies for growth and operational excellence have delivered a multiyear trend of excellent operating leverage, margin and earnings improvement. Our focus is to continue to grow earnings and cash flow through further implementation of these strategies. 
We practically work to deliver productivity and make prudent investments for the future. We continue to invest in new products and service offerings, our IT infrastructure and systems as well as further developing our people and our operating capabilities. We continue to execute a consistent, value-maximizing capital allocation program. So I'm proud of the progress we've made and results we've delivered, and I believe we're well positioned in 2016 to again deliver on our commitments. 
With that, Sue and I will be pleased to take your questions."

Our operating results are really going to be in the range of, and this includes the restructuring, negative $0.01 to a positive $0.04. We've got a little bit of lower share count. But when you think about what's happening in the headwinds, the first quarter is going to be part of that currency headwind that we talked about, particularly on the Industrial business. And the revenues we expect in the first quarter and margins for Industrial, we expect to be even lower than where we ended the year. So in other words, we're looking at a low revenue base. We're looking at headwinds from currency. And so I think the first quarter is just going to be tough compares, and then I think we get better as we go through the remainder of the year."

And that's at a place right now where I think is very productive. It's well utilized. And when we look at ideas around that's coming to 2016, paybacks are in the range of, say, 5 to 8 years, which is just outside the range of what we thought in this environment was doable. That being said, when you look at areas of business, particularly around compression technology, there is restructuring taking place there and largely it's the areas of headcount and things that we can do on a non-qualified way. So tremendous focus on both corporate and costs within each of the businesses. So there is a sort of a drumbeat over time of doing that but it's an effective, efficient -- relatively effective and efficient footprint. One of the things that we find is the better we've gotten that in Lean, that further we've gotten into that, the longer and harder is to get a payback on a closure, which is a good thing. So we remain, I think, open-minded, Steve. If, in fact, things deteriorated further, if, in fact, we saw an opportunity, we certainly will look at that. We'll keep an open mind on that. But rather than putting a big placeholder out there with no specifics, we wanted to just keep it to the known actions and the announcements that we made internally inside the company to this point."

That's why we're seeing good unitary, although some unitary spills in through K-12 as well. So that continues. And then, as you'd expect just the investments in the service network and service footprint have been good for us. So it's a pretty good backdrop from the fourth quarter going into the first part of the year."

I think it's a point often lost on investors is the amount of margin improvement we had in residential businesses. So good residential growth, it's good for us. It's fine. On the Transport side, if you look at Transport North America trailer, the industry being down 10%, our guidance embeds more of a 15% decline. We look at APUs. We had good growth in the year. We had 16% growth in APUs over the full year. We had good growth in bookings in the fourth quarter. We've got a strategy for a higher attachment rate to non-refrigerated trailers, about a 3:1 ratio. If we sell 3 APUs, it's equal to one North American trailer. So there is, between APU and some of the Air businesses and other businesses that we have within TK, the ability to offset that decline. And then I point you back to the fact that European trailer was up nicely. And as that moves up, that's actually even more helpful to North American trailer. So net-net, we're good. Actually, what's down for us pretty big is container. We had a big year last year in container. Container is soft market in general. We're against a tough comp. But container is an area, where, frankly, less container is helpful on the mix. So net-net, we think we can grow margins."

But I think as we think about the push and take between price and direct material inflation, we think all in all it's going to come back to about that the same 30 to 40 basis points range in 2016 as what we saw. One of the other points, and you didn't ask this, but I think it's relevant when we're having the discussion about price and direct material inflation, when we think about the differences between Climate and the Industrial businesses, the largest pieces of the benefit on material deflation do go to the Climate business. There is some, and there's still is a positive spread in the Industrial businesses, but it's much less than what you would see in Climate. And so as you're trying to come year-over-year, you also don't have that nice benefit coming out of commodities and the direct material deflation on the Industrial side."

But what it really doesn't do is it doesn't really affect the overall effective tax rate. So what you have to do in order to make that tax rate move is you have to continue to refine your strategy. Now having all of those issues off the table certainly does give you an opportunity, and we are certainly involved in looking at that strategy in terms of the different areas that we're looking at. So we have a good trading hub that is in Europe. We're looking at Asia and Panama for trading hubs. We're looking at all of our intercompany debt and making sure that we're as balanced as we go into 2016 as we would like to be. But we do also have a slight headwind, if you will, on tax rates. And that is when you look around the globe and you think about our revenue growth in 2016, the areas that are growing the most are in North America, which does pressure the tax rate. So that's a long way around saying, we absolutely have a goal of looking at every opportunity to bring that rate down. We're still going to be just as conscientious about the items we take on as we've always been. But I do think we'll see some opportunities in 2016. We'll continue to work that strategy and continue to communicate. But like I say, it's also a good thing that we have a little pressure on that rate coming out of the North America growth."

There are some investments that we need to continue to make around our IT infrastructure, around cybersecurity, and we also have on the corporate aside. So we talked about pension in total for Ingersoll Rand being about flat year-over-year. However, with a lot of puts and takes in elements of pension, pension is a little higher on the corporate side in 2016. So it's not just rounding, it's not just putting things back in, but I'll also tell you that we're going to be very conscientious about what that spend is. And looking at not getting ahead of ourselves on any spend before we see what's going to happen in the different markets.

That was extraordinary effort by that team to really pull all the stops on productivity and discretionary spending, and really to win in the marketplace. It's a little bit tough to compare comps against competition, particularly denominated in different currencies. But we did fairly well there on the product and services side of the business. So that's a great example. I would say that where we try to leverage in the gross margin range of 25% and 30%, we're certainly looking to deleverage within the gross margin range of not to exceed to 25% to 30%. So that would be sort of the essence of that. It could depend a bit on the business. I mean, TK has fundamentally, I think, more opportunity. It doesn't leverage up nearly as high as people think. It doesn't deleverage nearly as poorly as people think largely because the distribution base of that business is independent. And so we're really turning on and off sort of factory production, and we've got very flexible plants and labor forces that work with us on that. So a great example is TK, where we would look to certainly work inside of normal margins in that business."

Again, no excuses, the decrementals need to be at the same level as the incrementals when we go forward. But Industrial has an outsized impact from foreign exchange. So over 50% of their revenues are impacted or they're non-U.S. and are impacted by foreign exchange. So you have that headwind going against them. We do have the amortization from the accounting on the acquisition of Cameron, again took that on -- knew we took that on, but it does impact what we're looking at in 2015. And then, as I pointed out earlier, when you think about -- they don't get the benefit or the big benefit coming out of direct material deflation with commodity prices because that's just not how that segment works. The Air business gets benefit out of some of that, but the other businesses within the segment do not. And so when I say you've got outsized foreign exchange, less direct material deflation, and we put an acquisition in there with some additional amortization.

And so let's talk about the ECC business for just a little bit. And so I think the overarching point that we wanted to make when we were talking about that business is that it was EBITDA and EPS accretive, which is where we had hoped to go. However, I would say that as you look at that business from the time that we looked at the acquisition until we completed 2015, I would say that, that road map, just like we talked about with the entire company, has a few different components. So if you think about the revenue side of that business, you certainly have the 4 components of the business with the plant air side of the business being really hit by the weakened Industrial market. And so that definitely, that book in term business differently took a downturn in 2015. You also have tough, tough markets with oil prices and so on the processed gas side and on the engineered air side, you've got fewer projects, you've got same number of competitors. And so you've got some tough markets there and then you've got an aftermarket, which is an opportunity. Having said all of that, what we did with the business in 2015 with a top line that wasn't perhaps as strong as what we wanted is, we accelerated some of the synergies in the business and, in fact, overdrove the operating synergies, not revenue synergies, but the operating synergies in the business, and we're going to continue to do that.

The quarter really demonstrated the consistency we're seeing in our strategy, which is to deliver sustainable, profitable growth and I'd highlight a few areas here. 
First, we're leading in a markets in the innovation and development of energy-efficient, reliable and sustainable products and services. Second, we're deepening the penetration, the maturity of our operating system, and we're delivering Operational Excellence across our businesses. Third, we're maintaining a disciplined and dynamic approach to capital allocation. And finally, as I've said before, critical to any sustained culture transformation, our employees are engaged [indiscernible] increase across the company, employees [indiscernible] Ingersoll Rand as a great place to work, which leads to better customer experience and that ultimately delivers shareholder value.
Our performance in the first quarter gives us confidence to raise our full year guidance, essentially flowing through the first quarter operational [indiscernible]. Now, this morning, I'm going to give you an overview what we're seeing and our end markets across the globe and use the opportunity to talk a bit about how we're performing against this market backdrop, give you some color on how we're progressing for the year. I thought it'll be useful to highlight where our performance maps, specifically to our overall strategy, and I'm going to turn it over to Sue and she'll take you through the quarter and our revised guidance for the remainder of the year. 
So over the past 16 weeks, I've spent the majority of my time on the road with leaders across the company and during that time, I've met with customers from the many of our business units across vertical markets and regions of the world. I've spent considerable time with our customer-facing employees with service technicians, sales teams. And as always, I've spent time inside our operations talking with the people who are building and engineering our products to gain perspective on the maturity and momentum in our operating system and I've witnessed good momentum in the deployment of our operating system and remain confident that there is still long runway of opportunity in front of us. 
With that, let's go to Slide 4. I'm going to note that all my comments around an organic basis, so they're going to exclude currency and acquisitions. Now, I'll turn, first, to the North American Climate segment where our business remains strong overall and we expect this momentum to continue for the balance of the year. 
In commercial HVAC, recent put in place data continues to support mid-single-digit growth and we believe this should continue through at least 2017. We continue to see strong growth in the retail and office markets. Within the institutional markets, education and government markets are also strong. We saw a low-teens revenue growth in the quarter, coupled with high single-digit bookings growth. 
I want to point out, too, that we expect to see a record for quarter 2 with commercial HVAC North American bookings, which should be up approximately 25% over quarter 2 as a result of some large institutional project awards. We expect to continue to outperform the overall market for the balance of the year. 
Additionally, we're executing well on the volume and saw excellent operating leverage in the quarter. Growth here is a direct reflection of the constant investment we over the past years. And we're seeing grow the specifically in the areas where we have invested whether in product growth teams, products or channel. 
As in 2015, we are beginning quarter 1 of '16 with double-digit growth in our controls and Service business. With over 4,300 companies direct service mechanics and technicians, we believe we are now the largest provider of mechanical HVAC service to commercial customers of the world. Additionally, when we breakout our critical growth programs from the base business, we are seeing mid-teens growth in these programs.
Overall execution has been excellent with clear discipline the management team is running the business through our operating system. Like commercial, our residential HVAC North American business is likely to continue to outperform the market as well. We're proud of this performance and what's ahead for this business.
I'm occasionally asked, what do investors misunderstand about Ingersoll Rand and in reading some of the sell side reports, I think there is some about the success we've had in the residential HVAC business and so I want to add some of the facts for you.
According to data, we have increased share each quarter, over the past 6 quarters, including the first quarter of 2016. For all of 2015 and continuing into the quarter 1 of '16, we have a residential HVAC business with mid-teen EBITDA margins, which makes it accretive to the segment and IR as a whole. Quarter 1 brought mid-teen and bookings growth for the second consecutive quarter and mid-single-digit revenue growth in very strong operating leverage. Our market outlook remains positive, we forecast 4% to 5% unit growth for the industry and we anticipate our revenue growth to be in the high single-digits range for the year.
The residential team has done an outstanding job implementing our operating system across its full footprint. The team is running the entire business in a full product growth value stream and showing in the execution. And strategically, we've executed well on our complete product refresh, repositioning f our channel strategies. And in our connected home strategy, where we have a business platform, robust diagnostic capabilities and nearly 200,000 Nexia enrollments to date. Additionally, connected home is a key driver of our residential controls business, which has more than doubled since 2011 and continues to grow at around 25% annually.
Shifting to North American transport refrigeration markets. As usual, the management team did a great job in the quarter and managed to improve the margins with high operating leverage. North America continues to hold up well, especially in the truck and trailer market. Our current view of truck and trailer has improved from our original view of the market from earlier this year. 
ACC raised its trailer units forecast to 47,000 units, which is up about 1% versus last year, their prior forecast was for the market to be down 10%.
We view this market data as being a bit aggressive but we have raised our own forecast for approximately 45,000 units. And you may recall that our own prior forecast was 39,000 trailer units, so even though we do expect the market to be down over the record performance last year, our view has improved from when we spoke in February.
Our truck refrigeration business is also solid in the overall market for Class 3 to 7 trucks is actually moderate growth. And we continue to pursue growth strategies in rail, bus and auxiliary power units. We continue to balance the North American business into additional vertical markets.
As we look toward of the HVAC and transport refrigeration markets in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, we plan to continue to outperform the market in the year ahead with additional new product and service launches planned in the year and excellent management teams executing on the ground delivering good margin expansion and cash conversion growth. 
We continue to do very well in Europe with organic bookings in the high single digits against the flattish market backdrop. We're seeing excellent uptake of a new product introductions and like North America, the Service business also grew at a double-digit rate.
I visited our FRIGOBLOCK team and operations a few weeks ago, the progress made and the adoption of our operating system was absolutely amazing. With our FRIGOBLOCK acquisition, we've taken a step forward to integrating hybrid electric technology into our product road map. The acquisition has been a great success for us.
Middle East markets are certainly softening. We're seeing contraction of the number of building projects planned and we expect this to continue for sometime as lower oil prices are driving an investment pullback. 
Going to Asia Pacific, it's difficult to know if markets have reached an inflection point in China. The data is mixed and is not consistent month-to-month. Our performance does when deviating from the market in a positive way due to investments in products and a focus we put on an increasing our direct channel marketing investment to achieve fuller market coverage, Climate bookings in China were up mid-single digits in quarter 1 and up low teens for Asia-Pacific as a whole.
Our strategic focus on growing the Service business continues to be successful in Asia, too, achieving a mid-teens growth rate in the quarter. 
We're also seeing strong mid-teens bookings growth in transport refrigeration equipment as the market continues to grow and our local engineering and manufacturing teams continue to tune the product to low preferences [indiscernible]. 
Strong growth outside China is being driven by growth in Thailand, India and our performance in Singapore, along with good transport refrigeration growth in Australia. 
So concluding the HVAC and transport refrigeration geographic update, will take us to Latin America where markets remain very volatile with strength in smaller but fast-growing markets in the Dominican Republic in Panama but deteriorating conditions in Brazil, Venezuela, Ecuador and Argentina. Conditions in Mexico remains fundamentally sound. Organic revenue for the region was flat with low-teen increases in HVAC equipment. So we're pleased with our performance in the market. We've expanded margins in a very tough and volatile Latin American marketplace. 
Let's move to Slide 5. In here, we'll look at the end markets where the Industrial segment of our business and I'll start with an overall comments that our compression technologies business bookings revenue were down organically low single digits in the quarter with equipment essentially tracking the overall market but with service up mid-single digits. Again, we're focusing on growing our Service business across the enterprise and executing well on that strategy.
In North America, U.S. manufacturing capacity utilization remains relatively low, hitting 75% last quarter, which is the lowest point over the last 12 quarters. Now [indiscernible] equipment CapEx typical for what we would see for large centrifugal and large rotary air compressors historically rebounds the utilization readings above 80%.
At one visit I had the opportunity to meet with the major customer that's been around for decades, building small-scale LNG plants that range from 50,000 to 500,000 gallons per day. I asked this Ph.D. physicist what the most the leading indicator he would look for in that markets and he responded very simple by saying, it's when the telephone rings. Unfortunately, he did say the phone is beginning to ring as is ours in that area but whether it's small-scale LNG systems or large air compressors, our sense is that even early activity in large machine quoting probably will have little impact on large machine deliveries in 2016. 
To give you a little bit more color on this, from a North American market, you look at compressors between 500 and 400-plus horsepower, the market for small compressors, those between 5 and 15-horsepower is up roughly 10%, but compressors larger than 250-horsepower are down more than 30% in the first 2 industry reported months of the quarter. The smaller compressors are quicker book in turn with inventory restocking occurring in that category. 
We also believe we're seeing some restocking the wholesale channel in our tools fluid management business.
Our Material Handling team ahs done a great job managing their business, essentially holding the business to breakeven on a 50% reduction in revenue. So again, across the business management team, exhibiting cost control and execution discipline on the backdrop continued to declines global market growth.
In Europe, we're seeing increased exports and industrial production across Western Europe. Eastern Europe continues to be fairly weak. And for Asia-Pacific, the current environment continues to experience pricing pressure across the region but we're positively optimistic to see we've reached an inflection point as manufacturing indices signal pockets of improvement in countries, such as China, Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea and China's power consumption has also shown growth first 2 months of the year and India is seeing strong market growth in verticals like textile, pharma and food and beverage.
So rounding the geographic update for Industrial segment, we'll go to Latin America where volatility of the market there across the region, continues to be driven by political instability and this has contributed to reduced investment in key verticals, such as energy, oil and gas, mining and metals, however, other verticals like food and beverage, pharma and textile remain with positive outlook.
So before turning it over to Sue, let me conclude by saying again we had an excellent quarter. We continue to invest in the products, service offerings and footprint of the company, while using our operating systems to deliver well-above industry average results. 
And I'll turn over to you, Sue, to cover the financial review and guidance."

Let's begin with an overview with the first quarter. Q1 was a strong operational quarter across all of our businesses. As you heard in Mike's comment, end markets continues to be strong in Climate and weaker-than-expe",2262,"Thank you, Mike. let's go to Slide 6. Let's begin with an overview with the first quarter. Q1 was a strong operational quarter across all of our businesses. As you heard in Mike's comment, end markets continues to be strong in Climate and weaker-than-expected in Industrial. Our business operating system guided as through good execution in our factories and in our cost centers. Our focus was on good operating results in a low-growth environment. Our result show that we did not let cost get ahead of revenues in the quarter. 
Revenues grew slightly on a reported basis and we're up 2% organically. The Climate segment grew 4% organically. Industrial was down 5%, both on a reported and in organic basis. HVAC revenues grew in each of our Climate businesses, led by commercial and residential in North America. 
Revenue in our Industrial businesses declined in the quarter with tough comparisons to the first quarter of 2015. Large Centrifugal Compressors and other industrial equipment were weaker than our estimates, but Club Car performed as expected with low year-over-year growth.
Our adjusted operating margins grew 140 basis points year-over-year with organic operating leverage of 75%. Adjusted segment margins grew 150 basis points. We showed the alignment between our operating performance and our Q1 results. Our strength was in price, direct material deflation and mix.
Earnings per share grew 32% year-over-year exceeding our prior guidance. In Q1, our capital deployment actions, including -- included repurchasing $250 million of shares and we increased our dividend by 10%. We completed the sale of our remaining interest in Hussmann on April 1, 2016. All-in tax text will appear in the second quarter. 
Please go to Slide 7. I've included a slide to reconcile our Q1 EPS actual results with our prior guidance. As said on a few occasions this morning that our results were the result of good execution and operational performance. Price and direct material deflation were the largest drivers of the margin expansion in Q1. This is an area where everything went right in the quarter, i.e., there was no breakage. Price was positive in both segments and direct material deflation was also very, very positive to our guidance. 
Cost savings and controls were a positive $0.03 for the quarter. Each of our businesses and corporate functions had favorable variances to start the year as we control spending, while we evaluated our end market volatility.
Currency, share count and other income were about $0.01 each. We opportunistically repurchased shares earlier in the year than we would normally and currency was a bit favorable to our guidance range. 
Restructuring was favorable to our guidance by $0.03 for the quarter. This is timing. We have identified projects to execute and continue to work on restructuring projects that have good returns and shorter paybacks and we'll spend the remaining $0.03 throughout the remainder of 2016.
Please go to Slide 8. Orders for the first quarter of 2016 were up 4% organically. Climate orders were up 6% organically. Organic global commercial HVAC bookings were up high single digits, led by high-teens growth in North America unitary and double-digit growth in Asia applied.
We continue to see excellent growth in service controls on trucking with parts with double-digit growth in the quarter. Originally, for commercial HVAC, we saw high single-digit booking increases with a high single-digit increase in North America and Europe; up low teens in Asia; and with declines in both the Middle East and Latin America. Residential bookings were up 17%. 
Organic transport orders were down low single digits with low teens growth in truck and trailer in North America and Europe that were offset by lower container orders. 
Orders in the Industrial Segment were down 5% organically. We saw a low single-digit order decline in compression equipment, a low teens decline in other industrial products and a mid-single digit decline in Club Car. 
Performance in compression technologies was mixed in the first quarter. We had an improvement in small compressors, oil-free and in some of our component businesses like dryers and filters. We also had a small improvement in our aftermarket business. These gains were offset by declines in core industrial compressors and by large centrifugal equipment.
Please go to Slide 9. This slide provides a directional view of our segment performance by region. In our Climate segment, which was up 4% in the first quarter, we saw solid performance in North America and flattish growth across Europe, Latin America and Asia. The Middle East was the only region that declined within the Climate segment. We're seeing a contraction in the number of building projects in the Middle East and we expect this to continue for sometime as lower oil prices are driving an investment pullback.
Our Industrial Segment performance in the first quarter, which was down 5% is representative of the volatility that continues across the globe and the industrial the markets. Strong performance in Mexico contributed to double-digit growth in Latin America. We also saw growth in Europe, while Asia was flat and North America was down high single digits.
Overall our regional performance for the first quarter trends with the end market summary that Mike provided us earlier with a strong start in North America. Industrial Segment performance is expected to trend with markets. We're planning on expanding margins in a down market in the second half of the year through productivity gains and cost control. 
Please go to Slide 10. Operating margin on a reported basis increased 160 basis points from 5.9% to 7.5% from the first quarter 2015 to the first quarter of 2016. Mix was favorable for the quarter at 40 basis points, largely offset by unfavorable volume and currency. Net pricing versus direct material inflation was the largest driver of margin improvement in the quarter, favorable by 160 basis points. Price realization was achieved across both the Climate and Industrial segment, which was higher than expected and commodities remain deflationary.
Productivity versus other inflation was positive 10 basis points driven by ongoing productivity actions, partially offset by other inflation. Year-over-year investments in other items reduced margins by 20 basis points. In the box, you can see that was comprised of 40 basis points from incremental investments, 20 basis points from higher restructuring costs, which were partially offset by 40 basis point improvement related to the absence of acquisition-related step-up costs incurred in 2015.
Overall, reported operating leverage exceeded 100% in the quarter as we expanded margins in a low-growth environment.
Please go to Slide 11. Our Climate businesses had an excellent quarter in Q1. Adjusted segment income and EBITDA margins improved by 280 to 260 basis points to 9.8% and 12.4%, respectively. Increased volumes, favorable mix, price, direct material deflation and productivity offset other inflation and investment spending, the leverage for the Climate segment was 118% for the quarter. Revenues for the quarter were up 4% organically. 
Commercial HVAC organic revenues were up mid-single digits, led by mid-teens unitary shipments in North America and low-teens parts and service revenue in North America. Europe had low single-digit equipment growth and high single-digit in services and trucking and parts. The Middle East had parts and services growth offset by declines in equipment sales.
Residential revenues were up mid-single digits in Q1 with very strong leverage and significant margin improvement. 
Transport organic revenues were down slightly, but this does not tell the whole story for Q1. North America truck and trailer organic revenues were up mid-single digits and European truck and trailer organic revenues were up in the mid-20% range. Marine container organic revenues declined more than 60% in the first quarter, reflecting a soft start at various bus builders for 2016.
Please go to Slide 12. First quarter revenues for the Industrial Segment were $681 million, down 5% on an organic basis. Compression technologies and services organic revenues were down low single digits versus last year. Club Car organic revenues were up slightly versus prior year. Organic revenues in the Americas were down high single digits, while revenues in Europe, Middle East and Africa were down low single digits and were flat in Asia.
Industrial's adjusted operating margin of 9.8% was down 230 basis points compared with last year. Price and direct material deflation were positive. Productivity offset other inflation and volume and mix were unfavorable.
Please go to Slide 13. First quarter free cash flow was negative $46.3 million, was favorable to prior year by $135 million. Strong operating income improvement and improved working capital performance were the primary drivers of the favorability. 
For the quarter, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 6.2%. We had strong collections in the quarter with our days sales outstanding improving 1.3 days over the prior year and days payable outstanding improving 0.7 day. 
Inventories on planned for the quarter and we're well positioned to serve our customers as we enter the heavier volume second quarter. 
Capital expenditures of $40 million are lower than prior year due to capitalization of our ERP systems costs in the first quarter of 2015.
Please go to Slide 14. Capital allocation is a key area of strategy for us. We continue to invest in our businesses and I think you'll agree that our results show the value of our product refresh strategies and our Operational Excellence programs, which are a part of our business operating system. 
We raised annual dividend 10% in early 2016 with a goal of maintaining a dividend payout consistent with our peers. We have an M&A pipeline that reflects our desire to add to our products, technologies and channels as outlined in our strategy. We are focused on building long-term value. We've launched shares to offset benefit program dilution in the first quarter and an average share price of $51.10.
Please go to Slide 15. As always, our intention is to give you the best view of what we're seeing in our end markets sitting here today and how that translates to our revenue guidance for 2016. We've broken it down by major end markets and geographies. As you can see by the variation of colors and symbols, our end markets are seeing a wide variation in trends. We also added a column to show you our current versus prior thinking on organic revenue.
North American commercial HVAC and residential HVAC as well as European transport and commercial HVAC markets are generally positive, while global industrial markets have declined. We are forecasting transferred markets in North America to be flat. Our forecast for North American trailer volumes has shifted from declines of 15% to down slightly for the year. Asian HVAC markets are expected to be flat to down and industrial markets in Asia remain under pressure. Both car markets are the slightly down, offset by increases in the utility vehicle markets. 
Both the growth forecast shown here are on an organic basis. We're forecasting mid-single-digit growth in commercial HVAC in total, high single-digit growth in residential HVAC, which is essentially in all American business for us and a small increase in transport. We expect compression-related products and other equipment to be down high single-digits. We expect Club Car to be up low single-digit. 
Please go to Slide 16. As we're gaining those market backdrops, we expect a reported revenues for the full year for 2016 to be flat to up 2% versus 2015. Overall, foreign exchange will be a headwind of about 2 percentage points. While these revenue outlook do not show a total change, the segment numbers reflect important updates.
We expect Climate revenues to be up 2% to 4% on a reported basis and 4% to 6% organically. For the Industrial segment, revenues are forecasted to be in their range of down 4% to down 6% on a reported basis and down 2% to down 4% organically.
For operating margins, we're excluding restructuring cost to get adjusted margins. We expect Climate adjusted operating margins to be in the range of 14% to 14.5%. We expect Industrial adjusted margins to be in the range of 12% to 12.5%. For the enterprise, we expect adjusted operating margins of 11.8% to 12.3%, a 30 basis point improvement from our prior 2016 guidance and a year over -- a year-over-year improvement of 70 basis points. Operating leverage would be about 40% on an organic basis for the year.
Please go to Slide 17. Transitioning to earnings the reported earnings per share range is estimated to be $5.39 to $5.54. Excluding restructuring and the Hussmann gain, the range is $3.95 to $4.10, an increase of 6% to 10% versus 2015 and a $0.13 increase from the midpoint of our prior guidance range of $3.80 to $4. As a note for 2016, currency is a headwind of about 2% of revenue. This reflects a full year tax rate forecast of 24% to 25% and average diluted share count of 261 million shares for the full year. Second quarter 2016 revenues are forecast to be up 2% to 4% on a reported basis and 4% to 6% organically. We are projecting Climate revenues to grow mid-single digits in Q2 and Industrial to decline mid-single-digits on a reported basis reported second quarter earnings per share are forecast to be $2.75 to $2.80, back at $0.01 of restructuring and $1.49 Hussmann gain to get to an adjusted range of $1.27 to $1.32. For the full year 2016, we expect to generate adjusted free cash flow, which excludes restructuring in the Hussmann proceeds of $950 million to $1 billion.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Mike for a few closing comments."

What we expect for the first half of the year is strong performance on a year-over-year basis, because last year, we were",397,"Absolutely. So you're right, the 160 basis points spread between price and direct material deflation was a strong start to the year. What we expect for the first half of the year is strong performance on a year-over-year basis, because last year, we were still in an inflationary environment in the first half of 2015. So I think the second quarter will be slightly less favorable than 160 basis points but what we've adjusted the full year to now, Josh, is 80 basis points of favorable spread between price and direct material deflation. And so the first half, second half reflects basically the year-over-year compares to last year. And then as we look at the 80 basis points, so Q1 performance was driven by strong price performance and we expect some of that to continue to Q2 and also, strong performance from the material side. Price is one of those areas where I think you never want to reach out and assume that you can continue to get price at a great execution level throughout the year in a strong deflationary environment. But as it post commodities themselves, here's what we expect. So we have about 70% of our copper locked in for the year through our contracts. We expect that copper and aluminum are going to be a fairly stable in terms of what happens throughout the rest of 2016. You'll see some ups and downs, but generally, I think those are going to be pretty stable. We're seeing a slight uptick in steel, but I don't think that's going to impact us in 2016 because of the way that our contracts are written. We wouldn't start to see that until the very end of the year. So I think our -- I think our supply base and our commodity teams have done a great job of getting us the deflation that you're seeing in the results. I expect that to continue all of the Tier 2 pricing really seemed to come in Q1 also. So I think we had a great lever up and I think we'll have a great result. If you recall, we had given you a look at the full year, I think, 35 -- or 30 to 40 basis points when we last gave guidance and as I said, we took that up to 80 basis points favorable spread for 2016."

As we think about the tax strategy that I talked about getting us into a low 20s type of tax rate on an ongoing basis, I also don't expect those regulations to have an impact on us getting into those areas. And the reason that I say that is when we're looking at our strength tax strategy, intercompany debt is one element of some of the things that you can do, trading hubs, procurement hubs, making sure that your transfer pricing is absolutely aligned and other tax efficient projects can help us get to where we want to go. We've also been looking at a project that helps us look at effective tax rate by each of our SBUs so that we're all working on taxes, we do our plans and we do our forward I think that will help us with an overall tax strategy that doesn't get impacted by the proposed treasury regulations. We'll obviously continue to look at those and make sure that we understand all of the sort of conservative impacts that might be out there from of the regulations. But no impact on the rate and no impact on our strategy going forward."

I noticed that you didn't take up the restructuring at all for the quarter and if I recall correctly, there was some can shipments that were expected to be released in the beginning part of this year and so I'm just wondering, is there still opportunity for further action in Industrial?

We are continuing to work on restructuring actions for the remainder of the year and those are going to be primarily in Industrial. We called out in the guidance about $0.01",322,"Yes. So the $0.02 of restructuring that we spent in Q1 was related to Industrial. We are continuing to work on restructuring actions for the remainder of the year and those are going to be primarily in Industrial. We called out in the guidance about $0.01 for each of the next 3 quarters. I think what's important about the restructuring and the way that we've looked at it is the restructuring really does have a payback within 2016. So we fully expect to realize benefits of that $0.05 of restructuring and that is also what will help us with my comment earlier in my prepared remarks about Industrial margins improving in the back half of the year, so some of the productivity kicks in at some of the restructuring actions that we actually started almost 1 year ago are going to kick in. Now on the ECC side, we did have some shipments that had pushed out of Q4. We actually had some shipments that pushed out of Q1 also into Q2. But the ECC story is an interesting one. So if I look at first quarter bookings in total, bookings in total for the ECC business are actually up significantly in the first quarter. The majority of that is going to be in the products that are outside of the large centrifugal pump rose compressors, those are really coming down. But bookings are up, which is good their revenue that we're seeing are really being impacted by the large centrifugals, but also importantly, as we think about ECC and that business is, we expect to be really, really on track with the revenue and and the cost synergies for 2016 that we have outlined. So lots of moving pieces in the business, but I think you see some strength in the normal product and in the aftermarket and some bigger weakness and some shipments moving around in the large centrifugal compressors."

When you look at the type of paybacks that we're seeing in the business, we're getting numbers like 7 years, which is indicative of doing a good job around running the plants, the utilization that we've been able to achieve in our plants. You couple that with the lead times of bringing on new capacity one of the markets return, that's a 24- to 30-month process, particularly in the machining centers that we would be moving or upgrading to do that. So we don't want to get with sod in doing any large restructuring when this thing turns around because the margins come back very strong when the business volumes come back as well. So we're being cautious. Now we're always looking at the ideas that are on the table. If the underlying real estate value is changed or if tax incentive changed from one location to another, it could swing something like that. We are very cautious about looking at an upswing in that he come to bring capacity on when you need it and we don't want to be ever in a situation upswing in the markets to not have sufficient capacity at that point in time."

On the Industrial margins, your math is absolutely correct, that in the back half of the year, we do have the operating margins for industrial improving into the low-teens.

You still have positive price in the back half of the year. And you have just more volume the back half of the year than the front. I don't want anyone to think there's a lot of volume recovery that we've built into this, we have not. But if there is a by virtue of how the quarters pan out, roughly $50 million of additional revenue in the back half versus the front half. But it's productivity.

So there is a cost to that in the first half of the year and a benefit to that in the back half of the year, which is broadly in line with Sue's productivity comment, but a big piece of that productivity is really the cost control around headcount, some of which is qualified, some of which is nonqualified in terms of how we would actually account for it.

We think that's doable but I think the time frame is a really highly dependent on when the markets come back. Right now, we haven't seen the market essentially stopped falling, so we need to stabilize first and then the markets will return.

What I found there was one of the fastest implementation of an operating system that we've put in place across the company. It's very exciting and the openness around that. And then the openness of our transport refrigeration team to include that hybrid electronic technology into the truck platform is also very positive. So I left Europe feeling very bullish."

The quarter really demonstrated the consistency we're seeing in our strategy, which is to deliver sustainable, profitable growth, and I'd highlight a few areas here. 
First, we're leading in markets in the innovation and development of energy-efficient, reliable and sustainable products and services. Second, we're deepening the penetration, the maturity of our operating system, and we're delivering operational excellence across our businesses. Third, we're maintaining a disciplined and dynamic approach to capital allocation. And finally, as I've said before, critical to any sustained culture transformation, our employees are engaged. [indiscernible] are continuing to increase across the company, employees continue to see Ingersoll Rand as a great place to work, which in turn leads to a better customer experience and that ultimately delivers shareholder value.
Our performance in the first quarter gives us confidence to raise our full year guidance, essentially flowing through the first quarter operational beam. Now, this morning, I'm going to give you an overview of what we're seeing in our end markets across the globe and use the opportunity to talk a bit about how we're performing against this market backdrop, give you some color on how we're progressing for the year. I thought it'll be useful to highlight where our performance maps, specifically to our overall strategy. And then I'm going to turn it over to Sue, and she'll take you through the quarter and our revised guidance for the remainder of the year. 
So over the past 16 weeks, I've spent the majority of my time on the road with leaders across the company, and during that time, I've met with customers from many of our business units across vertical markets and regions of the world. I've spent considerable time with our customer-facing employees and service technicians, sales teams. And as always, I've spent time inside our operations talking with the people who are building and engineering our products, to gain their perspective on the maturity and momentum in our operating system. And I've witnessed good momentum in the deployment of our operating system and remain confident that there is still long runway of opportunity in front of us. 
With that, let's go to Slide 4. I'm going to note that all my comments are around an organic basis. So they're going to exclude currency and acquisitions. Now I'll turn, first, to the North American Climate segment, where our business remains strong, overall, and we expect this momentum to continue for the balance of the year. 
In commercial HVAC, recent put-in-place data continues to support mid-single-digit growth, and we believe this should continue through at least 2017. We continue to see strong growth in the retail and office markets. Within the institutional markets, education and government markets are also strong. We saw a low-teens revenue growth in the quarter, coupled with high single-digit bookings growth. 
I want to point out, too, that we expect to see a record for quarter 2 with commercial HVAC North American bookings, which should be up approximately 25% over quarter 2, as a result of some large institutional project awards. We expect to continue to outperform the overall market for the balance of the year. 
Additionally, we're executing well on the volume and saw excellent operating leverage in the quarter. Growth here is a direct reflection of the constant investment we made over the past years. And we're seeing growth specifically in the areas where we have invested, whether in product growth teams, products or channel. 
As in 2015, we are beginning quarter 1 of '16 with double-digit growth in our Controls and Service business. With over 4,300 companies direct service mechanics and technicians, we believe we are now the largest provider of mechanical HVAC service to commercial customers in the world. Additionally, when we break out our critical growth programs from the base business, we are seeing mid-teens growth in these programs.
Overall execution has been excellent with clear discipline the management team is running the business through our operating system. Like commercial, our residential HVAC North American business is likely to continue to outperform the market as well. We're proud of this performance and what's ahead for this business.
I'm occasionally asked, what do investors misunderstand about Ingersoll Rand, and in reading some of the sell side reports, I think there is some misunderstanding about the success we've had in the residential HVAC business, and so I want to add some of the facts for you.
According to AHRI data, we have increased share each quarter, over the past 6 quarters, including the first quarter of 2016. For all of 2015 and continuing into the quarter 1 of '16, we have a residential HVAC business with mid-teen EBITDA margins, which makes it accretive to the segment and IR, as a whole. Quarter 1 brought mid-teen in bookings growth for the second consecutive quarter and mid-single-digit revenue growth and very strong operating leverage. Our market outlook remains positive. We forecast 4% to 5% unit growth for the industry, and we anticipate our revenue growth to be in the high single-digit range for the year.
The residential team has done an outstanding job implementing our operating system across its full footprint. The team is running the entire business in a full product growth value stream and showing in the execution. And strategically, we've executed well on a complete product refresh, repositioning of our channel strategies. And in our connected home strategy, where we have a plausible business platform, robust diagnostic capabilities and nearly 200,000 Nexia enrollments to date. Additionally, connected home is a key driver of our residential controls business, which has more than doubled since 2011 and continues to grow at around 25% annually.
Shifting to North American transport refrigeration markets. As usual, the management team did a great job in the quarter and managed to improve the margins with high operating leverage. North America continues to hold up well, especially in the truck and trailer market. Our current view of truck and trailer has improved from our original view of the market from earlier this year. 
ACC raised its trailer units forecast to 47,000 units, which is up about 1% versus last year. Their prior forecast was for the market to be down 10%.
We view this market data as being a bit aggressive, but we have raised our own forecast for approximately 45,000 units. And you may recall that our own prior forecast was 39,000 trailer units. So even though we do expect the market to be down over the record performance last year, our view has improved from when we spoke in February.
Our truck refrigeration business is also solid. And the overall market for Class 3 to 7 trucks is showing moderate growth. And we continue to pursue growth strategies in rail, bus and auxiliary power units. We continue to balance North American business into additional vertical markets.
As we look toward the HVAC and transport refrigeration markets in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, we plan to continue to outperform the market in the year ahead, with additional new product and service launches planned in the year and excellent management teams executing on the ground, delivering good margin expansion and cash conversion growth. 
We continue to do very well in Europe with organic bookings in the high single digits against the flattish market backdrop. We're seeing excellent uptake on the new product introductions, and like North America, the Service business also grew at a double-digit rate.
I visited our FRIGOBLOCK team and operations a few weeks ago. The progress made and the adoption of our operating system was absolutely amazing. With our FRIGOBLOCK acquisition, we've taken a step forward now in integrating hybrid electric technology into our product roadmap. The acquisition has been a great success for us.
Middle East markets are certainly softening. We're seeing a contraction in the number of building projects planned and would expect this to continue for some time, as lower oil prices are driving an investment pullback. 
Going to Asia Pacific, it is difficult to know if markets have reached an inflection point in China. The data is mixed and is not that consistent month-to-month. Our performance though has been deviating from the market in a positive way due to investments in products and a focus we put on an increasing our direct channel marketing investment to achieve fuller market coverage. Climate bookings in China were up mid-single digits in quarter 1 and up low teens for Asia Pacific as a whole.
Our strategic focus on growing the Service business continues to be successful in Asia, too, achieving a mid-teens growth rate in the quarter. 
We're also seeing strong mid-teens bookings growth in transport refrigeration equipment as the market continues to grow. And our local engineering and manufacturing teams continue to tune the product to local preferences.
Strong growth outside China is being driven by growth in Thailand, India and our performance in Singapore, along with good transport refrigeration growth in Australia. 
So concluding the HVAC and transport refrigeration geographic update, it'll take us to Latin America where markets remain very volatile, with strength in smaller, but fast-growing markets in the Dominican Republic and Panama, but deteriorating conditions in Brazil, Venezuela, Ecuador and Argentina. Conditions in Mexico remains fundamentally sound. Organic revenue for the region was flat with low-teen increases in HVAC equipment. So we're pleased with our performance in the market. We've expanded margins in a very tough and volatile Latin American marketplace. 
Let's move to Slide 5. In here, we'll look at the end markets for the Industrial segment of our business, and I'll start with an overall comment that our compression technologies business bookings and revenue were down organically low single digits in the quarter, with equipment essentially tracking the overall market, but with service up mid-single digits. Again, we're focusing on growing our Service business across the enterprise and has been executing well on that strategy.
In North America, U.S. manufacturing capacity utilization remains relatively low, hitting 75% last quarter, which is the lowest point over the last 12 quarters. Now large equipment CapEx typical for what we would see for large centrifugal and large rotary air compressors historically rebounds the utilization readings above 80%.
At one visit, I had the opportunity to meet with the major customer that's been around for decades, building small-scale LNG plants that range from 50,000 to 500,000 gallons per day. I asked this Ph.D. physicist what the most reliable leading indicator he would look for in end markets, and he responded very simply by saying, it's when the telephone rings. Unfortunately, he did say the phone is beginning to ring, as is ours, in that area, but whether it's small-scale LNG systems or larger air compressors, our sense is that even early activity in large machine hoarding activity probably will have little impact on large machine deliveries in 2016. 
To give you a little bit more color on this, from the North American market, you look at compressors between 500 and 400-plus horsepower, the market for small compressors, those between 5 and 15 horsepower is up roughly 10%, but compressors larger than 250 horsepower are down more than 30% in the first 2 industry-reported months of the quarter. The smaller compressors are quicker [indiscernible] in turn with inventory restocking occurring in that category. 
We also believe we're seeing some restocking in the wholesale channel, in our tools and fluid management business.
Our Material Handling team has done a great job managing their business, essentially holding the business to breakeven on a 50% reduction in revenue. So again, across the business through the management team, they're doing a very good job, exhibiting strong cost control and execution discipline on the backdrop of continued declines and projected global market growth.
In Europe, we're seeing increased exports and industrial production across Western Europe. Eastern Europe continues to be fairly weak. And for Asia-Pacific, the current environment continues to experience pricing pressure across the region, but we're positively optimistic to see if we've had reached an inflection point as manufacturing indices signal pockets of improvement in countries such as China, Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea, and China's power consumption has also shown growth first 2 months of the year, and India is seeing strong market growth in verticals like textile, pharma and food and beverage.
So rounding up the geographic update for Industrial segment, we'll go to Latin America, where volatility of the market there across the region continues to be driven by political instability and this has contributed to reduced investment in key verticals, such as energy, oil and gas, mining and metals; however, other verticals like food and beverage, pharma and textile remain with positive outlook.
So before turning it over to Sue, let me conclude by saying, again, we had an excellent quarter. We continue to invest in the products, service offerings and footprint of the company, while using our operating systems to deliver well above the industry average results. 
And I'll turn it over to you, Sue, to cover the financial review and guidance."

Q1 was a strong operational quarter across all of our businesses. As you heard in Mike's comments, end markets continued to be strong in Climate and weaker-than-expected in Industrial. Our business operating system guided as through good execution in our factories and in our cost centers. Our focus was on good operating results in a low-growth environment. Our results show that we did not let cost get ahead of revenues in the quarter. 
Revenues grew slightly on a reported basis, and we're up 2% organically. The Climate segment grew 4% organically. Industrial was down 5%, both on a reported and in organic basis. HVAC revenues grew in each of our Climate businesses, led by commercial and residential in North America. 
Revenue in our Industrial businesses declined in the quarter with tough comparisons to the first quarter of 2015. Large centrifugal compressors and other industrial equipment were weaker than our estimates, but Club Car performed as expected, with low year-over-year growth.
Our adjusted operating margins grew 140 basis points year-over-year with organic operating leverage of 75%. Adjusted segment margins grew 150 basis points, which shows the alignment between our operating performance and our Q1 results. Our strength was in price, direct material deflation and mix.
Earnings per share grew 32% year-over-year exceeding our prior guidance. In Q1, our capital deployment actions, including -- included repurchasing $250 million of shares and we increased our dividend by 10%. We completed the sale of our remaining interest in Hussmann on April 1, 2016. All impacts will appear in the second quarter. 
Please go to Slide 7. I've included a slide to reconcile our Q1 EPS actual results with our prior guidance. I've said on a few occasions this morning that our results were the result of good execution and operational performance. Price and direct material deflation were the largest drivers of the margin expansion in Q1. This is an area where everything went right in the quarter; i.e., there was no breakage. Price was positive in both segments and direct material deflation was also very, very positive to our guidance. 
Cost savings and controls were a positive $0.03 for the quarter. Each of our businesses and corporate functions had favorable variances to start the year as we control spending, while we evaluated our end market volatility.
Currency, share counts and other income were about $0.01 each. We opportunistically repurchased shares earlier in the year than we would normally, and currency was a bit favorable to our guidance range. 
Restructuring was favorable to our guidance by $0.03 for the quarter. This is timing. We have identified projects to execute and continue to work on restructuring projects that have good returns and shorter paybacks, and we'll spend the remaining $0.03 throughout the remainder of 2016.
Please go to Slide 8. Orders for the first quarter of 2016 were up 4% organically. Climate orders were up 6% organically. Organic global commercial HVAC bookings were up high single digits, led by high-teens growth in North America unitary and double-digit growth in Asia applied.
We continue to see excellent growth in service controls on trucking with parts with double-digit growth in the quarter. Originally, for commercial HVAC, we saw high single-digit booking increases with a high single-digit increase in North America and Europe; up low teens in Asia; and with declines in both the Middle East and Latin America. Residential bookings were up 17%. 
Organic transport orders were down low single digits with low-teens growth in truck and trailer in North America and Europe that were offset by lower container orders. 
Orders in the Industrial Segment were down 5% organically. We saw a low single-digit order decline in compression equipment, a low-teens decline in other industrial products and a mid-single-digit decline in Club Car. 
Performance in compression technologies was mixed in the first quarter. We had an improvement in small compressors, oil-free and in some of our component businesses, like dryers and filters. We also had a small improvement in our aftermarket business. These gains were offset by declines in core industrial compressors and by large centrifugal equipment.
Please go to Slide 9. This slide provides a directional view of our segment performance by region. In our Climate segment, which was up 4% in the first quarter, we saw solid performance in North America and flattish growth across Europe, Latin America and Asia. The Middle East was the only region that declined within the Climate segment. We're seeing a contraction in the number of building projects planned in the Middle East and would expect this to continue for some time, as lower oil prices are driving an investment pullback.
Our Industrial Segment performance in the first quarter, which was down 5%, is representative of the volatility that continues across the globe in the industrials market. Strong performance in Mexico contributed double-digit growth in Latin America. We also saw a growth in Europe, while Asia was flat and North America was down high single digits.
Overall, our regional performance for the first quarter trends with the end market summary that Mike provided us earlier, with a strong start in North America. Industrial Segment performance is expected to trend with the market. We're planning on expanding margins in a down market in the second half of the year through productivity gains and cost control. 
Please go to Slide 10. Operating margin on a reported basis increased 160 basis points from 5.9% to 7.5% from the first quarter 2015 to the first quarter of 2016. Mix was favorable for the quarter, 40 basis points, largely offset by unfavorable volume and currency. Net pricing versus direct material inflation was the largest driver of margin improvement in the quarter, favorable by 160 basis points. Price realization was achieved across both the Climate and Industrial segments, which was higher than expected, and commodities remain deflationary.
Productivity versus other inflation was positive 10 basis points, driven by ongoing productivity actions, partially offset by other inflation. Year-over-year investments in other items reduced margins by 20 basis points. In the box, you can see that was comprised of 40 basis points from incremental investments, 20 basis points from higher restructuring costs, which were partially offset by 40-basis-point improvement related to the absence of acquisition-related step-up costs incurred in 2015.
Overall, reported operating leverage exceeded 100% in the quarter, as we expanded margins in a low-growth environment.
Please go to Slide 11. Our Climate businesses had an excellent quarter in Q1. Adjusted segment income and EBITDA margins improved by 280 and 260 basis points to 9.8% and 12.4%, respectively. Increased volumes, favorable mix, price, direct material deflation and productivity offset other inflation and investment spending, the leverage for the Climate segment was 118% for the quarter. Revenues for the quarter were up 4% organically. 
Commercial HVAC organic revenues were up mid-single digits, led by mid-teens unitary equipment shipments in North America and low-teens parts and service revenue in North America. Europe had low single-digit equipment growth and high single-digit in services and trucking and parts. The Middle East had parts and services growth offset by declines in equipment sales.
Residential revenues were up mid-single digits in Q1 with very strong leverage and significant margin improvements. 
Transport organic revenues were down slightly, but this does not tell the whole story for Q1. North America truck and trailer organic revenues were up mid-single digits, and European truck and trailer organic revenues were up in the mid-20% range. Marine container organic revenues declined more than 60% in the first quarter, reflecting a soft start at various box builders for 2016.
Please go to Slide 12. First quarter revenues for the Industrial Segment were $681 million, down 5% on an organic basis. Compression technologies and services organic revenues were down low single digits versus last year. Club Car organic revenues were up slightly versus prior year. Organic revenues in the Americas were down high single digits, while revenues in Europe, Middle East and Africa were down low single digits and were flat in Asia.
Industrial's adjusted operating margin of 9.8% was down 230 basis points compared with last year. Price and direct material deflation were positive. Productivity offset other inflation and volume and mix were unfavorable.
Please go to Slide 13. First quarter free cash flow of negative $46.3 million was favorable to prior year by $135 million. Strong operating income improvement and improved working capital performance were the primary drivers of the favorability. 
For the quarter, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 6.2%. We had strong collections in the quarter with our days sales outstanding improving 1.3 days over the prior year, and days payable outstanding improving 0.7 days. 
Inventories aren't planned for the quarter, and we're well positioned to serve our customers as we enter the heavier volume second quarter. 
Capital expenditures of $40 million are lower than prior year due to capitalization of our ERP systems costs in the first quarter of 2015.
Please go to Slide 14. Capital allocation is a key area of strategy for us. We continue to invest in our businesses, and I think you'll agree that our results show the value of our product refresh strategies and our operational excellence programs, which are a part of our business operating system. 
We raised the annual dividend 10% in early 2016, with a goal of maintaining a dividend payout consistent with our peers. We have an M&A pipeline that reflects our desire to add to our products, technologies and channels, as outlined in our strategy. We are focused on building long-term value. We've launched shares to offset benefit program dilution in the first quarter at an average share price of $51.10.
Please go to Slide 15. As always, our intention is to give you the best view of what we're seeing in our end markets sitting here today and how that translates to our revenue guidance for 2016. We've broken it down by major end markets and geographies. As you can see by the variation of colors and symbols, our end markets are seeing a wide variation in trends. We also added a column to show you our current versus prior thinking on organic revenue.
North American commercial HVAC and residential HVAC as well as European transport and commercial HVAC markets are generally positive, while global industrial markets have declined. We are forecasting transport markets in North America to be flat. Our forecast for North American trailer volumes has shifted from declines of 15% to down slightly for the year. Asian HVAC markets are expected to be flat to down, and industrial markets in Asia remain under pressure. Golf cart markets are slightly down, offset by increases in the utility vehicle markets. 
Both the growth forecast shown here are on an organic basis. We're forecasting mid-single-digit growth in commercial HVAC in total, high single-digit growth in residential HVAC, which is essentially an all American -- North American business for us and a small increase in transport. We expect compression-related products and other equipments to be down high single digits. We expect Club Car to be up low single digit. 
Please go to Slide 16. As we're gaining those market backdrops, we expect reported revenues for the full year 2016 to be flat to up 2% versus 2015. Overall, foreign exchange will be a headwind of about 2 percentage points. While these revenue outlooks do not show a total change, the segment numbers reflect important updates.
We expect Climate revenues to be up 2% to 4% on a reported basis and 4% to 6% organically. For the Industrial segment, revenues are forecasted to be in the range of down 4% to down 6% on a reported basis and down 2% to down 4% organically.
For operating margins, we're excluding restructuring costs to get adjusted margins. We expect Climate adjusted operating margins to be in the range of 14% to 14.5%. We expect Industrial adjusted margins to be in the range of 12% to 12.5%. For the enterprise, we expect adjusted operating margins of 11.8% to 12.3%, a 30-basis-point improvement from our prior 2016 guidance and a year over improvement -- year-over-year improvement of 70 basis points. Operating leverage would be about 40% on an organic basis for the year.
Please go to Slide 17. Transitioning to earnings, the reported earnings per share range is estimated to be $5.39 to $5.54. Excluding restructuring and the Hussmann gain, the range is $3.95 to $4.10, an increase of 6% to 10% versus 2015 and a $0.13 increase from the midpoint of our prior guidance range of $3.80 to $4. As a note for 2016, currency is a headwind of about 2% of revenue. This reflects a full year tax rate forecast of 24% to 25% and an average diluted share count of 261 million shares for the full year. Second quarter 2016 revenues are forecast to be up 2% to 4% on a reported basis and 4% to 6% organically. We are projecting Climate revenues to grow mid-single digits in Q2 and Industrial to decline mid-single digits on a reported basis. Reported second quarter earnings per share are forecast to be $2.75 to $2.80, back at $0.01 of restructuring and $1.49 Hussmann gain to get to an adjusted range of $1.27 to $1.32. For the full year 2016, we expect to generate adjusted free cash flow, which excludes restructuring in the Hussmann proceeds of $950 million to $1 billion.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Mike for a few closing comments."

The 160-basis-point spread between price and direct material deflation was a strong start to the year. What we expect for the first half of the year is strong performance on a year-over-year basis, because last year, we were s",396,"Absolutely. So you're right. The 160-basis-point spread between price and direct material deflation was a strong start to the year. What we expect for the first half of the year is strong performance on a year-over-year basis, because last year, we were still in an inflationary environment in the first half of 2015. So I think the second quarter will be slightly less favorable than 160 basis points, but what we've adjusted the full year to now, Josh, is 80 basis points of favorable spread between price and direct material deflation. And so the first half, second half reflects basically the year-over-year compares to last year. And then as we look at the 80 basis points, so Q1 performance was driven by strong price performance, and we expect some of that to continue in Q2, and also strong performance from the material side. Price is one of those areas where, I think, you never want to reach out and assume that you can continue to get price at a great execution level throughout the year in a strong deflationary environment. But as opposed to the commodities themselves, here's what we expect. So we have about 70% of our copper locked in for the year through our contracts. We expect that copper and aluminum are going to be fairly stable in terms of what happens throughout the rest of 2016. You'll see some ups and downs, but generally, I think those are going to be pretty stable. We're seeing a slight uptick in steel, but I don't think that's going to impact us in 2016, because of the way that our contracts are written, we wouldn't start to see that until the very end of the year. So I think our -- I think our supply base and our commodity teams have done a great job of getting us the deflation that you're seeing in the results. I expect that to continue. All of the Tier 2 pricing really seemed to come in Q1 also. So I think we had a great environment, and I think we will have a great result. So if you recall, we had given you a look at the full year, I think, 35 -- or 30 to 40 basis points when we last gave guidance, and as I said, we took that up to 80 basis points favorable spread for 2016."

So I think the first way to start out that question, Josh, is to say that we -- we've looked at all of the proposed treasury regulations, and we don't expect those regulations to have an impact on our effective tax rate in 2016.

So I think the first way to start out that question, Josh, is to say that we -- we've looked at all of the proposed treasury regulations, and we don't expect those regulations to have an impact on our effective tax rate in 2016. As we think about the tax strategy that I've talked about getting us into a low 20s type of tax rate on an ongoing basis, I also don't expect those regulations to have an impact on us getting into those areas. And the reason that I say that is when we're looking at our tax strategy, intercompany debt is one element of some of the things that you can do, trading hubs, procurement hubs, making sure that your transfer pricing is absolutely aligned and other tax efficient projects can help us get to where we want to go. We've also been looking at a project that helps us look at effective tax rate by each of our SBUs, so that we're all working on taxes. We do our plans and we do our forward looks, and I think that will help us with an overall tax strategy that doesn't get impacted by the proposed treasury regulations. We'll obviously continue to look at those and make sure that we understand all of the sort of derivative impacts that might be out there from of the regulations. But no impact on the rate and no impact on our strategy going forward."

I noticed that you didn't take up the restructuring at all for the quarter, and if I recall correctly, there were some Cam shipments that were expected to be released in the beginning part of this year.

So the $0.02 of restructuring that we spent in Q1 was related to Industrial. We are continuing to work on restructuring actions for the remainder of the year and those are going to primarily be in Industrial. So we called out in the guidance about $0",323,"Yes. So the $0.02 of restructuring that we spent in Q1 was related to Industrial. We are continuing to work on restructuring actions for the remainder of the year and those are going to primarily be in Industrial. So we called out in the guidance about $0.01 for each of the next 3 quarters. I think what's important about the restructuring and the way that we've looked at it is that the restructuring really does have a payback within 2016. So we fully expect to realize the benefits of that $0.05 of restructuring, and that is also what will help us with my comment earlier in my prepared remarks about industrial margins improving in the back half of the year. So some of that productivity kicks in and some of the restructuring actions that were actually started almost one year ago are going to kick in. Now on the ECC side, we did have some shipments that had pushed out of Q4. We actually had some shipments that pushed out of Q1 also into Q2. But the ECC story is an interesting one. So if I look at first quarter bookings in total, bookings in total for the ECC business are actually up significantly in the first quarter. The majority of that is going to be in the products that are outside of the large centrifugal compressors, those are really coming down. But -- so bookings are up, which is good. The revenue that we're seeing are really being impacted by the large centrifugals, but also importantly, as we think about ECC and that business is, we expect to really be on track with the revenue and the cost synergies for 2016 that we had outlined. So lots of moving pieces in the business, but I think you'll see some strength in the normal product and in the aftermarket and some bigger weakness and some shipments moving around in the large centrifugal compressors."

So we're always improving the cost base there. When you look at the type of paybacks that we're seeing in that business, we're getting numbers like 7 years, which is indicative of doing a good job around running the plants, the utilization that we've been able to achieve in our plants. You couple that with the lead time to bring a new capacity when the markets return, and that's a 24- to 30-month process, particularly in the machining centers that we would be moving or upgrading to do that. So we don't want to get whipsawed in doing any large restructuring when this thing turns around, because the margins come back very strong when the business volumes come back as well. So we're being cautious. Now we're always looking at the ideas that are on the table. If the underlying real estate values change or if tax incentives change from one location to another, it could swing something like that. We are very cautious about looking at an upswing in the lead time to bring capacity on when you need it, and we don't want to ever be in a situation at an upswing in the market to not have sufficient capacity at that point in time."

You still have positive price in the back half of the year. And you have just [indiscernible] more volume in the back half of the year than the front. I don't want anyone to think there's a lot of volume recovery that we've built into this. We have not. But there is, by virtue of how the quarters pan out, roughly $50 million of additional revenue in the back half versus the front half. But it's productivity. It is the restructuring actions that are kicking in, and it is the continuation of the actions that the management teams are taking to work through this low revenue and end market decline."

So even though you're seeing kind of a headline $0.02 restructuring, the least that much, maybe more than that, which would be nonqualified restructuring. So it's sort of restructuring in place, not replacing or controlling spending. So there is a cost to that in the first half of the year and a benefit to that in the back half of the year, which is broadly in line with Sue's productivity comment, but a big piece of that productivity is really the cost control around headcount, some of which is qualified, some of which is nonqualified, in terms of how we would actually account for it. The longer-term question that you asked about the profitability of the business, Sue did a little bit of an analysis on this, and it might be useful to kind of walk through where we -- when we would see a 17% margin in the business?"

If I look at where we're at today, we're roughly in the $3 billion type of territory. So I think as we look at the business, we're doing all of the right actions today to get the cost in line, but I think what we need is market recoveries and, I think, the revenues to return to sort of that upper $3 billion range for us to get into the 17% margins. We think that's doable, but I think the timeframe is really highly dependent on when the markets come back. Right now, we haven't seen -- the market has actually stopped falling. So we need to stabilize first and then the markets to return.

The quarter really demonstrated the consistency we're seeing in our strategy, which is to deliver sustainable, profitable growth, and I'd highlight a few areas here. 
First, we're leading in our markets in the innovation and development of energy-efficient, reliable and sustainable products and services. Second, we're deepening the penetration, the maturity of our operating system, and we're delivering operational excellence across our businesses. Third, we're maintaining a disciplined and dynamic approach to capital allocation. And finally, as I've said before, critical to any sustained culture transformation, our employees are engaged. Their scores are continuing to increase across the company. Employees continue to see Ingersoll Rand as a great place to work, which in turn leads to a better customer experience, and that ultimately delivers shareholder value.
Our performance in the first quarter gives us confidence to raise our full year guidance, essentially flowing through the first quarter operational beat [ph]. Now this morning, I'm going to give you an overview of what we're seeing in our end markets across the globe and use the opportunity to talk a bit about how we're performing against this market backdrop to give you some color on how we're progressing for the year. I thought it'd be useful to highlight where our performance maps specifically to our overall strategy. And then I'm going to turn it over to Sue, and she'll take you through the quarter and our revised guidance for the remainder of the year. 
So over the past 16 weeks, I've spent the majority of my time on the road with leaders across the company, and during that time, I've met with customers from many of our business units across vertical markets and regions of the world. I've spent considerable time with our customer-facing employees, from service technicians to sales teams. And as always, I've spent time inside our operations talking with the people who are building and engineering our products, to gain their perspective on the maturity and momentum in our operating system. And I've witnessed good momentum in the deployment of our operating system and remain confident that there is still a long runway of opportunity in front of us. 
With that, let's go to Slide 4. And I'm going to note that all of my comments are on an organic basis. So they're going to exclude currency and acquisitions. Now I'll turn first to the North American Climate segment, where our business remains strong overall, and we expect this momentum to continue for the balance of the year. 
In commercial HVAC, recent put-in-place data continues to support mid-single-digit growth, and we believe this should continue through at least 2017. We continue to see strong growth in the retail and office markets. Within the institutional markets, education and government markets are also strong. We saw a low-teens revenue growth in the quarter, coupled with high single-digit bookings growth. 
I want to point out, too, that we expect to see a record for quarter 2 with commercial HVAC North American bookings, which should be up approximately 25% over quarter 2, as a result of some large institutional project awards. We expect to continue to outperform the overall market for the balance of the year. 
Additionally, we're executing well on the volume and saw excellent operating leverage in the quarter. Growth here is a direct reflection of the constant investment we've made over the past years. And we're seeing growth specifically in the areas where we have invested, whether in product growth teams, products or channel. 
As in 2015, we are beginning quarter 1 of '16 with double-digit growth in our Controls and Service business. With over 4,300 companies direct service mechanics and technicians, we believe we are now the largest provider of mechanical HVAC service to commercial customers in the world. Additionally, when we break out our critical growth programs from the base business, we are seeing mid-teens growth in these programs.
Overall execution has been excellent. With clear discipline, the management team is running the business through our operating system. Like commercial, our residential HVAC North American business is likely to continue to outperform the market as well. We're proud of this performance and what's ahead for this business.
I'm occasionally asked, ""What do investors misunderstand about Ingersoll Rand?"" and in reading some of the sell side reports, I think there is some misunderstanding about the success we've had in the residential HVAC business, and so I want to lay out some of the facts for you.
According to AHRI data, we have increased share each quarter, over the past 6 quarters, including the first quarter of 2016. For all of 2015 and continuing into quarter 1 of '16, we have a residential HVAC business with mid-teen EBITDA margins, which makes it accretive to the segment and IR as a whole. Quarter 1 brought mid-teen bookings growth for the second consecutive quarter and mid-single-digit revenue growth and very strong operating leverage. Our market outlook remains positive. We forecast 4% to 5% unit growth for the industry, and we anticipate our revenue growth to be in the high single-digit range for the year.
The residential team has done an outstanding job implementing our operating system across its full footprint. The team is running the entire business in a full product growth value stream, and it's showing in the execution. And strategically, we've executed well on our complete product refresh, repositioning of our channel strategies and in our connected home strategy, where we have a profitable business platform, robust diagnostic capabilities and nearly 200,000 Nexia enrollments to date. Additionally, connected home is a key driver of our residential controls business, which has more than doubled since 2011 and continues to grow at around 25% annually.
Shifting to North American transport refrigeration markets. As usual, the management team did a great job in the quarter and managed to improve their margins with high operating leverage. North America continues to hold up well, especially in the truck and trailer market. Our current view of truck and trailer has improved from our original view of the market from earlier this year. 
ACT raised its trailer units forecast to 47,000 units, which is up about 1% versus last year. Their prior forecast was for the market to be down 10%.
We view this market data as being a bit aggressive, but we have raised our own forecast for approximately 45,000 units. And you may recall that our own prior forecast was 39,000 trailer units. So even though we do expect the market to be down over the record performance last year, our view has improved from when we spoke in February.
Our truck refrigeration business is also solid, and the overall market for Class 3 to 7 trucks is showing moderate growth. And we continue to pursue growth strategies in rail, bus and auxiliary power units to continue to balance North American business into additional vertical markets.
As we look toward the HVAC and transport refrigeration markets in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, we plan to continue to outperform the market in the year ahead, with additional new product and service launches planned in the year and excellent management teams executing on the ground, delivering good margin expansion and cash conversion growth. 
We continue to do very well in Europe with organic bookings in the high single-digits against a flattish market backdrop. We are seeing excellent uptake on the new product introductions, and like North America, the Service business also grew at a double-digit rate.
I visited our FRIGOBLOCK team and operations a few weeks ago. The progress made and the adoption of our operating system was absolutely amazing. With our FRIGOBLOCK acquisition, we've taken a step forward now in integrating hybrid electric technology into our product roadmap. The acquisition has been a great success for us.
Middle East markets are certainly softening. We're seeing a contraction in the number of building projects planned and would expect this to continue for some time, as lower oil prices are driving an investment pullback. 
Moving to Asia Pacific, it's difficult to know if markets have reached an inflection point in China. The data is mixed, and it's not that consistent month-to-month. Our performance, though, has been deviating from the market in a positive way due to investments in products and the focus we've put on in increasing our direct channel marketing investment to achieve fuller market coverage. Climate bookings in China were up mid-single-digits in quarter 1 and up low teens for Asia Pacific as a whole.
Our strategic focus on growing the Service business continues to be successful in Asia, too, achieving a mid-teens growth rate in the quarter. 
We're also seeing strong mid-teens bookings growth in transport refrigeration equipment as the market continues to grow. And our local engineering and manufacturing teams continue to tune the product to local preferences.
Strong growth outside China is being driven by growth in Thailand, India and our performance in Singapore, along with good transport refrigeration growth in Australia. 
So concluding the HVAC and transport refrigeration geographic update will take us to Latin America, where markets remain very volatile, with strength in smaller but fast-growing markets in the Dominican Republic and Panama but deteriorating conditions in Brazil, Venezuela, Ecuador and Argentina. Conditions though in Mexico remained fundamentally sound. Organic revenue for the region was flat, with low-teen increases in HVAC equipment. So we're pleased with our performance in the market. We've expanded margins in a very tough and volatile Latin American marketplace. 
Let's move to Slide 5. And here, we'll look at the end markets for the Industrial segment of our business, and I'll start with an overall comment that our compression technologies business bookings and revenue were down organically low single-digits in the quarter, with equipment essentially tracking the overall market, but with service up mid-single-digits. Again, we are focusing on growing our service businesses across the enterprise and have been executing well on that strategy.
In North America, U.S. manufacturing capacity utilization remains relatively low, hitting 75% last quarter, which is the lowest point over the last 12 quarters, and large equipment CapEx, typical for what we would see for large centrifugal and large rotary air compressors, historically rebounds the utilization readings above 80%.
On one visit, I had the opportunity to meet with a major customer that's been around for decades, building small-scale LNG plants that range from 50,000 to 500,000 gallons per day. I asked this Ph.D. physicist what the most reliable leading indicator he would look for in his end markets, and he responded very simply by saying, ""It's when the telephone rings."" And fortunately, he did say the phone is beginning to ring, as is ours, in that area, but whether it's small-scale LNG systems or larger air compressors, our sense is that even early activity in large machine quoting activity probably will have little impact on large machine deliveries in 2016. 
To give you a little bit more color on this for the North American market, you look at compressors between 500 and 400-plus horsepower, the market for small compressors, those between 5 and 15 horsepower is up roughly 10%, but compressors larger than 250 horsepower are down more than 30% in the first 2 industry-reported months of the quarter. The small air compressors are quicker book and turn, with inventory restocking occurring in that category. 
We also believe we are seeing some restocking to the wholesale channel in our tools and fluid management business.
But our Material Handling team has done a great job managing their business, essentially holding the business to breakeven on a 50% reduction in revenue. So again, across the business, with the management team doing a very good job, exhibiting strong cost control and execution discipline on the backdrop of continued declines and projected global market growth.
In Europe, we're seeing increased exports and industrial production across Western Europe. Eastern Europe continues to be fairly weak. And for Asia-Pacific, the current environment continues to experience pricing pressure across the region, but we're cautiously optimistic to see if we have reached an inflection point, as manufacturing indices signal pockets of improvement in countries such as China, Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea, and China's power consumption has also shown growth in the first 2 months of the year, and India is seeing strong market growth in verticals like textile, pharma and food and beverage.
So rounding out the geographic update for Industrial segment, we'll go to Latin America, where volatility in the markets there across the region continues to be driven by political instability, and this has contributed to reduced investment in key verticals such as energy, oil and gas, mining and metals. However, other verticals like food and beverage, pharma and textile remain with positive outlooks.
So before turning it over to Sue, let me conclude by saying again we had an excellent quarter. We continue to invest in the products, service offerings and footprint of the company while using our operating system to deliver well above industry average results. 
And I'll turn it over to you, Sue, to cover the financial review and guidance."

Let's begin with an overview of the first quarter. Q1 was a strong operational quarter across all of our businesses. As you heard in Mike's comments, end markets continue to be strong in Climate and weaker than expect",2247,"Thank you, Mike. Let's go to Slide 6. Let's begin with an overview of the first quarter. Q1 was a strong operational quarter across all of our businesses. As you heard in Mike's comments, end markets continue to be strong in Climate and weaker than expected in Industrial. Our business operating system guided us through good execution in our factories and in our cost centers. Our focus was on good operating results in a low-growth environment. Our results show that we did not let cost get ahead of revenues in the quarter. 
Revenues grew slightly on a reported basis and were up 2% organically. The Climate segment grew 4% organically. Industrial was down 5%, both on a reported and an organic basis. HVAC revenues grew in each of our Climate businesses, led by commercial and residential in North America. 
Revenue in our Industrial businesses declined in the quarter with tough comparisons to the first quarter of 2015. Large centrifugal compressors and other industrial equipment were weaker than our estimates, but Club Car performed as expected, with low year-over-year growth.
Our adjusted operating margins grew 140 basis points year-over-year, with organic operating leverage of 75%. Adjusted segment margins grew 150 basis points, which shows the alignment between our operating performance and our Q1 results. Our strength was in price, direct material deflation and mix.
Earnings per share grew 32% year-over-year, exceeding our prior guidance. In Q1, our capital deployment actions, including -- included repurchasing $250 million of shares, and we increased our dividend by 10%. We completed the sale of our remaining interest in Hussmann on April 1, 2016. All impacts will appear in the second quarter. 
Please go to Slide 7. I've included a slide to reconcile our Q1 EPS actual results with our prior guidance. I've said on a few occasions this morning that our results were the result of good execution and operational performance. Price and direct material deflation were the largest drivers of the margin expansion in Q1. This is an area where everything went right in the quarter; i.e., there was no breakage, price was positive in both segments and direct material deflation was also very positive to our guidance. 
Cost savings and controls were a positive $0.03 for the quarter. Each of our businesses and corporate functions had favorable variances to start the year as we controlled spending while we evaluated our end market volatility.
Currency, share count and other income were about $0.01 each. We opportunistically repurchased shares earlier in the year than we would normally, and currency was a bit favorable to our guidance range. 
Restructuring was favorable to our guidance by $0.03 for the quarter. This is timing. We have identified projects to execute and continue to work on restructuring projects that have good returns and shorter paybacks, and we'll spend the remaining $0.03 throughout the remainder of 2016.
Please go to Slide 8. Orders for the first quarter of 2016 were up 4% organically. Climate orders were up 6% organically. Organic global commercial HVAC bookings were up high single-digits, led by high-teens growth in North America unitary and double-digit growth in Asia applied.
We continue to see excellent growth in service controls, contracting and parts, with double-digit growth in the quarter. Originally, for commercial HVAC, we saw high single-digit booking increases with a high single-digit increase in North America and Europe; up low teens in Asia; and with declines in both the Middle East and Latin America. Residential bookings were up 17%. 
Organic transport orders were down low single-digits with low-teens growth in truck and trailer in North America and Europe that were offset by lower container orders. 
Orders in the Industrial Segment were down 5% organically. We saw a low single-digit order decline in compression equipment, a low-teens decline in other industrial products and a mid-single-digit decline in Club Car. 
Performance in compression technologies was mixed in the first quarter. We had an improvement in small compressors, oil-free and in some of our component businesses, like dryers and filters. We also had a small improvement in our aftermarket business. These gains were offset by declines in core industrial compressors and by large centrifugal equipment.
Please go to Slide 9. This slide provides a directional view of our segment performance by region. In our Climate segment, which was up 4% in the first quarter, we saw solid performance in North America and flattish growth across Europe, Latin America and Asia. The Middle East was the only region that declined within the Climate segment. We're seeing a contraction in the number of building projects planned in the Middle East and would expect this to continue for some time, as lower oil prices are driving an investment pullback.
Our Industrial Segment performance in the first quarter, which was down 5%, is representative of the volatility that continues across the globe in the industrials market. Strong performance in Mexico contributed to double-digit growth in Latin America. We also saw growth in Europe, while Asia was flat and North America was down high single-digits.
Overall, our regional performance for the first quarter trends with the end market summary that Mike provided us earlier, with a strong start in North America. Industrial Segment performance is expected to trend with the market. We're planning on expanding margins in a down market in the second half of the year through productivity gains and cost controls. 
Please go to Slide 10. Operating margin on a reported basis increased 160 basis points from 5.9% to 7.5% from the first quarter 2015 to the first quarter of 2016. Mix was favorable for the quarter 40 basis points, largely offset by unfavorable volume and currency. Net pricing versus direct material inflation was the largest driver of margin improvement in the quarter, favorable by 160 basis points. Price realization was achieved across both the Climate and Industrial segments, which was higher than expected, and commodities remain deflationary.
Productivity versus other inflation was positive 10 basis points, driven by ongoing productivity actions, partially offset by other inflation. Year-over-year investments in other items reduced margins by 20 basis points. In the box, you can see that was comprised of 40 basis points from incremental investments, 20 basis points from higher restructuring costs, which were partially offset by a 40-basis-point improvement related to the absence of acquisition-related step-up costs incurred in 2015.
Overall, reported operating leverage exceeded 100% in the quarter, as we expanded margins in a low-growth environment.
Please go to Slide 11. Our Climate businesses had an excellent quarter in Q1. Adjusted segment income and EBITDA margins improved by 280 and 260 basis points to 9.8% and 12.4%, respectively. Increased volumes, favorable mix, price, direct material deflation and productivity offset other inflation and investment spending, the leverage for the Climate segment was 118% for the quarter. Revenues for the quarter were up 4% organically. 
Commercial HVAC organic revenues were up mid-single-digits, led by mid-teens unitary equipment shipments in North America and low-teens parts and service revenue in North America. Europe had low single-digit equipment growth and high single-digits services, contracting and parts. The Middle East had parts and services growth offset by declines in equipment sales.
Residential revenues were up mid-single-digits in Q1, with very strong leverage and significant margin improvements. 
Transport organic revenues were down slightly, but this does not tell the whole story for Q1. North America truck and trailer organic revenues were up mid-single-digits, and European truck and trailer organic revenues were up in the mid-20% range. Marine container organic revenues declined more than 60% in the first quarter, reflecting a soft start at various box builders for 2016.
Please go to Slide 12. First quarter revenues for the Industrial Segment were $681 million, down 5% on an organic basis. Compression technologies and services organic revenues were down low single-digits versus last year. Club Car organic revenues were up slightly versus prior year. Organic revenues in the Americas were down high single-digits, while revenues in Europe, Middle East and Africa were down low single-digits and were flat in Asia.
Industrial's adjusted operating margin of 9.8% was down 230 basis points compared with last year. Price and direct material deflation were positive. Productivity offset other inflation and volume and mix were unfavorable.
Please go to Slide 13. First quarter free cash flow of negative $46.3 million was favorable to prior year by $135 million. Strong operating income improvement and improved working capital performance were the primary drivers of the favorability. 
For the quarter, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 6.2%. We had strong collections in the quarter, with our days sales outstanding improving 1.3 days over the prior year and days payable outstanding improving 0.7 days. 
Inventory's on plan for the quarter, and we're well positioned to serve our customers as we enter the heavier volume second quarter. 
Capital expenditures of $40 million are lower than prior year due to capitalization of our ERP systems cost in the first quarter of 2015.
Please go to Slide 14. Capital allocation is a key area of strategy for us. We continue to invest in our businesses, and I think you'll agree that our results show the value of our product refresh strategies and our operational excellence programs, which are a part of our business operating system. 
We raised the annual dividend 10% in early 2016, with a goal of maintaining a dividend payout consistent with our peers. We have an M&A pipeline that reflects our desire to add to our products, technologies and channels, as outlined in our strategy. We are focused on building long-term value. We bought shares to offset benefit program dilution in the first quarter at an average share price of $51.10.
Please go to Slide 15. As always, our intention is to give you the best view of what we're seeing in our end markets sitting here today and how that translates to our revenue guidance for 2016. We've broken it down by major end markets and geographies. As you can see by the variation of colors and symbols, our end markets are seeing a wide variation in trends. We also added a column to show you our current versus prior thinking on organic revenue.
North American commercial HVAC and residential HVAC as well as European transport and commercial HVAC markets are generally positive, while global industrial markets have declined. We are forecasting transport markets in North America to be flat. Our forecast for North American trailer volumes has shifted from declines of 15% to down slightly for the year. Asian HVAC markets are expected to be flat to down, and industrial markets in Asia remain under pressure. Golf cart markets are slightly down, offset by increases in the utility vehicle markets. 
Both the growth forecasts shown here are on an organic basis. We're forecasting mid-single-digit growth in commercial HVAC in total, high single-digit growth in residential HVAC, which is essentially an all American -- North American business for us and a small increase in transport. We expect compression-related products and other equipments to be down high single-digits. We expect Club Car to be up low single-digits. 
Please go to Slide 16. Aggregating those market backdrops, we expect our reported revenues for the full year 2016 to be flat to up 2% versus 2015. Overall, foreign exchange will be a headwind of about 2 percentage points. While these revenue outlooks do not show a total change, the segment numbers reflect important updates.
We expect Climate revenues to be up 2% to 4% on a reported basis and 4% to 6% organically. For the Industrial segment, revenues are forecasted to be in the range of down 4% to down 6% on a reported basis and down 2% to down 4% organically.
For operating margins, we're excluding restructuring costs to get adjusted margins. We expect Climate adjusted operating margins to be in the range of 14% to 14.5%. We expect Industrial adjusted margins to be in the range of 12% to 12.5%. For the enterprise, we expect adjusted operating margins of 11.8% to 12.3%, a 30-basis-point improvement from our prior 2016 guidance and a year over improvement -- year-over-year improvement of 70 basis points. Operating leverage would be about 40% on an organic basis for the year.
Please go to Slide 17. Transitioning to earnings, the reported earnings per share range is estimated to be $5.39 to $5.54. Excluding restructuring and the Hussmann gain, the range is $3.95 to $4.10, an increase of 6% to 10% versus 2015 and a $0.13 increase from the midpoint of our prior guidance range of $3.80 to $4. As a note for 2016, currency is a headwind of about 2% of revenue. This reflects a full year tax rate forecast of 24% to 25% and an average diluted share count of 261 million shares for the full year. Second quarter 2016 revenues are forecast to be up 2% to 4% on a reported basis and 4% to 6% organically. We are projecting Climate revenues to grow mid-single-digits in Q2 and Industrial to decline mid-single-digits on a reported basis. Reported second quarter earnings per share are forecast to be $2.75 to $2.80. Back out $0.01 of restructuring and the $1.49 Hussmann gain to get to an adjusted range of $1.27 to $1.32. For the full year 2016, we expect to generate adjusted free cash flow, which excludes restructuring and the Hussmann proceeds, of $950 million to $1 billion.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Mike for a few closing comments."

The 160-basis-point spread between price and direct material deflation was a strong start to the year. What we expect for the first half of the year is strong performance on a year-over-year basis, because last year, we were still in an inflationary environment in the first half of 2015. So I think the second quarter will be slightly less favorable than the 160 basis points, but what we've adjusted the full year to now, Josh, is 80 basis points of favorable spread between price and direct material deflation. And so the first half, second half reflects basically the year-over-year compares to last year. And then as we look at the 80 basis points, so Q1 performance was driven by strong price performance, and we expect some of that to continue in Q2 and also strong performance from the materials side. Price is one of those areas where, I think, you never want to reach out and assume that you can continue to get price at a great execution level throughout the year in a strong deflationary environment. But as opposed to the commodities themselves, here's what we expect. So we have about 70% of our copper locked in for the year through our contracts. We expect that copper and aluminum are going to be fairly stable in terms of what happens throughout the rest of 2016. You'll see some ups and downs. But generally, I think those are going to be pretty stable. We're seeing a slight uptick in steel, but I don't think that's going to impact us in 2016. Because of the way that our contracts are written, we wouldn't start to see that until the very end of the year. So I think our -- I think our supply base and our commodity teams have done a great job of getting us the deflation that you're seeing in the results. I expect that to continue. All of the Tier 2 pricing really seemed to come in Q1 also. So I think we had a great environment, and I think we'll have a great result. So if you recall, we had given you a look at the full year, I think, 30 to 40 basis points when we last gave guidance, and as I said, we took that up to 80 basis points favorable spread for 2016."

And the reason that I say that is when we're looking at our tax strategy, intercompany debt is one element of some of the things that you can do, trading hubs, procurement hubs, making sure that your transfer pricing is absolutely aligned and other tax efficient projects can help us get to where we want to go. We've also been looking at a project that helps us look at effective tax rates by each of our SBUs, so that we're all working on tax as we do our plans and we do our forward looks, and I think that will help us with an overall tax strategy that doesn't get impacted by the proposed treasury regulations. We'll obviously continue to look at those and make sure that we understand all of the sort of derivative impacts that might be out there from the regulations. But no impact on the rate and no impact on our strategy going forward."

I noticed that you didn't take up the restructuring at all for the quarter, and if I recall correctly, there were some Cam shipments that were expected to be released in the beginning part of this year.

We are continuing to work on restructuring actions for the remainder of the year. And those are going to primarily be in Industrial. So we called out in the guidance about $0.01 for each of the next 3 quarters. I think what's important about the restructuring and the way that we've looked at it is that the restructuring really does have a payback within 2016. So we fully expect to realize the benefits of that $0.05 of restructuring. And that is also what will help us with my comment earlier in my prepared remarks about industrial margins improving in the back half of the year. So some of that productivity kicks in and some of the restructuring actions that were actually started almost a year ago are going to kick in. Now on the ECC [ph] side, we did have some shipments that had pushed out of Q4. We actually had some shipments that pushed out of Q1 also into Q2. But the ECC [ph] story is an interesting one. So if I look at first quarter bookings in total, bookings in total for the ECC [ph] business are actually up significantly in the first quarter. The majority of that is going to be in the products that are outside of the large centrifugal compressors. Those are really coming down. But -- so bookings are up, which is good. The revenues that we're seeing are really being impacted by the large centrifugals, but also importantly, as we think about ECC [ph] and that business is, we expect to really be on track with the revenue and the cost synergies for 2016 that we had outlined. So lots of moving pieces in the business, but I think you'll see some strength in the normal product and in the aftermarket and some bigger weakness and some shipments moving around in the large centrifugal compressors."

When you look at the type of paybacks that we're seeing in that business, we're getting numbers like 7 years, which is indicative of doing a good job around running the plants, the utilization that we've been able to achieve in our plants. You couple that with the lead time to bring on new capacity when the markets return, and that's a 24- to 30-month process, particularly in the machining centers that we would be moving or upgrading to do that. So we don't want to get whipsawed in doing any large restructuring when this thing turns around, because the margins come back very strong when the business volumes come back as well. So we're being cautious. Now we're always looking at the ideas that are on the table. If the underlying real estate values change or if tax incentives change from one location to another, it could swing something like that. We are very cautious about looking at an upswing in the lead time to bring capacity on when you need it, and we don't want to ever be in a situation at an upswing in the market to not have sufficient capacity at that point in time."

You still have positive price in the back half of the year. And you have just a skosh more volume in the back half of the year than the front. I don't want anyone to think there's a lot of volume recovery that we've built into this. We have not. But there is, by virtue of how the quarters pan out, roughly $50 million of additional revenue in the back half versus the front half. But it's productivity.

So there is a cost of that in the first half of the year and a benefit to that in the back half of the year, which is broadly in line with Sue's productivity comment. But a big piece of that productivity is literally the cost control around headcount, some of which is qualified, some of which is nonqualified, in terms of how we would actually account for it.

So I think as we look at the business, we're doing all of the right actions today to get the costs in line, but I think what we need is market recoveries and, I think, the revenues to return to sort of that upper $3 billion range for us to get into the 17% margins. We think that's doable, but I think the timeframe is really highly dependent on when the markets come back. Right now, we haven't seen -- the markets actually stop falling.

Can you just maybe speak to what you expect seasonally there or maybe just at a high level, what you expect for the margin in that business as we move through the year? And my guess is that seasonality is a bit muted because you're now seeing the onset of Commercial, which is a less seasonal business than some of these other things or just maybe help us square that.

Employees continue to see Ingersoll Rand as a great place to work, which in turn leads to a better customer experience, and that ultimately delivers shareholder value.
Our performance in the first quarter gives us confidence to raise our full year guidance, essentially flowing through the first quarter operational beat [ph]. Now this morning, I'm going to give you an overview of what we're seeing in our end markets across the globe and use the opportunity to talk a bit about how we're performing against this market backdrop to give you some color on how we're progressing for the year. I thought it'd be useful to highlight where our performance maps specifically to our overall strategy. And then I'm going to turn it over to Sue, and she'll take you through the quarter and our revised guidance for the remainder of the year. 
So over the past 16 weeks, I've spent the majority of my time on the road with leaders across the company, and during that time, I've met with customers from many of our business units across vertical markets and regions of the world. I've spent considerable time with our customer-facing employees, from service technicians to sales teams. And as always, I've spent time inside our operations talking with the people who are building and engineering our products, to gain their perspective on the maturity and momentum in our operating system. And I've witnessed good momentum in the deployment of our operating system and remain confident that there is still a long runway of opportunity in front of us. 
With that, let's go to Slide 4. And I'm going to note that all of my comments are on an organic basis. So they're going to exclude currency and acquisitions. Now I'll turn first to the North American Climate segment, where our business remains strong overall, and we expect this momentum to continue for the balance of the year. 
In commercial HVAC, recent put-in-place data continues to support mid-single-digit growth, and we believe this should continue through at least 2017. We continue to see strong growth in the retail and office markets. Within the institutional markets, education and government markets are also strong. We saw a low-teens revenue growth in the quarter, coupled with high single-digit bookings growth. 
I want to point out, too, that we expect to see a record for quarter 2 with commercial HVAC North American bookings, which should be up approximately 25% over quarter 2, as a result of some large institutional project awards. We expect to continue to outperform the overall market for the balance of the year. 
Additionally, we're executing well on the volume and saw excellent operating leverage in the quarter. Growth here is a direct reflection of the constant investment we've made over the past years. And we're seeing growth specifically in the areas where we have invested, whether in product growth teams, products or channel. 
As in 2015, we are beginning quarter 1 of '16 with double-digit growth in our Controls and Service business. With over 4,300 companies direct service mechanics and technicians, we believe we are now the largest provider of mechanical HVAC service to commercial customers in the world. Additionally, when we break out our critical growth programs from the base business, we are seeing mid-teens growth in these programs.
Overall execution has been excellent. With clear discipline, the management team is running the business through our operating system. Like commercial, our residential HVAC North American business is likely to continue to outperform the market as well. We're proud of this performance and what's ahead for this business.
I'm occasionally asked, ""What do investors misunderstand about Ingersoll Rand?"" and in reading some of the sell side reports, I think there is some misunderstanding about the success we've had in the residential HVAC business, and so I want to lay out some of the facts for you.
According to AHRI data, we have increased share each quarter, over the past 6 quarters, including the first quarter of 2016. For all of 2015 and continuing into quarter 1 of '16, we have a residential HVAC business with mid-teen EBITDA margins, which makes it accretive to the segment and IR as a whole. Quarter 1 brought mid-teen bookings growth for the second consecutive quarter and mid-single-digit revenue growth and very strong operating leverage. Our market outlook remains positive. We forecast 4% to 5% unit growth for the industry, and we anticipate our revenue growth to be in the high single-digit range for the year.
The residential team has done an outstanding job implementing our operating system across its full footprint. The team is running the entire business in a full product growth value stream, and it's showing in the execution. And strategically, we've executed well on our complete product refresh, repositioning of our channel strategies and in our connected home strategy, where we have a profitable business platform, robust diagnostic capabilities and nearly 200,000 Nexia enrollments to date. Additionally, connected home is a key driver of our residential controls business, which has more than doubled since 2011 and continues to grow at around 25% annually.
Shifting to North American transport refrigeration markets. As usual, the management team did a great job in the quarter and managed to improve their margins with high operating leverage. North America continues to hold up well, especially in the truck and trailer market. Our current view of truck and trailer has improved from our original view of the market from earlier this year. 
ACT raised its trailer units forecast to 47,000 units, which is up about 1% versus last year. Their prior forecast was for the market to be down 10%.
We view this market data as being a bit aggressive, but we have raised our own forecast for approximately 45,000 units. And you may recall that our own prior forecast was 39,000 trailer units. So even though we do expect the market to be down over the record performance last year, our view has improved from when we spoke in February.
Our truck refrigeration business is also solid, and the overall market for Class 3 to 7 trucks is showing moderate growth. And we continue to pursue growth strategies in rail, bus and auxiliary power units to continue to balance North American business into additional vertical markets.
As we look toward the HVAC and transport refrigeration markets in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, we plan to continue to outperform the market in the year ahead, with additional new product and service launches planned in the year and excellent management teams executing on the ground, delivering good margin expansion and cash conversion growth. 
We continue to do very well in Europe with organic bookings in the high single digits against a flattish market backdrop. We are seeing excellent uptake on the new product introductions, and like North America, the Service business also grew at a double-digit rate.
I visited our FRIGOBLOCK team and operations a few weeks ago. The progress made and the adoption of our operating system was absolutely amazing. With our FRIGOBLOCK acquisition, we've taken a step forward now in integrating hybrid electric technology into our product roadmap. The acquisition has been a great success for us.
Middle East markets are certainly softening. We're seeing a contraction in the number of building projects planned and would expect this to continue for some time, as lower oil prices are driving an investment pullback. 
Moving to Asia Pacific, it's difficult to know if markets have reached an inflection point in China. The data is mixed, and it's not that consistent month-to-month. Our performance, though, has been deviating from the market in a positive way due to investments in products and the focus we've put on in increasing our direct channel marketing investment to achieve fuller market coverage. Climate bookings in China were up mid-single digits in quarter 1 and up low teens for Asia Pacific as a whole.
Our strategic focus on growing the Service business continues to be successful in Asia, too, achieving a mid-teens growth rate in the quarter. 
We're also seeing strong mid-teens bookings growth in transport refrigeration equipment as the market continues to grow. And our local engineering and manufacturing teams continue to tune the product to local preferences.
Strong growth outside China is being driven by growth in Thailand, India and our performance in Singapore, along with good transport refrigeration growth in Australia. 
So concluding the HVAC and transport refrigeration geographic update will take us to Latin America, where markets remain very volatile, with strength in smaller but fast-growing markets in the Dominican Republic and Panama but deteriorating conditions in Brazil, Venezuela, Ecuador and Argentina. Conditions though in Mexico remained fundamentally sound. Organic revenue for the region was flat, with low-teen increases in HVAC equipment. So we're pleased with our performance in the market. We've expanded margins in a very tough and volatile Latin American marketplace. 
Let's move to Slide 5. And here, we'll look at the end markets for the Industrial segment of our business, and I'll start with an overall comment that our compression technologies business bookings and revenue were down organically low single digits in the quarter, with equipment essentially tracking the overall market, but with service up mid-single digits. Again, we are focusing on growing our service businesses across the enterprise and have been executing well on that strategy.
In North America, U.S. manufacturing capacity utilization remains relatively low, hitting 75% last quarter, which is the lowest point over the last 12 quarters, and large equipment CapEx, typical for what we would see for large centrifugal and large rotary air compressors, historically rebounds the utilization readings above 80%.
On one visit, I had the opportunity to meet with a major customer that's been around for decades, building small-scale LNG plants that range from 50,000 to 500,000 gallons per day. I asked this Ph.D. physicist what the most reliable leading indicator he would look for in his end markets, and he responded very simply by saying, ""It's when the telephone rings."" And fortunately, he did say the phone is beginning to ring, as is ours, in that area, but whether it's small-scale LNG systems or larger air compressors, our sense is that even early activity in large machine quoting activity probably will have little impact on large machine deliveries in 2016. 
To give you a little bit more color on this for the North American market, you look at compressors between 500 and 400-plus horsepower, the market for small compressors, those between 5 and 15 horsepower is up roughly 10%, but compressors larger than 250 horsepower are down more than 30% in the first 2 industry-reported months of the quarter. The small air compressors are quicker book and turn, with inventory restocking occurring in that category. 
We also believe we are seeing some restocking to the wholesale channel in our tools and fluid management business.
But our Material Handling team has done a great job managing their business, essentially holding the business to breakeven on a 50% reduction in revenue. So again, across the business, with the management team doing a very good job, exhibiting strong cost control and execution discipline on the backdrop of continued declines and projected global market growth.
In Europe, we're seeing increased exports and industrial production across Western Europe. Eastern Europe continues to be fairly weak. And for Asia-Pacific, the current environment continues to experience pricing pressure across the region, but we're cautiously optimistic to see if we have reached an inflection point, as manufacturing indices signal pockets of improvement in countries such as China, Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea, and China's power consumption has also shown growth in the first 2 months of the year, and India is seeing strong market growth in verticals like textile, pharma and food and beverage.
So rounding out the geographic update for Industrial segment, we'll go to Latin America, where volatility in the markets there across the region continues to be driven by political instability, and this has contributed to reduced investment in key verticals such as energy, oil and gas, mining and metals. However, other verticals like food and beverage, pharma and textile remain with positive outlooks.
So before turning it over to Sue, let me conclude by saying again we had an excellent quarter. We continue to invest in the products, service offerings and footprint of the company while using our operating system to deliver well above industry average results. 
And I'll turn it over to you, Sue, to cover the financial review and guidance."
280944,330034016,963787,"Ingersoll-Rand Plc, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Trane Technologies plc","Executives","Thank you, Mike. Let's go to Slide 6. Let's begin with an overview of the first quarter. Q1 was a strong operational quarter across all of our businesses. As you heard in Mike's comments, end markets continue to be strong in Climate and weaker than expect",2260,"Thank you, Mike. Let's go to Slide 6. Let's begin with an overview of the first quarter. Q1 was a strong operational quarter across all of our businesses. As you heard in Mike's comments, end markets continue to be strong in Climate and weaker than expected in Industrial. Our business operating system guided us through good execution in our factories and in our cost centers. Our focus was on good operating results in a low-growth environment. Our results show that we did not let cost get ahead of revenues in the quarter. 
Revenues grew slightly on a reported basis and were up 2% organically. The Climate segment grew 4% organically. Industrial was down 5%, both on a reported and an organic basis. HVAC revenues grew in each of our Climate businesses, led by commercial and residential in North America. 
Revenue in our Industrial businesses declined in the quarter with tough comparisons to the first quarter of 2015. Large centrifugal compressors and other industrial equipment were weaker than our estimates, but Club Car performed as expected, with low year-over-year growth.
Our adjusted operating margins grew 140 basis points year-over-year, with organic operating leverage of 75%. Adjusted segment margins grew 150 basis points, which shows the alignment between our operating performance and our Q1 results. Our strength was in price, direct material deflation and mix.
Earnings per share grew 32% year-over-year, exceeding our prior guidance. In Q1, our capital deployment actions, including -- included repurchasing $250 million of shares, and we increased our dividend by 10%. We completed the sale of our remaining interest in Hussmann on April 1, 2016. All impacts will appear in the second quarter. 
Please go to Slide 7. I've included a slide to reconcile our Q1 EPS actual results with our prior guidance. I've said on a few occasions this morning that our results were the result of good execution and operational performance. Price and direct material deflation were the largest drivers of the margin expansion in Q1. This is an area where everything went right in the quarter; i.e., there was no breakage, price was positive in both segments and direct material deflation was also very positive to our guidance. 
Cost savings and controls were a positive $0.03 for the quarter. Each of our businesses and corporate functions had favorable variances to start the year as we controlled spending while we evaluated our end market volatility.
Currency, share count and other income were about $0.01 each. We opportunistically repurchased shares earlier in the year than we would normally, and currency was a bit favorable to our guidance range. 
Restructuring was favorable to our guidance by $0.03 for the quarter. This is timing. We have identified projects to execute and continue to work on restructuring projects that have good returns and shorter paybacks, and we'll spend the remaining $0.03 throughout the remainder of 2016.
Please go to Slide 8. Orders for the first quarter of 2016 were up 4% organically. Climate orders were up 6% organically. Organic global commercial HVAC bookings were up high single digits, led by high-teens growth in North America unitary and double-digit growth in Asia applied.
We continue to see excellent growth in service controls, contracting and parts, with double-digit growth in the quarter. Originally, for commercial HVAC, we saw high single-digit booking increases with a high single-digit increase in North America and Europe; up low teens in Asia; and with declines in both the Middle East and Latin America. Residential bookings were up 17%. 
Organic transport orders were down low single digits with low-teens growth in truck and trailer in North America and Europe that were offset by lower container orders. 
Orders in the Industrial Segment were down 5% organically. We saw a low single-digit order decline in compression equipment, a low-teens decline in other industrial products and a mid-single-digit decline in Club Car. 
Performance in compression technologies was mixed in the first quarter. We had an improvement in small compressors, oil-free and in some of our component businesses, like dryers and filters. We also had a small improvement in our aftermarket business. These gains were offset by declines in core industrial compressors and by large centrifugal equipment.
Please go to Slide 9. This slide provides a directional view of our segment performance by region. In our Climate segment, which was up 4% in the first quarter, we saw solid performance in North America and flattish growth across Europe, Latin America and Asia. The Middle East was the only region that declined within the Climate segment. We're seeing a contraction in the number of building projects planned in the Middle East and would expect this to continue for some time, as lower oil prices are driving an investment pullback.
Our Industrial Segment performance in the first quarter, which was down 5%, is representative of the volatility that continues across the globe in the industrials market. Strong performance in Mexico contributed to double-digit growth in Latin America. We also saw growth in Europe, while Asia was flat and North America was down high single digits.
Overall, our regional performance for the first quarter trends with the end market summary that Mike provided us earlier, with a strong start in North America. Industrial Segment performance is expected to trend with the market. We're planning on expanding margins in a down market in the second half of the year through productivity gains and cost controls. 
Please go to Slide 10. Operating margin on a reported basis increased 160 basis points from 5.9% to 7.5% from the first quarter 2015 to the first quarter of 2016. Mix was favorable for the quarter 40 basis points, largely offset by unfavorable volume and currency. Net pricing versus direct material inflation was the largest driver of margin improvement in the quarter, favorable by 160 basis points. Price realization was achieved across both the Climate and Industrial segments, which was higher than expected, and commodities remain deflationary.
Productivity versus other inflation was positive 10 basis points, driven by ongoing productivity actions, partially offset by other inflation. Year-over-year investments in other items reduced margins by 20 basis points. In the box, you can see that was comprised of 40 basis points from incremental investments, 20 basis points from higher restructuring costs, which were partially offset by a 40-basis-point improvement related to the absence of acquisition-related step-up costs incurred in 2015.
Overall, reported operating leverage exceeded 100% in the quarter, as we expanded margins in a low-growth environment.
Please go to Slide 11. Our Climate businesses had an excellent quarter in Q1. Adjusted segment income and EBITDA margins improved by 280 and 260 basis points to 9.8% and 12.4%, respectively. Increased volumes, favorable mix, price, direct material deflation and productivity offset other inflation and investment spending, the leverage for the Climate segment was 118% for the quarter. Revenues for the quarter were up 4% organically. 
Commercial HVAC organic revenues were up mid-single digits, led by mid-teens unitary equipment shipments in North America and low-teens parts and service revenue in North America. Europe had low single-digit equipment growth and high single-digit services, contracting and parts. The Middle East had parts and services growth offset by declines in equipment sales.
Residential revenues were up mid-single digits in Q1, with very strong leverage and significant margin improvements. 
Transport organic revenues were down slightly, but this does not tell the whole story for Q1. North America truck and trailer organic revenues were up mid-single digits, and European truck and trailer organic revenues were up in the mid-20% range. Marine container organic revenues declined more than 60% in the first quarter, reflecting a soft start at various box builders for 2016.
Please go to Slide 12. First quarter revenues for the Industrial Segment were $681 million, down 5% on an organic basis. Compression technologies and services organic revenues were down low single digits versus last year. Club Car organic revenues were up slightly versus prior year. Organic revenues in the Americas were down high single digits, while revenues in Europe, Middle East and Africa were down low single digits and were flat in Asia.
Industrial's adjusted operating margin of 9.8% was down 230 basis points compared with last year. Price and direct material deflation were positive. Productivity offset other inflation and volume and mix were unfavorable.
Please go to Slide 13. First quarter free cash flow of negative $46.3 million was favorable to prior year by $135 million. Strong operating income improvement and improved working capital performance were the primary drivers of the favorability. 
For the quarter, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 6.2%. We had strong collections in the quarter, with our days sales outstanding improving 1.3 days over the prior year and days payable outstanding improving 0.7 days. 
Inventory's on plan for the quarter, and we're well positioned to serve our customers as we enter the heavier volume second quarter. 
Capital expenditures of $40 million are lower than prior year due to capitalization of our ERP systems cost in the first quarter of 2015.
Please go to Slide 14. Capital allocation is a key area of strategy for us. We continue to invest in our businesses, and I think you'll agree that our results show the value of our product refresh strategies and our operational excellence programs, which are a part of our business operating system. 
We raised the annual dividend 10% in early 2016, with a goal of maintaining a dividend payout consistent with our peers. We have an M&A pipeline that reflects our desire to add to our products, technologies and channels, as outlined in our strategy. We are focused on building long-term value. We bought shares to offset benefit program dilution in the first quarter at an average share price of $51.10.
Please go to Slide 15. As always, our intention is to give you the best view of what we're seeing in our end markets sitting here today and how that translates to our revenue guidance for 2016. We've broken it down by major end markets and geographies. As you can see by the variation of colors and symbols, our end markets are seeing a wide variation in trends. We also added a column to show you our current versus prior thinking on organic revenue.
North American commercial HVAC and residential HVAC as well as European transport and commercial HVAC markets are generally positive, while global industrial markets have declined. We are forecasting transport markets in North America to be flat. Our forecast for North American trailer volumes has shifted from declines of 15% to down slightly for the year. Asian HVAC markets are expected to be flat to down, and industrial markets in Asia remain under pressure. Golf cart markets are slightly down, offset by increases in the utility vehicle markets. 
Both the growth forecasts shown here are on an organic basis. We're forecasting mid-single-digit growth in commercial HVAC in total, high single-digit growth in residential HVAC, which is essentially an all American -- North American business for us and a small increase in transport. We expect compression-related products and other equipments to be down high single digits. We expect Club Car to be up low single digits. 
Please go to Slide 16. Aggregating those market backdrops, we expect our reported revenues for the full year 2016 to be flat to up 2% versus 2015. Overall, foreign exchange will be a headwind of about 2 percentage points. While these revenue outlooks do not show a total change, the segment numbers reflect important updates.
We expect Climate revenues to be up 2% to 4% on a reported basis and 4% to 6% organically. For the Industrial segment, revenues are forecasted to be in the range of down 4% to down 6% on a reported basis and down 2% to down 4% organically.
For operating margins, we're excluding restructuring costs to get adjusted margins. We expect Climate adjusted operating margins to be in the range of 14% to 14.5%. We expect Industrial adjusted margins to be in the range of 12% to 12.5%. For the enterprise, we expect adjusted operating margins of 11.8% to 12.3%, a 30-basis-point improvement from our prior 2016 guidance and a year over improvement -- year-over-year improvement of 70 basis points. Operating leverage would be about 40% on an organic basis for the year.
Please go to Slide 17. Transitioning to earnings, the reported earnings per share range is estimated to be $5.39 to $5.54. Excluding restructuring and the Hussmann gain, the range is $3.95 to $4.10, an increase of 6% to 10% versus 2015 and a $0.13 increase from the midpoint of our prior guidance range of $3.80 to $4. As a note for 2016, currency is a headwind of about 2% of revenue. This reflects a full year tax rate forecast of 24% to 25% and an average diluted share count of 261 million shares for the full year. Second quarter 2016 revenues are forecast to be up 2% to 4% on a reported basis and 4% to 6% organically. We are projecting Climate revenues to grow mid-single digits in Q2 and Industrial to decline mid-single digits on a reported basis. Reported second quarter earnings per share are forecast to be $2.75 to $2.80. Back out $0.01 of restructuring and the $1.49 Hussmann gain to get to an adjusted range of $1.27 to $1.32. For the full year 2016, we expect to generate adjusted free cash flow, which excludes restructuring and the Hussmann proceeds, of $950 million to $1 billion.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Mike for a few closing comments."

The 160-basis-point spread between price and direct material deflation was a strong start to the year. What we expect for the first half of the year is strong performance on a year-over-year basis, because last year, we were s",393,"Absolutely. So you're right. The 160-basis-point spread between price and direct material deflation was a strong start to the year. What we expect for the first half of the year is strong performance on a year-over-year basis, because last year, we were still in an inflationary environment in the first half of 2015. So I think the second quarter will be slightly less favorable than the 160 basis points, but what we've adjusted the full year to now, Josh, is 80 basis points of favorable spread between price and direct material deflation. And so the first half, second half reflects basically the year-over-year compares to last year. And then as we look at the 80 basis points, so Q1 performance was driven by strong price performance, and we expect some of that to continue in Q2 and also strong performance from the materials side. Price is one of those areas where, I think, you never want to reach out and assume that you can continue to get price at a great execution level throughout the year in a strong deflationary environment. But as opposed to the commodities themselves, here's what we expect. So we have about 70% of our copper locked in for the year through our contracts. We expect that copper and aluminum are going to be fairly stable in terms of what happens throughout the rest of 2016. You'll see some ups and downs. But generally, I think those are going to be pretty stable. We're seeing a slight uptick in steel, but I don't think that's going to impact us in 2016. Because of the way that our contracts are written, we wouldn't start to see that until the very end of the year. So I think our -- I think our supply base and our commodity teams have done a great job of getting us the deflation that you're seeing in the results. I expect that to continue. All of the Tier 2 pricing really seemed to come in Q1 also. So I think we had a great environment, and I think we'll have a great result. So if you recall, we had given you a look at the full year, I think, 30 to 40 basis points when we last gave guidance, and as I said, we took that up to 80 basis points favorable spread for 2016."

So I think the first way to start out that question, Josh, is to say that we -- we've looked at all of the proposed treasury regulations, and we don't expect those regulations to have an impact on our effective tax rate in 2016.

As we think about the tax strategy that I've talked about getting us into a low 20s type of tax rate on an ongoing basis, I also don't expect those regulations to have an impact on us getting into those areas. And the reason that I say that is when we're looking at our tax strategy, intercompany debt is one element of some of the things that you can do, trading hubs, procurement hubs, making sure that your transfer pricing is absolutely aligned and other tax efficient projects can help us get to where we want to go. We've also been looking at a project that helps us look at effective tax rates by each of our SBUs, so that we're all working on tax as we do our plans and we do our forward looks, and I think that will help us with an overall tax strategy that doesn't get impacted by the proposed treasury regulations.

I noticed that you didn't take up the restructuring at all for the quarter, and if I recall correctly, there were some Cam shipments that were expected to be released in the beginning part of this year.

We are continuing to work on restructuring actions for the remainder of the year. And those are going to primarily be in Industrial. So we called out in the guidance about $0.01 for each of the next 3 quarters. I think what's important about the restructuring and the way that we've looked at it is that the restructuring really does have a payback within 2016. So we fully expect to realize the benefits of that $0.05 of restructuring. And that is also what will help us with my comment earlier in my prepared remarks about industrial margins improving in the back half of the year. So some of that productivity kicks in and some of the restructuring actions that were actually started almost a year ago are going to kick in. Now on the ECC [ph] side, we did have some shipments that had pushed out of Q4. We actually had some shipments that pushed out of Q1 also into Q2. But the ECC [ph] story is an interesting one. So if I look at first quarter bookings in total, bookings in total for the ECC [ph] business are actually up significantly in the first quarter. The majority of that is going to be in the products that are outside of the large centrifugal compressors. Those are really coming down. But -- so bookings are up, which is good. The revenues that we're seeing are really being impacted by the large centrifugals, but also importantly, as we think about ECC [ph] and that business is, we expect to really be on track with the revenue and the cost synergies for 2016 that we had outlined. So lots of moving pieces in the business, but I think you'll see some strength in the normal product and in the aftermarket and some bigger weakness and some shipments moving around in the large centrifugal compressors."

When you look at the type of paybacks that we're seeing in that business, we're getting numbers like 7 years, which is indicative of doing a good job around running the plants, the utilization that we've been able to achieve in our plants. You couple that with the lead time to bring on new capacity when the markets return, and that's a 24- to 30-month process, particularly in the machining centers that we would be moving or upgrading to do that. So we don't want to get whipsawed in doing any large restructuring when this thing turns around, because the margins come back very strong when the business volumes come back as well. So we're being cautious. Now we're always looking at the ideas that are on the table. If the underlying real estate values change or if tax incentives change from one location to another, it could swing something like that. We are very cautious about looking at an upswing in the lead time to bring capacity on when you need it, and we don't want to ever be in a situation at an upswing in the market to not have sufficient capacity at that point in time."

You still have positive price in the back half of the year. And you have just a skosh more volume in the back half of the year than the front. I don't want anyone to think there's a lot of volume recovery that we've built into this. We have not. But there is, by virtue of how the quarters pan out, roughly $50 million of additional revenue in the back half versus the front half. But it's productivity.

So there is a cost of that in the first half of the year and a benefit to that in the back half of the year, which is broadly in line with Sue's productivity comment.

I don't see that stopping for us in 2016. I'm very optimistic, very proud of the work that's gotten done on the HVAC side in Europe. But I would also tell you, switching over to FRIGOBLOCK, FRIGOBLOCK was a family-run German company. If you put sort of a paradigm around that, you might think slow to change or difficult to incorporate on the operating system. What I found there was one of the fastest implementations of an operating system that we've put in place across the company. It's very exciting and the openness around that. And then, the openness of our transport refrigeration team to include that hybrid electric technology into the truck platform is also very positive. So I left Europe feeling very bullish."

Thank you, Zac and officially welcome to Ingersoll Rand in your first earnings call with us. As you can see from our earnings release this morning, we had another excellent quarter.

As you can see from our earnings release this morning, we had another excellent quarter. We had outstanding execution across the company delivering 15% EPS growth, record operating margin, share gains and strong cash flow despite challenging industrial markets. We're seeing strong momentum in the operating system that we've been installing and developing in the company over the past 6-plus years. 
As we did last quarter, I'd like to start out spending a few minutes linking this quarter's performance to the longer-term strategic direction of the company to help investors understand how we're building a more valuable, sustainable and less cyclical company over the longer term. 
Within our operating system, Operational Excellence and growth excellence have been cornerstones of the strategy from the beginning with our goal of becoming the very best operating company within our diversified or multi-industry peer group. This quarter we continued to deliver best-in-class operating leverage of 47% and our goal is to achieve top quartile organic growth for the quarter and for the year as well. There were a number of noteworthy milestones that showed clear progress in these areas during the quarter. 
Our residential HVAC business had another outstanding quarter with record revenue and profitability. We estimate that over the past quarter and 12 months, we now have benchmark profitability in this business and are seeing the benefits of a 5-year effort to refresh the product line, align and repositioned the channel and dramatically improve product management, manufacturing and supply chain. Our residential business is also a model for the deployment of product road teams for delivering market share and margin growth. 
Our commercial HVAC business in North America had record second quarter bookings and revenue. Similar to our residential HVAC story, we have executed on a consistent strategy with the goal to have the freshest, most energy-efficient and reliable product line in the industry and have supported that with consistent operational improvements along the way.
We continue to see double-digit increases in our controls business and high single-digit growth in our Service business, consistent with our strategy of balance equipment with controls and services. 
In the second quarter, Trane Commercial led the industry with a strong pipeline of new high-efficiency products, many of which earn our eco badge for innovation that improves energy efficiency as compared to legacy product platforms, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Examples this quarter included the North American announcement of the new CentraVac centrifugal chiller portfolio using next generation world-global warming refrigerant. The product is for large buildings and industrial applications to the U.S. and Canada. We also announced the service program to retrofit the existing installed base to the next-generation low global warming for refrigerant, which protects and provides a viable option for our customers past investments, while achieving their own sustainability goals.
In Europe, we announced another 4 new products. the [indiscernible], a new air-cooled chiller with nearly 0 global warming potential using next-generation refrigerants. Airfinity [ph], a complete new range of HVAC rooftop units designed to comply with the upcoming European eco designed regulations, they're light, compact and modular plug-and-play HVAC units that are compatible with wireless technology and designed to save time and money when retrofitting and improve efficiency of existing buildings across Europe. Extreme [ph], a range of a water-cooled screw chillers now available in Europe and the Middle East. The efficiency capacity ratings are unmatched by any other screw chiller in the market today. We hope this will become a preferred action for critical applications like data centers, hospitals, process cooling, district cooling and heating. And finally, Trane [ph] balance, our second generation of innovative multipipe systems for high-efficiency simultaneous heating and cooling. The system's repurpose energy that's rejected and use renewable energy for heating. 
Within our Thermo King North America, Europe and Middle East business, we're demonstrating that we have a more resilient business than in the past, expanded margins 270 basis points in a low-growth environment. As we noted in our initial guidance, we believe that we could maintain or even grow margins with a 15% North American trailer pull back and flat overall volumes. Today, the Thermo King business serves the refrigerated truck, trailer, marine container, air container, bus and rail, telematics and auxiliary power unit markets and the completeness of the portfolio has added to margins and the overall resiliency of the portfolio.
Also of interest both our residential HVAC and Thermo King North America, Europe and Middle East business units have been fully deployed a new ERP system for the past couple of quarters and we believe we're now seeing expected productivity throughout these business units. We continue to deploy new sites routinely in other business units each quarter. 
We continue to be pleased with the tremendous execution we're seeing on our HVAC and transport refrigeration business in Asia Pacific and in Latin America. Both regions demonstrated substantial margin improvement and share growth. HVAC bookings in Latin America were up 36% on an organic basis for the quarter, really outstanding performance by that team and that region. In Asia Pacific, our transport refrigeration business continues to grow with another 23% increase in bookings and 25% increase in revenue. Both are examples of finding pockets of growth within generally weak markets and then capitalizing on those opportunities. 
Turning to our Industrial Segment. I want to start by saying that I have tremendous confidence in our leaders running these business units and they're operating in a very challenging environment. Within Compression Technologies in North America, it's the largest market for equipment, the 250-horsepower rotary markets is down 20%. And all other size ranges are also down in the high single-digits range with only small 5 to 15-horse compressors showing year-over-year growth. Again, to this backdrop, we're performing well and supplementing the business with service bookings of approximately 10% in the quarter. Remember, too, that the last time we emerged with down Industrial sales cycle, we grew margins of nearly 7 full points in a 24-month period.
Our Fluid Management business continues to perform well with modest growth, and we're seeing continued weakness in the tools business. And no sign of recovery in our Material Handling business, which provides to the oil and gas industry. 
Club Car continues to broaden its strategy and reach outside of golf with small electric vehicles in the commercial and consumer segments.
Turning to growth excellence, which encompasses the full value stream from strategic analytics, product management, new product and technology introduction, sales management and service and support, this has been the cornerstone of our long-term strategy. We believe the product, channel and service footprint investments we have made over the past 5 to 7 years are paying off. And it's clearly evident in the HVAC and transport refrigeration business units. And we believe it'll also be the case for our compression technology business unit that has been doing a similar investment program over the past couple of years which will continue over the next several years.
Even as industrial markets are challenging today, we continue the investment in the Compression Technologies business because we expect we'll be rewarded as the market recovers. As one example, one of the product road teams operates in the compression technology business and covers a specific product portfolio, which equates to about 10% of the overall revenue of that business. Within the product road team, we're seeing year-to-date bookings increases of 30% and revenues increasing by 17%. 
Its strength in our Climate segment, capacity, utilization and our shared Climate and industrial plants and operations and leveraging our technology teams, that's allowing us the opportunity to stay the course on critical growth programs in our Industrial segment. We have continued to invest in strategic growth programs across the company through both good and difficult times and the benefits of doing so are clear. Our designated strategic growth programs, many of which are managed through our product road teams process, are growing at a rate 3x faster than the underlying growth rate of the company. 
As another example, within the commercial HVAC business in North America, Europe and the Middle East, our strategic growth programs are growing at a 14% rate of this year. And for the company, 80-plus percent of our growth is coming from investments and focus on these critical strategic growth programs.  So as is our model, we'll leverage the success and build and excellent with full deployment of this element of our operating system in the years ahead. 
Going forward, we see multiple investment opportunities to deliver long-term growth through innovation and differentiation of the product, software and services we provide. I don't think anyone in this call needs another presentation on the Internet of Things on the possibilities for how that will transform competition and opportunity. This macro trend is the squarely centered on nearly every growth and productivity strategy in our company, whether it's connected buildings, intelligent monitoring and service, diagnostic and self-healing systems, telematics, consumer marketing and fulfillment and too many other digital concepts to list. We're funding a number of these ideas centrally within the corporate expense line and are likely to accelerate this incubation investment later this year. Incremental 2016 investment for this activity is already embedded in our guidance. 
Finally, building on the culture element of remodel. High-quality teams and deep employee engagement are critical to any sustained transformation, and I'm pleased that we continue to excel in these areas. One source of great pride within Ingersoll Rand is our ability to walk the talk around sustainability. To make a point, we continue to see benchmark level employee engagement; world-class safety performance for any segment of industry; energy reduction of 5% on an absolute, not volume adjusted basis; a 14% reduction in water consumption, also on an absolute basis; and similar reductions on both hazardous and nonhazardous waste. 
So Sue will take you through the quarter in detail that I felt was important to align how today's results were enforced the strategy of the company, how we intend to get delivering great results and why you should believe we're building a more valuable, sustainable and less cyclical company for our shareholders. 
With that I'll turn it over to Sue."

As Mike has discussed, Q2 was another strong operational quarter for us and it shows through the financial results that",2334,"Thank you, Mike. Let's go to Slide 4. This is a summary slide that I like to begin with and give you some takeaway from today's call. 
As Mike has discussed, Q2 was another strong operational quarter for us and it shows through the financial results that we posted. In the second quarter, we drove year-over-year organic revenues higher by 3%, adjusted margins up 80 basis points with a leverage of over 45% and adjusted earnings per share up 15% against the backdrop of a very slow low-growth environment and particularly, challenged industrial markets.
Adjusted earnings per share of $1.38 exceeded our guidance range of $1.27 to $1.32 by $0.08 at the midpoint and $0.06 at the high end. Our $0.08 beat versus our midpoint was driven by exceptionally strong performance in our Climate segment, partially offset by challenged markets in our Industrial Segment and about $0.06 beat from a lower tax rate in the quarter. And as I'll also discuss in detail later, we believe we'll maintain a 200 basis point in our average tax rate in our previous guidance of to 24% to 25% for 2016.
We also posted strong year-to-date free cash flow of $348 million, up $293 million from the prior year. We're seeing the benefits of our focus on working capital management and our business operating system and with that, we're raising our free cash flow forecast to $1 billion to $1.1 billion, excluding the proceeds from the sale of Hussmann. 
Let's turn to segment results. The Climate segment continues to exceed expectations driven largely by outstanding execution in both commercial and residential HVAC with mid-single-digit growth and high single-digit growth, respectively. Margins also showed healthy expansion driven by strong volume, productivity improvements and material deflation of nonferrous commodities. We also continue to invest in the business in order to derive sustainable growth. 
The Industrial Segment end markets are more challenged than previously forecast and we experienced negative growth in all the major end markets, except small electric vehicles, which is our Club Car business; and Fluid Management where we continue to see growth. Across industrial, we continue to take measures to drive productivity, shift our mix further towards more profitable aftermarket services and parts markets and to make prudent cost reductions in the business. 
We continue to be committed to a dynamic capital allocation strategy focused on delivering high returns to shareholders over the long term. Our strong free cash flow generation and cash balances provide us important option as the markets evolve. 
And lastly, we bumped up at the bottom end of our guidance range by $0.05 and our current adjusted continuing operations earnings per share for 2016 is $4 to $4.10. This update reflects expected continued strong growth in our Climate segment and tailwinds resulting from a lower go-forward structural tax rate of 22% to 23%, partially offset by continued weakness in our Industrial end markets where we're not seeing the signs of recovery we had originally anticipated in our prior guidance. 
Now if you go to Slide 5. Let's begin discussing additional details regarding the second quarter. Our business operating system again guided through good execution in our factories and in our cost centers. Our focus was on good operating results in a low-growth environment and we delivered against that objective. 
Enterprise revenues were up 3% organically with Climate up 5% and industrial down 3%. HVAC revenues grew in each of our Climate businesses, led by commercial and residential HVAC in North America. 
Thermo King North America and EMEIA truck and trailer revenues continue to be strong in the quarter. 
Industrial markets declined in the quarter, consistent with the overall market. Club Car performed as expected, with mid-single-digit growth year-over-year. 
Our adjusted operating margins grew 80 basis points year-over-year with operating leverage exceeding 45%. Our strength in margin expansion was driven through price realization, productivity gains and direct material deflation. We've inserted a margin table on the slide and that'll illustrates some of the items I just talked about. 
We completed the sale of our remaining interest in Hussmann on April 1, 2016, for a gain of approximately $398 million.
Let's go to Slide 6. Orders for the second quarter of 2016 were up 3% organically. Climate orders were up 6% organically. Organic global commercial HVAC bookings were up high single-digits, similar to the first quarter, led by low-teens growth in North America of applied and unitary and strong growth of 36% in Latin America, which was against a relatively easy compare in 2015. 
Asia bookings continue to be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter and were down in Q2 overall, while China was up low single digits. We continue to see excellent growth in service, controls and contracting with low-teens growth in the quarter. 
Residential bookings were up low teens, representing the fourth consecutive quarter of bookings growth above 10%. 
Organic transport orders were down mid-single digits with order growth in overseas market offset by declines in North America trailer and auxiliary power units. Consistent with the expectations we set out earlier in the year, we continue to expect bookings to decline in North America trailer in the second half of the year and this is built into our guidance. Transport orders in Asia were up 23% in the second quarter. 
Overall, we anticipated some recovery in the Industrial markets as we moved through Q2 and the balance of the year but we're seeing continued challenges and market declines. Net orders in the Industrial Segment were down 5% organically. We saw high single-digit order decline in Compression Technologies and services. 
Services continue to be a bright spot and were up high single-digit as we continue to focus on the business with higher-margin product streams. We saw low-teens decline in other industrial products and a high single-digit increase in Club Car. 
Now if you'll go to Slide 7, please. This slide provides a directional view of our segment revenue performance by region. In our Climate segment, which was up 5% in the second quarter, we saw solid performance in North America and low single-digit growth across Europe, Asia and Latin America. We saw a decline in the Middle East, consistent with the contraction in the number of building projects planned, primarily in Saudi Arabia and we'd expect this to continue for some time as low oil prices are driving an investment pullback. 
Our Industrial Segment performance in the second quarter, which was down 3% is representative of the ongoing volatility and declining markets that continue across the globe in industrial markets.  Our regional industrial markets declined except for Europe and Asia, which were up.
Let's go to Slide 8, please. Climate revenues of $2.9 billion for the quarter were strong, up 5% organically. Commercial HVAC organic revenues were up mid-single digits, led by 20% growth in North America contracting and upper single-digit growth in unitary equipment shipments in North America. 
Europe had equipment growth in the mid-teens and high single-digit growth in services, contracting and parts. The Middle East revenues declined largely due to a share pullback in Saudi Arabia, as I mentioned earlier. 
Residential revenues were up record levels and up high single digits in the second quarter. 
Transport organic revenues were up low single digits in the quarter. Truck and trailer organic revenues were up high single digits overall, with improved revenues in North America, Europe and Asia. We also had a high single-digit improvement in aftermarket volumes. Marine container organic revenues declined more than 60% in the second quarter, reflecting a soft first half at various box builders for 2016. We also had lower sales auxiliary power units reflecting the decline in the class 8 market. 
Please go to Slide 9. Our Climate operating margins grew 250 basis points year-over-year. Our strength was broad-based based on volume, price, direct material deflation and productivity gains and we continue to invest in the business for sustainable growth. 
Please go to Slide 10. Second quarter revenues for the Industrial Segment were $753 million, down 3% on an organic basis. Compression Technologies and services organic revenues were down low single digits versus last year. And industrial products were down mid-teens with growth in Fluid Management and declines in Material Handling equipment and tools. 
Small electric vehicles, also known as Club Car, organic revenues were up mid-single digits versus prior year from gains and equipment and aftermarket Regionally, the decline in organic industrial revenues was led by a mid-single-digit decline in the Americas and the Middle East. Asia and Europe were up modestly, partially offsetting the declines.
Please go to Slide 11. Industrial's operating margin of 9.1% was down 250 basis points compared with last year. Lower volumes were the largest driver, partially offset by pricing, material deflation and productivity. Despite the downturn, we continue to invest in the business for the long term.  Additionally, capitalized costs related to new product engineering and development were reclassified to the income statement in Q2, which were a drag on margin of approximately $8 million or 1.1 percentage points for the Industrial segment. Excluding this adjustment, Industrial adjusted margins were 10.9% in Q2. 
Moving forward, we expect Industrial Segment performance to trend with the market. We're planning on expanding margins in a down market in the second half of the year through aftermarket growth, productivity gains and cost controls. 
Please go to Slide 12. Our June year-to-date free cash flow of $348 million was favorable to prior year by $293 million. Strong operating income improvement and improved working capital performance were the primary drivers of the favorability. Because of our strong to the year, we have raised our free cash flow forecast range to $1 billion to $1.1 billion from our previous range of $950 million to $1 billion. 
For the quarter, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 5.6%. We had strong collections in the quarter with our days sales outstanding improving 0.6 days over the prior year and days payable outstanding improving 0.7 days. Inventories on plan for the quarter and we're well positioned to serve our customers. 
Please go to Slide 13. Our cash performance in the second quarter and our expectations for the year enable us to: One, continue to invest in the strategic growth programs that Mike outlined earlier. In addition to the core strategic investments, we're also investing in our term growth through innovation and differentiated product in such areas as connected building, in which an intelligent monitoring and the self-healing systems and just to name a few. Two, we'll also maintain a strong balance sheet with a BBB credit metrics. And three, we'll also maintain -- we'll also retain optionality relative to paying a competitive dividend up, acquisitions to build the business and share repurchases.
Please go to Slide 14. As always our attention is to give our best view of what we're seeing our end markets sitting here today and how that translates to our revenue guidance for 2016. We've broken it down by major end markets and geographies. As you can see by the variation of colors and symbols, our end markets are seeing a wide variation in trends. 
North America commercial HVAC and residential HVAC, as well as European transport and commercial HVAC markets are generally positive, while global industrial markets are declining. We're forecasting transport markets in North America to be down low single digits. Our forecast for North America trailer volumes has not changed and we expect the market to be down was slightly for the year. This implies a decline in the second half after single-digit growth in the first half of the year. 
Asian HVAC markets are expected to be flat to down and industrial markets in Asia remain under pressure. Golf cart markets are slightly down offset by increases in the utility vehicle markets. 
All of our revenue growth forecast are shown on an organic basis. We're forecasting mid-single-digit growth in commercial HVAC in total; high single-digit growth in residential HVAC, which is essentially an all North American business for us; and a flat to small decline in transport globally.
We expect compression-related products and other industrial equipment to be down high single digits. We expect Club Car to be up low single digits. 
Please go to Slide 15. Aggregating those market backdrops, we expect to our organic revenues for the full year 2016 to be up 2% to 3% versus 2015 with foreign exchange presenting a headwind of about 1 percentage point. We expect Climate revenues to be up 4% to 5% organically. For Industrial, we expect organic revenues to be down 4% to 5%. 
For operating margins, we're excluding restructuring costs to get to adjusted margins. We expect adjusted operating margins in Climate to be between 14% and 14.5%. We expect adjusted Industrial margins to be between 10% and 11%. And for the enterprise, we expect adjusted operating margin of 11.5% to 12%. 
Please go to Slide 16. Transitioning to earnings. The reported earnings per share range is estimated to be $5.47 to $5.57 and the adjusted range is $4 to $4.10 versus our prior guidance range of $3.95 to $4.10. Adjusted numbers exclude restructuring and the Hussmann gain.
Our full year guidance reflects a tax rate forecast of 22% to 23% and an average diluted share count of approximately 261 million shares. The tax rate reflects a 200 basis point improvement versus prior guidance of 24% to 25%. 
For the third quarter of 2016, revenues are forecasted to be up by approximately 3% organically. We're projecting Climate revenues to grow mid-single digits in Q3 and Industrial to decline low single digits. Adjusted third quarter earnings per share are forecasted to be between $1.25 and $1.30, excluding restructuring charges of about $0.01.
For the full year 2016, we also raised our free cash flow expectations and now expect free cash flow to be between $1 billion and $1.1 billion, excluding restructuring charges and proceeds from the sale of Hussmann. 
And with that, I'm going to turn it back to Mike for a few closing comments."

I'm pleased with the progress and the momentum and the implementation of our operating system and the growing depth and the bench strength throughout the company that makes the operating system come to live through continuous improvement. 
We're building a stronger, more valuable and more sustainable and less cyclical Ingersoll Rand than ever before and it's exciting to me and leaders throughout the company to be part of that transformation and to help create a bright future with more individual development possibilities for all our people throughout the world. 
Results we reported this morning are a direct result of the strategic work, the persistent, the tenacity of the talented people that represent the unique culture we're building. It is a strategic advantage and it's the toughest thing in any business for a competitor to copy. 
There are a few takeaways I want to point out to you as we had to the back half of the year and into 2017. First, the Industrial businesses are running effectively in a very tough environment. The management team is aggressively taking and we'll continue to take the right actions to reduce the overall cost structure of the business. And is committed to protecting that key product and service investments in a build long-term growth and margin expansion when the markets improve.
Second, the transport market is performing as we expected. And as we said at the beginning of the year, we expect the first half results to be up and the back half of the year would be down. The management team ahs done an effective job anticipating and seeing around the corners and is proactively taking the actions doing strong margin performance continues. 
Third, commodity deflation has been a tailwind during the first half of the year and it's going to moderate to neutral in the back half of the year. We have a long track record of managing the price material input equation very effective in we're going to continue to do so going forward. 
And finally, let me say, we are proactively reviewing both prior restructuring considerations as well as an new actions as our business, markets and even the input variables into our own models continue to evolve and although we don't have any immediate that the restructuring actions to today to announce today, we won't hesitate to take additional prudent restructuring actions going forward. 
So with that, Sue and I will be happy to take your questions."

What we expect to see in the back half of the year is we expect to see that steel, particularly in the fourth quarter, is going to turn more inflationary than deflationary. So that's part of what's happening with the flatter margins. We're also going to continue to invest in the overall business in the back half of the year.

There's a tremendous effort underway at reducing cost in that business, much of not visible through what you to say would be qualified restructuring, much of that is just reduction in place and just other containment actions being taken in the business. So that really, when I say, the business is being run effectively, I have no doubt that all the rest are being turned over with the exception of protecting this a political investment pool that is important to us going forward. And I'll use that one example for you because I happen to be the example of the product road team is the one product area that we have launched in that portfolio, and we're getting tremendous results with that.

It's a great question and thanks for stepping back and looking at it. Because I look back over the 7 years that I've been in this role and I remember when Industrial was the sweetheart of the portfolio, right, from '09 to '11 even through '13, and we're expanding margins so fast that it afforded us the opportunity to all the great investment we made in Trane, resi and commercial businesses, which is really what you're seeing the numbers that you're seeing today in that business. And so now it's flip remember that was all happening with no real commercial, certainly, no institutional support coming from construction markets. And now that's flipped. And it allowed us opportunity to keep factor is fairly noted. It's given us the opportunity to keep them technical professionals highly engaged in the developments of product. And all that really just a really sets of aware at some point when the commercial markets it HVAC slows down, when institutional eventually fades. Our hope is that we've got a strong, refreshed energy-efficient, reliable portfolios sitting particularly in Compression Technologies, and we're going to leverage that just like we did from '09 to '11 when it grew 7 full points. We are very leverage year toward some of those fixed costs. Where we play in the market is in the big machines. Is not the nut and not talking about Cameron plus, all the 250 to 400-horse centrifugal air compressors, of which we're the leader now in that area, and we don't said that much in the vacuum and blower business, which has some growth in it. So we have a product portfolio and a position in the market in these larger machines, that's what getting hurt right now. And we're not going to throw the baby out with the bathwater here on that for sure. That's why in addition to I mentioned product development, but the machining investments I mentioned last call in this call, those are going to continue. And we'll put $50 million in the machining in this downturn so when we emerge out of this thing, we're going to be more productive. Hope that it's just not 7 points of margin, it's more than 7 points of margins coming back. So Jeff, I think I really have a got my head around the value of what we created around integrating the portfolio. And over the long run, not really so interested in a flash and the pan around some multiples for short-cycle. I'm really interested in building the value of the company over the long run. And again, step back 2009, Jeff, if you invested back in 2009, you're a very happy investor and I thank you for all the Christmas cards we get to that effect.

But I'm by kind use the same passion that Mike had in his comments on the multiples and what we've built at Ingersoll Rand. From a perspective of our cash generation and then our ensuing capital allocation, we're really trying to create longer-term shareholder value with the cash that we're generating. And so what we've seen that it's been really successful for us is in investing in our products and investing in areas like energy efficiency and sustainability. Those are proven for us in terms of a building our growth excellence. If we look at Operational Excellence, all of the work that we've gone and invested in the company, whether in our factories or in our overall processes with the business operating system, all of that has shown to be something that has worked very well for us. So our preference, as we think about capital allocation and your question, is to really invest and grow the company. So to be more specific than in terms of what that means, it means I want to continue to invest. It means I want to continue to do all those things. It means we want to look at the M&A pipeline. But what we have is an opportunity where we can be patient, we can wait for the right opportunity and not just take the cash that we're generating and run out and buy something. So we're really, really thinking about investments. We're thinking about M&A, dividends are extremely important to us. We understand that. And we're going to continue to have the dividends that are in line with our peer payout ratios and we'll also be opportunistic about share repurchase. I don't want to take that completely off the table. But if I had set our preference up, it's going to be able to longer-term value through investments in the business and acquisitions."

So all the other projects just aren't happening and so it sort of gets labeled with oil and gas. And so let me step back and also add to what Mike was talking about when I started talking about Industrial early in 2016 and I was sort of breaking it down into pieces for you. What I said was that Club Car was about 20% of the business and it was going to be up sort of low to mid-single digits, that the aftermarket was about 30% of the Industrial segment and that it was going to be up low single digits. Then I talked about the big machines being down in excess of 20% and some of the small rotary and small air being up slightly for year. And then some of the other businesses like the Material Handling business and the tools business is being down sort of mid-single digits for the year. If I take that and transform that now into what we're seeing in 2016 after 2 quarters, Club Car, the same spot. They're growing in the mid-single-digits range and that's on track. The aftermarket piece of Industrial is continuing to grow. So you've got sort of solid footing with about 50% of the business. However, when you get over into the other side where I talked about, if I talked about large machines being down 20%, as Mike said, they're now down 50%, so they're down way larger than what we thought. And even some of the smaller equipment is really much more pressured than I thought it was going to be added said to have a being up sort of low single digits, it's going to be down. So you really just have a lot of dynamics that are going on there with the Industrial business. And to bring it back and wrap it around your question about oil and gas and projects, again, it's really the derivative effects for us in most of our industrial businesses where the large projects just aren't happening and the ones that are happening are much more competitive."

That growth was really around shipping product that was [indiscernible] but we really haven't seen the pickup in China per se. If you look at China nonresidential construction, it's still a negative, but for the past 6 or 7 months, it's been trending up, I think it's gone from negative 17% up to negative 2%, but hasn't cross over. We really would have thought at this point, we would've seen more pickup. The nice thing in China buildings are built and about half this be that we see in other parts of the world and our cycle times for delivery can be half of what they are in other parts of the world as well. So if we did see China recovery on the HVAC side. You need to see that the, say, within a 6-month or not a 12-month period but as you get into July you're not really seeing the bookings here. It just a way of really derisking the forecast. And really, that derisking is a theme coming in on the industrial portfolio to. At this point, if we haven't seen bookings on large machines or bookings on the yes, midsize rotary machines at this point in time, that reality is just you call it what we've done and so we hope we used got into the bottom of the cycle."

280944,370127974,1013711,"Ingersoll-Rand Plc, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Trane Technologies plc","Executives","Great. Thank you, Zac, and officially welcome to Ingersoll Rand in your first earnings call with us. As you can see from our earnings release this morning, we had another excellent quarter. We had outstanding execution across the company delivering 15%",1716,"Great. Thank you, Zac, and officially welcome to Ingersoll Rand in your first earnings call with us. 
As you can see from our earnings release this morning, we had another excellent quarter. We had outstanding execution across the company delivering 15% EPS growth, record operating margin, share gains and strong cash flow despite challenging industrial markets. We're seeing strong momentum in the operating system that we've been installing and developing in the company over the past 6-plus years. 
As we did last quarter, I'd like to start out spending a few minutes linking this quarter's performance to the longer-term strategic direction of the company to help investors understand how we're building a more valuable, sustainable and less cyclical company over the longer term. 
Within our operating system, operational excellence and growth excellence have been cornerstones of the strategy from the beginning, with our goal of becoming the very best operating company within our diversified or multi-industry peer group. This quarter we continued to deliver best-in-class operating leverage of 47% and our goal is to achieve top quartile organic growth for the quarter and for the year as well. There were a number of noteworthy milestones that showed clear progress in these areas during the quarter. 
Our residential HVAC business had another outstanding quarter with record revenue and profitability. We estimate that over the past quarter and 12 months, we now have benchmark profitability in this business and are seeing the benefits of a 5-year effort to refresh the product line, align and reposition the channel and dramatically improve product management, manufacturing and supply chain. Our residential business is also a model for the deployment of product growth teams for delivering market share and margin growth. 
Our commercial HVAC business in North America had record second quarter bookings and revenue. Similar to our residential HVAC story, we have executed on a consistent strategy with the goal to have the freshest, most energy-efficient and reliable product line in the industry and have supported that with consistent operational improvements along the way. We continue to see double-digit increases in our controls business and high single-digit growth in our service business, consistent with our strategy to balance equipment with controls and services. 
In the second quarter, Trane Commercial led the industry with a strong pipeline of new high-efficiency products, many of which earn our EcoWise badge for innovation that improves energy efficiency as compared to legacy product platforms, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Examples this quarter include the North American announcement of the new CenTraVac centrifugal chiller portfolio using next-generation low global warming potential refrigerant. The product is for large buildings and industrial applications in the U.S. and Canada. We also announced the service program to retrofit the existing installed base to the next-generation low global warming potential refrigerant, which protects and provides a viable option for our customers' past investment, while achieving their own sustainability goals.
In Europe, we announced another 4 new products, the Sintesis eXcellent, a new air-cooled chiller with nearly 0 global warming potential using next-generation refrigerants. Airfinity, a complete new range of HVAC rooftop units designed to comply with the upcoming European Union EcoDesign regulations. They're light, compact and modular plug-and-play HVAC units that are compatible with wireless technology and designed to save time and money when retrofitting, and improve the efficiency of existing buildings across Europe. XStream, a range of a water-cooled screw chillers now available in Europe and the Middle East. The efficiency and capacity ratings are unmatched by any other screw chiller in the market today. We hope this will become a preferred option for critical applications like data centers, hospitals, process cooling, district cooling and heating. And finally, Trane Balance, our second generation of innovative multi-pipe systems for high-efficiency simultaneous heating and cooling. The systems repurpose energy that's rejected and use renewable energy for heating. 
Within our Thermo King North America, Europe and Middle East business, we're demonstrating that we have a more resilient business than in the past, expanding margins 270 basis points in a low-growth environment. As we noted in our initial guidance, we believe that we could maintain or even grow margins with a 15% North American trailer pullback and flat overall volumes. Today, the Thermo King business serves the refrigerated truck, trailer, marine container, air container, bus and rail, telematics and auxiliary power unit markets. And the completeness of the portfolio has added to margins and the overall resiliency of the portfolio.
Also of interest, both our residential HVAC and Thermo King North America, Europe and Middle East business units have been fully deployed of a new ERP system for the past couple of quarters and we believe we're now seeing expected productivity throughout these business units. We continue to deploy new sites routinely in other business units each quarter. 
We continue to be pleased with the tremendous execution we're seeing at our HVAC and transport refrigeration business in Asia Pacific and in Latin America. Both regions demonstrated substantial margin improvement and share growth. HVAC bookings in Latin America were up 36% on an organic basis for the quarter, really outstanding performance by that team and that region. In Asia Pacific, our transport refrigeration business continues to grow with another 23% increase in bookings and 25% increase in revenue. Both are examples of finding pockets of growth within generally weak markets and then capitalizing on those opportunities. 
Turning to our Industrial segment. I want to start by saying that I have tremendous confidence in our leaders running these business units. They're operating in a very challenging environment. Within compression technologies in North America, it's our largest market for equipment, the 250-horsepower to 400-horsepower contact-cooled rotary market is down 20%. And all other size ranges are also down in the high single-digit range, with only small 5- to 15-horse compressors showing year-over-year growth. Against this backdrop, we're performing well and supplementing the business with service bookings of approximately 10% in the quarter. Remember, too, that the last time we emerged with down industrial cycle, we grew margins nearly 7 full points in a 24-month period.
Our Fluid Management business continues to perform well with modest growth, and we're seeing continued weakness in the tools business. And no sign of recovery in our Material Handling business, which provides hoist and winches to the oil and gas industry. 
Club Car continues to broaden its strategy and reach outside of golf with small electric vehicles in the commercial and consumer segments.
Turning to growth excellence, which encompasses the full value stream from strategic analytics, product management, new product and technology introduction, sales management and service and support, this has been another cornerstone to our long-term strategy. We believe the product, channel and service footprint investments we have made over the past 5 to 7 years are paying off. It's clearly evident in the HVAC and transport refrigeration business units. And we believe it'll also be the case for our compression technology business unit that has been doing a similar investment program over the past couple of years, which will continue over the next several years.
Even as industrial markets are challenging today, we continue the investment in the compression technologies business because we expect we'll be rewarded as the market recovers. As one example, one of the product growth teams operates in the compression technology business and covers a specific product portfolio, which equates to about 10% of the overall revenue of that business. Within the product growth team, we're seeing year-to-date bookings increases of 30% and revenues increasing by 17%. 
Its strength in our Climate segment, capacity, utilization in our shared Climate and industrial plants and operations and leveraging our technology teams, that's allowing us the opportunity to stay the course on critical growth programs in our Industrial segment. We have continued to invest in strategic growth programs across the company through both good and difficult times and the benefits of doing so are clear. Our designated strategic growth programs, many of which are managed through our product growth team process, are growing at a rate 3x faster than the underlying growth rate of the company. 
As another example, within the commercial HVAC business in North America, Europe and the Middle East, our strategic growth programs are growing at a 14% rate of this year. And for the company, 80-plus percent of our growth is coming from investment and focus on these critical strategic growth programs. So as is our model, we'll leverage the success and build and accelerate on the full deployment of this element of our operating system in the years ahead. 
Going forward, we see multiple investment opportunities to deliver long-term growth through innovation and differentiation of the product, software and services we provide. I don't think anyone in this call needs another presentation on the Internet of Things on the possibilities for how that will transform competition and opportunity. This macro trend is squarely centered on nearly every growth and productivity strategy in our company, whether it's connected buildings, intelligent monitoring service, diagnostic and self-healing systems, telematics, consumer marketing and fulfillment and too many other digital concepts to list. We're funding a number of these ideas centrally within the corporate expense line and are likely to accelerate this incubation investment later this year. Incremental 2016 investment for this activity is already embedded in our guidance. 
Finally, building on the culture element of remodel. High-quality teams and deep employee engagement are critical to any sustained transformation, and I'm pleased that we continue to excel in these areas. One source of great pride within Ingersoll Rand is our ability to walk the talk around sustainability. To make a point, we continue to see benchmark levels from employee engagement; world-class safety performance for any segment of industry; energy reduction of 5% on an absolute, not volume-adjusted basis; a 14% reduction in water consumption, also on an absolute basis; and similar reductions on both hazardous and nonhazardous wastes. 
So Sue will take you through the quarter in detail. I just felt it was important to align how today's results were enforced, the strategy of the company, how we intend to get delivering great results and why you should believe we're building a more valuable, sustainable and less cyclical company for our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Sue."
280944,370127974,1013711,"Ingersoll-Rand Plc, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Trane Technologies plc","Executives","Thank you, Mike. Let's go to Slide 4. This is a summary slide that I like to begin with and give you some takeaway from today's call. As Mike has discussed, Q2 was another strong operational quarter for us and it shows through the financial results that",2338,"Thank you, Mike. Let's go to Slide 4. This is a summary slide that I like to begin with and give you some takeaway from today's call. 
As Mike has discussed, Q2 was another strong operational quarter for us and it shows through the financial results that we posted. In the second quarter, we drove year-over-year organic revenues higher by 3%, adjusted margins up 80 basis points with a leverage of over 45% and adjusted earnings per share up 15% against the backdrop of a very slow low-growth environment and particularly challenged industrial markets.
Adjusted earnings per share of $1.38 exceeded our guidance range of $1.27 to $1.32 by $0.08 at the midpoint and $0.06 at the high end. Our $0.08 beat versus our midpoint was driven by exceptionally strong performance in our Climate segment, partially offset by challenged markets in our Industrial segment and about $0.06 beat from a lower tax rate in the quarter. And as I'll discuss in detail later, we believe we'll maintain a 200 basis point lower average tax rate than our previous guidance of 24% to 25% for 2016.
We also posted strong year-to-date free cash flow of $348 million, up $293 million from the prior year. We're seeing the benefits of our focus on working capital management and our business operating system and our rate. And with that, we're raising our free cash flow forecast to $1 billion to $1.1 billion, excluding the proceeds from the sale of Hussmann. 
Let's turn to segment results. The Climate segment continues to exceed expectations, driven largely by outstanding execution in both commercial and residential HVAC with mid-single-digit growth and high single-digit growth, respectively. Margins also showed healthy expansion, driven by strong volume, productivity improvements and material deflation of nonferrous commodities. We also continue to invest in the business in order to derive sustainable growth. 
The Industrial segment end markets are more challenged than previously forecast and we experienced negative growth in all the major end markets, except small electric vehicles, which is our Club Car business, and Fluid Management where we continue to see growth. Across Industrial, we continue to take measures to drive productivity, shift our mix further towards more profitable aftermarket services and parts markets and to make prudent cost reductions in the business. 
We continue to be committed to a dynamic capital allocation strategy focused on delivering high returns to shareholders over the long term. Our strong free cash flow generation and cash balances provide us important options as the markets evolve. 
And lastly, we bumped up at the bottom end of our guidance range by $0.05 and our current adjusted continuing operations earnings per share for 2016 is $4 to $4.10. This update reflects expected continued strong growth in our Climate segment and tailwinds resulting from a lower go-forward structural tax rate of 22% to 23%, partially offset by continued weakness in our Industrial end markets, where we're not seeing the signs of recovery we had originally anticipated in our prior guidance. 
Now if you'll go to Slide 5. Let's begin discussing additional details regarding the second quarter. Our business operating system again guided us through good execution in our factories and in our cost centers. Our focus was on good operating results in a low-growth environment and we delivered against that objective. 
Enterprise revenues were up 3% organically with Climate up 5% and Industrial down 3%. HVAC revenues grew in each of our Climate businesses, led by commercial and residential HVAC in North America. 
Thermo King North America and EMEIA truck and trailer revenues continued to be strong in the quarter. 
Industrial markets declined in the quarter, consistent with the overall market. Club Car performed as expected, with mid-single-digit growth year-over-year. 
Our adjusted operating margins grew 80 basis points year-over-year with operating leverage exceeding 45%. Our strength in margin expansion was driven through price realization, productivity gains and direct material deflation. We've inserted a margin table on the slide and that'll illustrate some of the items I just talked about. 
We completed the sale of our remaining interest in Hussmann on April 1, 2016, for a gain of approximately $398 million.
Let's go to Slide 6. Orders for the second quarter of 2016 were up 3% organically. Climate orders were up 6% organically. Organic global commercial HVAC bookings were up high single digits, similar to the first quarter, led by low-teens growth in North America, applied and unitary, and strong growth of 36% in Latin America, which was against a relatively easy compare in 2015. 
Asia bookings continue to be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter and were down in Q2 overall, while China was up low single digits. We continue to see excellent growth in service, controls and contracting with low-teens growth in the quarter. 
Residential bookings were up low teens, representing the fourth consecutive quarter of bookings growth above 10%. 
Organic transport orders were down mid-single digits with order growth in overseas market offset by declines in North America trailer and auxiliary power units. Consistent with the expectations we set out earlier in the year, we continue to expect bookings to decline in North America trailer in the second half of the year, and this is built into our guidance. Transport orders in Asia were up 23% in the second quarter. 
Overall, we anticipated some recovery in the Industrial markets as we moved through Q2 and the balance of the year, but we're seeing continued challenges and market declines. Net orders in the Industrial segment were down 5% organically. We saw high single-digit order decline in compression technologies and services. 
Services continue to be a bright spot and were up high single digit as we continue to focus on the business with higher-margin product streams. We saw low-teens decline in other Industrial products and a high single-digit increase in Club Car. 
Now if you'll go to Slide 7, please. This slide provides a directional view of our segment revenue performance by region. In our Climate segment, which was up 5% in the second quarter, we saw solid performance in North America and low single-digit growth across Europe, Asia and Latin America. We saw a decline in the Middle East, consistent with the contraction in the number of building projects planned, primarily in Saudi Arabia, and we'd expect this to continue for some time as low oil prices are driving an investment pullback. 
Our Industrial segment performance in the second quarter, which was down 3% is representative of the ongoing volatility and declining markets that continue across the globe in industrial markets. Our regional industrial markets declined except for Europe and Asia, which were up.
Let's go to Slide 8, please. Climate revenues of $2.9 billion for the quarter were strong, up 5% organically. Commercial HVAC organic revenues were up mid-single digits, led by 20% growth in North America in contracting and upper single-digit growth in unitary equipment shipments in North America. 
Europe had equipment growth in the mid-teens and high single-digit growth in services, contracting and parts. The Middle East revenues declined largely due to a share pullback in Saudi Arabia, as I mentioned earlier. 
Residential revenues were up record levels and up high single digits in the second quarter. 
Transport organic revenues were up low single digits in the quarter. Truck and trailer organic revenues were up high single digits overall, with improved revenues in North America, Europe and Asia. We also had a high single-digit improvement in aftermarket volumes. Marine container organic revenues declined more than 60% in the second quarter, reflecting a soft first half at various box builders for 2016. We also had lower sales auxiliary power units reflecting the decline in the Class 8 sleeper market. 
Please go to Slide 9. Our Climate operating margins grew 250 basis points year-over-year. Our strength was broad-based based on volume, price, direct material deflation and productivity gains and we continue to invest in the business for sustainable growth. 
Please go to Slide 10. Second quarter revenues for the Industrial segment were $753 million, down 3% on an organic basis. Compression technologies and services organic revenues were down low single digits versus last year. And industrial products were down mid-teens with growth in Fluid Management and declines in Material Handling equipment and tools. 
Small electric vehicles, also; known as Club Car, organic revenues were up mid-single digits versus prior year from gains and equipment and aftermarket. Regionally, the decline in organic industrial revenues was led by a mid-single-digit decline in the Americas and the Middle East. Asia and Europe were up modestly, partially offsetting the declines.
Please go to Slide 11. Industrial's operating margin of 9.1% was down 250 basis points compared with last year. Lower volumes were the largest driver, partially offset by pricing, material deflation and productivity. Despite the downturn, we continued to invest in the business for the long term. Additionally, capitalized costs related to new product engineering and development were reclassified to the income statement in Q2, which were a drag on margin of approximately $8 million or 1.1 percentage points for the Industrial segment. Excluding this adjustment, Industrial adjusted margins were 10.9% in Q2. 
Moving forward, we expect Industrial segment performance to trend with the market. We're planning on expanding margins in a down market in the second half of the year through aftermarket growth, productivity gains and cost controls. 
Please go to Slide 12. Our June year-to-date free cash flow of $348 million was favorable to prior year by $293 million. Strong operating income improvement and improved working capital performance were the primary drivers of the favorability. Because of our strong start to the year, we have raised our free cash flow forecast range to $1 billion to $1.1 billion from our previous range of $950 million to $1 billion. 
For the quarter, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 5.6%. We had strong collections in the quarter with our days sales outstanding improving 0.6 days over the prior year and days payable outstanding improving 0.7 days. Inventories on plan for the quarter and we're well positioned to serve our customers. 
Please go to Slide 13. Our cash performance in the second quarter and our expectations for the year enable us to: one, continue to invest in the strategic growth programs that Mike outlined earlier. In addition to the core strategic investments, we're also investing in long-term growth through innovation and differentiated product in such areas as connected buildings, intelligent monitoring and the self-healing systems, just to name a few. Two, we'll also maintain a strong balance sheet with a BBB credit metrics. And three, we'll also maintain -- we'll also retain optionality relative to paying a competitive dividend, acquisitions to build the business and share repurchases.
Please go to Slide 14. As always, our attention is to give you our best view of what we're seeing in our end markets sitting here today and how that translates to our revenue guidance for 2016. We've broken it down by major end markets and geographies. As you can see by the variation of colors and symbols, our end markets are seeing a wide variation in trends. 
North America commercial HVAC and residential HVAC as well as European transport and commercial HVAC markets are generally positive, while global industrial markets are declining. We're forecasting transport markets in North America to be down low single digits. Our forecast for North America trailer volumes has not changed and we expect the market to be down was slightly for the year. This implies a decline in the second half after a single-digit growth in the first half of the year. 
Asian HVAC markets are expected to be flat to down and industrial markets in Asia remain under pressure. Golf car markets are slightly down offset by increases in the utility vehicle markets. 
All of our revenue growth forecast are shown on an organic basis. We're forecasting mid-single-digit growth in commercial HVAC in total; high single-digit growth in residential HVAC, which is essentially an all North American business for us; and a flat to small decline in transport globally. We expect compression-related products and other industrial equipment to be down high single digits. We expect Club Car to be up low single digits. 
Please go to Slide 15. Aggregating those market backdrops, we expect our organic revenues for the full year 2016 to be up 2% to 3% versus 2015, with foreign exchange presenting a headwind of about 1 percentage point. We expect Climate revenues to be up 4% to 5% organically. For Industrial, we expect organic revenues to be down 4% to 5%. 
For operating margins, we're excluding restructuring costs to get to adjusted margins. We expect adjusted operating margins in Climate to be between 14% and 14.5%. We expect adjusted Industrial margins to be between 10% and 11%. And for the enterprise, we expect adjusted operating margin of 11.5% to 12%. 
Please go to Slide 16. Transitioning to earnings. The reported earnings per share range is estimated to be $5.47 to $5.57 and the adjusted range is $4 to $4.10 versus our prior guidance range of $3.95 to $4.10. Adjusted numbers exclude restructuring and the Hussmann gain.
Our full year guidance reflects a tax rate forecast of 22% to 23% and an average diluted share count of approximately 260 million-- 2 61 million shares. The tax rate reflects a 200 basis point improvement versus prior guidance of 24% to 25%. 
For the third quarter of 2016, revenues are forecasted to be up by approximately 3% organically. We're projecting Climate revenues to grow mid-single digits in Q3 and Industrial to decline low single digits. Adjusted third quarter earnings per share are forecasted to be between $1.25 and $1.30, excluding restructuring charges of about $0.01.
For the full year 2016, we also raised our free cash flow expectations and now expect free cash flow to be between $1 billion and $1.1 billion, excluding restructuring charges and proceeds from the sale of Hussmann. 
And with that, I'm going to turn it back to Mike for a few closing comments."

So to conclude, we had an excellent quarter grounded in solid execution. I'm proud of the many people within Ingersoll Rand that continue to deliver for our customers and for our shareholders. I'm pleased with the progress and the momentum and the implementation of our operating system, and the growing depth and bench strength throughout the company that makes the operating systems come to life through continuous improvement. 
We're building a stronger, more valuable and more sustainable and less cyclical Ingersoll Rand than ever before. And it's exciting to me and leaders throughout the company to be part of that transformation and to help create a bright future with more individual development possibilities for all our people throughout the world. 
Results we reported this morning are a direct result of the strategic work, the persistent, the tenacity of the talented people that represent the unique culture we're building. It is a strategic advantage and it's the toughest thing in any business for a competitor to copy. 
There are a few takeaways I want to point out to you as we had to the back half of the year and into 2017. First, the Industrial businesses are running effectively in a very tough market environment. The management team is aggressively taking and we'll continue to take the right actions to reduce the overall cost structure of the business. And is committed to protecting the key product and service investments that will build long-term growth and margin expansion when the markets improve.
Second, the transport market is performing as we expected. And as we said at the beginning of the year, we expect the first half results to be up and the back half of the year would be down. The management team has done an effective job anticipating and seeing around the corners and is proactively taking the actions to ensure strong margin performance continues. 
Third, commodity deflation has been a tailwind during the first half of the year, and it's going to moderate to neutral in the back half of the year. We have a long track record of managing the price material input equation very effectively and we're going to continue to do so going forward. 
And finally, let me say, we are proactively reviewing both prior restructuring considerations as well as a new actions as our business, markets and even the input variables into our own models continue to evolve. Although we don't have any immediate additional restructuring actions to take or announce today, we won't hesitate to take additional prudent restructuring actions going forward. 
So with that, Sue and I will be happy to take your questions."

The first of which, as we talked about, was that direct material was going to moderate in terms of its deflationary environment. So let me talk about that for just a second. What we expect to see in the back half of the year is we expect to see that steel, particularly in the fourth quarter, is going to turn more inflationary than deflationary. So that's part of what's happening with the flatter margins. We're also going to continue to invest in the overall business in the back half of the year. Again, we've got some significant product launches, and we see this as an area that really sets us up for success. So though it's really priced a little bit of mix that comes from us lapping the 14 SEER in residential and then investment in the business."

And so that continues for the balance of the year for us. And that's something that I think is vitally important. There's a tremendous effort underway at reducing cost in that business. Much of what's not just visible through what you'd say would be qualified restructuring. Much of that is just reduction in place and just other containment actions being taken in the business. So that really, when I say, the business is being run effectively, I have no doubt that all the rocks are being turned over with the exception of protecting this critical investment pool that is important to us going forward. And I use that one example for you because that happened to be the example of the product growth team. It's the one product area that we have launched in that portfolio, and we're getting tremendous results with that. So again, this gives us some confidence that, although it's not a great story for the third and the fourth quarter, we're not running the company for the third and the fourth quarter. We run the company for the long run, and we hope investors see that. And that's part of the reason I think taking good success around the Climate business, keeping utilization up to the combined factory structures that we've got, leveraging the networks of that, excellence across the compression-related businesses that we have, give us the opportunity to stay at course on these investments, and that's more important."

It's a great question, and thanks for [indiscernible] step back and look at it. Because I look back over the 7 years that I've been in this role, and I remember when Industrial was the sweetheart of the portfolio, right, from '09 to '11 even through '13. And we're expanding margins so fast that it afforded us the opportunity to do all the great investment we made in the Trane, resi and commercial businesses, which is really why you're seeing the numbers that you're seeing today in that business. And so now it's flip. Remember, that was all happening with no real commercial -- certainly, no institutional support coming from construction markets. And now that's flipped. And it's allowed us the opportunity to keep factories fairly loaded. It's given us the opportunity to keep technical professionals highly engaged in developments of product. And all that really just -- really sets up where at some point when the commercial market in HVAC slows down, when institutional eventually fades. Our hope is that we've got a strong, refreshed, energy-efficient, reliable portfolio, particularly in compression technologies, and we're going to leverage that, just like we did from '09 to '11 when it grew 7 full points. We are very leveraged here toward some of those fixed costs. Where we play in the market is in the big machines. It's not the Cameron -- I'm not talking about Cameron, I'm talking about Cameron plus. All the 250- to 400-horse centrifugal air compressors, of which we're the leader now in that area. And we don't [indiscernible] much in the vacuum and blower business, which has some growth in it. So we have a product portfolio and a position in the market in these larger machines, that's what's getting hurt right now. And we're not going to throw the baby out with the bathwater here on that, for sure. That's why in addition to I mentioned the product development, but the machining investments, I mentioned in the last call and this call, those are going to continue. And we'll put $50 million in the machining in this downturn, so that when we emerge out of this thing, we're going to be more productive. Hope that it's not just 7 points of margin, it's more than 7 points of margins coming back. So Jeff, I think, I really got my head around the value of what we've created around integrating the portfolio. And over the long run, not really so interested in a flash and the pan around some multiples for short cycle. I'm really interested in building the value of the company over the long run. And again, step back 2009, Jeff, if you invested back in 2009, you're a very happy investor. And I thank you for all the Christmas cards we get to that effect.

So to be more specific than in terms of what that means, it means I want to continue to invest. It means I want to continue to do all of those things. It means we want to look at the M&A pipeline. But what we have is an opportunity where we can be patient, we can wait for the right opportunity and not just take the cash that we're generating and run out and buy something. So we're really, really thinking about investments. We're thinking about M&A, dividends are extremely important to us. We understand that. And we're going to continue to have dividends that are in line with our peer payout ratios, and we'll also be opportunistic about share repurchase. I don't want to take that completely off the table.

And if you just look to the Trane portfolio, you would see that. In every launch we've made, not only is it more efficient than anything in the marketplace but it's using refrigerants that you'll go way past the HFC -- the HFC phase out. So we're not meeting anybody kind of where they are, we are leapfrogging. In this whole strategic analytics piece of our business operating system, we're figuring out kind of where to go at TAC, specifically.

These are the most capital-intensive sort of factories we have. And that certainly, when we have those kinds of volume drops, really adversely affects our mix. So you look at volume alone contributing 3 points of negativity on the bridge, you can see what volume does. And as a proof point, again, go back and look at '09 through '11, look what happened when volume came in, after we had been affectively restructuring the footprint there, and that's where that 7 points came from. So we're heavily leveraged toward that any way you slice it, and that's the main reason for it. Now on the oil and gas side?"

I mean, that's not -- that's part of the issue because you don't have a large projects, but it's really the derivative. So all the other projects just aren't happening, and so it sort of gets labeled with oil and gas. And so let me step back and also add to what Mike was talking about. When I started talking about Industrial early in 2016, and I was sort of breaking it down into pieces for you. What I said was that Club Car was about 20% of the business, and it was going to be up sort of low to mid-single digits, that the aftermarket was about 30% of the Industrial segment, and then it was going to be up low single digits. Then I talked about the big machines being down in excess of 20%, and some of the small rotary and small air being up slightly for the year. And then some of the other businesses like the Material Handling business and the tools businesses being down sort of mid-single digits for the year. If I take that and transform that now into what we're seeing in 2016 after 2 quarters, Club Car, the same spot. They're growing in the mid-single-digits range and that's on track. The aftermarket piece of Industrial is continuing to grow. So you've got sort of solid footing with about 50% of the business. However, when you get over into the other side where I talked about -- if I talked about large machines being down 20%, as Mike said, they're now down 50%, so they are down way larger than what we thought. And even some of the smaller equipment is really much more pressured than I thought it was going to be. And instead of being up sort of low single digits, it's going to be down. So you really just have a lot of dynamics that are going on there with the Industrial business. And to bring it back and wrap it around your question about oil and gas and projects, again, it's really the derivative effects for us in most of our industrial businesses where the large projects just aren't happening and the ones that are happening are much more competitive."

And so the drag on the Middle East was fairly material. We're seeing some growth in China. That growth was really around shipping product that was booked, but we really haven't seen the pick up in China per se. If you look at China nonresidential construction, it's still a negative, but for the past 6 or 7 months, it's been trending up. I think it's gone from negative 17% up to negative 2%, but it hasn't cross over. We really would have thought at this point, we would've seen more pick up. The nice thing in China -- buildings are built in about half the speed that we see in other parts of the world, and our cycle times for delivery can be half of what they are in other parts of the world as well. So if we did see China recovery on the HVAC side, you need to see that, say, within a 6-month period, not a 12-month period. But as you get into July and you're not really seeing the bookings here, it's just a way of really derisking the forecast. And really, that derisking is a theme coming into the industrial portfolio too. At this point, if we haven't seen bookings on large machines or bookings on midsize or even rotary machines at this point in time, the reality is just to call [indiscernible] what we've done. And so we hope we've got to the bottom of this thing."

Thank you, Zac, an official welcome to Ingersoll Rand and your first earnings call with us. As you can see from our earnings release this morning, we had another excellent quarter. We had outstanding execution across the company delivering 15% EP",1719,"Great. Thank you, Zac, an official welcome to Ingersoll Rand and your first earnings call with us. 
As you can see from our earnings release this morning, we had another excellent quarter. We had outstanding execution across the company delivering 15% EPS growth, record operating margin, share gains and strong cash flow despite challenging industrial markets. We're seeing strong momentum in the operating system that we've been installing and developing in the company over the past 6-plus years. 
As we did last quarter, I'd like to start out spending a few minutes linking this quarter's performance to the longer-term strategic direction of the company to help investors understand how we're building a more valuable, sustainable and less cyclical company over the longer term. 
Within our operating system, operational excellence and growth excellence have been cornerstones of the strategy from the beginning, with our goal of becoming the very best operating company within our diversified or multi-industry peer group. This quarter we continued to deliver best-in-class operating leverage of 47% and our goal is to achieve top quartile organic growth for the quarter and for the year as well. There were a number of noteworthy milestones that showed clear progress in these areas during the quarter. 
Our residential HVAC business had another outstanding quarter with record revenue and profitability. We estimate that over the past quarter and 12 months, we now have benchmark profitability in this business and are seeing the benefits of a 5-year effort to refresh the product line, align and reposition the channel and dramatically improve product management, manufacturing and supply chain. Our residential business is also a model for the deployment of product growth teams for delivering market share and margin growth. 
Our commercial HVAC business in North America had record second quarter bookings and revenue. Similar to our residential HVAC story, we have executed on a consistent strategy with the goal to have the freshest, most energy-efficient and reliable product line in the industry and have supported that with consistent operational improvements along the way. We continue to see double-digit increases in our controls business and high single-digit growth in our service business, consistent with our strategy to balance equipment with controls and services. 
In the second quarter, Trane Commercial led the industry with a strong pipeline of new high-efficiency products, many of which earn our EcoWise badge for innovation that improves energy efficiency as compared to legacy product platforms, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Examples this quarter include the North American announcement of the new CenTraVac centrifugal chiller portfolio using next-generation low global warming potential refrigerant. The product is for large buildings and industrial applications in the U.S. and Canada. We also announced a service program to retrofit the existing installed base to the next-generation low global warming potential refrigerant, which protects and provides a viable option for our customers' past investment, while achieving their own sustainability goals.
In Europe, we announced another 4 new products, the Sintesis eXcellent [ph], a new air-cooled chiller with nearly 0 global warming potential using next-generation refrigerants. Airfinity, a complete new range of HVAC rooftop units designed to comply with the upcoming European Union EcoDesign regulations. They're light, compact and modular plug-and-play HVAC units that are compatible with wireless technology and designed to save time and money when retrofitting, and improve the efficiency of existing buildings across Europe. XStream, a new range of a water-cooled screw chillers now available in Europe and the Middle East. The efficiency and capacity ratings are unmatched by any other screw chiller in the market today. We hope this will become a preferred option for critical applications like data centers, hospitals, process cooling, district cooling and heating. And finally, Trane Balance, our second generation of innovative multi-pipe systems for high-efficiency simultaneous heating and cooling. The systems repurpose energy that's rejected and use renewable energy for heating. 
Within our Thermo King North America, Europe and Middle East business, we're demonstrating that we have a more resilient business than in the past, expanding margins 270 basis points in a low-growth environment. As we noted in our initial guidance, we believe that we could maintain or even grow margins with a 15% North American trailer pullback and flat overall volumes. Today, the Thermo King business serves the refrigerated truck, trailer, marine container, air container, bus and rail, telematics and auxiliary power unit markets. And the completeness of the portfolio has added to margins and the overall resiliency of the portfolio.
Also of interest, both our residential HVAC and Thermo King North America, Europe and Middle East business units have been fully deployed on the new ERP system for the past couple of quarters, and we believe we're now seeing the expected productivity throughout these business units. We continue to deploy new sites routinely in other business units each quarter. 
We continue to be pleased with the tremendous execution we're seeing in our HVAC and transport refrigeration business in Asia Pacific and in Latin America. Both regions demonstrated substantial margin improvement and share growth. HVAC bookings in Latin America were up 36% on an organic basis for the quarter, really outstanding performance by that team and that region. In Asia Pacific, our transport refrigeration business continues to grow with another 23% increase in bookings and 25% increase in revenue. Both are examples of finding pockets of growth within generally weak markets and then capitalizing on those opportunities. 
Turning to our Industrial segment. I want to start by saying that I have tremendous confidence in our leaders running these business units. They're operating in a very challenging environment. Within compression technologies in North America, it's our largest market for equipment, the 250-horsepower to 400-horsepower contact-cooled rotary market is down 20%. And all other size ranges are also down in the high single-digit range, with only small 5- to 15-horse compressors showing year-over-year growth. Against this backdrop, we're performing well and supplementing the business with service bookings of approximately 10% in the quarter. Remember, too, that the last time we emerged from down industrial cycle, we grew margins nearly 7 full points in a 24-month period.
Our Fluid Management business continues to perform well with modest growth, and we're seeing continued weakness in the tools business. And no sign of recovery in our Material Handling business, which provides hoist and winches for the oil and gas industry. 
Club Car continues to broaden its strategy and reach outside of golf with small electric vehicles in the commercial and consumer segments.
Turning to growth excellence, which encompasses the full value stream from strategic analytics, product management, new product and technology introduction, sales management and service and support, this has been another cornerstone to our long-term strategy. We believe the product, channel and service footprint investments we have made over the past 5 to 7 years are paying off. It's clearly evident in the HVAC and transport refrigeration business units. And we believe it'll also be the case for our compression technology business unit that has been doing a similar investment program over the past couple of years, which will continue over the next several years.
Even as industrial markets are challenging today, we continue the investment in the compression technologies business because we expect we'll be rewarded as the market recovers. As one example, one of the product growth teams operates in the compression technology business and covers a specific product portfolio, which equates to about 10% of the overall revenue of that business. Within the product growth team, we're seeing year-to-date bookings increases of 30% and revenues increasing by 17%. 
It's strength in our Climate segment, capacity, utilization and our shared Climate and Industrial plants and operations and leveraging our technology teams, that's allowing us the opportunity to stay the course on critical growth programs in our Industrial segment. We have continued to invest in strategic growth programs across the company through both good and difficult times and the benefits of doing so are clear. Our designated strategic growth programs, many of which are managed through our product growth team process, are growing at a rate 3x faster than the underlying growth rate of the company. 
As another example, within the commercial HVAC business in North America, Europe and the Middle East, our strategic growth programs are growing at a 14% rate of this year. And for the company, 80-plus percent of our growth is coming from investment and focus on these critical strategic growth programs. So as is our model, we'll leverage the success and build and accelerate on the full deployment of this element of our operating system in the years ahead. 
Going forward, we see multiple investment opportunities to deliver long-term growth through innovation and differentiation of the product, software and services we provide. I don't think anyone on this call needs another presentation on the Internet of Things on the possibilities for how that will transform competition and opportunity. This macro trend is squarely centered on nearly every growth and productivity strategy in our company, whether it's connected buildings, intelligent monitoring and service, diagnostic and self-healing systems, telematics, consumer marketing and fulfillment and too many other digital concepts to list. We're funding a number of these ideas centrally within the corporate expense line and are likely to accelerate this incubation investment later this year. Incremental 2016 investment for this activity is already embedded in our guidance. 
Finally, building on the culture element of our model. High-quality teams and deep employee engagement are critical to any sustained transformation, and I'm pleased that we continue to excel in these areas. One source of great pride within Ingersoll Rand is our ability to walk the talk on sustainability. To make a point, we continue to see benchmark levels from employee engagement; world-class safety performance for any segment of industry; energy reduction of 5% on an absolute, not volume-adjusted basis; a 14% reduction in water consumption, also on an absolute basis; and similar reductions on both hazardous and nonhazardous wastes. 
So Sue will take you through the quarter in detail. I felt it was important to align how today's results reinforce the strategy of the company, how we intend to get delivering great results and why you should believe we're building a more valuable, sustainable and less cyclical company for our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Sue."

This is a summary slide that I like to begin with and give you some takeaway from today's call. As Mike has discussed, Q2 was another strong operational quarter for us and it shows through the financial results that",2336,"Thank you, Mike. Let's go to Slide 4. This is a summary slide that I like to begin with and give you some takeaway from today's call. 
As Mike has discussed, Q2 was another strong operational quarter for us and it shows through the financial results that we posted. In the second quarter, we drove year-over-year organic revenues higher by 3%, adjusted margins up 80 basis points with a leverage of over 45% and adjusted earnings per share up 15% against the backdrop of a very slow-growth environment and particularly challenged industrial markets.
Adjusted earnings per share of $1.38 exceeded our guidance range of $1.27 to $1.32 by $0.08 at the midpoint and $0.06 at the high end. Our $0.08 beat versus our midpoint was driven by exceptionally strong performance in our Climate segment, partially offset by challenged markets in our Industrial segment and about a $0.06 beat from a lower tax rate in the quarter. And as I'll discuss in detail later, we believe we'll maintain a 200 basis point lower average tax rate than our previous guidance of 24% to 25% for 2016.
We also posted strong year-to-date free cash flow of $348 million, up $293 million from the prior year. We're seeing the benefits of our focus on working capital management and our business operating system and our rate -- and with that, we're raising our free cash flow forecast to $1 billion to $1.1 billion, excluding the proceeds from the sale of Hussmann. 
Let's turn to segment results. The Climate segment continues to exceed expectations, driven largely by outstanding execution in both commercial and residential HVAC with mid-single-digit growth and high single-digit growth, respectively. Margins also showed healthy expansion, driven by strong volume, productivity improvements and material deflation of nonferrous commodities. We also continued to invest in the business in order to derive sustainable growth. 
The Industrial segment's end markets are more challenged than previously forecast and we experienced negative growth in all the major end markets, except small electric vehicles, which is our Club Car business, and Fluid Management where we continue to see growth. Across Industrial, we continue to take measures to drive productivity, shift our mix further towards more profitable aftermarket services and parts markets and to make prudent cost reductions in the business. 
We continue to be committed to a dynamic capital allocation strategy focused on delivering high returns to shareholders over the long term. Our strong free cash flow generation and cash balances provide us important options as the markets evolve. 
And lastly, we bumped up at the bottom end of our guidance range by $0.05 and our current adjusted continuing operations earnings per share for 2016 is $4 to $4.10. This update reflects expected continued strong growth in our Climate segment and tailwinds resulting from a lower go-forward structural tax rate of 22% to 23%, partially offset by continued weakness in our Industrial end markets, where we're not seeing the signs of recovery we had originally anticipated in our prior guidance. 
Now if you'll go to Slide 5. Let's begin discussing additional details regarding the second quarter. Our business operating system again guided us through good execution in our factories and in our cost centers. Our focus was on good operating results in a low-growth environment and we delivered against that objective. 
Enterprise revenues were up 3% organically with Climate up 5% and Industrial down 3%. HVAC revenues grew in each of our Climate businesses, led by commercial and residential HVAC in North America. 
Thermo King North America and EMEIA truck and trailer revenues continued to be strong in the quarter. 
Industrial markets declined in the quarter, consistent with the overall market. Club Car performed as expected, with mid-single-digit growth year-over-year. 
Our adjusted operating margins grew 80 basis points year-over-year with operating leverage exceeding 45%. Our strength in margin expansion was driven through price realization, productivity gains and direct material deflation. We've inserted a margin table on the slide and that'll illustrate some of the items I just talked about. 
We completed the sale of our remaining interest in Hussmann on April 1, 2016, for a gain of approximately $398 million.
Let's go to Slide 6. Orders for the second quarter of 2016 were up 3% organically. Climate orders were up 6% organically. Organic global commercial HVAC bookings were up high single digits, similar to the first quarter, led by low-teens growth in North America, Applied and unitary, and strong growth of 36% in Latin America, which was against a relatively easy compare in 2015. 
Asia bookings continue to be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter and were down in Q2 overall, while China was up low single digits. We continue to see excellent growth in service, controls and contracting with low-teens growth in the quarter. 
Residential bookings were up low teens, representing the fourth consecutive quarter of bookings growth above 10%. 
Organic transport orders were down mid-single digits with order growth in overseas market offset by declines in North America trailer and auxiliary power units. Consistent with the expectations we set out earlier in the year, we continue to expect bookings to decline in North America trailer in the second half of the year, and this is built into our guidance. Transport orders in Asia were up 23% in the second quarter. 
Overall, we anticipated some recovery in the Industrial markets as we moved through Q2 and the balance of the year, but we're seeing continued challenges and market declines. Net orders in the Industrial segment were down 5% organically. We saw high single-digit order decline in compression technologies and services. 
Services continued to be a bright spot and were up high single digit as we continue to focus on the business with higher-margin product streams. We saw low-teens decline in other Industrial products and a high single-digit increase in Club Car. 
Now if you'll go to Slide 7, please. This slide provides a directional view of our segment revenue performance by region. In our Climate segment, which was up 5% in the second quarter, we saw solid performance in North America and low single-digit growth across Europe, Asia and Latin America. We saw a decline in the Middle East, consistent with the contraction in the number of building projects planned, primarily in Saudi Arabia, and we'd expect this to continue for some time as low oil prices are driving an investment pullback. 
Our Industrial segment performance in the second quarter, which was down 3% is representative of the ongoing volatility and declining markets that continue across the globe in industrial markets. Our regional industrial markets declined except for Europe and Asia, which were up.
Let's go to Slide 8, please. Climate revenues of $2.9 billion for the quarter were strong, up 5% organically. Commercial HVAC organic revenues were up mid-single digits, led by 20% growth in North America in contracting and upper single-digit growth in unitary equipment shipments in North America. 
Europe had equipment growth in the mid-teens and high single-digit growth in services, contracting and parts. The Middle East revenues declined largely due to a share pullback in Saudi Arabia, as I mentioned earlier. 
Residential revenues were at record levels and up high single digits in the second quarter. 
Transport organic revenues were up low single digits in the quarter. Truck and trailer organic revenues were up high single digits overall, with improved revenues in North America, Europe and Asia. We also had a high single-digit improvement in aftermarket volumes. Marine container organic revenues declined more than 60% in the second quarter, reflecting a soft first half at various box builders for 2016. We also had lower sales auxiliary power units reflecting the decline in the Class 8 sleeper market. 
Please go to Slide 9. Our Climate operating margins grew 250 basis points year-over-year. Our strength was broad-based, based on volume, price, direct material deflation and productivity gains, and we continued to invest in the business for sustainable growth. 
Please go to Slide 10. Second quarter revenues for the Industrial segment were $753 million, down 3% on an organic basis. Compression technologies and services organic revenues were down low single digits versus last year. And industrial products were down mid-teens with growth in Fluid Management and declines in Material Handling equipment and tools. 
Small electric vehicles, also known as Club Car, organic revenues were up mid-single digits versus prior year from gains and equipment and aftermarket. Regionally, the decline in organic industrial revenues was led by a mid-single-digit decline in the Americas and the Middle East. Asia and Europe were up modestly, partially offsetting the declines.
Please go to Slide 11. Industrial's operating margin of 9.1% was down 250 basis points compared with last year. Lower volumes were the largest driver, partially offset by pricing, material deflation and productivity. Despite the downturn, we continued to invest in the business for the long term. Additionally, capitalized costs related to new product engineering and development were reclassified to the income statement in Q2, which were a drag on margin of approximately $8 million or 1.1 percentage points for the Industrial segment. Excluding this adjustment, Industrial adjusted margins were 10.9% in Q2. 
Moving forward, we expect Industrial segment performance to trend with the market. We're planning on expanding margins in a down market in the second half of the year through aftermarket growth, productivity gains and cost controls. 
Please go to Slide 12. Our June year-to-date free cash flow of $348 million was favorable to prior year by $293 million. Strong operating income improvement and improved working capital performance were the primary drivers of the favorability. Because of our strong start to the year, we have raised our free cash flow forecast range to $1 billion to $1.1 billion from our previous range of $950 million to $1 billion. 
For the quarter, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 5.6%. We had strong collections in the quarter with our days sales outstanding improving 0.6 days over the prior year and days payable outstanding improving 0.7 days. Inventory is on plan for the quarter, and we're well positioned to serve our customers. 
Please go to Slide 13. Our cash performance in the second quarter and our expectations for the year enable us to, one, continue to invest in the strategic growth programs that Mike outlined earlier. In addition to the core strategic investments, we're also investing in long-term growth through innovation and differentiated products in such areas as connected buildings, intelligent monitoring and the self-healing systems, just to name a few. Two, we'll also maintain a strong balance sheet with a BBB credit metrics. And three, we'll also maintain -- we'll also retain optionality relative to paying a competitive dividend, acquisitions to build the business and share repurchases.
Please go to Slide 14. As always, our intention is to give you our best view of what we're seeing in our end markets sitting here today and how that translates to our revenue guidance for 2016. We've broken it down by major end markets and geographies. As you can see by the variation of colors and symbols, our end markets are seeing a wide variation in trends. 
North America commercial HVAC and residential HVAC as well as European transport and commercial HVAC markets are generally positive, while global industrial markets are declining. We're forecasting transport markets in North America to be down low single digits. Our forecast for North America trailer volumes has not changed, and we expect the market to be down was slightly for the year. This implies a decline in the second half after single-digit growth in the first half of the year. 
Asian HVAC markets are expected to be flat to down, and industrial markets in Asia remain under pressure. Golf car markets are slightly down offset by increases in the utility vehicle markets. 
All of our revenue growth forecast are shown on an organic basis. We're forecasting mid-single-digit growth in commercial HVAC in total; high single-digit growth in residential HVAC, which is essentially an all North America business for us; and a flat-to-small decline in transport globally. We expect compression-related products and other industrial equipment to be down high single digits. We expect Club Car to be up low single digits. 
Please go to Slide 15. Aggregating those market backdrops, we expect our organic revenues for the full year 2016 to be up 2% to 3% versus 2015, with foreign exchange presenting a headwind of about 1 percentage point. We expect Climate revenues to be up 4% to 5% organically. For Industrial, we expect organic revenues to be down 4% to 5%. 
For operating margins, we're excluding restructuring costs to get to adjusted margins. We expect adjusted operating margins in Climate to be between 14% and 14.5%. We expect adjusted Industrial margins to be between 10% and 11%. And for the enterprise, we expect adjusted operating margins of 11.5% to 12%. 
Please go to Slide 16. Transitioning to earnings. The reported earnings per share range is estimated to be $5.47 to $5.57 and the adjusted range is $4 to $4.10 versus our prior guidance range of $3.95 to $4.10. Adjusted numbers exclude restructuring and the Hussmann gain.
Our full year guidance reflects a tax rate forecast of 22% to 23% and an average diluted share count of approximately 260 -- 261 million shares. The tax rate reflects a 200 basis point improvement versus prior guidance of 24% to 25%. 
For the third quarter of 2016, revenues are forecasted to be up by approximately 3% organically. We're projecting Climate revenues to grow mid-single digits in Q3 and Industrial to decline low single digits. Adjusted third quarter earnings per share are forecasted to be between $1.25 and $1.30, excluding restructuring charges of about $0.01.
For the full year 2016, we also raised our free cash flow expectations and now expect free cash flow to be between $1 billion and $1.1 billion, excluding restructuring charges and proceeds from the sale of Hussmann. 
And with that, I'm going to turn it back to Mike for a few closing comments."

So to conclude, we had an excellent quarter grounded in solid execution. I'm proud of the many people within Ingersoll Rand that continue to deliver for our customers and for our shareholders. I'm pleased with the progress and the momentum and the implementation of our operating system, and the growing depth and bench strength throughout the company that makes the operating systems come to life through continuous improvement. 
We're building a stronger, more valuable and more sustainable and less cyclical Ingersoll Rand than ever before. And it's exciting to me and leaders throughout the company to be part of that transformation and to help create a bright future with more individual development possibilities for all our people throughout the world. 
Results we reported this morning are a direct result of the strategic work, the persistence, the tenacity of the talented people that represent the unique culture we're building. It is a strategic advantage and it's the toughest thing in any business for a competitor to copy. 
There are a few takeaways I want to point out to you as we head to the back half of the year and into 2017. First, the Industrial businesses are running effectively in a very tough market environment. The management team is aggressively taking and will continue to take the right actions to reduce the overall cost structure of the business. And it's committed to protecting the key product and service investments that will build long-term growth and margin expansion when the markets improve.
Second, the transport market is performing as we expected. And as we said at the beginning of the year, we expect the first half results to be up and the back half of the year would be down. The management team has done an effective job anticipating and seeing around the corners and is proactively taking the actions to ensure strong margin performance continues. 
Third, commodity deflation has been a tailwind during the first half of the year, and it's going to moderate to neutral in the back half of the year. We have a long track record of managing the price material input equation very effectively and we're going to continue to do so going forward. 
And finally, let me say, we are proactively reviewing both prior restructuring considerations as well as new actions as our business, markets and even the input variables into our own models continue to evolve. Although we don't have any immediate additional restructuring actions to take or announce today, we won't hesitate to take additional prudent restructuring actions going forward. 
So with that, Sue and I will be happy to take your questions."

What we expect to see in the back half of the year is we expect to see that steel, particularly in the fourth quarter, is going to turn more inflationary than deflationary. So that's part of what's happening with the flatter margins. We're also going to continue to invest in the overall business in the back half of the year. Again, we've got some significant product launches, and we see this as an area that really sets us up for success. So it's really price, a little bit of mix that comes from us lapping the 14 SEER in residential and then investment in the business."

And so that continues for the balance of the year for us. And that's something that I think is vitally important. There's a tremendous effort underway at reducing cost in that business. Much of what's not just visible through what you'd say would be qualified restructuring. Much of that is just reduction in place and just other containment actions being taken in the business. So that, really, when I say the business is being run effectively, I have no doubt that all the rocks are being turned over with the exception of protecting this critical investment pool that is important to us going forward. And I use that one example for you because that happened to be the example of the product growth team. It's the one product area that we have launched in that portfolio, and we're getting tremendous results with that. So again, this gives us some confidence that, although it's not a great story for the third and the fourth quarter, we're not running the company for the third and the fourth quarter. We run the company for the long run, and we hope investors see that. And that's part of the reason I think taking good success around the Climate business, keeping utilization up through the combined factory structures that we've got, leveraging the networks of that -- excellence across the compression-related businesses that we have, give us the opportunity to stay the course on these investments, and that's really important."

It's a great question, and thanks for the opportunity to step back and look at it. Because I look back over the 7 years that I've been in this role, and I remember when Industrial was the sweetheart of the portfolio, right, from '09 to '11 even through '13. And we're expanding margins so fast that it afforded us the opportunity to do all the great investment we made in the Trane, res and commercial businesses, which is really why you're seeing the numbers that you're seeing today in that business. And so now it's flipped. Remember, that was all happening with no real commercial -- certainly, no institutional support coming from construction markets. And now that's flipped. And it's allowed us the opportunity to keep factories fairly loaded. It's given us the opportunity to keep technical professionals highly engaged in development of product. And all that really just -- it really sets up where at some point when the commercial market in HVAC slows down, when institutional eventually fades, our hope is that we've got a strong, refreshed, energy-efficient, reliable portfolio sitting, particularly, in compression technologies. And we're going to leverage that just like we did from '09 to '11 when it grew 7 full points. We are very leveraged here toward some of those fixed costs. Where we play in the market is in the big machine. It's not the Cameron -- I'm not talking about Cameron, I'm talking about Cameron plus. All the 250- to 400-horse centrifugal air compressors, of which we're the leader now in that area. And we don't really participate much in the vacuum and blower business, which has some growth in it. So we have a product portfolio and a position in the market in these larger machines, that's what's getting hurt right now. And we're not going to throw the baby out with the bathwater here on that, for sure. That's why in addition to I mentioned the product development, but the machining investments I mentioned in the last call and this call, those are going to continue. And we'll put $50 million in the machining in this downturn, so that when we emerge out of this thing, we're going to be more productive. The hope that it's not just 7 points of margin, it's more than 7 points of margins coming back. So Jeff, I think, I really have got my head around the value of what we've created around integrating the portfolio. And over the long run, not really so interested in a flash in the pan around some multiple for short cycle. I'm really interested in building the value of the company over the long run. And again, step back 2009, Jeff, if you invested back in 2009, you're a very happy investor. And I thank you for all the Christmas cards we get to that effect.

But I'm going to kind of use some of the same passion that Mike had in his comments on the multiples and what we've built at Ingersoll Rand.

And so what we've seen that has been really successful for us is investing in our products and investing in areas like energy efficiency and sustainability. Those are proven for us in terms of building our growth excellence. If we look at Operational Excellence, all of the work that we've done and invested in the company, whether it's in our factories or in our overall processes with the business operating system, all of that has shown to be something that has worked very well for us. So our preference, as we think about capital allocation and your question, is to really invest and grow the company. So to be more specific, then, in terms of what that means, it means I want to continue to invest. It means I want to continue to do all of those things. It means we want to look at the M&A pipeline. But what we have is an opportunity where we can be patient, we can wait for the right opportunity and not just take the cash that we're generating and run out and buy something. So we're really, really thinking about investments. We're thinking about M&A. Dividends are extremely important to us. We understand that. And we're going to continue to have dividends that are in line with our peer payout ratios, and we'll also be opportunistic about share repurchase. I don't want to take that completely off the table. But if I set our preference up, it's going to be to build longer-term value through investments in the business and acquisitions."

In every launch we've made, not only is it more efficient than anything in the marketplace but it's using refrigerants that go way past the HFC -- the HFC phase out. So we're not meeting anybody kind of where they are. We are leapfrogging.

Actually, as you go up between 250 and 400 and past 400, those growth rates start to look like minus 50%, okay, from where they were. These are the most capital-intensive sort of factories we have. And that certainly, when we have those kinds of volume drops, really adversely affects our mix. So you look at volume alone contributing 3 points of negativity on the bridge, you can see what volume does. And as a proof point, again, go back and look at '09 through '11, look what happened when volume came in, after we had been effectively restructuring the footprint there, and that's where that 7 points came from.

I mean, that's not -- that's part of the issue because you don't have large projects, but it's really the derivative. So all the other projects just aren't happening, and so it sort of gets labeled with oil and gas. And so let me step back and also add to what Mike was talking about. When I started talking about Industrial early in 2016, and I was sort of breaking it down into pieces for you. What I said was that Club Car was about 20% of the business, and it was going to be up sort of low to mid-single digits, that the aftermarket was about 30% of the Industrial segment, and then it was going to be up low single digits. Then I talked about the big machines being down in excess of 20%, and some of the small rotary and small air being up slightly for the year. And then some of the other businesses like the Material Handling business and the tools businesses being down sort of mid-single digits for the year. If I take that and transform that now into what we're seeing in 2016 after 2 quarters: Club Car, the same spot. They're growing in the mid-single-digits range and that's on track. The aftermarket piece of Industrial is continuing to grow. So you've got sort of solid footing with about 50% of the business. However, when you get over into the other side where I talked about -- if I talked about large machines being down 20%, as Mike said, they're now down 50%, so they are down way larger than what we thought. And even some of the smaller equipment is really much more pressured than I thought it was going to be. And instead of being up sort of low single digits, it's going to be down. So you really just have a lot of dynamics that are going on there with the Industrial business. And to bring it back and wrap it around your question about oil and gas and projects, again, it's really the derivative effects for us in most of our industrial businesses where the large projects just aren't happening and the ones that are happening are much more competitive."

And so the drag on the Middle East was fairly material. We're seeing some growth in China. That growth was really around shipping product that was booked, but we really haven't seen the pickup in China per se. If you look at China nonresidential construction, it's still a negative, but for the past 6 or 7 months, it's been trending up. I think it's gone from negative 17% up to negative 2%, but it hasn't crossed over. We really would have thought at this point, we would've seen more pick up. The nice thing in China, buildings are built in about half the speed that we see in other parts of the world, and our cycle times for delivery can be half of what they are in other parts of the world as well. So if we did see a China recovery on the HVAC side, you need to see that, say, within a 6-month period, not a 12-month period. But as you get into July and you're not really seeing the bookings here, it's just a way of really derisking the forecast. And really, that derisking is a theme coming into the industrial portfolio too. At this point, if we haven't seen bookings on large machines or bookings on midsize, even rotary machines at this point in time, the reality is you just call it lower, and it's what we've done. And so we hope we've got to the bottom of this thing."

Thank you, Zac, an official welcome to Ingersoll Rand and your first earnings call with us. As you can see from our earnings release this morning, we had another excellent quarter. We had outstanding execution across the company delivering 15% EP",1719,"Great. Thank you, Zac, an official welcome to Ingersoll Rand and your first earnings call with us. 
As you can see from our earnings release this morning, we had another excellent quarter. We had outstanding execution across the company delivering 15% EPS growth, record operating margin, share gains and strong cash flow despite challenging industrial markets. We're seeing strong momentum in the operating system that we've been installing and developing in the company over the past 6-plus years. 
As we did last quarter, I'd like to start out spending a few minutes linking this quarter's performance to the longer-term strategic direction of the company to help investors understand how we're building a more valuable, sustainable and less cyclical company over the longer term. 
Within our operating system, operational excellence and growth excellence have been cornerstones of the strategy from the beginning, with our goal of becoming the very best operating company within our diversified or multi-industry peer group. This quarter we continued to deliver best-in-class operating leverage of 47% and our goal is to achieve top quartile organic growth for the quarter and for the year as well. There were a number of noteworthy milestones that showed clear progress in these areas during the quarter. 
Our residential HVAC business had another outstanding quarter with record revenue and profitability. We estimate that over the past quarter and 12 months, we now have benchmark profitability in this business and are seeing the benefits of a 5-year effort to refresh the product line, align and reposition the channel and dramatically improve product management, manufacturing and supply chain. Our residential business is also a model for the deployment of product growth teams for delivering market share and margin growth. 
Our commercial HVAC business in North America had record second quarter bookings and revenue. Similar to our residential HVAC story, we have executed on a consistent strategy with the goal to have the freshest, most energy-efficient and reliable product line in the industry and have supported that with consistent operational improvements along the way. We continue to see double-digit increases in our controls business and high single-digit growth in our service business, consistent with our strategy to balance equipment with controls and services. 
In the second quarter, Trane Commercial led the industry with a strong pipeline of new high-efficiency products, many of which earn our EcoWise badge for innovation that improves energy efficiency as compared to legacy product platforms, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Examples this quarter include the North American announcement of the new CenTraVac centrifugal chiller portfolio using next-generation low global warming potential refrigerant. The product is for large buildings and industrial applications in the U.S. and Canada. We also announced a service program to retrofit the existing installed base to the next-generation low global warming potential refrigerant, which protects and provides a viable option for our customers' past investment, while achieving their own sustainability goals.
In Europe, we announced another 4 new products, the Sintesis eXcellent [ph], a new air-cooled chiller with nearly 0 global warming potential using next-generation refrigerants. Airfinity, a complete new range of HVAC rooftop units designed to comply with the upcoming European Union EcoDesign regulations. They're light, compact and modular plug-and-play HVAC units that are compatible with wireless technology and designed to save time and money when retrofitting, and improve the efficiency of existing buildings across Europe. XStream, a new range of a water-cooled screw chillers now available in Europe and the Middle East. The efficiency and capacity ratings are unmatched by any other screw chiller in the market today. We hope this will become a preferred option for critical applications like data centers, hospitals, process cooling, district cooling and heating. And finally, Trane Balance, our second generation of innovative multi-pipe systems for high-efficiency simultaneous heating and cooling. The systems repurpose energy that's rejected and use renewable energy for heating. 
Within our Thermo King North America, Europe and Middle East business, we're demonstrating that we have a more resilient business than in the past, expanding margins 270 basis points in a low-growth environment. As we noted in our initial guidance, we believe that we could maintain or even grow margins with a 15% North American trailer pullback and flat overall volumes. Today, the Thermo King business serves the refrigerated truck, trailer, marine container, air container, bus and rail, telematics and auxiliary power unit markets. And the completeness of the portfolio has added to margins and the overall resiliency of the portfolio.
Also of interest, both our residential HVAC and Thermo King North America, Europe and Middle East business units have been fully deployed on the new ERP system for the past couple of quarters, and we believe we're now seeing the expected productivity throughout these business units. We continue to deploy new sites routinely in other business units each quarter. 
We continue to be pleased with the tremendous execution we're seeing in our HVAC and transport refrigeration business in Asia Pacific and in Latin America. Both regions demonstrated substantial margin improvement and share growth. HVAC bookings in Latin America were up 36% on an organic basis for the quarter, really outstanding performance by that team and that region. In Asia Pacific, our transport refrigeration business continues to grow with another 23% increase in bookings and 25% increase in revenue. Both are examples of finding pockets of growth within generally weak markets and then capitalizing on those opportunities. 
Turning to our Industrial segment. I want to start by saying that I have tremendous confidence in our leaders running these business units. They're operating in a very challenging environment. Within compression technologies in North America, it's our largest market for equipment, the 250-horsepower to 400-horsepower contact-cooled rotary market is down 20%. And all other size ranges are also down in the high single-digit range, with only small 5- to 15-horse compressors showing year-over-year growth. Against this backdrop, we're performing well and supplementing the business with service bookings of approximately 10% in the quarter. Remember, too, that the last time we emerged from down industrial cycle, we grew margins nearly 7 full points in a 24-month period.
Our Fluid Management business continues to perform well with modest growth, and we're seeing continued weakness in the tools business. And no sign of recovery in our Material Handling business, which provides hoist and winches for the oil and gas industry. 
Club Car continues to broaden its strategy and reach outside of golf with small electric vehicles in the commercial and consumer segments.
Turning to growth excellence, which encompasses the full value stream from strategic analytics, product management, new product and technology introduction, sales management and service and support, this has been another cornerstone to our long-term strategy. We believe the product, channel and service footprint investments we have made over the past 5 to 7 years are paying off. It's clearly evident in the HVAC and transport refrigeration business units. And we believe it'll also be the case for our compression technology business unit that has been doing a similar investment program over the past couple of years, which will continue over the next several years.
Even as industrial markets are challenging today, we continue the investment in the compression technologies business because we expect we'll be rewarded as the market recovers. As one example, one of the product growth teams operates in the compression technology business and covers a specific product portfolio, which equates to about 10% of the overall revenue of that business. Within the product growth team, we're seeing year-to-date bookings increases of 30% and revenues increasing by 17%. 
It's strength in our Climate segment, capacity, utilization and our shared Climate and Industrial plants and operations and leveraging our technology teams, that's allowing us the opportunity to stay the course on critical growth programs in our Industrial segment. We have continued to invest in strategic growth programs across the company through both good and difficult times and the benefits of doing so are clear. Our designated strategic growth programs, many of which are managed through our product growth team process, are growing at a rate 3x faster than the underlying growth rate of the company. 
As another example, within the commercial HVAC business in North America, Europe and the Middle East, our strategic growth programs are growing at a 14% rate of this year. And for the company, 80-plus percent of our growth is coming from investment and focus on these critical strategic growth programs. So as is our model, we'll leverage the success and build and accelerate on the full deployment of this element of our operating system in the years ahead. 
Going forward, we see multiple investment opportunities to deliver long-term growth through innovation and differentiation of the product, software and services we provide. I don't think anyone on this call needs another presentation on the Internet of Things on the possibilities for how that will transform competition and opportunity. This macro trend is squarely centered on nearly every growth and productivity strategy in our company, whether it's connected buildings, intelligent monitoring and service, diagnostic and self-healing systems, telematics, consumer marketing and fulfillment and too many other digital concepts to list. We're funding a number of these ideas centrally within the corporate expense line and are likely to accelerate this incubation investment later this year. Incremental 2016 investment for this activity is already embedded in our guidance. 
Finally, building on the culture element of our model. High-quality teams and deep employee engagement are critical to any sustained transformation, and I'm pleased that we continue to excel in these areas. One source of great pride within Ingersoll Rand is our ability to walk the talk on sustainability. To make a point, we continue to see benchmark levels from employee engagement; world-class safety performance for any segment of industry; energy reduction of 5% on an absolute, not volume-adjusted basis; a 14% reduction in water consumption, also on an absolute basis; and similar reductions on both hazardous and nonhazardous wastes. 
So Sue will take you through the quarter in detail. I felt it was important to align how today's results reinforce the strategy of the company, how we intend to get delivering great results and why you should believe we're building a more valuable, sustainable and less cyclical company for our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Sue."
280944,370127974,1014763,"Ingersoll-Rand Plc, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Trane Technologies plc","Executives","Thank you, Mike. Let's go to Slide 4. This is a summary slide that I like to begin with and give you some takeaway from today's call. As Mike has discussed, Q2 was another strong operational quarter for us and it shows through the financial results that",2336,"Thank you, Mike. Let's go to Slide 4. This is a summary slide that I like to begin with and give you some takeaway from today's call. 
As Mike has discussed, Q2 was another strong operational quarter for us and it shows through the financial results that we posted. In the second quarter, we drove year-over-year organic revenues higher by 3%, adjusted margins up 80 basis points with a leverage of over 45% and adjusted earnings per share up 15% against the backdrop of a very slow-growth environment and particularly challenged industrial markets.
Adjusted earnings per share of $1.38 exceeded our guidance range of $1.27 to $1.32 by $0.08 at the midpoint and $0.06 at the high end. Our $0.08 beat versus our midpoint was driven by exceptionally strong performance in our Climate segment, partially offset by challenged markets in our Industrial segment and about a $0.06 beat from a lower tax rate in the quarter. And as I'll discuss in detail later, we believe we'll maintain a 200 basis point lower average tax rate than our previous guidance of 24% to 25% for 2016.
We also posted strong year-to-date free cash flow of $348 million, up $293 million from the prior year. We're seeing the benefits of our focus on working capital management and our business operating system and our rate -- and with that, we're raising our free cash flow forecast to $1 billion to $1.1 billion, excluding the proceeds from the sale of Hussmann. 
Let's turn to segment results. The Climate segment continues to exceed expectations, driven largely by outstanding execution in both commercial and residential HVAC with mid-single-digit growth and high single-digit growth, respectively. Margins also showed healthy expansion, driven by strong volume, productivity improvements and material deflation of nonferrous commodities. We also continued to invest in the business in order to derive sustainable growth. 
The Industrial segment's end markets are more challenged than previously forecast and we experienced negative growth in all the major end markets, except small electric vehicles, which is our Club Car business, and Fluid Management where we continue to see growth. Across Industrial, we continue to take measures to drive productivity, shift our mix further towards more profitable aftermarket services and parts markets and to make prudent cost reductions in the business. 
We continue to be committed to a dynamic capital allocation strategy focused on delivering high returns to shareholders over the long term. Our strong free cash flow generation and cash balances provide us important options as the markets evolve. 
And lastly, we bumped up at the bottom end of our guidance range by $0.05 and our current adjusted continuing operations earnings per share for 2016 is $4 to $4.10. This update reflects expected continued strong growth in our Climate segment and tailwinds resulting from a lower go-forward structural tax rate of 22% to 23%, partially offset by continued weakness in our Industrial end markets, where we're not seeing the signs of recovery we had originally anticipated in our prior guidance. 
Now if you'll go to Slide 5. Let's begin discussing additional details regarding the second quarter. Our business operating system again guided us through good execution in our factories and in our cost centers. Our focus was on good operating results in a low-growth environment and we delivered against that objective. 
Enterprise revenues were up 3% organically with Climate up 5% and Industrial down 3%. HVAC revenues grew in each of our Climate businesses, led by commercial and residential HVAC in North America. 
Thermo King North America and EMEIA truck and trailer revenues continued to be strong in the quarter. 
Industrial markets declined in the quarter, consistent with the overall market. Club Car performed as expected, with mid-single-digit growth year-over-year. 
Our adjusted operating margins grew 80 basis points year-over-year with operating leverage exceeding 45%. Our strength in margin expansion was driven through price realization, productivity gains and direct material deflation. We've inserted a margin table on the slide and that'll illustrate some of the items I just talked about. 
We completed the sale of our remaining interest in Hussmann on April 1, 2016, for a gain of approximately $398 million.
Let's go to Slide 6. Orders for the second quarter of 2016 were up 3% organically. Climate orders were up 6% organically. Organic global commercial HVAC bookings were up high single digits, similar to the first quarter, led by low-teens growth in North America, Applied and unitary, and strong growth of 36% in Latin America, which was against a relatively easy compare in 2015. 
Asia bookings continue to be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter and were down in Q2 overall, while China was up low single digits. We continue to see excellent growth in service, controls and contracting with low-teens growth in the quarter. 
Residential bookings were up low teens, representing the fourth consecutive quarter of bookings growth above 10%. 
Organic transport orders were down mid-single digits with order growth in overseas market offset by declines in North America trailer and auxiliary power units. Consistent with the expectations we set out earlier in the year, we continue to expect bookings to decline in North America trailer in the second half of the year, and this is built into our guidance. Transport orders in Asia were up 23% in the second quarter. 
Overall, we anticipated some recovery in the Industrial markets as we moved through Q2 and the balance of the year, but we're seeing continued challenges and market declines. Net orders in the Industrial segment were down 5% organically. We saw high single-digit order decline in compression technologies and services. 
Services continued to be a bright spot and were up high single digit as we continue to focus on the business with higher-margin product streams. We saw low-teens decline in other Industrial products and a high single-digit increase in Club Car. 
Now if you'll go to Slide 7, please. This slide provides a directional view of our segment revenue performance by region. In our Climate segment, which was up 5% in the second quarter, we saw solid performance in North America and low single-digit growth across Europe, Asia and Latin America. We saw a decline in the Middle East, consistent with the contraction in the number of building projects planned, primarily in Saudi Arabia, and we'd expect this to continue for some time as low oil prices are driving an investment pullback. 
Our Industrial segment performance in the second quarter, which was down 3% is representative of the ongoing volatility and declining markets that continue across the globe in industrial markets. Our regional industrial markets declined except for Europe and Asia, which were up.
Let's go to Slide 8, please. Climate revenues of $2.9 billion for the quarter were strong, up 5% organically. Commercial HVAC organic revenues were up mid-single digits, led by 20% growth in North America in contracting and upper single-digit growth in unitary equipment shipments in North America. 
Europe had equipment growth in the mid-teens and high single-digit growth in services, contracting and parts. The Middle East revenues declined largely due to a share pullback in Saudi Arabia, as I mentioned earlier. 
Residential revenues were at record levels and up high single digits in the second quarter. 
Transport organic revenues were up low single digits in the quarter. Truck and trailer organic revenues were up high single digits overall, with improved revenues in North America, Europe and Asia. We also had a high single-digit improvement in aftermarket volumes. Marine container organic revenues declined more than 60% in the second quarter, reflecting a soft first half at various box builders for 2016. We also had lower sales auxiliary power units reflecting the decline in the Class 8 sleeper market. 
Please go to Slide 9. Our Climate operating margins grew 250 basis points year-over-year. Our strength was broad-based, based on volume, price, direct material deflation and productivity gains, and we continued to invest in the business for sustainable growth. 
Please go to Slide 10. Second quarter revenues for the Industrial segment were $753 million, down 3% on an organic basis. Compression technologies and services organic revenues were down low single digits versus last year. And industrial products were down mid-teens with growth in Fluid Management and declines in Material Handling equipment and tools. 
Small electric vehicles, also known as Club Car, organic revenues were up mid-single digits versus prior year from gains and equipment and aftermarket. Regionally, the decline in organic industrial revenues was led by a mid-single-digit decline in the Americas and the Middle East. Asia and Europe were up modestly, partially offsetting the declines.
Please go to Slide 11. Industrial's operating margin of 9.1% was down 250 basis points compared with last year. Lower volumes were the largest driver, partially offset by pricing, material deflation and productivity. Despite the downturn, we continued to invest in the business for the long term. Additionally, capitalized costs related to new product engineering and development were reclassified to the income statement in Q2, which were a drag on margin of approximately $8 million or 1.1 percentage points for the Industrial segment. Excluding this adjustment, Industrial adjusted margins were 10.9% in Q2. 
Moving forward, we expect Industrial segment performance to trend with the market. We're planning on expanding margins in a down market in the second half of the year through aftermarket growth, productivity gains and cost controls. 
Please go to Slide 12. Our June year-to-date free cash flow of $348 million was favorable to prior year by $293 million. Strong operating income improvement and improved working capital performance were the primary drivers of the favorability. Because of our strong start to the year, we have raised our free cash flow forecast range to $1 billion to $1.1 billion from our previous range of $950 million to $1 billion. 
For the quarter, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 5.6%. We had strong collections in the quarter with our days sales outstanding improving 0.6 days over the prior year and days payable outstanding improving 0.7 days. Inventory is on plan for the quarter, and we're well positioned to serve our customers. 
Please go to Slide 13. Our cash performance in the second quarter and our expectations for the year enable us to, one, continue to invest in the strategic growth programs that Mike outlined earlier. In addition to the core strategic investments, we're also investing in long-term growth through innovation and differentiated products in such areas as connected buildings, intelligent monitoring and the self-healing systems, just to name a few. Two, we'll also maintain a strong balance sheet with a BBB credit metrics. And three, we'll also maintain -- we'll also retain optionality relative to paying a competitive dividend, acquisitions to build the business and share repurchases.
Please go to Slide 14. As always, our intention is to give you our best view of what we're seeing in our end markets sitting here today and how that translates to our revenue guidance for 2016. We've broken it down by major end markets and geographies. As you can see by the variation of colors and symbols, our end markets are seeing a wide variation in trends. 
North America commercial HVAC and residential HVAC as well as European transport and commercial HVAC markets are generally positive, while global industrial markets are declining. We're forecasting transport markets in North America to be down low single digits. Our forecast for North America trailer volumes has not changed, and we expect the market to be down was slightly for the year. This implies a decline in the second half after single-digit growth in the first half of the year. 
Asian HVAC markets are expected to be flat to down, and industrial markets in Asia remain under pressure. Golf car markets are slightly down offset by increases in the utility vehicle markets. 
All of our revenue growth forecast are shown on an organic basis. We're forecasting mid-single-digit growth in commercial HVAC in total; high single-digit growth in residential HVAC, which is essentially an all North America business for us; and a flat-to-small decline in transport globally. We expect compression-related products and other industrial equipment to be down high single digits. We expect Club Car to be up low single digits. 
Please go to Slide 15. Aggregating those market backdrops, we expect our organic revenues for the full year 2016 to be up 2% to 3% versus 2015, with foreign exchange presenting a headwind of about 1 percentage point. We expect Climate revenues to be up 4% to 5% organically. For Industrial, we expect organic revenues to be down 4% to 5%. 
For operating margins, we're excluding restructuring costs to get to adjusted margins. We expect adjusted operating margins in Climate to be between 14% and 14.5%. We expect adjusted Industrial margins to be between 10% and 11%. And for the enterprise, we expect adjusted operating margins of 11.5% to 12%. 
Please go to Slide 16. Transitioning to earnings. The reported earnings per share range is estimated to be $5.47 to $5.57 and the adjusted range is $4 to $4.10 versus our prior guidance range of $3.95 to $4.10. Adjusted numbers exclude restructuring and the Hussmann gain.
Our full year guidance reflects a tax rate forecast of 22% to 23% and an average diluted share count of approximately 260 -- 261 million shares. The tax rate reflects a 200 basis point improvement versus prior guidance of 24% to 25%. 
For the third quarter of 2016, revenues are forecasted to be up by approximately 3% organically. We're projecting Climate revenues to grow mid-single digits in Q3 and Industrial to decline low single digits. Adjusted third quarter earnings per share are forecasted to be between $1.25 and $1.30, excluding restructuring charges of about $0.01.
For the full year 2016, we also raised our free cash flow expectations and now expect free cash flow to be between $1 billion and $1.1 billion, excluding restructuring charges and proceeds from the sale of Hussmann. 
And with that, I'm going to turn it back to Mike for a few closing comments."

So to conclude, we had an excellent quarter grounded in solid execution. I'm proud of the many people within Ingersoll Rand that continue to deliver for our customers and for our shareholders. I'm pleased with the progress and the momentum and the implementation of our operating system, and the growing depth and bench strength throughout the company that makes the operating systems come to life through continuous improvement. 
We're building a stronger, more valuable and more sustainable and less cyclical Ingersoll Rand than ever before. And it's exciting to me and leaders throughout the company to be part of that transformation and to help create a bright future with more individual development possibilities for all our people throughout the world. 
Results we reported this morning are a direct result of the strategic work, the persistence, the tenacity of the talented people that represent the unique culture we're building. It is a strategic advantage and it's the toughest thing in any business for a competitor to copy. 
There are a few takeaways I want to point out to you as we head to the back half of the year and into 2017. First, the Industrial businesses are running effectively in a very tough market environment. The management team is aggressively taking and will continue to take the right actions to reduce the overall cost structure of the business. And it's committed to protecting the key product and service investments that will build long-term growth and margin expansion when the markets improve.
Second, the transport market is performing as we expected. And as we said at the beginning of the year, we expect the first half results to be up and the back half of the year would be down. The management team has done an effective job anticipating and seeing around the corners and is proactively taking the actions to ensure strong margin performance continues. 
Third, commodity deflation has been a tailwind during the first half of the year, and it's going to moderate to neutral in the back half of the year. We have a long track record of managing the price material input equation very effectively and we're going to continue to do so going forward. 
And finally, let me say, we are proactively reviewing both prior restructuring considerations as well as new actions as our business, markets and even the input variables into our own models continue to evolve. Although we don't have any immediate additional restructuring actions to take or announce today, we won't hesitate to take additional prudent restructuring actions going forward. 
So with that, Sue and I will be happy to take your questions."

What we expect to see in the back half of the year is we expect to see that steel, particularly in the fourth quarter, is going to turn more inflationary than deflationary. So that's part of what's happening with the flatter margins. We're also going to continue to invest in the overall business in the back half of the year.

And so that continues for the balance of the year for us. And that's something that I think is vitally important. There's a tremendous effort underway at reducing cost in that business. Much of what's not just visible through what you'd say would be qualified restructuring. Much of that is just reduction in place and just other containment actions being taken in the business. So that, really, when I say the business is being run effectively, I have no doubt that all the rocks are being turned over with the exception of protecting this critical investment pool that is important to us going forward. And I use that one example for you because that happened to be the example of the product growth team. It's the one product area that we have launched in that portfolio, and we're getting tremendous results with that. So again, this gives us some confidence that, although it's not a great story for the third and the fourth quarter, we're not running the company for the third and the fourth quarter. We run the company for the long run, and we hope investors see that.

It's a great question, and thanks for the opportunity to step back and look at it. Because I look back over the 7 years that I've been in this role, and I remember when Industrial was the sweetheart of the portfolio, right, from '09 to '11 even through '13. And we're expanding margins so fast that it afforded us the opportunity to do all the great investment we made in the Trane, res and commercial businesses, which is really why you're seeing the numbers that you're seeing today in that business. And so now it's flipped. Remember, that was all happening with no real commercial -- certainly, no institutional support coming from construction markets. And now that's flipped. And it's allowed us the opportunity to keep factories fairly loaded. It's given us the opportunity to keep technical professionals highly engaged in development of product. And all that really just -- it really sets up where at some point when the commercial market in HVAC slows down, when institutional eventually fades, our hope is that we've got a strong, refreshed, energy-efficient, reliable portfolio sitting, particularly, in compression technologies. And we're going to leverage that just like we did from '09 to '11 when it grew 7 full points. We are very leveraged here toward some of those fixed costs. Where we play in the market is in the big machine. It's not the Cameron -- I'm not talking about Cameron, I'm talking about Cameron plus. All the 250- to 400-horse centrifugal air compressors, of which we're the leader now in that area. And we don't really participate much in the vacuum and blower business, which has some growth in it. So we have a product portfolio and a position in the market in these larger machines, that's what's getting hurt right now. And we're not going to throw the baby out with the bathwater here on that, for sure. That's why in addition to I mentioned the product development, but the machining investments I mentioned in the last call and this call, those are going to continue. And we'll put $50 million in the machining in this downturn, so that when we emerge out of this thing, we're going to be more productive. The hope that it's not just 7 points of margin, it's more than 7 points of margins coming back. So Jeff, I think, I really have got my head around the value of what we've created around integrating the portfolio. And over the long run, not really so interested in a flash in the pan around some multiple for short cycle. I'm really interested in building the value of the company over the long run. And again, step back 2009, Jeff, if you invested back in 2009, you're a very happy investor. And I thank you for all the Christmas cards we get to that effect.

But I'm going to kind of use some of the same passion that Mike had in his comments on the multiples and what we've built at Ingersoll Rand.

And so what we've seen that has been really successful for us is investing in our products and investing in areas like energy efficiency and sustainability. Those are proven for us in terms of building our growth excellence. If we look at Operational Excellence, all of the work that we've done and invested in the company, whether it's in our factories or in our overall processes with the business operating system, all of that has shown to be something that has worked very well for us. So our preference, as we think about capital allocation and your question, is to really invest and grow the company. So to be more specific, then, in terms of what that means, it means I want to continue to invest. It means I want to continue to do all of those things. It means we want to look at the M&A pipeline. But what we have is an opportunity where we can be patient, we can wait for the right opportunity and not just take the cash that we're generating and run out and buy something. So we're really, really thinking about investments. We're thinking about M&A. Dividends are extremely important to us. We understand that. And we're going to continue to have dividends that are in line with our peer payout ratios, and we'll also be opportunistic about share repurchase. I don't want to take that completely off the table.

In every launch we've made, not only is it more efficient than anything in the marketplace but it's using refrigerants that go way past the HFC -- the HFC phase out. So we're not meeting anybody kind of where they are. We are leapfrogging.

Actually, as you go up between 250 and 400 and past 400, those growth rates start to look like minus 50%, okay, from where they were. These are the most capital-intensive sort of factories we have. And that certainly, when we have those kinds of volume drops, really adversely affects our mix. So you look at volume alone contributing 3 points of negativity on the bridge, you can see what volume does. And as a proof point, again, go back and look at '09 through '11, look what happened when volume came in, after we had been effectively restructuring the footprint there, and that's where that 7 points came from. So we're heavily leveraged toward that any way you slice it, and that's the main reason for it. Now on the oil and gas side?"

I mean, that's not -- that's part of the issue because you don't have large projects, but it's really the derivative. So all the other projects just aren't happening, and so it sort of gets labeled with oil and gas. And so let me step back and also add to what Mike was talking about. When I started talking about Industrial early in 2016, and I was sort of breaking it down into pieces for you. What I said was that Club Car was about 20% of the business, and it was going to be up sort of low to mid-single digits, that the aftermarket was about 30% of the Industrial segment, and then it was going to be up low single digits. Then I talked about the big machines being down in excess of 20%, and some of the small rotary and small air being up slightly for the year. And then some of the other businesses like the Material Handling business and the tools businesses being down sort of mid-single digits for the year. If I take that and transform that now into what we're seeing in 2016 after 2 quarters: Club Car, the same spot. They're growing in the mid-single-digits range and that's on track. The aftermarket piece of Industrial is continuing to grow. So you've got sort of solid footing with about 50% of the business. However, when you get over into the other side where I talked about -- if I talked about large machines being down 20%, as Mike said, they're now down 50%, so they are down way larger than what we thought. And even some of the smaller equipment is really much more pressured than I thought it was going to be. And instead of being up sort of low single digits, it's going to be down. So you really just have a lot of dynamics that are going on there with the Industrial business. And to bring it back and wrap it around your question about oil and gas and projects, again, it's really the derivative effects for us in most of our industrial businesses where the large projects just aren't happening and the ones that are happening are much more competitive."

And so the drag on the Middle East was fairly material. We're seeing some growth in China. That growth was really around shipping product that was booked, but we really haven't seen the pickup in China per se. If you look at China nonresidential construction, it's still a negative, but for the past 6 or 7 months, it's been trending up. I think it's gone from negative 17% up to negative 2%, but it hasn't crossed over. We really would have thought at this point, we would've seen more pick up. The nice thing in China, buildings are built in about half the speed that we see in other parts of the world, and our cycle times for delivery can be half of what they are in other parts of the world as well. So if we did see a China recovery on the HVAC side, you need to see that, say, within a 6-month period, not a 12-month period. But as you get into July and you're not really seeing the bookings here, it's just a way of really derisking the forecast. And really, that derisking is a theme coming into the industrial portfolio too.

Thank you, Zac, an official welcome to Ingersoll Rand and your first earnings call with us. As you can see from our earnings release this morning, we had another excellent quarter. We had outstanding execution across the company delivering 15% EP",1719,"Great. Thank you, Zac, an official welcome to Ingersoll Rand and your first earnings call with us. 
As you can see from our earnings release this morning, we had another excellent quarter. We had outstanding execution across the company delivering 15% EPS growth, record operating margin, share gains and strong cash flow despite challenging industrial markets. We're seeing strong momentum in the operating system that we've been installing and developing in the company over the past 6-plus years. 
As we did last quarter, I'd like to start out spending a few minutes linking this quarter's performance to the longer-term strategic direction of the company to help investors understand how we're building a more valuable, sustainable and less cyclical company over the longer term. 
Within our operating system, operational excellence and growth excellence have been cornerstones of the strategy from the beginning, with our goal of becoming the very best operating company within our diversified or multi-industry peer group. This quarter we continued to deliver best-in-class operating leverage of 47% and our goal is to achieve top quartile organic growth for the quarter and for the year as well. There were a number of noteworthy milestones that showed clear progress in these areas during the quarter. 
Our residential HVAC business had another outstanding quarter with record revenue and profitability. We estimate that over the past quarter and 12 months, we now have benchmark profitability in this business and are seeing the benefits of a 5-year effort to refresh the product line, align and reposition the channel and dramatically improve product management, manufacturing and supply chain. Our residential business is also a model for the deployment of product growth teams for delivering market share and margin growth. 
Our commercial HVAC business in North America had record second quarter bookings and revenue. Similar to our residential HVAC story, we have executed on a consistent strategy with the goal to have the freshest, most energy-efficient and reliable product line in the industry and have supported that with consistent operational improvements along the way. We continue to see double-digit increases in our controls business and high single-digit growth in our service business, consistent with our strategy to balance equipment with controls and services. 
In the second quarter, Trane Commercial led the industry with a strong pipeline of new high-efficiency products, many of which earn our EcoWise badge for innovation that improves energy efficiency as compared to legacy product platforms, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Examples this quarter include the North American announcement of the new CenTraVac centrifugal chiller portfolio using next-generation low global warming potential refrigerant. The product is for large buildings and industrial applications in the U.S. and Canada. We also announced a service program to retrofit the existing installed base to the next-generation low global warming potential refrigerant, which protects and provides a viable option for our customers' past investment, while achieving their own sustainability goals.
In Europe, we announced another 4 new products, the Sintesis eXcellent [ph], a new air-cooled chiller with nearly 0 global warming potential using next-generation refrigerants. Airfinity, a complete new range of HVAC rooftop units designed to comply with the upcoming European Union EcoDesign regulations. They're light, compact and modular plug-and-play HVAC units that are compatible with wireless technology and designed to save time and money when retrofitting, and improve the efficiency of existing buildings across Europe. XStream, a new range of a water-cooled screw chillers now available in Europe and the Middle East. The efficiency and capacity ratings are unmatched by any other screw chiller in the market today. We hope this will become a preferred option for critical applications like data centers, hospitals, process cooling, district cooling and heating. And finally, Trane Balance, our second generation of innovative multi-pipe systems for high-efficiency simultaneous heating and cooling. The systems repurpose energy that's rejected and use renewable energy for heating. 
Within our Thermo King North America, Europe and Middle East business, we're demonstrating that we have a more resilient business than in the past, expanding margins 270 basis points in a low-growth environment. As we noted in our initial guidance, we believe that we could maintain or even grow margins with a 15% North American trailer pullback and flat overall volumes. Today, the Thermo King business serves the refrigerated truck, trailer, marine container, air container, bus and rail, telematics and auxiliary power unit markets. And the completeness of the portfolio has added to margins and the overall resiliency of the portfolio.
Also of interest, both our residential HVAC and Thermo King North America, Europe and Middle East business units have been fully deployed on the new ERP system for the past couple of quarters, and we believe we're now seeing the expected productivity throughout these business units. We continue to deploy new sites routinely in other business units each quarter. 
We continue to be pleased with the tremendous execution we're seeing in our HVAC and transport refrigeration business in Asia Pacific and in Latin America. Both regions demonstrated substantial margin improvement and share growth. HVAC bookings in Latin America were up 36% on an organic basis for the quarter, really outstanding performance by that team and that region. In Asia Pacific, our transport refrigeration business continues to grow with another 23% increase in bookings and 25% increase in revenue. Both are examples of finding pockets of growth within generally weak markets and then capitalizing on those opportunities. 
Turning to our Industrial segment. I want to start by saying that I have tremendous confidence in our leaders running these business units. They're operating in a very challenging environment. Within compression technologies in North America, it's our largest market for equipment, the 250-horsepower to 400-horsepower contact-cooled rotary market is down 20%. And all other size ranges are also down in the high single-digit range, with only small 5- to 15-horse compressors showing year-over-year growth. Against this backdrop, we're performing well and supplementing the business with service bookings of approximately 10% in the quarter. Remember, too, that the last time we emerged from down industrial cycle, we grew margins nearly 7 full points in a 24-month period.
Our Fluid Management business continues to perform well with modest growth, and we're seeing continued weakness in the tools business. And no sign of recovery in our Material Handling business, which provides hoist and winches for the oil and gas industry. 
Club Car continues to broaden its strategy and reach outside of golf with small electric vehicles in the commercial and consumer segments.
Turning to growth excellence, which encompasses the full value stream from strategic analytics, product management, new product and technology introduction, sales management and service and support, this has been another cornerstone to our long-term strategy. We believe the product, channel and service footprint investments we have made over the past 5 to 7 years are paying off. It's clearly evident in the HVAC and transport refrigeration business units. And we believe it'll also be the case for our compression technology business unit that has been doing a similar investment program over the past couple of years, which will continue over the next several years.
Even as industrial markets are challenging today, we continue the investment in the compression technologies business because we expect we'll be rewarded as the market recovers. As one example, one of the product growth teams operates in the compression technology business and covers a specific product portfolio, which equates to about 10% of the overall revenue of that business. Within the product growth team, we're seeing year-to-date bookings increases of 30% and revenues increasing by 17%. 
It's strength in our Climate segment, capacity utilization in our shared Climate and Industrial plants and operations and leveraging our technology teams, that's allowing us the opportunity to stay the course on critical growth programs in our Industrial segment. We have continued to invest in strategic growth programs across the company through both good and difficult times and the benefits of doing so are clear. Our designated strategic growth programs, many of which are managed through our product growth team process, are growing at a rate 3x faster than the underlying growth rate of the company. 
As another example, within the commercial HVAC business in North America, Europe and the Middle East, our strategic growth programs are growing at a 14% rate of this year. And for the company, 80-plus percent of our growth is coming from investment and focus on these critical strategic growth programs. So as is our model, we'll leverage the success and build and accelerate on the full deployment of this element of our operating system in the years ahead. 
Going forward, we see multiple investment opportunities to deliver long-term growth through innovation and differentiation of the product, software and services we provide. I don't think anyone on this call needs another presentation on the Internet of Things on the possibilities for how that will transform competition and opportunity. This macro trend is squarely centered on nearly every growth and productivity strategy in our company, whether it's connected buildings, intelligent monitoring and service, diagnostic and self-healing systems, telematics, consumer marketing and fulfillment and too many other digital concepts to list. We're funding a number of these ideas centrally within the corporate expense line and are likely to accelerate this incubation investment later this year. Incremental 2016 investment for this activity is already embedded in our guidance. 
Finally, building on the culture element of our model. High-quality teams and deep employee engagement are critical to any sustained transformation, and I'm pleased that we continue to excel in these areas. One source of great pride within Ingersoll Rand is our ability to walk the talk on sustainability. To make a point, we continue to see benchmark levels from employee engagement; world-class safety performance for any segment of industry; energy reduction of 5% on an absolute, not volume-adjusted basis; a 14% reduction in water consumption, also on an absolute basis; and similar reductions on both hazardous and nonhazardous wastes. 
So Sue will take you through the quarter in detail. I felt it was important to align how today's results reinforce the strategy of the company, how we intend to get delivering great results and why you should believe we're building a more valuable, sustainable and less cyclical company for our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Sue."

This is a summary slide that I like to begin with and give you some takeaway from today's call.

This is a summary slide that I like to begin with and give you some takeaway from today's call. 
As Mike has discussed, Q2 was another strong operational quarter for us and it shows through the financial results that we posted. In the second quarter, we drove year-over-year organic revenues higher by 3%, adjusted margins up 80 basis points with a leverage of over 45% and adjusted earnings per share up 15% against the backdrop of a very slow-growth environment and particularly challenged industrial markets.
Adjusted earnings per share of $1.38 exceeded our guidance range of $1.27 to $1.32 by $0.08 at the midpoint and $0.06 at the high end. Our $0.08 beat versus our midpoint was driven by exceptionally strong performance in our Climate segment, partially offset by challenged markets in our Industrial segment and about a $0.06 beat from a lower tax rate in the quarter. And as I'll discuss in detail later, we believe we'll maintain a 200 basis point lower average tax rate than our previous guidance of 24% to 25% for 2016.
We also posted strong year-to-date free cash flow of $348 million, up $293 million from the prior year. We're seeing the benefits of our focus on working capital management and our business operating system and our rate -- and with that, we're raising our free cash flow forecast to $1 billion to $1.1 billion, excluding the proceeds from the sale of Hussmann. 
Let's turn to segment results. The Climate segment continues to exceed expectations, driven largely by outstanding execution in both commercial and residential HVAC with mid-single-digit growth and high single-digit growth, respectively. Margins also showed healthy expansion, driven by strong volume, productivity improvements and material deflation of nonferrous commodities. We also continued to invest in the business in order to derive sustainable growth. 
The Industrial segment's end markets are more challenged than previously forecast and we experienced negative growth in all the major end markets, except small electric vehicles, which is our Club Car business, and Fluid Management where we continue to see growth. Across Industrial, we continue to take measures to drive productivity, shift our mix further towards more profitable aftermarket services and parts markets and to make prudent cost reductions in the business. 
We continue to be committed to a dynamic capital allocation strategy focused on delivering high returns to shareholders over the long term. Our strong free cash flow generation and cash balances provide us important options as the markets evolve. 
And lastly, we bumped up at the bottom end of our guidance range by $0.05 and our current adjusted continuing operations earnings per share for 2016 is $4 to $4.10. This update reflects expected continued strong growth in our Climate segment and tailwinds resulting from a lower go-forward structural tax rate of 22% to 23%, partially offset by continued weakness in our Industrial end markets, where we're not seeing the signs of recovery we had originally anticipated in our prior guidance. 
Now if you'll go to Slide 5. Let's begin discussing additional details regarding the second quarter. Our business operating system again guided us through good execution in our factories and in our cost centers. Our focus was on good operating results in a low-growth environment and we delivered against that objective. 
Enterprise revenues were up 3% organically with Climate up 5% and Industrial down 3%. HVAC revenues grew in each of our Climate businesses, led by commercial and residential HVAC in North America. 
Thermo King North America and EMEIA truck and trailer revenues continued to be strong in the quarter. 
Industrial markets declined in the quarter, consistent with the overall market. Club Car performed as expected, with mid-single-digit growth year-over-year. 
Our adjusted operating margins grew 80 basis points year-over-year with operating leverage exceeding 45%. Our strength in margin expansion was driven through price realization, productivity gains and direct material deflation. We've inserted a margin table on the slide and that'll illustrate some of the items I just talked about. 
We completed the sale of our remaining interest in Hussmann on April 1, 2016, for a gain of approximately $398 million.
Let's go to Slide 6. Orders for the second quarter of 2016 were up 3% organically. Climate orders were up 6% organically. Organic global commercial HVAC bookings were up high single digits, similar to the first quarter, led by low-teens growth in North America, Applied and unitary, and strong growth of 36% in Latin America, which was against a relatively easy compare in 2015. 
Asia bookings continue to be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter and were down in Q2 overall, while China was up low single digits. We continue to see excellent growth in service, controls and contracting with low-teens growth in the quarter. 
Residential bookings were up low teens, representing the fourth consecutive quarter of bookings growth above 10%. 
Organic transport orders were down mid-single digits with order growth in overseas market offset by declines in North America trailer and auxiliary power units. Consistent with the expectations we set out earlier in the year, we continue to expect bookings to decline in North America trailer in the second half of the year, and this is built into our guidance. Transport orders in Asia were up 23% in the second quarter. 
Overall, we anticipated some recovery in the Industrial markets as we moved through Q2 and the balance of the year, but we're seeing continued challenges and market declines. Net orders in the Industrial segment were down 5% organically. We saw high single-digit order decline in compression technologies and services. 
Services continued to be a bright spot and were up high single digit as we continue to focus on the business with higher-margin product streams. We saw low-teens decline in other Industrial products and a high single-digit increase in Club Car. 
Now if you'll go to Slide 7, please. This slide provides a directional view of our segment revenue performance by region. In our Climate segment, which was up 5% in the second quarter, we saw solid performance in North America and low single-digit growth across Europe, Asia and Latin America. We saw a decline in the Middle East, consistent with the contraction in the number of building projects planned, primarily in Saudi Arabia, and we'd expect this to continue for some time as low oil prices are driving an investment pullback. 
Our Industrial segment performance in the second quarter, which was down 3% is representative of the ongoing volatility and declining markets that continue across the globe in industrial markets. Our regional industrial markets declined except for Europe and Asia, which were up.
Let's go to Slide 8, please. Climate revenues of $2.9 billion for the quarter were strong, up 5% organically. Commercial HVAC organic revenues were up mid-single digits, led by 20% growth in North America in contracting and upper single-digit growth in unitary equipment shipments in North America. 
Europe had equipment growth in the mid-teens and high single-digit growth in services, contracting and parts. The Middle East revenues declined largely due to a share pullback in Saudi Arabia, as I mentioned earlier. 
Residential revenues were at record levels and up high single digits in the second quarter. 
Transport organic revenues were up low single digits in the quarter. Truck and trailer organic revenues were up high single digits overall, with improved revenues in North America, Europe and Asia. We also had a high single-digit improvement in aftermarket volumes. Marine container organic revenues declined more than 60% in the second quarter, reflecting a soft first half at various box builders for 2016. We also had lower sales auxiliary power units reflecting the decline in the Class 8 sleeper market. 
Please go to Slide 9. Our Climate operating margins grew 250 basis points year-over-year. Our strength was broad-based, based on volume, price, direct material deflation and productivity gains, and we continued to invest in the business for sustainable growth. 
Please go to Slide 10. Second quarter revenues for the Industrial segment were $753 million, down 3% on an organic basis. Compression technologies and services organic revenues were down low single digits versus last year. And industrial products were down mid-teens with growth in Fluid Management and declines in Material Handling equipment and tools. 
Small electric vehicles, also known as Club Car, organic revenues were up mid-single digits versus prior year from gains and equipment and aftermarket. Regionally, the decline in organic industrial revenues was led by a mid-single-digit decline in the Americas and the Middle East. Asia and Europe were up modestly, partially offsetting the declines.
Please go to Slide 11. Industrial's operating margin of 9.1% was down 250 basis points compared with last year. Lower volumes were the largest driver, partially offset by pricing, material deflation and productivity. Despite the downturn, we continued to invest in the business for the long term. Additionally, capitalized costs related to new product engineering and development were reclassified to the income statement in Q2, which were a drag on margin of approximately $8 million or 1.1 percentage points for the Industrial segment. Excluding this adjustment, Industrial adjusted margins were 10.9% in Q2. 
Moving forward, we expect Industrial segment performance to trend with the market. We're planning on expanding margins in a down market in the second half of the year through aftermarket growth, productivity gains and cost controls. 
Please go to Slide 12. Our June year-to-date free cash flow of $348 million was favorable to prior year by $293 million. Strong operating income improvement and improved working capital performance were the primary drivers of the favorability. Because of our strong start to the year, we have raised our free cash flow forecast range to $1 billion to $1.1 billion from our previous range of $950 million to $1 billion. 
For the quarter, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 5.6%. We had strong collections in the quarter with our days sales outstanding improving 0.6 days over the prior year and days payable outstanding improving 0.7 days. Inventory is on plan for the quarter, and we're well positioned to serve our customers. 
Please go to Slide 13. Our cash performance in the second quarter and our expectations for the year enable us to, one, continue to invest in the strategic growth programs that Mike outlined earlier. In addition to the core strategic investments, we're also investing in long-term growth through innovation and differentiated products in such areas as connected buildings, intelligent monitoring and the self-healing systems, just to name a few. Two, we'll also maintain a strong balance sheet with a BBB credit metrics. And three, we'll also maintain -- we'll also retain optionality relative to paying a competitive dividend, acquisitions to build the business and share repurchases.
Please go to Slide 14. As always, our intention is to give you our best view of what we're seeing in our end markets sitting here today and how that translates to our revenue guidance for 2016. We've broken it down by major end markets and geographies. As you can see by the variation of colors and symbols, our end markets are seeing a wide variation in trends. 
North America commercial HVAC and residential HVAC as well as European transport and commercial HVAC markets are generally positive, while global industrial markets are declining. We're forecasting transport markets in North America to be down low single digits. Our forecast for North America trailer volumes has not changed, and we expect the market to be down was slightly for the year. This implies a decline in the second half after single-digit growth in the first half of the year. 
Asian HVAC markets are expected to be flat to down, and industrial markets in Asia remain under pressure. Golf car markets are slightly down offset by increases in the utility vehicle markets. 
All of our revenue growth forecast are shown on an organic basis. We're forecasting mid-single-digit growth in commercial HVAC in total; high single-digit growth in residential HVAC, which is essentially an all North America business for us; and a flat-to-small decline in transport globally. We expect compression-related products and other industrial equipment to be down high single digits. We expect Club Car to be up low single digits. 
Please go to Slide 15. Aggregating those market backdrops, we expect our organic revenues for the full year 2016 to be up 2% to 3% versus 2015, with foreign exchange presenting a headwind of about 1 percentage point. We expect Climate revenues to be up 4% to 5% organically. For Industrial, we expect organic revenues to be down 4% to 5%. 
For operating margins, we're excluding restructuring costs to get to adjusted margins. We expect adjusted operating margins in Climate to be between 14% and 14.5%. We expect adjusted Industrial margins to be between 10% and 11%. And for the enterprise, we expect adjusted operating margins of 11.5% to 12%. 
Please go to Slide 16. Transitioning to earnings. The reported earnings per share range is estimated to be $5.47 to $5.57 and the adjusted range is $4 to $4.10 versus our prior guidance range of $3.95 to $4.10. Adjusted numbers exclude restructuring and the Hussmann gain.
Our full year guidance reflects a tax rate forecast of 22% to 23% and an average diluted share count of approximately 260 -- 261 million shares. The tax rate reflects a 200 basis point improvement versus prior guidance of 24% to 25%. 
For the third quarter of 2016, revenues are forecasted to be up by approximately 3% organically. We're projecting Climate revenues to grow mid-single digits in Q3 and Industrial to decline low single digits. Adjusted third quarter earnings per share are forecasted to be between $1.25 and $1.30, excluding restructuring charges of about $0.01.
For the full year 2016, we also raised our free cash flow expectations and now expect free cash flow to be between $1 billion and $1.1 billion, excluding restructuring charges and proceeds from the sale of Hussmann. 
And with that, I'm going to turn it back to Mike for a few closing comments."

So to conclude, we had an excellent quarter grounded in solid execution. I'm proud of the many people within Ingersoll Rand that continue to deliver for our customers and for our shareholders. I'm pleased with the progress and the momentum and the implementation of our operating system, and the growing depth and bench strength throughout the company that makes the operating systems come to life through continuous improvement. 
We're building a stronger, more valuable and more sustainable and less cyclical Ingersoll Rand than ever before. And it's exciting to me and leaders throughout the company to be part of that transformation and to help create a bright future with more individual development possibilities for all our people throughout the world. 
Results we reported this morning are a direct result of the strategic work, the persistence, the tenacity of the talented people that represent the unique culture we're building. It is a strategic advantage and it's the toughest thing in any business for a competitor to copy. 
There are a few takeaways I want to point out to you as we head to the back half of the year and into 2017. First, the Industrial businesses are running effectively in a very tough market environment. The management team is aggressively taking and will continue to take the right actions to reduce the overall cost structure of the business. And it's committed to protecting the key product and service investments that will build long-term growth and margin expansion when the markets improve.
Second, the transport market is performing as we expected. And as we said at the beginning of the year, we expect the first half results to be up and the back half of the year would be down. The management team has done an effective job anticipating and seeing around the corners and is proactively taking the actions to ensure strong margin performance continues. 
Third, commodity deflation has been a tailwind during the first half of the year, and it's going to moderate to neutral in the back half of the year. We have a long track record of managing the price material input equation very effectively and we're going to continue to do so going forward. 
And finally, let me say, we are proactively reviewing both prior restructuring considerations as well as new actions as our business, markets and even the input variables into our own models continue to evolve. Although we don't have any immediate additional restructuring actions to take or announce today, we won't hesitate to take additional prudent restructuring actions going forward. 
So with that, Sue and I will be happy to take your questions."

So as I think about Climate in the back half of the year, you're going to have a couple of different dynamics. The first of which, as we talked about, was that direct material was going to moderate in terms of its deflationary environment. So let me talk about that for just a second. What we expect to see in the back half of the year is we expect to see that steel, particularly in the fourth quarter, is going to turn more inflationary than deflationary. So that's part of what's happening with the flatter margins. We're also going to continue to invest in the overall business in the back half of the year. Again, we've got some significant product launches, and we see this as an area that really sets us up for success. So it's really price, a little bit of mix that comes from us lapping the 14 SEER in residential and then investment in the business."

And so that continues for the balance of the year for us. And that's something that I think is vitally important. There's a tremendous effort underway at reducing cost in that business. Much of what's not just visible through what you'd say would be qualified restructuring. Much of that is just reduction in place and just other containment actions being taken in the business. So that, really, when I say the business is being run effectively, I have no doubt that all the rocks are being turned over with the exception of protecting this critical investment pool that is important to us going forward. And I use that one example for you because that happened to be the example of the product growth team. It's the one product area that we have launched in that portfolio, and we're getting tremendous results with that. So again, this gives us some confidence that, although it's not a great story for the third and the fourth quarter, we're not running the company for the third and the fourth quarter. We run the company for the long run, and we hope investors see that. And that's part of the reason I think taking good success around the Climate business, keeping utilization up through the combined factory structures that we've got, leveraging the networks of that -- excellence across the compression-related businesses that we have, give us the opportunity to stay the course on these investments, and that's really important."

It's a great question, and thanks for the opportunity to step back and look at it. Because I look back over the 7 years that I've been in this role, and I remember when Industrial was the sweetheart of the portfolio, right, from '09 to '11 even through '13. And we're expanding margins so fast that it afforded us the opportunity to do all the great investment we made in the Trane, res and commercial businesses, which is really why you're seeing the numbers that you're seeing today in that business. And so now it's flipped. Remember, that was all happening with no real commercial -- certainly, no institutional support coming from construction markets. And now that's flipped. And it's allowed us the opportunity to keep factories fairly loaded. It's given us the opportunity to keep technical professionals highly engaged in development of product. And all that really just -- it really sets up where at some point when the commercial market in HVAC slows down, when institutional eventually fades, our hope is that we've got a strong, refreshed, energy-efficient, reliable portfolio sitting, particularly, in compression technologies. And we're going to leverage that just like we did from '09 to '11 when it grew 7 full points. We are very leveraged here toward some of those fixed costs. Where we play in the market is in the big machine. It's not the Cameron -- I'm not talking about Cameron, I'm talking about Cameron plus. All the 250- to 400-horse centrifugal air compressors, of which we're the leader now in that area. And we don't really participate much in the vacuum and blower business, which has some growth in it. So we have a product portfolio and a position in the market in these larger machines, that's what's getting hurt right now. And we're not going to throw the baby out with the bathwater here on that, for sure. That's why in addition to I mentioned the product development, but the machining investments I mentioned in the last call and this call, those are going to continue. And we'll put $50 million in the machining in this downturn, so that when we emerge out of this thing, we're going to be more productive. The hope that it's not just 7 points of margin, it's more than 7 points of margins coming back. So Jeff, I think, I really have got my head around the value of what we've created around integrating the portfolio. And over the long run, not really so interested in a flash in the pan around some multiple for short cycle. I'm really interested in building the value of the company over the long run. And again, step back 2009, Jeff, if you invested back in 2009, you're a very happy investor. And I thank you for all the Christmas cards we get to that effect.

But I'm going to kind of use some of the same passion that Mike had in his comments on the multiples and what we've built at Ingersoll Rand. From a perspective of our cash generation and then our ensuing capital allocation, we're really trying to create longer-term shareholder value with the cash that we're generating. And so what we've seen that has been really successful for us is investing in our products and investing in areas like energy efficiency and sustainability. Those are proven for us in terms of building our growth excellence. If we look at Operational Excellence, all of the work that we've done and invested in the company, whether it's in our factories or in our overall processes with the business operating system, all of that has shown to be something that has worked very well for us. So our preference, as we think about capital allocation and your question, is to really invest and grow the company. So to be more specific, then, in terms of what that means, it means I want to continue to invest. It means I want to continue to do all of those things. It means we want to look at the M&A pipeline. But what we have is an opportunity where we can be patient, we can wait for the right opportunity and not just take the cash that we're generating and run out and buy something. So we're really, really thinking about investments. We're thinking about M&A. Dividends are extremely important to us. We understand that. And we're going to continue to have dividends that are in line with our peer payout ratios, and we'll also be opportunistic about share repurchase. I don't want to take that completely off the table.

Vacuum and blowers, you called out, and that's actually still been a market growing. Yes, when you think about oil-free or vacuum and blowers, you have to think about the industries that they go into. And those industries happen into be growing as well, as opposed to some of the heavier industries that would use some of the larger centrifugal machines for the most part. So we do a very thorough compare with all public information that we can pick up from all of our various competitors, not just a single competitor. Have a good understanding of sort of how that mix looks, and then we are realists about where the opportunity is for us to self-help where we can.

And I used 250- to 400-horsepowers as being a big machine down 20%. Actually, as you go up between 250 and 400 and past 400, those growth rates start to look like minus 50%, okay, from where they were. These are the most capital-intensive sort of factories we have. And that certainly, when we have those kinds of volume drops, really adversely affects our mix. So you look at volume alone contributing 3 points of negativity on the bridge, you can see what volume does. And as a proof point, again, go back and look at '09 through '11, look what happened when volume came in, after we had been effectively restructuring the footprint there, and that's where that 7 points came from. So we're heavily leveraged toward that any way you slice it, and that's the main reason for it. Now on the oil and gas side?"

I mean, that's not -- that's part of the issue because you don't have large projects, but it's really the derivative.

I mean, that's not -- that's part of the issue because you don't have large projects, but it's really the derivative. So all the other projects just aren't happening, and so it sort of gets labeled with oil and gas. And so let me step back and also add to what Mike was talking about. When I started talking about Industrial early in 2016, and I was sort of breaking it down into pieces for you. What I said was that Club Car was about 20% of the business, and it was going to be up sort of low to mid-single digits, that the aftermarket was about 30% of the Industrial segment, and then it was going to be up low single digits. Then I talked about the big machines being down in excess of 20%, and some of the small rotary and small air being up slightly for the year. And then some of the other businesses like the Material Handling business and the tools businesses being down sort of mid-single digits for the year. If I take that and transform that now into what we're seeing in 2016 after 2 quarters: Club Car, the same spot. They're growing in the mid-single-digits range and that's on track. The aftermarket piece of Industrial is continuing to grow. So you've got sort of solid footing with about 50% of the business. However, when you get over into the other side where I talked about -- if I talked about large machines being down 20%, as Mike said, they're now down 50%, so they are down way larger than what we thought. And even some of the smaller equipment is really much more pressured than I thought it was going to be. And instead of being up sort of low single digits, it's going to be down. So you really just have a lot of dynamics that are going on there with the Industrial business. And to bring it back and wrap it around your question about oil and gas and projects, again, it's really the derivative effects for us in most of our industrial businesses where the large projects just aren't happening and the ones that are happening are much more competitive."

And so the drag on the Middle East was fairly material. We're seeing some growth in China. That growth was really around shipping product that was booked, but we really haven't seen the pickup in China per se. If you look at China nonresidential construction, it's still a negative, but for the past 6 or 7 months, it's been trending up. I think it's gone from negative 17% up to negative 2%, but it hasn't crossed over. We really would have thought at this point, we would've seen more pick up. The nice thing in China, buildings are built in about half the speed that we see in other parts of the world, and our cycle times for delivery can be half of what they are in other parts of the world as well. So if we did see a China recovery on the HVAC side, you need to see that, say, within a 6-month period, not a 12-month period. But as you get into July and you're not really seeing the bookings here, it's just a way of really derisking the forecast. And really, that derisking is a theme coming into the industrial portfolio too. At this point, if we haven't seen bookings on large machines or bookings on midsize, even rotary machines at this point in time, the reality is you just call it lower, and it's what we've done.

I'm going to begin by discussing our strategy and how as a [ph] foundation, our business operating system drives top tier financial performance for shareholders. Sue will provide more details about the quarter financials and guidance, then I'll close with a few comments before we answer your questions. 
As a matter of strategy, more than 90% of our product portfolio directly addresses demands for greater productivity and energy efficiency, with lower greenhouse gas emissions in buildings, homes, industrial and transport markets around the world. The strength and resiliency of our portfolio comes from our leadership in growing markets that are durable because these markets are central to addressing the global strategic imperative to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to conserve resources. 
Our business operating system is a systematic way our people work within the company to deliver against our strategy globally. It is a holistic approach that establishes strong baseline execution expectations and builds on those expectations through continuous development of people and improvement of processes and standards. Respecting and engaging our people in the development and maturation of our business operating system makes it sustainable and is a core element of what it takes to win over the long term. Rigorous execution of our business operating system has enabled us to deliver consistent top-tier financial performance across key metrics, including organic growth, incremental margins, EPS growth and cash flow conversion over many years. 
The third quarter demonstrated our consistent progress against these key metrics. We delivered strong organic growth of 3% across our diversified portfolio. We had record operating margins of 14.1% and drove leverage through the P&L, resulting in adjusted EPS growth of 17%. Year-to-date, free cash flow is more than 100% of adjusted net income, demonstrating our ability to convert earnings into real cash, a fundamental driver of valuation. 
Record margins in the quarter were primarily driven by continued strength in our Climate business, where adjusted operating margins expanded 90 basis points to 16.7%, with particular strength in our commercial and residential HVAC businesses. 
We are also pleased to report that our Industrial business turned in a positive direction in quarter 3, with an [ph] adjusted operating margins higher by 180 basis points sequentially to 11.6%. Adjusting for the capitalized cost that we discussed last quarter of 1.1 percentage points, the business improved 70 basis points sequentially from 10.9% to 11.6%. The actions we've been taking to improve the business are taking hold, and we believe we saw margins bottom in the second quarter. 
Improved profitability was driven by Operational Excellence and our continued focus on delivering innovation centered on energy efficiencies, sustainability, system reliability, as well as disruptive, game-changing technological advancements in areas like controls and digital connectivity. 
In quarter 3, our overall growth was led by our commercial and residential HVAC businesses in North America, where we continue to see strong double-digit growth and market share gains. Our performance in 2016 is a direct result of the continuous long-term investment program, prioritized around a clear set of opportunities and managed from inception to launch by focused and committed product growth teams. And [ph] that result is in [ph]our  product growth team's average to growth rate above 4x higher than our overall average growth rate in quarter 3. Continuously delivering innovation through our product growth teams is one way we produce strong financial results and stay ahead competitively. 
But the key driver is our commitment to being the leader in energy-efficient and sustainable products. About 10 days ago, the 28th meeting of the parties to [ph] the Montreal Protocol was held. At that meeting, about 200 countries agreed to an amendment that phases out hydrofluorocarbons beginning in 2019 and aims for an 80% reduction in their use by 2045. For several years now, we have been planning for the phaseout of hydrofluorocarbons, and over that time, we have been a leader in developing several commercialized next-generation low global warming potential products that meet and exceed the transition requirements to help customers achieve their sustainability goals. 
Two years ago, we made a public climate commitment to a 50% reduction of refrigerant greenhouse gases in the footprint of our products by 2020 and to transition out of current refrigerants before 2030. We did this to help customers plan from transition period based upon their business needs and system requirements. We are on track to complete; our commitment goals, and to date, have avoided approximately 2 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent globally. 
Another example is our EcoWise product portfolio. Typically, when an ecofriendly refrigerant is used in a system, it reduces efficiency and can sometimes compromise safety. For example, the gas might be flammable or more toxic. With the introduction of our equalize product portfolio, we've not only developed a low global warming potential refrigerant product, we've also designed the product resistant [ph] is more energy-efficient. The prime example of this is our new line of centrifugal chillers that have near 0 global warming potential, do not concede [ph] safety and deliver 13.5% better efficiency than chillers using hydrofluorocarbons. So now, our customers' not choosing between being green or being efficient. Through EcoWise, they're able to do both. 
Growth with these products has been excellent. In Europe, for example, the EcoWise portfolio growth has nearly doubled over the last year, and we see a healthy pipeline of high-profile jobs coming in like the Chunnel Tunnel between France and the U.K. After considering -- retrofitted [ph] our equipment, our expert technical team worked with Chunnel operators to install units from our EcoWise portfolio this year. With near 0 global warming potential, these [ph] will allow us savings of around 40% of electrical energy use in the Chunnel's cooling system. And to give you some perspective, the energy savings for this project is about as much energy as the island of Aruba generates annually. That's [ph] a savings of 53% compared to the customer's former units that we replaced from one of our competitors. 
Vertical integration is another way that we drive growth and leverage technical know-how across our Climate and Industrial segments. Our vertical integration and compressor technology is one area of real competitive advantage because we engineer and manufacture our screw [ph] centrifugal, and the majority of our squirrel [ph] compressors, we own the intellectual property and accelerated our time-to-market with these products. Through our energy efficiency strategy, the next-generation R-Series air compressor that we introduced in quarter 3 incorporates the latest advancements in variable speed drive technology to increase airflow output up to 15%, reduce energy cost up to 35% with an increase in system reliability. Customers are finding the product offering compelling, and we are outpacing the market growth rate as a result. 
These are just a few examples of how we're making investments in long-term innovation, energy efficiency and productivity to stay ahead of the competition and in front of an increasing regulatory environment. We are also tying in services, controls and wireless to our products so they are leading-edge as technology continues to move quickly. We continue to see double-digit increases in our commercial HVAC controls business and high single-digit growth in services.  In compression technologies, we also realized mid-single-digit growth in our aftermarket business. 
Our multiyear trend in aftermarket growth is consistent with our strategy to drive service penetration across our segments and create a more resilient portfolio. 
Turning to cash and capital allocation. Q3 was another quarter of steady and strong cash flow. Year-to-date, free cash flow is nearly $1 billion. Over the past 5 years, our cash flow ROIC has averaged 18% per annum. Our top priority is to increase shareholder returns through high ROIC investments in our business that build a platform for consistent cash generation and investment in growth and innovation. Our long-standing commitment to organic long-term strategic investments is what has enabled us to perform well in both up and down climate or industrial cycles over the years. As an example, in 2016, we've been investing heavily in channel investments that will improve growth by penetrating key markets over the next several years. 
In addition to fully investing in the business, we spent $250 million in 2016 on share buybacks. We've raised our dividend twice: 10% in February, an [ph] additional 25% in October; and we continue to have an increasing pipeline of interesting M&A opportunities. Our consistency in performance resulted [ph] in strong cash flow and healthy balance sheet puts us in an excellent position to maintain significant optionality to move quickly across any or all capital allocation fronts as opportunities arise in this uncertain and often volatile global economy. 
Before I hand things over to Sue, I want to hit on 3 key areas that we know are important for you to understand based on our conversations with many investors. 
Turning to Slide 4. I'm pleased with the progress of our Industrial segment in the third quarter, and we believe we remain on track to achieve our guidance for 2016 margins of 10% to 11%. The continuing actions we've taken and are taking to deliver improvement are taking hold. [ph] We continue to focus on operational excellence initiatives, restructuring and reducing costs, increased focus on parts and service, and here, we're already seeing growth in the service business, but we believe we can step on the gas even further in this area. Segmentation and focus on growing markets like food and beverage, pharma and electronics, and continuing multiyear product channel initiating investments to achieve strong leverage where the market's recovering. It's important to note based on the actions we've taken and what we're seeing in the business that we believe Q2 marked the trough in [ph] operating margins for the business, and we're expecting improved performance going forward in 2017, although the results may not be a straight line up quarter-to-quarter. 
If you turn to Slide 5, the main takeaway here is that the Thermo King business is resilient. We saw this in the third quarter where revenues were down but margins moved higher. For 2016, we continue to see the business being consistent with the expectations we set out in July. The team deserves a lot of execution credit there for improving margins on declining revenue and for building a more resilient and valuable franchise over time. 
Quarter 3 is a great example. The transport business grew margins on a 12% lower revenue base. We do expect about a 20% decline in trailers next year, but we believe we should be able to mitigate some of the downside by growing the business in other regions and in other TK products. 
Moving to Slide 6. Another topic in the minds of investors is how the Dodge data for nonresidential put in place [ph] translates to Ingersoll-Rand. Here, I think it's important to weigh out where our business comes from and what drives the market, but I think the market overestimates our exposure. As the chart shows, the North American commercial HVAC segment is about $4 billion and is split about 50-50 between services and equipment. Of the equipment, about 65% is replacement business, so not new put in place. [ph] The result is that our Dodge put in place [ph] data just covers about 18% of our business. Additionally, when you drill down further into the 18%, about 50% is commercial and 50% is institutional. Institutional is expected to show good growth in 2016 and even better growth in 2017. Our data said North American commercial HVAC will be mid-single digits in 2016 and a similar number in 2017. So we continue to see a healthy market going into next year. 
And with that, I'll turn things over to Sue."
280944,403397444,1061508,"Ingersoll-Rand Plc, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Trane Technologies plc","Executives","Thank you, Mike. Let's go to Slide 7. I'd like to begin with a summary of main points for you to take away from today's call. As Mike discussed, we continue to execute the core tenets of our business operating system in Q3, building upon our strong 2016 p",2018,"Thank you, Mike. Let's go to Slide 7. I'd like to begin with a summary of main points for you to take away from today's call. As Mike discussed, we continue to execute the core tenets of our business operating system in Q3, building upon our strong 2016 performance across the 3 pillars of growth, profitability, and cash flow. Adjusted earnings per share was up 17% on 3% organic revenue growth. Cash flow was 180% of net income for the quarter. 
Our performance was highlighted by record results in our North America, commercial and residential HVAC businesses, where we captured additional market share, while at the same time expanding margins year-over-year. 
In our Industrial business, we drove 180 basis points of improved operating margin performance sequentially. We continue to take further actions on operational excellence initiatives, increased our commercial focus on aftermarket parts and service and added cost-reduction initiatives to improve operating results going forward. The margin improvement was 70 basis points after adjusting Q2 margins for capitalized new product engineering and development costs that we highlighted in last quarter's earnings materials. We believe we are largely maintaining our growing market share across the portfolio despite continued soft industrial end markets. 
During the quarter, we also extended our strong free cash flow performance by $644 million, bringing our year-to-date total to $992 million, up $527 million from the prior year. Given our long-term expectations for strong earnings and cash conversion, we also increased our dividend by 25% in October to $0.40 per share or $1.60 annualized, making our dividend highly competitive not only in our peer group, but across the broader market. Additionally, we now believe our free cash flow for 2016 will approximate $1.3 billion, up more than $200 million from our previous guidance of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. 
We've also increased our earnings per share guidance for the year given our year-to-date performance and outlook. Our revised guidance of between $4.17 and $4.22 is higher by $0.14 at the midpoint, reflecting the flow-through of our Q3 overperformance versus our Q3 guidance midpoint and an $0.88 to $0.93 fourth quarter. The fourth quarter of $0.90 to $0.91 at the midpoint is consistent with our prior guidance. 
On the next several slides, I will highlight the key messages for this earnings call. Please go to Slide 8. Our strong enterprise performance on organic growth, earnings per share growth and cash flow conversion was highlighted by our North America HVAC businesses and by sequential operating margin improvement in our Industrial segment versus the prior quarter. Organic revenue was up 3%, as adjusted margins improved 30 basis points year-on-year with 30% operating leverage. Our business operating system again guided us through good execution of our factories and in our cost centers. Our focus was on good operating results in a low growth environment, and we delivered against that objective. 
Please go to Slide 9. Organic orders continued to be solid through the third quarter of 2016, led by our Climate business and partially offset by soft Industrial markets. Climate orders were up 4% organically. Organic global commercial HVAC bookings were up mid-single digit, led by low-teens growth in North America unitary. We also continue to drive excellent growth in service, controls and contracting, with low-teens growth in the quarter. Residential bookings were solid, up mid-single digits. 
Organic transport orders were down low single-digits, with order growth in Europe and Asia offset by declines in North America trailer and auxiliary power units. Consistent with our guidance, we continue to expect bookings to decline in North America trailer. 
On balance, the Industrial businesses were flat to down modestly, and we are calling a broad-based recovery in the near term. 
Please go to Slide 10. This slide provides a directional view of our segment revenue performance by region. In our Climate segment, we saw solid performance in both North America and Latin America and low-single-digit growth in the Middle East. In our Industrial segment, overall performance was essentially flat, with high single-digit growth in Europe, Middle East and Africa due to the shipment of large orders in the Middle East, and mid-single-digit growth in Asia, offset by declines in North America and Latin America. 
Please go to Slide 11. Climate performance was running the quarter, with organic revenues up 3% and adjusted operating margins up 90 basis points. Commercial HVAC organic revenues were up mid-single digits, highlighted by exceptional growth in North America contracting, up 17%, and unitary equipment in North America, up low teens. In Europe, business was unusually light, impacted by the slowdown in activity during the summer holiday season, driving mid-single-digit equipment declines. Europe services contracting and parts were flat. Residential continued their outstanding year, with revenues up low-teens. 
Transport organic revenues were down low-teens in the quarter, driven by weakening North America trailer and soft APU and Marine markets. Despite lower revenues, margins expanded 110 basis points with increases in both North America and Europe, Middle East and Africa. This demonstrates more resilient franchise we discussed. Growth in aftermarket parts and services, trucks and [indiscernible] trailers drove higher margins and helped mitigate the impact of the downturn. 
Please go to Slide 12. Climate reported operating margins expanded 110 basis points year-over-year. Volume and mix were favorable across commercial and residential HVAC, partially offset by volume in transport. Price and direct material deflation and productivity also contributed to margin improvement. Additionally, we continued to invest in the business to drive innovation and growth. 
Please go to Slide 13. Third quarter Industrial margins improved 180 basis points from second quarter trough margins on 1% organic revenue growth. Margin improvement was still solid at 70 basis points when accounting for Q2 2016 capitalized costs related to new product engineering and development of $8 million that we discussed last quarter. Excluding those costs, Q2 margin was 10.9%.  Industrial end markets remained soft in Q3 and are expected to be soft through 2016. 
Revenues were up mid-single digits in compressors with growth in aftermarket, oil free and large machines with easier comparisons to the prior year. Other industrial products were down low-teens, with material handling showing the largest decline due to oil and gas exposure. Small electric vehicles were down slightly in the quarter. 
Please go to Slide 14. Industrial's reported operating margin of 10.9% was down 300 basis points versus prior year. Volume and mix were the largest drivers of this decline. Pricing offset materials, but given the continued low volumes running through our factories, productivity did not offset inflation in the quarter. We continued planned investment in our products and channel and restructuring to improve our cost base. Looking forward, we expect margins to improve in 2017, given ongoing margin improvement actions, although we do expect some variability due to cyclicality. 
Please go to Slide 15. September year-to-date [ph] free cash flow of $992 [ph] million was favorable to prior year by $527 million. Strong operating income improvement and working capital performance were the primary drivers of the favorability. For the quarter, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 4.9%. Our 2016 goal is approximately 4%. 
Based on strong performance year-to-date and our confidence in future cash conversion, we have raised our 2016 free cash flow forecast to approximately $1.3 billion. This is up more than $200 million from our prior range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. 
We have a proud history of returning cash to shareholders. Since 2011, our free cash flow as a percentage of net income has averaged 100%. Over that same time frame, we returned more than $6.5 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends of $1.5 billion and share buybacks of $5.1 billion. 
You may have noted that we referenced cash flow ROIC a few times today. Our definition is free cash flow divided by close fixed assets plus working capital. Our goal is period-over-period improvement in this metric, and we are doing well in 2016 with improved free cash flow and balanced capital expenditures and working capital. 
Please go to Slide 16. Our strong cash performance in the third quarter and our expectations moving forward enable us to, one, continue to invest in strategic growth programs, as Mike outlined earlier. In addition to the core strategic investments, we're also investing in long-term growth through innovative and differentiated products in areas such as controls for buildings as a resource, intelligent monitoring and self-healing systems, just to name a few; two, we've paid an annual dividend for 106 years and have consistently raised the dividend over time. Over the past 5 years, we've raised our annual dividend at a 20% compound annual growth rate. In October, we announced dividend increase of 25% to $0.40 per quarter or to $1.60 per share annually. Three, we will continue to purchase sweeping shares sufficient to offset dilution, roughly $250 million per year. Four, we continue to see an increasing number of positive, potential acquisition targets. And five, we strive to maintain a strong balance sheet with BBB metrics to provide optionality as our markets continue to evolve. We will continue to create long-term value for our shareholders through capital allocation, as we have consistently done for years. 
Please go to Slide 17. Our intention is to give you our best view of what we are seeing in our end markets sitting here today and how that trend links to our revenue guidance for the remainder of 2016. We've broken it down by major end markets and geographies. As you can see by the variation of colors and symbols, our end markets are seeing a wide variation in trends. Markets for North America commercial and residential HVAC as well as European transport and commercial HVAC are generally positive, while global Industrial markets remain soft. We are forecasting global trends [indiscernible] markets to be down low single-digits. Our forecast for North America trailer volumes has not changed and we expect the market to be down slightly for the year. This implies a decline in the second half, after single digit growth in the first half of the year. Asian HVAC markets are expected to be flat to down, and Industrial markets in Asia remain under pressure. Club Car markets are slightly down, offset by increases in the utility vehicle markets. 
All of our revenue growth forecasts are shown on an organic basis. We are forecasting mid-single-digit growth in commercial HVAC in total, high single-digit growth in residential HVAC, which is essentially an all North America business for us and a small decline in transport globally. 
Please go to Slide 18. Aggregating those market backdrops, we expect organic revenues for the full year 2016 to be up approximately 2% versus 2015, with foreign exchange presenting a headwind of about 1 percentage point. We expect organic revenues to be up approximately 4% for Climate and down 3% for Industrial. Adjusted operating margins, which exclude restructuring costs, are expected to be at the high end of our previous ranges for the enterprise at 12% and for Climate at 14.5%. Adjusted Industrial margins are expected to be at the midpoint of our previous range of 10% to 11%. Please go to Slide 19. 
Transitioning to earnings, the reported earnings per share range is estimated to be $5.62 to $5.67 and the adjusted range is $4.17 to $4.22, up $0.14 to $0.15. At the midpoint, this represents a 12% increase in earnings per share over 2015. Adjusted numbers exclude restructuring and the Hussmann gain. We have raised our full year guidance for free cash flow more than $200 million to approximately $1.3 billion from $1 billion to $1.1 billion, reflecting continued strong cash flows through 2016. For the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect Climate revenues to be up 2% to 4% organically, while Industrial revenues are expected to be down 6% to 8%. Adjusted fourth quarter earnings per share is forecasted to be between $0.88 and $0.93, excluding restructuring targets of about $0.02. The midpoint is consistent with or slightly higher than our previous guidance midpoint of $0.90 per share. 
With that, I will turn it back to Mike for a few closing comments."

As we conclude, I want to emphasize a few points that I think are important for you to have as takeaways as we head into the final quarter and into 2017. 
First, we are performing well, with a solid strategy punctuated with excellent execution over time. As a result, we have delivered consistent, reliable top-tier financial performance on organic growth, EPS growth and cash flow over Industrial and Climate cycles. 
Second, our management team is effective in anticipating and seeing around the corners. Our commercial HVAC business is strong and focused on the right growth areas with equipment, controls and service. We believe we have turned the corner with our Industrial segment and starting to realize margin improvement versus the quarter 2 trough. 
And our transport refrigeration business is resilient. Our team is capturing margin expansion despite downward sales. 
Finally, we're building a stronger, more valuable, more sustainable and less cyclical Ingersoll Rand. The results we reported today are a direct result of the strategic work, persistence and tenacity of the talented people that represent the unique culture we built. I'm proud of our people, who continue to deliver for our customers and our shareholders. Our momentum is strong as we conclude the year and head into 2017.

So what we've done in 2016 is we've really changed the way that free cash flow has come in. So every quarter, as we've started out 2016, we've had positive cash flow as opposed to having everything really back-end loaded. So again, I think where we're at at $992 million at the end of the third quarter is fabulous. We brought it forward, and we brought it forward by paying attention to things like terms on accounts receivable, making sure that accounts receivable is balanced with accounts payable in terms across the globe. With working through inventories and making sure inventories were there to serve the customer but not too much to have additional products on hand. So we've really managed this very, very carefully. And so what you're seeing in the fourth quarter is really that instead of doing heroics to end of the quarter, we'd normalize it, which is really how we want to operate the business and how we want our cash flow to come in."

We're going to remain focused in terms of the price cost spread. We know we'll have a few headwinds on the sell-side, but we still have a bit of deflation that occurs on the basis of copper that we already have locked in and some of the aluminum that we have locked in for 2017. We're also going to hit productivity really, really hard in the business, that's part of our hallmark of operational excellence, and we are going to offset inflation. We're going to continue to press on corporate. So earnings per share growth next year, I think, is going to come from all of the different parts of the business as well as tax. Now tax is something that we're really proud of. And we're really proud of because it's -- we started to talk about a low 20s tax rate earlier in the year. We got there faster than we expected, but we got there by really doing what we call operationalizing tax, which is basically we assign tax partners to each of our SBUs. They're working projects within the SBUs to actually work down the effective tax rate, things like trading hubs, things like energy credit, things like really legal entity simplification. So we've really operationalized that. I think it's kind of cutting edge. I still don't think our tax rate is going to go below the low 20s. I think that's where it should be. So yes, we'll get some tailwind out of that going into 2017 because I think below 20 is where we project the rate. But I think it's -- I think it's operational also and something I think is really good for Ingersoll Rand."

As we start to look at 2017, I think what 2017 does is it reverts to what we've said all along which is that we would have a 20 to 30 basis points spread between price and cost. And as you start to look at commodities for 2017, so steel has moved around a little bit. We saw an increase earlier in the summer to over $800 a ton. We currently see spot prices back in the $700 range. So we have about 6 months time lag between when those prices move around and when we see it translated. That means I'm going to see some steel inflation in the fourth quarter as well as probably the first quarter of 2017. However, I still continue to see tailwinds coming out of copper and aluminum going into 2017, helping us to offset that balance. So we have line of sight to what we think the commodities are going to do, and therefore, we have line of sigh what our costs are so we can price our operating model the top line margin expansion and get back to the 20 to 30 basis points for the year."

I'm going to begin by discussing our strategy and how as a foundation, our business operating system drives top tier financial performance for shareholders. Sue will provide more details about the quarter financials and guidance, then I'll close with a few comments before we answer your questions. 
As a matter of strategy, more than 90% of our product portfolio directly addresses demands for greater productivity and energy efficiency, with lower greenhouse gas emissions in buildings, homes, industrial and transport markets around the world. The strength and resiliency of our portfolio comes from our leadership in growing markets that are durable because these markets are central to addressing the global strategic imperative to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to conserve resources. 
Our business operating system is a systematic way our people work within the company to deliver against our strategy globally. It is a holistic approach that establishes strong baseline execution expectations and builds on those expectations through continuous development of people and improvement of processes and standards. Respecting and engaging our people in the development and maturation of our business operating system makes it sustainable and is a core element of what it takes to win over the long term. Rigorous execution of our business operating system has enabled us to deliver consistent top-tier financial performance across key metrics, including organic growth, incremental margins, EPS growth and cash flow conversion over many years. 
The third quarter demonstrated our consistent progress against these key metrics. We delivered strong organic growth of 3% across our diversified portfolio. We had record operating margins of 14.1% and drove leverage through the P&L, resulting in adjusted EPS growth of 17%. Year-to-date, free cash flow is more than 100% of adjusted net income, demonstrating our ability to convert earnings into real cash, a fundamental driver of valuation. 
Record margins in the quarter were primarily driven by continued strength in our Climate business, where adjusted operating margins expanded 90 basis points to 16.7%, with particular strength in our commercial and residential HVAC businesses. 
We are also pleased to report that our Industrial business turned in a positive direction in quarter 3, moving adjusted operating margins higher by 180 basis points sequentially to 11.6%. Adjusting for the capitalized cost that we discussed last quarter of 1.1 percentage points, the business improved 70 basis points sequentially from 10.9% to 11.6%. The actions we've been taking to improve the business are taking hold, and we believe we saw margins bottom in the second quarter. 
Improved profitability was driven by Operational Excellence and our continued focus on delivering innovation centered on energy efficiencies, sustainability, system reliability, as well as disruptive, game-changing technological advancements in areas like controls and digital connectivity. 
In quarter 3, our overall growth was led by our commercial and residential HVAC businesses in North America, where we continue to see strong double-digit growth and market share gains. Our performance in 2016 is a direct result of the continuous long-term investment program, prioritized around a clear set of opportunities and managed from inception to launch by focused and committed product growth teams. And that result is that our product growth team's average to growth rate about 4x higher than our overall average growth rate in quarter 3. Continuously delivering innovation through our product growth teams is one way we produce strong financial results and stay ahead competitively. 
But the key driver is our commitment to being the leader in energy-efficient and sustainable products. About 10 days ago, the 28th meeting of the parties to the Montreal Protocol was held. At that meeting, about 200 countries agreed to an amendment that phases out hydrofluorocarbons beginning in 2019 and aims for an 80% reduction in their use by 2045. For several years now, we have been planning for the phaseout of hydrofluorocarbons, and over that time, we have been a leader in developing several commercialized next-generation low global warming potential products that meet and exceed the transition requirements to help customers achieve their sustainability goals. 
Two years ago, we made a public climate commitment to a 50% reduction of refrigerant greenhouse gases in the footprint of our products by 2020 and to transition out of current refrigerants before 2030. We did this to help customers plan from transition period based upon their business needs and system requirements. We are on track to complete; our commitment goals, and to date, have avoided approximately 2 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent globally. 
Another example is our EcoWise product portfolio. Typically, when an ecofriendly refrigerant is used in a system, it reduces efficiency and can sometimes compromise safety. For example, the gas might be flammable or more toxic. With the introduction of our EcoWise product portfolio, we've not only developed a low global warming potential refrigerant product, we've also designed it so the product or system is more energy-efficient. The prime example of this is our new line of centrifugal chillers that have near 0 global warming potential, do not concede safety and deliver 13.5% better efficiency than chillers using hydrofluorocarbons. So now, our customers' not choosing between being green or being efficient. Through EcoWise, they're able to do both. 
Growth with these products has been excellent. In Europe, for example, the EcoWise portfolio growth has nearly doubled over the last year, and we see a healthy pipeline of high-profile jobs coming in like the Chunnel Tunnel between France and the U.K. After considering -- retrofitted our equipment, our expert technical team worked with Chunnel operators to install units from our EcoWise portfolio this year. With near 0 global warming potential, the units will allow us savings of around 40% of electrical energy use in the Chunnel's cooling system. And to give you some perspective, the energy savings for this project is about as much energy as the island of Aruba generates annually. That's a savings of 53% compared to the customer's former units that we replaced from one of our competitors. 
Vertical integration is another way that we drive growth and leverage technical know-how across our Climate and Industrial segments. Our vertical integration in compressor technology is one area of real competitive advantage because we engineer and manufacture our screw centrifugal and the majority of our scroll compressors, we own the intellectual property and accelerated our time-to-market with these products. Through our energy efficiency strategy, the next-generation R-Series air compressor that we introduced in quarter 3 incorporates the latest advancements in variable speed drive technology to increase airflow output up to 15%, reduce energy cost up to 35% with an increase in system reliability. Customers are finding the product offering compelling, and we are outpacing the market growth rate as a result. 
These are just a few examples of how we're making investments in long-term innovation, energy efficiency and productivity to stay ahead of the competition and in front of an increasing regulatory environment. We are also tying in services, controls and wireless to our products so they are leading-edge as technology continues to move quickly. We continue to see double-digit increases in our commercial HVAC controls business and high single-digit growth in services.  In compression technologies, we also realized mid-single-digit growth in our aftermarket business. 
Our multiyear trend in aftermarket growth is consistent with our strategy to drive service penetration across our segments and create a more resilient portfolio. 
Turning to cash and capital allocation. Q3 was another quarter of steady and strong cash flow. Year-to-date, free cash flow is nearly $1 billion. Over the past 5 years, our cash flow ROIC has averaged 18% per annum. Our top priority is to increase shareholder returns through high ROIC investments in our business that build a platform for consistent cash generation and investment in growth and innovation. Our long-standing commitment to organic long-term strategic investments is what has enabled us to perform well in both up and down climate or industrial cycles over the years. As an example, in 2016, we've been investing heavily in channel investments that will improve growth by penetrating key markets over the next several years. 
In addition to fully investing in the business, we spent $250 million in 2016 on share buybacks. We've raised our dividend twice: 10% in February, an  additional 25% in October; and we continue to have an increasing pipeline of interesting M&A opportunities. Our consistency in performance and our result in strong cash flow and healthy balance sheet puts us in an excellent position to maintain significant optionality to move quickly across any or all capital allocation fronts as opportunities arise in this uncertain and often volatile global economy. 
Before I hand things over to Sue, I want to hit on 3 key areas that we know are important for you to understand based on our conversations with many investors. 
Turning to Slide 4. I'm pleased with the progress of our Industrial segment in the third quarter, and we believe we remain on track to achieve our guidance for 2016 margins of 10% to 11%. The continuing actions we've taken and are taking to deliver improvement are taking hold. We continue to focus on operational excellence initiatives, restructuring and reducing costs, increased focus on parts and service, and here, we're already seeing growth in the service business, but we believe we can step on the gas even further in this area. Segmentation and focus on growing markets like food and beverage, pharma and electronics, and continuing multiyear product channel initiating investments to achieve strong leverage where the market's recovering. It's important to note, based on the actions we've taken and what we're seeing in the business, that we believe Q2 marked the trough in our operating margins for the business, and we're expecting improved performance going forward in 2017, although the results may not be a straight line up quarter-to-quarter. 
If you turn to Slide 5, the main takeaway here is that the Thermo King business is resilient. We saw this in the third quarter where revenues were down but margins moved higher. For 2016, we continue to see the business being consistent with the expectations we set out in July. The team deserves a lot of execution credit there for improving margins on declining revenue and for building a more resilient and valuable franchise over time.  Quarter 3 is a great example. The transport business grew margins on a 12% lower revenue base. We do expect about a 20% decline in trailers next year, but we believe we should be able to mitigate some of the downside by growing the business in other regions and in other TK products. 
Moving to Slide 6. Another topic on the minds of investors is how the Dodge data for nonresidential put in place translates to Ingersoll-Rand. Here, I think it's important to weigh out where our business comes from and what drives the market, but I think the market overestimates our exposure. As the chart shows, the North American commercial HVAC segment is about $4 billion and is split about 50-50 between services and equipment. Of the equipment, about 65% is replacement business, so not new put in place. The result is that our Dodge put in place data just covers about 18% of our business. Additionally, when you drill down further into the 18%, about 50% is commercial and 50% is institutional. Institutional is expected to show good growth in 2016 and even better growth in 2017. Our data set in North American commercial HVAC will be mid-single digits in 2016 and a similar number in 2017. So we continue to see a healthy market going into next year. 
And with that, I'll turn things over to Sue."
280944,403397444,1061873,"Ingersoll-Rand Plc, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Trane Technologies plc","Executives","Thank you, Mike. Let's go to Slide 7. I'd like to begin with a summary of main points for you to take away from today's call. As Mike discussed, we continue to execute the core tenets of our business operating system in Q3, building upon our strong 2016 p",2021,"Thank you, Mike. Let's go to Slide 7. I'd like to begin with a summary of main points for you to take away from today's call. As Mike discussed, we continue to execute the core tenets of our business operating system in Q3, building upon our strong 2016 performance across the 3 pillars of growth, profitability and cash flow. 
Adjusted earnings per share was up 17% on 3% organic revenue growth. Cash flow was 180% of net income for the quarter. 
Our performance was highlighted by record results in our North America commercial and residential HVAC businesses where we captured additional market share, while at the same time, expanding margins year-over-year. 
In our Industrial business, we drove 180 basis points of improved operating margin performance sequentially. We continue to take further actions on operational excellence initiatives, increased our commercial focus on aftermarket parts and service and added cost-reduction activities to improve operating results going forward. The margin improvement was 70 basis points after adjusting Q2 margins for capitalized new product engineering and development cost that we highlighted in last quarter's earnings materials. We believe we are largely maintaining our growing market share across the portfolio despite continued soft industrial end markets. 
During the quarter, we also extended our strong free cash flow performance by $644 million, bringing our year-to-date total to $992 million, up $527 million from the prior year. Given our long-term expectations for strong earnings and cash conversion, we also increased our dividend by 25% in October to $0.40 per share or $1.60 annualized, making our dividend highly competitive not only in our peer group, but across the broader market. Additionally, we now believe our free cash flow for 2016 will approximate $1.3 billion, up more than $200 million from our previous guidance of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. 
We've also increased our earnings per share guidance for the year given our year-to-date performance and outlook. Our revised guidance of between $4.17 and $4.22 is higher by $0.14 at the midpoint, reflecting the flow-through of our Q3 over-performance versus our Q3 guidance midpoint and an $0.88 to $0.93 fourth quarter. The fourth quarter of $0.90 to $0.91 at the midpoint is consistent with our prior guidance. 
On the next several slides, I will highlight the key messages for this earnings call. Please go to Slide 8. 
Our strong enterprise performance on organic growth, earnings per share growth and cash flow conversion was highlighted by our North America HVAC businesses and by sequential operating margin improvement in our Industrial segment versus the prior quarter. Organic revenue was up 3%, as adjusted margins improved 30 basis points year-on-year with 30% operating leverage. Our business operating system again guided us through good execution in our factories and in our call centers. Our focus was on good operating results in a-low-growth environment, and we delivered against that objective. 
Please go to Slide 9. 
Organic orders continue to be solid through the third quarter of 2016, led by our Climate business and partially offset by soft Industrial markets. Climate orders were up 4% organically. Organic global commercial HVAC bookings were up mid-single digit, led by low-teens growth in North America unitary. We also continued to drive excellent growth in service, controls and contracting, with low-teens growth in the quarter. Residential bookings were solid, up mid-single digits. 
Organic transport orders were down low single-digits, with order growth in Europe and Asia offset by declines in North America trailer and auxiliary power units. Consistent with our guidance, we continue to expect bookings to decline in North America trailer. 
On balance, the Industrial businesses were flat to down modestly, and we are calling a broad-based recovery in the near term. 
Please go to Slide 10. 
This slide provides a directional view of our segment revenue performance by region. In our Climate segment, we saw solid performance in both North America and Latin America and low-single-digit growth in the Middle East. In our Industrial segment, overall performance was essentially flat, with high single digit growth in Europe, Middle East and Africa due to the shipment of large orders in the Middle East, and mid-single digit growth in Asia, offset by declines in North America and Latin America. 
Please go to Slide 11. 
Climate performance was strong in the quarter, with organic revenues up 3% and adjusted operating margins up 90 basis points. Commercial HVAC organic revenues were up mid-single digits, highlighted by exceptional growth in North America contracting up 17% and unitary equipment in North America up low-teens. In Europe, business was unusually light, impacted by the slowdown in activity during the summer holiday season, driving mid-single-digit equipment declines. Europe services contracting and parts were flat. Residential continued their outstanding year, with revenues up low-teens. 
Transport organic revenues were down low-teens in the quarter, driven by weakening North America trailer and soft APU and marine markets. Despite lower revenues, margins expanded 110 basis points with increases in both North America and Europe, Middle East and Africa. This demonstrates the more resilient franchise we discussed. Growth in aftermarket parts and services, trucks and in Europe trailers drove higher margins and helped mitigate the impact of the downturn. 
Please go to Slide 12. 
Climate reported operating margins expanded 110 basis points year-over-year. Volume and mix were favorable across commercial and residential HVAC, partially offset by volume in transport. Price and direct material deflation and productivity also contributed to margin improvement. Additionally, we continued to invest in the business to drive innovation and growth. 
Please go to Slide 13. 
Third quarter Industrial margins improved 180 basis points from second quarter trough margins on 1% organic revenue growth. Margin improvement was still solid at 70 basis points when accounting for Q2 2016 capitalized costs related to new product engineering and development of $8 million that we discussed last quarter. Excluding those costs, Q2 margin was 10.9%.  
Industrial end markets remained soft in Q3 and are expected to be soft through 2016. 
Revenues were up mid-single digits in compressors with growth in aftermarket, oil free and large machines with easier comparisons to the prior year. Other industrial products were down low-teens, with material handling showing the largest decline due to oil and gas exposure. Small electric vehicles were down slightly in the quarter. 
Please go to Slide 14. Industrial's reported operating margin of 10.9% was down 300 basis points versus prior year. Volume and mix were the largest drivers of this decline. Pricing offset materials, but given the continued low volumes running through our factories, productivity did not offset inflation in the quarter. We continued planned investments in our products and channel and restructuring to improve our cost base. Looking forward, we expect margins to improve in 2017 given ongoing margin improvement actions, although we do expect some variability due to cyclicality. 
Please go to Slide 15. 
September year-to-date free cash flow of $992 million was favorable to prior year by $527 million. Strong operating income improvement and working capital performance were the primary drivers of the favorability. For the quarter, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 4.9%. Our 2016 goal is approximately 4%.  Based on strong performance year-to-date and our confidence in future cash conversion, we have raised our 2016 free cash flow forecast to approximately $1.3 billion. This is up more than $200 million from our prior range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. 
We have a proud history of returning cash to shareholders. Since 2011, our free cash flow as a percentage of net income has averaged 100%. Over that same timeframe, we've returned more than $6.5 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends of $1.5 billion and share buybacks of $5.1 billion. 
You may have noted that we referenced cash flow ROIC a few times today. Our definition is free cash flow divided by gross fixed assets plus working capital. Our goal is period-over-period improvement in this metric, and we are doing well in 2016 with improved free cash flow and balanced capital expenditures and working capital. 
Please go to Slide 16. Our strong cash performance in the third quarter and our expectations moving forward enable us to, one, continue to invest in strategic growth programs, as Mike outlined earlier. In addition to the core strategic investments, we're also investing in long-term growth through innovative and differentiated products in areas such as controls for buildings as a resource, intelligent monitoring and self-healing systems, just to name a few.  Two, we've paid an annual dividend for 106 years and have consistently raised the dividend over time. Over the past 5 years, we've raised our annual dividend at a 20% compound annual growth rate. In October, we announced a dividend increase of 25% to $0.40 per quarter or to $1.60 per share annually. Three, we will continue to purchase sweeping shares sufficient to offset dilution, roughly $250 million per year. Four, we continue to see an increasing number of positive, potential acquisition targets. And five, we strive to maintain a strong balance sheet with BBB metrics to provide optionality as our markets continue to evolve. We will continue to create long-term value for our shareholders through capital allocation, as we have consistently done for years. 
Please go to Slide 17. Our intention is to give you our best view of what we're seeing in our end markets sitting here today and how that translates to our revenue guidance for the remainder of 2016. We've broken it down by major end markets and geographies. As you can see by the variation of colors and symbols, our end markets are seeing a wide variation in trends. Markets for North America commercial and residential HVAC, as well as European transport and commercial HVAC are generally positive, while global Industrial markets remain soft. We are forecasting global trends for markets to be down low single digits. Our forecast for North America trailer volumes has not changed and we expect the market to be down slightly for the year. This implies a decline in the second half after a single digit growth in the first half of the year. Asian HVAC markets are expected to be flat to down, and Industrial markets in Asia remain under pressure. Golf car markets are slightly down, offset by increases in the utility vehicle markets. 
All of our revenue growth forecasts are shown on an organic basis. We are forecasting mid single digit growth in commercial HVAC in total, high single digit growth in residential HVAC, which is essentially an all North America business for us, and a small decline in transport globally. 
Please go to Slide 18. 
Aggregating those market backdrops, we expect organic revenues for the full year 2016 to be up approximately 2% versus 2015, with foreign exchange presenting a headwind of about 1 percentage point. We expect organic revenues to be up approximately 4% for Climate and down 3% for Industrial. Adjusted operating margins, which exclude restructuring costs, are expected to be at the high end of our previous ranges for the enterprise at 12% and for Climate at 14.5%. Adjusted Industrial margins are expected to be at the midpoint of our previous range of 10% to 11%. 
Please go to Slide 19. 
Transitioning to earnings, the reported earnings per share range is estimated to be $5.62 to $5.67, and the adjusted range is $4.17 to $4.22, up $0.14 to $0.15. At the midpoint, this represents a 12% increase in earnings per share over 2015. Adjusted numbers exclude restructuring and the Hussmann gain. We have raised our full year guidance for free cash flow more than $200 million to approximately $1.3 billion from $1 billion to $1.1 billion, reflecting continued strong cash flows through 2016. For the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect Climate revenues to be up 2% to 4% organically, while Industrial revenues are expected to be down 6% to 8%. Adjusted fourth quarter earnings per share is forecast to be between $0.88 and $0.93, excluding restructuring charges of about $0.02. The midpoint is consistent with or slightly higher than our previous guidance midpoint of $0.90 per share. 
With that, I will turn it back to Mike for a few closing comments."

As we conclude, I want to emphasize a few points that I think are important for you to have as takeaways as we head into the final quarter and into 2017. 
First, we're performing well, with a solid strategy punctuated with excellent execution over time. As a result, we have delivered consistent, reliable top-tier financial performance on organic growth, EPS growth and cash flow over Industrial and Climate cycles. 
Second, our management team is effective in anticipating and seeing around the corners. Our commercial HVAC business is strong and focused on the right growth areas with equipment, controls and service. We believe we have turned the corner with our Industrial segment and starting to realize margin improvement versus the quarter 2 trough. 
And our transport refrigeration business is resilient. And our team is capturing margin expansion despite downward sales. 
Finally, we're building a stronger, more valuable, more sustainable and less cyclical Ingersoll-Rand. The results we reported today are a direct result of the strategic work, persistence and tenacity of the talented people that represent the unique culture we've built. I'm proud of our people who continue to deliver for our customers and our shareholders. 
Our momentum is strong as we conclude the year and head into 2017.  And with that, Sue and I will now be happy to take your questions."

Let me start out with the Industrial comment in the fourth quarter. So you're correct that the operating income is about flat.

So in essence, you're going to have a volume challenge. You're also going to have some investments there occurring in some of the business. For instance, we're doing some investment in the Club Car business, as well as in new products for the CTS business. So it's really a story about volume and investments, and a little bit less on the Industrial side with commodities, but also some impact there."

So again, I think where we're at, at $992 million at the end of the third quarter is fabulous. We brought it forward, and we brought it forward by paying attention to things like terms on accounts receivable, making sure that accounts receivable is balanced with accounts payable terms across the globe; with working through inventories and making sure inventories were there to serve the customer, but not too much to have additional product on hand. So we've really managed this very, very carefully. And so what you'll see in the fourth quarter is really that instead of doing heroics to end the quarter, we've normalized it, which is really how we want to operate the business and how we want our cash flow to come in."

We see strength in the residential business going into next year. We'll see improving margins coming out of the Industrial business. So we're going to get some good play on that. We're going to remain focused in terms of the price cost spread. We know we'll have a few headwinds on the sale side, but we'll still have a bit of deflation that occurs on the basis of copper that we already have locked in and some of the aluminum that we have locked in for 2017. We're also going to hit productivity really, really hard in the business. That's part of our hallmark of our operational excellence. And we're going to offset inflation. We're going to continue to press on corporate. So earnings per share growth next year, I think, is going to come from all of the different parts of the business, as well as tax. Now tax is something that we're really proud of. And we're really proud of because it's -- we started to talk about a low 20s tax rate earlier in the year. We got there faster than we expected. But we got there by really doing what we call operationalizing tax, which is basically we assign tax partners to each of our SBUs. They're working projects within the SBUs to actually work down the effective tax rate, things like trading hubs, things like energy credit, things like really legal entity simplification. So we've really operationalized that. I think it's kind of cutting edge. I still don't think our tax rate is going to go below the low 20s. I think that's where it should be. So yes, we'll get some tailwind out of that going into 2017, because I think the low 20s is where we project the rate. But I think it's operational also and something that I think is really good for Ingersoll-Rand."

But what we see happening, and again, the third quarter came out better than we had hoped at 60 basis points, which was really about 50-50 material deflation and the other price. As we start to look at 2017, I think what 2017 does is it reverts to what we've said all along, which is that we would have a 20 to 30 basis points spread between price and cost. And as you start to look at commodities for 2017, so steel has moved around a little bit. We saw an increase earlier in the summer to over $800 a ton. We currently see spot prices back in the $700 range. So we have about a 6-month time lag between when those prices move around and when we see it translated. That means I'm going to see some steel inflation in the fourth quarter, as well as probably the first quarter of 2017. However, I still continue to see tailwinds coming out of copper and aluminum going into 2017, helping us to offset that balance. So we have line of sight to what we think the commodities are going to do, and therefore, we have line of sight what our costs are so that we can price per our operating model with top line margin expansion and get back to the 20 to 30 basis points for the year."

So it really does come down to what do you do with the other pieces of this thing? And if you think about it over the long run, roughly half of the cash, you want to do an acquisition or share buyback. We certainly like to grow the company, but we're not going to do that in the expense of making a poor capital allocation decision. So what you see right now is a large number of channel and potential product extension investments that might fit the portfolio. If we could close, that would be worth the -- the juice is worth the squeeze on those, so that's really why you're seeing us hold back here.

I'm going to begin by discussing our strategy and how as a foundation, our business operating system drives top tier financial performance for shareholders. Sue will provide more details about the quarter financials and guidance, then I'll close with a few comments before we answer your questions. 
As a matter of strategy, more than 90% of our product portfolio directly addresses demands for greater productivity and energy efficiency, with lower greenhouse gas emissions in buildings, homes, industrial and transport markets around the world. The strength and resiliency of our portfolio comes from our leadership in growing markets that are durable because these markets are central to addressing the global strategic imperative to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to conserve resources. 
Our business operating system is a systematic way our people work within the company to deliver against our strategy globally. It is a holistic approach that establishes strong baseline execution expectations and builds on those expectations through continuous development of people and improvement of processes and standards. Respecting and engaging our people in the development and maturation of our business operating system makes it sustainable and is a core element of what it takes to win over the long term. Rigorous execution of our business operating system has enabled us to deliver consistent top-tier financial performance across key metrics, including organic growth, incremental margins, EPS growth and cash flow conversion over many years. 
The third quarter demonstrated our consistent progress against these key metrics. We delivered strong organic growth of 3% across our diversified portfolio. We had record operating margins of 14.1% and drove leverage through the P&L, resulting in adjusted EPS growth of 17%. Year-to-date, free cash flow is more than 100% of adjusted net income, demonstrating our ability to convert earnings into real cash, a fundamental driver of valuation. 
Record margins in the quarter were primarily driven by continued strength in our Climate business, where adjusted operating margins expanded 90 basis points to 16.7%, with particular strength in our commercial and residential HVAC businesses. 
We are also pleased to report that our Industrial business turned in a positive direction in quarter 3, moving adjusted operating margins higher by 180 basis points sequentially to 11.6%. Adjusting for the capitalized cost that we discussed last quarter of 1.1 percentage points, the business improved 70 basis points sequentially from 10.9% to 11.6%. The actions we've been taking to improve the business are taking hold, and we believe we saw margins bottom in the second quarter. 
Improved profitability was driven by Operational Excellence and our continued focus on delivering innovation centered on energy efficiencies, sustainability, system reliability, as well as disruptive, game-changing technological advancements in areas like controls and digital connectivity. 
In quarter 3, our overall growth was led by our commercial and residential HVAC businesses in North America, where we continue to see strong double-digit growth and market share gains. Our performance in 2016 is a direct result of the continuous long-term investment program, prioritized around a clear set of opportunities and managed from inception to launch by focused and committed product growth teams. And that result is that our product growth team's average to growth rate about 4x higher than our overall average growth rate in quarter 3. Continuously delivering innovation through our product growth teams is one way we produce strong financial results and stay ahead competitively. 
But the key driver is our commitment to being the leader in energy-efficient and sustainable products. About 10 days ago, the 28th meeting of the parties to the Montreal Protocol was held. At that meeting, about 200 countries agreed to an amendment that phases out hydrofluorocarbons beginning in 2019 and aims for an 80% reduction in their use by 2045. For several years now, we have been planning for the phaseout of hydrofluorocarbons, and over that time, we have been a leader in developing several commercialized next-generation low global warming potential products that meet and exceed the transition requirements to help customers achieve their sustainability goals. 
Two years ago, we made a public climate commitment to a 50% reduction of refrigerant greenhouse gases in the footprint of our products by 2020 and to transition out of current refrigerants before 2030. We did this to help customers plan from transition period based upon their business needs and system requirements. We are on track to complete; our commitment goals, and to date, have avoided approximately 2 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent globally. 
Another example is our EcoWise product portfolio. Typically, when an ecofriendly refrigerant is used in a system, it reduces efficiency and can sometimes compromise safety. For example, the gas might be flammable or more toxic. With the introduction of our EcoWise product portfolio, we've not only developed a low global warming potential refrigerant product, we've also designed it so the product or system is more energy-efficient. The prime example of this is our new line of centrifugal chillers that have near 0 global warming potential, do not concede safety and deliver 13.5% better efficiency than chillers using hydrofluorocarbons. So now, our customers' not choosing between being green or being efficient. Through EcoWise, they're able to do both. 
Growth with these products has been excellent. In Europe, for example, the EcoWise portfolio growth has nearly doubled over the last year, and we see a healthy pipeline of high-profile jobs coming in like the Chunnel Tunnel between France and the U.K. After considering -- retrofitted our equipment, our expert technical team worked with Chunnel operators to install units from our EcoWise portfolio this year. With near 0 global warming potential, the units will allow us savings of around 40% of electrical energy use in the Chunnel's cooling system. And to give you some perspective, the energy savings for this project is about as much energy as the island of Aruba generates annually. That's a savings of 53% compared to the customer's former units that we replaced from one of our competitors. 
Vertical integration is another way that we drive growth and leverage technical know-how across our Climate and Industrial segments. Our vertical integration in compressor technology is one area of real competitive advantage because we engineer and manufacture our screw centrifugal and the majority of our scroll compressors, we own the intellectual property and accelerated our time-to-market with these products. Through our energy efficiency strategy, the next-generation R-Series air compressor that we introduced in quarter 3 incorporates the latest advancements in variable speed drive technology to increase airflow output up to 15%, reduce energy cost up to 35% with an increase in system reliability. Customers are finding the product offering compelling, and we are outpacing the market growth rate as a result. 
These are just a few examples of how we're making investments in long-term innovation, energy efficiency and productivity to stay ahead of the competition and in front of an increasing regulatory environment. We are also tying in services, controls and wireless to our products so they are leading-edge as technology continues to move quickly. We continue to see double-digit increases in our commercial HVAC controls business and high single-digit growth in services.  In compression technologies, we also realized mid-single-digit growth in our aftermarket business. 
Our multiyear trend in aftermarket growth is consistent with our strategy to drive service penetration across our segments and create a more resilient portfolio. 
Turning to cash and capital allocation. Q3 was another quarter of steady and strong cash flow. Year-to-date, free cash flow is nearly $1 billion. Over the past 5 years, our cash flow ROIC has averaged 18% per annum. Our top priority is to increase shareholder returns through high ROIC investments in our business that build a platform for consistent cash generation and investment in growth and innovation. Our long-standing commitment to organic long-term strategic investments is what has enabled us to perform well in both up and down climate or industrial cycles over the years. As an example, in 2016, we've been investing heavily in channel investments that will improve growth by penetrating key markets over the next several years. 
In addition to fully investing in the business, we spent $250 million in 2016 on share buybacks. We've raised our dividend twice: 10% in February, an  additional 25% in October; and we continue to have an increasing pipeline of interesting M&A opportunities. Our consistency in performance and our result in strong cash flow and healthy balance sheet puts us in an excellent position to maintain significant optionality to move quickly across any or all capital allocation fronts as opportunities arise in this uncertain and often volatile global economy. 
Before I hand things over to Sue, I want to hit on 3 key areas that we know are important for you to understand based on our conversations with many investors. 
Turning to Slide 4. I'm pleased with the progress of our Industrial segment in the third quarter, and we believe we remain on track to achieve our guidance for 2016 margins of 10% to 11%. The continuing actions we've taken and are taking to deliver improvement are taking hold. We continue to focus on operational excellence initiatives, restructuring and reducing costs, increased focus on parts and service, and here, we're already seeing growth in the service business, but we believe we can step on the gas even further in this area. Segmentation and focus on growing markets like food and beverage, pharma and electronics, and continuing multiyear product channel initiating investments to achieve strong leverage where the market's recovering. It's important to note, based on the actions we've taken and what we're seeing in the business, that we believe Q2 marked the trough in our operating margins for the business, and we're expecting improved performance going forward in 2017, although the results may not be a straight line up quarter-to-quarter. 
If you turn to Slide 5, the main takeaway here is that the Thermo King business is resilient. We saw this in the third quarter where revenues were down but margins moved higher. For 2016, we continue to see the business being consistent with the expectations we set out in July. The team deserves a lot of execution credit there for improving margins on declining revenue and for building a more resilient and valuable franchise over time.  Quarter 3 is a great example. The transport business grew margins on a 12% lower revenue base. We do expect about a 20% decline in trailers next year, but we believe we should be able to mitigate some of the downside by growing the business in other regions and in other TK products. 
Moving to Slide 6. Another topic on the minds of investors is how the Dodge data for nonresidential put in place translates to Ingersoll-Rand. Here, I think it's important to weigh out where our business comes from and what drives the market, but I think the market overestimates our exposure. As the chart shows, the North American commercial HVAC segment is about $4 billion and is split about 50-50 between services and equipment. Of the equipment, about 65% is replacement business, so not new put in place. The result is that our Dodge put in place data just covers about 18% of our business. Additionally, when you drill down further into the 18%, about 50% is commercial and 50% is institutional. Institutional is expected to show good growth in 2016 and even better growth in 2017. Our data set is North American commercial HVAC will be mid-single digits in 2016 and a similar number in 2017. So we continue to see a healthy market going into next year. 
And with that, I'll turn things over to Sue."

I'd like to begin with a summary of main points for you to take away from today's call. As Mike discussed, we continue to execute the core tenets of our business operating system in Q3, building upon our strong 2016 performance across the 3 pillars of growth, profitability and cash flow. 
Adjusted earnings per share was up 17% on 3% organic revenue growth. Cash flow was 180% of net income for the quarter. 
Our performance was highlighted by record results in our North America commercial and residential HVAC businesses where we captured additional market share, while at the same time, expanding margins year-over-year. 
In our Industrial business, we drove 180 basis points of improved operating margin performance sequentially. We continue to take further actions on operational excellence initiatives, increased our commercial focus on aftermarket parts and service and added cost-reduction activities to improve operating results going forward. The margin improvement was 70 basis points after adjusting Q2 margins for capitalized new product engineering and development cost that we highlighted in last quarter's earnings materials. We believe we are largely maintaining our growing market share across the portfolio despite continued soft industrial end markets. 
During the quarter, we also extended our strong free cash flow performance by $644 million, bringing our year-to-date total to $992 million, up $527 million from the prior year. Given our long-term expectations for strong earnings and cash conversion, we also increased our dividend by 25% in October to $0.40 per share or $1.60 annualized, making our dividend highly competitive not only in our peer group, but across the broader market. Additionally, we now believe our free cash flow for 2016 will approximate $1.3 billion, up more than $200 million from our previous guidance of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. 
We've also increased our earnings per share guidance for the year given our year-to-date performance and outlook. Our revised guidance of between $4.17 and $4.22 is higher by $0.14 at the midpoint, reflecting the flow-through of our Q3 over-performance versus our Q3 guidance midpoint and an $0.88 to $0.93 fourth quarter. The fourth quarter of $0.90 to $0.91 at the midpoint is consistent with our prior guidance. 
On the next several slides, I will highlight the key messages for this earnings call. Please go to Slide 8. 
Our strong enterprise performance on organic growth, earnings per share growth and cash flow conversion was highlighted by our North America HVAC businesses and by sequential operating margin improvement in our Industrial segment versus the prior quarter. Organic revenue was up 3%, as adjusted margins improved 30 basis points year-on-year with 30% operating leverage. Our business operating system again guided us through good execution in our factories and in our call centers. Our focus was on good operating results in a-low-growth environment, and we delivered against that objective. 
Please go to Slide 9. 
Organic orders continue to be solid through the third quarter of 2016, led by our Climate business and partially offset by soft Industrial markets. Climate orders were up 4% organically. Organic global commercial HVAC bookings were up mid-single digit, led by low-teens growth in North America unitary. We also continued to drive excellent growth in service, controls and contracting, with low-teens growth in the quarter. Residential bookings were solid, up mid-single digits. 
Organic transport orders were down low single-digits, with order growth in Europe and Asia offset by declines in North America trailer and auxiliary power units. Consistent with our guidance, we continue to expect bookings to decline in North America trailer. 
On balance, the Industrial businesses were flat to down modestly, and we are calling a broad-based recovery in the near term. 
Please go to Slide 10. 
This slide provides a directional view of our segment revenue performance by region. In our Climate segment, we saw solid performance in both North America and Latin America and low-single-digit growth in the Middle East. In our Industrial segment, overall performance was essentially flat, with high single digit growth in Europe, Middle East and Africa due to the shipment of large orders in the Middle East, and mid-single digit growth in Asia, offset by declines in North America and Latin America. 
Please go to Slide 11. 
Climate performance was strong in the quarter, with organic revenues up 3% and adjusted operating margins up 90 basis points. Commercial HVAC organic revenues were up mid-single digits, highlighted by exceptional growth in North America contracting up 17% and unitary equipment in North America up low-teens. In Europe, business was unusually light, impacted by the slowdown in activity during the summer holiday season, driving mid-single-digit equipment declines. Europe services contracting and parts were flat. Residential continued their outstanding year, with revenues up low-teens. 
Transport organic revenues were down low-teens in the quarter, driven by weakening North America trailer and soft APU and marine markets. Despite lower revenues, margins expanded 110 basis points with increases in both North America and Europe, Middle East and Africa. This demonstrates the more resilient franchise we discussed. Growth in aftermarket parts and services, trucks and in Europe trailers drove higher margins and helped mitigate the impact of the downturn. 
Please go to Slide 12. 
Climate reported operating margins expanded 110 basis points year-over-year. Volume and mix were favorable across commercial and residential HVAC, partially offset by volume in transport. Price and direct material deflation and productivity also contributed to margin improvement. Additionally, we continued to invest in the business to drive innovation and growth. 
Please go to Slide 13. 
Third quarter Industrial margins improved 180 basis points from second quarter trough margins on 1% organic revenue growth. Margin improvement was still solid at 70 basis points when accounting for Q2 2016 capitalized costs related to new product engineering and development of $8 million that we discussed last quarter. Excluding those costs, Q2 margin was 10.9%.  
Industrial end markets remained soft in Q3 and are expected to be soft through 2016. 
Revenues were up mid-single digits in compressors with growth in aftermarket, oil free and large machines with easier comparisons to the prior year. Other industrial products were down low-teens, with material handling showing the largest decline due to oil and gas exposure. Small electric vehicles were down slightly in the quarter. 
Please go to Slide 14. Industrial's reported operating margin of 10.9% was down 300 basis points versus prior year. Volume and mix were the largest drivers of this decline. Pricing offset materials, but given the continued low volumes running through our factories, productivity did not offset inflation in the quarter. We continued planned investments in our products and channel and restructuring to improve our cost base. Looking forward, we expect margins to improve in 2017 given ongoing margin improvement actions, although we do expect some variability due to cyclicality. 
Please go to Slide 15. 
September year-to-date free cash flow of $992 million was favorable to prior year by $527 million. Strong operating income improvement and working capital performance were the primary drivers of the favorability. For the quarter, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 4.9%. Our 2016 goal is approximately 4%.  Based on strong performance year-to-date and our confidence in future cash conversion, we have raised our 2016 free cash flow forecast to approximately $1.3 billion. This is up more than $200 million from our prior range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. 
We have a proud history of returning cash to shareholders. Since 2011, our free cash flow as a percentage of net income has averaged 100%. Over that same timeframe, we've returned more than $6.5 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends of $1.5 billion and share buybacks of $5.1 billion. 
You may have noted that we referenced cash flow ROIC a few times today. Our definition is free cash flow divided by gross fixed assets plus working capital. Our goal is period-over-period improvement in this metric, and we are doing well in 2016 with improved free cash flow and balanced capital expenditures and working capital. 
Please go to Slide 16. Our strong cash performance in the third quarter and our expectations moving forward enable us to, one, continue to invest in strategic growth programs, as Mike outlined earlier. In addition to the core strategic investments, we're also investing in long-term growth through innovative and differentiated products in areas such as controls for buildings as a resource, intelligent monitoring and self-healing systems, just to name a few.  Two, we've paid an annual dividend for 106 years and have consistently raised the dividend over time. Over the past 5 years, we've raised our annual dividend at a 20% compound annual growth rate. In October, we announced a dividend increase of 25% to $0.40 per quarter or to $1.60 per share annually. Three, we will continue to purchase sweeping shares sufficient to offset dilution, roughly $250 million per year. Four, we continue to see an increasing number of positive, potential acquisition targets. And five, we strive to maintain a strong balance sheet with BBB metrics to provide optionality as our markets continue to evolve. We will continue to create long-term value for our shareholders through capital allocation, as we have consistently done for years. 
Please go to Slide 17. Our intention is to give you our best view of what we're seeing in our end markets sitting here today and how that translates to our revenue guidance for the remainder of 2016. We've broken it down by major end markets and geographies. As you can see by the variation of colors and symbols, our end markets are seeing a wide variation in trends. Markets for North America commercial and residential HVAC, as well as European transport and commercial HVAC are generally positive, while global Industrial markets remain soft. We are forecasting global transport markets to be down low single digits. Our forecast for North America trailer volumes has not changed and we expect the market to be down slightly for the year. This implies a decline in the second half after a single digit growth in the first half of the year. Asian HVAC markets are expected to be flat to down, and Industrial markets in Asia remain under pressure. Golf car markets are slightly down, offset by increases in the utility vehicle markets. 
All of our revenue growth forecasts are shown on an organic basis. We are forecasting mid single digit growth in commercial HVAC in total, high single digit growth in residential HVAC, which is essentially an all North America business for us, and a small decline in transport globally. 
Please go to Slide 18. 
Aggregating those market backdrops, we expect organic revenues for the full year 2016 to be up approximately 2% versus 2015, with foreign exchange presenting a headwind of about 1 percentage point. We expect organic revenues to be up approximately 4% for Climate and down 3% for Industrial. Adjusted operating margins, which exclude restructuring costs, are expected to be at the high end of our previous ranges for the enterprise at 12% and for Climate at 14.5%. Adjusted Industrial margins are expected to be at the midpoint of our previous range of 10% to 11%. 
Please go to Slide 19. 
Transitioning to earnings, the reported earnings per share range is estimated to be $5.62 to $5.67, and the adjusted range is $4.17 to $4.22, up $0.14 to $0.15. At the midpoint, this represents a 12% increase in earnings per share over 2015. Adjusted numbers exclude restructuring and the Hussmann gain. We have raised our full year guidance for free cash flow more than $200 million to approximately $1.3 billion from $1 billion to $1.1 billion, reflecting continued strong cash flows through 2016. For the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect Climate revenues to be up 2% to 4% organically, while Industrial revenues are expected to be down 6% to 8%. Adjusted fourth quarter earnings per share is forecast to be between $0.88 and $0.93, excluding restructuring charges of about $0.02. The midpoint is consistent with or slightly higher than our previous guidance midpoint of $0.90 per share. 
With that, I will turn it back to Mike for a few closing comments."

As we conclude, I want to emphasize a few points that I think are important for you to have as takeaways as we head into the final quarter and into 2017. 
First, we're performing well, with a solid strategy punctuated with excellent execution over time. As a result, we have delivered consistent, reliable top-tier financial performance on organic growth, EPS growth and cash flow over Industrial and Climate cycles. 
Second, our management team is effective in anticipating and seeing around the corners. Our commercial HVAC business is strong and focused on the right growth areas with equipment, controls and service. We believe we have turned the corner with our Industrial segment and starting to realize margin improvement versus the quarter 2 trough. 
And our transport refrigeration business is resilient. And our team is capturing margin expansion despite downward sales. 
Finally, we're building a stronger, more valuable, more sustainable and less cyclical Ingersoll-Rand. The results we reported today are a direct result of the strategic work, persistence and tenacity of the talented people that represent the unique culture we've built. I'm proud of our people who continue to deliver for our customers and our shareholders. 
Our momentum is strong as we conclude the year and head into 2017.  And with that, Sue and I will now be happy to take your questions."

So in essence, you're going to have a volume challenge. You're also going to have some investments there occurring in some of the business. For instance, we're doing some investment in the Club Car business, as well as in new products for the CTS business. So it's really a story about volume and investments, and a little bit less on the Industrial side with commodities, but also some impact there."

So again, I think where we're at, at $992 million at the end of the third quarter is fabulous. We brought it forward, and we brought it forward by paying attention to things like terms on accounts receivable, making sure that accounts receivable is balanced with accounts payable terms across the globe; with working through inventories and making sure inventories were there to serve the customer, but not too much to have additional product on hand. So we've really managed this very, very carefully. And so what you'll see in the fourth quarter is really that instead of doing heroics to end the quarter, we've normalized it, which is really how we want to operate the business and how we want our cash flow to come in."

We're going to remain focused in terms of the price cost spread. We know we'll have a few headwinds on the sale side, but we'll still have a bit of deflation that occurs on the basis of copper that we already have locked in and some of the aluminum that we have locked in for 2017. We're also going to hit productivity really, really hard in the business. That's part of our hallmark of our operational excellence. And we're going to offset inflation. We're going to continue to press on corporate. So earnings per share growth next year, I think, is going to come from all of the different parts of the business, as well as tax. Now tax is something that we're really proud of. And we're really proud of because it's -- we started to talk about a low 20s tax rate earlier in the year. We got there faster than we expected. But we got there by really doing what we call operationalizing tax, which is basically we assign tax partners to each of our SBUs. They're working projects within the SBUs to actually work down the effective tax rate, things like trading hubs, things like energy credit, things like really legal entity simplification. So we've really operationalized that. I think it's kind of cutting edge. I still don't think our tax rate is going to go below the low 20s. I think that's where it should be. So yes, we'll get some tailwind out of that going into 2017, because I think the low 20s is where we project the rate. But I think it's operational also and something that I think is really good for Ingersoll-Rand."

As we start to look at 2017, I think what 2017 does is it reverts to what we've said all along, which is that we would have a 20 to 30 basis points spread between price and cost. And as you start to look at commodities for 2017, so steel has moved around a little bit. We saw an increase earlier in the summer to over $800 a ton. We currently see spot prices back in the $700 range. So we have about a 6-month time lag between when those prices move around and when we see it translated. That means I'm going to see some steel inflation in the fourth quarter, as well as probably the first quarter of 2017. However, I still continue to see tailwinds coming out of copper and aluminum going into 2017, helping us to offset that balance. So we have line of sight to what we think the commodities are going to do, and therefore, we have line of sight what our costs are so that we can price per our operating model with top line margin expansion and get back to the 20 to 30 basis points for the year."

I'm going to begin by discussing our strategy and how as a foundation, our business operating system drives top tier financial performance for shareholders. Sue will provide more details about the quarter financials and guidance, then I'll close with a few comments before we answer your questions. 
As a matter of strategy, more than 90% of our product portfolio directly addresses demands for greater productivity and energy efficiency, with lower greenhouse gas emissions in buildings, homes, industrial and transport markets around the world. The strength and resiliency of our portfolio comes from our leadership in growing markets that are durable because these markets are central to addressing the global strategic imperative to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to conserve resources. 
Our business operating system is a systematic way our people work within the company to deliver against our strategy globally. It is a holistic approach that establishes strong baseline execution expectations and builds on those expectations through continuous development of people and improvement of processes and standards. Respecting and engaging our people in the development and maturation of our business operating system makes it sustainable and is a core element of what it takes to win over the long term. Rigorous execution of our business operating system has enabled us to deliver consistent top-tier financial performance across key metrics, including organic growth, incremental margins, EPS growth and cash flow conversion over many years. 
The third quarter demonstrated our consistent progress against these key metrics. We delivered strong organic growth of 3% across our diversified portfolio. We had record operating margins of 14.1% and drove leverage through the P&L, resulting in adjusted EPS growth of 17%. Year-to-date, free cash flow is more than 100% of adjusted net income, demonstrating our ability to convert earnings into real cash, a fundamental driver of valuation. 
Record margins in the quarter were primarily driven by continued strength in our Climate business, where adjusted operating margins expanded 90 basis points to 16.7%, with particular strength in our commercial and residential HVAC businesses. 
We are also pleased to report that our Industrial business turned in a positive direction in quarter 3, moving adjusted operating margins higher by 180 basis points sequentially to 11.6%. Adjusting for the capitalized cost that we discussed last quarter of 1.1 percentage points, the business improved 70 basis points sequentially from 10.9% to 11.6%. The actions we've been taking to improve the business are taking hold, and we believe we saw margins bottom in the second quarter. 
Improved profitability was driven by Operational Excellence and our continued focus on delivering innovation centered on energy efficiencies, sustainability, system reliability, as well as disruptive, game-changing technological advancements in areas like controls and digital connectivity. 
In quarter 3, our overall growth was led by our commercial and residential HVAC businesses in North America, where we continue to see strong double-digit growth and market share gains. Our performance in 2016 is a direct result of the continuous long-term investment program, prioritized around a clear set of opportunities and managed from inception to launch by focused and committed product growth teams. And that result is that our product growth team's average to growth rate about 4x higher than our overall average growth rate in quarter 3. Continuously delivering innovation through our product growth teams is one way we produce strong financial results and stay ahead competitively. 
But the key driver is our commitment to being the leader in energy-efficient and sustainable products. About 10 days ago, the 28th meeting of the parties to the Montreal Protocol was held. At that meeting, about 200 countries agreed to an amendment that phases out hydrofluorocarbons beginning in 2019 and aims for an 80% reduction in their use by 2045. For several years now, we have been planning for the phaseout of hydrofluorocarbons, and over that time, we have been a leader in developing several commercialized next-generation low global warming potential products that meet and exceed the transition requirements to help customers achieve their sustainability goals. 
Two years ago, we made a public climate commitment to a 50% reduction of refrigerant greenhouse gases in the footprint of our products by 2020 and to transition out of current refrigerants before 2030. We did this to help customers plan from transition period based upon their business needs and system requirements. We are on track to complete; our commitment goals, and to date, have avoided approximately 2 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent globally. 
Another example is our EcoWise product portfolio. Typically, when an ecofriendly refrigerant is used in a system, it reduces efficiency and can sometimes compromise safety. For example, the gas might be flammable or more toxic. With the introduction of our EcoWise product portfolio, we've not only developed a low global warming potential refrigerant product, we've also designed it so the product or system is more energy-efficient. The prime example of this is our new line of centrifugal chillers that have near 0 global warming potential, do not concede safety and deliver 13.5% better efficiency than chillers using hydrofluorocarbons. So now, our customers' not choosing between being green or being efficient. Through EcoWise, they're able to do both. 
Growth with these products has been excellent. In Europe, for example, the EcoWise portfolio growth has nearly doubled over the last year, and we see a healthy pipeline of high-profile jobs coming in like the Chunnel Tunnel between France and the U.K. After considering -- retrofitted our equipment, our expert technical team worked with Chunnel operators to install units from our EcoWise portfolio this year. With near 0 global warming potential, the units will allow us savings of around 40% of electrical energy use in the Chunnel's cooling system. And to give you some perspective, the energy savings for this project is about as much energy as the island of Aruba generates annually. That's a savings of 53% compared to the customer's former units that we replaced from one of our competitors. 
Vertical integration is another way that we drive growth and leverage technical know-how across our Climate and Industrial segments. Our vertical integration in compressor technology is one area of real competitive advantage because we engineer and manufacture our screw centrifugal and the majority of our scroll compressors, we own the intellectual property and accelerated our time-to-market with these products. Through our energy efficiency strategy, the next-generation R-Series air compressor that we introduced in quarter 3 incorporates the latest advancements in variable speed drive technology to increase airflow output up to 15%, reduce energy cost up to 35% with an increase in system reliability. Customers are finding the product offering compelling, and we are outpacing the market growth rate as a result. 
These are just a few examples of how we're making investments in long-term innovation, energy efficiency and productivity to stay ahead of the competition and in front of an increasing regulatory environment. We are also tying in services, controls and wireless to our products so they are leading-edge as technology continues to move quickly. We continue to see double-digit increases in our commercial HVAC controls business and high single-digit growth in services.  In compression technologies, we also realized mid-single-digit growth in our aftermarket business. 
Our multiyear trend in aftermarket growth is consistent with our strategy to drive service penetration across our segments and create a more resilient portfolio. 
Turning to cash and capital allocation. Q3 was another quarter of steady and strong cash flow. Year-to-date, free cash flow is nearly $1 billion. Over the past 5 years, our cash flow ROIC has averaged 18% per annum. Our top priority is to increase shareholder returns through high ROIC investments in our business that build a platform for consistent cash generation and investment in growth and innovation. Our long-standing commitment to organic long-term strategic investments is what has enabled us to perform well in both up and down climate or industrial cycles over the years. As an example, in 2016, we've been investing heavily in channel investments that will improve growth by penetrating key markets over the next several years. 
In addition to fully investing in the business, we spent $250 million in 2016 on share buybacks. We've raised our dividend twice: 10% in February, an  additional 25% in October; and we continue to have an increasing pipeline of interesting M&A opportunities. Our consistency in performance and our result in strong cash flow and healthy balance sheet puts us in an excellent position to maintain significant optionality to move quickly across any or all capital allocation fronts as opportunities arise in this uncertain and often volatile global economy. 
Before I hand things over to Sue, I want to hit on 3 key areas that we know are important for you to understand based on our conversations with many investors. 
Turning to Slide 4. I'm pleased with the progress of our Industrial segment in the third quarter, and we believe we remain on track to achieve our guidance for 2016 margins of 10% to 11%. The continuing actions we've taken and are taking to deliver improvement are taking hold. We continue to focus on operational excellence initiatives, restructuring and reducing costs, increased focus on parts and service, and here, we're already seeing growth in the service business, but we believe we can step on the gas even further in this area. Segmentation and focus on growing markets like food and beverage, pharma and electronics, and continuing multiyear product channel initiating investments to achieve strong leverage where the market's recovering. It's important to note, based on the actions we've taken and what we're seeing in the business, that we believe Q2 marked the trough in our operating margins for the business, and we're expecting improved performance going forward in 2017, although the results may not be a straight line up quarter-to-quarter. 
If you turn to Slide 5, the main takeaway here is that the Thermo King business is resilient. We saw this in the third quarter where revenues were down but margins moved higher. For 2016, we continue to see the business being consistent with the expectations we set out in July. The team deserves a lot of execution credit there for improving margins on declining revenue and for building a more resilient and valuable franchise over time.  Quarter 3 is a great example. The transport business grew margins on a 12% lower revenue base. We do expect about a 20% decline in trailers next year, but we believe we should be able to mitigate some of the downside by growing the business in other regions and in other TK products. 
Moving to Slide 6. Another topic on the minds of investors is how the Dodge data for nonresidential put in place translates to Ingersoll-Rand. Here, I think it's important to weigh out where our business comes from and what drives the market, but I think the market overestimates our exposure. As the chart shows, the North American commercial HVAC segment is about $4 billion and is split about 50-50 between services and equipment. Of the equipment, about 65% is replacement business, so not new put in place. The result is that our Dodge put in place data just covers about 18% of our business. Additionally, when you drill down further into the 18%, about 50% is commercial and 50% is institutional. Institutional is expected to show good growth in 2016 and even better growth in 2017. Our data set is North American commercial HVAC will be mid-single digits in 2016 and a similar number in 2017. So we continue to see a healthy market going into next year. 
And with that, I'll turn things over to Sue."

I'd like to begin with a summary of main points for you to take away from today's call. As Mike discussed, we continue to execute the core tenets of our business operating system in Q3, building upon our strong 2016 p",2020,"Thank you, Mike. Let's go to Slide 7. I'd like to begin with a summary of main points for you to take away from today's call. As Mike discussed, we continue to execute the core tenets of our business operating system in Q3, building upon our strong 2016 performance across the 3 pillars of growth, profitability and cash flow. 
Adjusted earnings per share was up 17% on 3% organic revenue growth. Cash flow was 180% of net income for the quarter. 
Our performance was highlighted by record results in our North America commercial and residential HVAC businesses where we captured additional market share, while at the same time, expanding margins year-over-year. 
In our Industrial business, we drove 180 basis points of improved operating margin performance sequentially. We continue to take further actions on operational excellence initiatives, increased our commercial focus on aftermarket parts and service and added cost-reduction activities to improve operating results going forward. The margin improvement was 70 basis points after adjusting Q2 margins for capitalized new product engineering and development cost that we highlighted in last quarter's earnings materials. We believe we are largely maintaining our growing market share across the portfolio despite continued soft industrial end markets. 
During the quarter, we also extended our strong free cash flow performance by $644 million, bringing our year-to-date total to $992 million, up $527 million from the prior year. Given our long-term expectations for strong earnings and cash conversion, we also increased our dividend by 25% in October to $0.40 per share or $1.60 annualized, making our dividend highly competitive not only in our peer group, but across the broader market. Additionally, we now believe our free cash flow for 2016 will approximate $1.3 billion, up more than $200 million from our previous guidance of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. 
We've also increased our earnings per share guidance for the year given our year-to-date performance and outlook. Our revised guidance of between $4.17 and $4.22 is higher by $0.14 at the midpoint, reflecting the flow-through of our Q3 over-performance versus our Q3 guidance midpoint and an $0.88 to $0.93 fourth quarter. The fourth quarter of $0.90 to $0.91 at the midpoint is consistent with our prior guidance. 
On the next several slides, I will highlight the key messages for this earnings call. Please go to Slide 8. 
Our strong enterprise performance on organic growth, earnings per share growth and cash flow conversion was highlighted by our North America HVAC businesses and by sequential operating margin improvement in our Industrial segment versus the prior quarter. Organic revenue was up 3%, as adjusted margins improved 30 basis points year-on-year with 30% operating leverage. Our business operating system again guided us through good execution in our factories and in our call centers. Our focus was on good operating results in a-low-growth environment, and we delivered against that objective. 
Please go to Slide 9. 
Organic orders continue to be solid through the third quarter of 2016, led by our Climate business and partially offset by soft Industrial markets. Climate orders were up 4% organically. Organic global commercial HVAC bookings were up mid-single digit, led by low-teens growth in North America unitary. We also continued to drive excellent growth in service, controls and contracting, with low-teens growth in the quarter. Residential bookings were solid, up mid-single digits. 
Organic transport orders were down low single-digits, with order growth in Europe and Asia offset by declines in North America trailer and auxiliary power units. Consistent with our guidance, we continue to expect bookings to decline in North America trailer. 
On balance, the Industrial businesses were flat to down modestly, and we are calling a broad-based recovery in the near term. 
Please go to Slide 10. 
This slide provides a directional view of our segment revenue performance by region. In our Climate segment, we saw solid performance in both North America and Latin America and low-single-digit growth in the Middle East. In our Industrial segment, overall performance was essentially flat, with high single digit growth in Europe, Middle East and Africa due to the shipment of large orders in the Middle East, and mid-single digit growth in Asia, offset by declines in North America and Latin America. 
Please go to Slide 11. 
Climate performance was strong in the quarter, with organic revenues up 3% and adjusted operating margins up 90 basis points. Commercial HVAC organic revenues were up mid-single digits, highlighted by exceptional growth in North America contracting up 17% and unitary equipment in North America up low-teens. In Europe, business was unusually light, impacted by the slowdown in activity during the summer holiday season, driving mid-single-digit equipment declines. Europe services contracting and parts were flat. Residential continued their outstanding year, with revenues up low-teens. 
Transport organic revenues were down low-teens in the quarter, driven by weakening North America trailer and soft APU and marine markets. Despite lower revenues, margins expanded 110 basis points with increases in both North America and Europe, Middle East and Africa. This demonstrates the more resilient franchise we discussed. Growth in aftermarket parts and services, trucks and in Europe trailers drove higher margins and helped mitigate the impact of the downturn. 
Please go to Slide 12. 
Climate reported operating margins expanded 110 basis points year-over-year. Volume and mix were favorable across commercial and residential HVAC, partially offset by volume in transport. Price and direct material deflation and productivity also contributed to margin improvement. Additionally, we continued to invest in the business to drive innovation and growth. 
Please go to Slide 13. 
Third quarter Industrial margins improved 180 basis points from second quarter trough margins on 1% organic revenue growth. Margin improvement was still solid at 70 basis points when accounting for Q2 2016 capitalized costs related to new product engineering and development of $8 million that we discussed last quarter. Excluding those costs, Q2 margin was 10.9%.  
Industrial end markets remained soft in Q3 and are expected to be soft through 2016. 
Revenues were up mid-single digits in compressors with growth in aftermarket, oil free and large machines with easier comparisons to the prior year. Other industrial products were down low-teens, with material handling showing the largest decline due to oil and gas exposure. Small electric vehicles were down slightly in the quarter. 
Please go to Slide 14. Industrial's reported operating margin of 10.9% was down 300 basis points versus prior year. Volume and mix were the largest drivers of this decline. Pricing offset materials, but given the continued low volumes running through our factories, productivity did not offset inflation in the quarter. We continued planned investments in our products and channel and restructuring to improve our cost base. Looking forward, we expect margins to improve in 2017 given ongoing margin improvement actions, although we do expect some variability due to cyclicality. 
Please go to Slide 15. 
September year-to-date free cash flow of $992 million was favorable to prior year by $527 million. Strong operating income improvement and working capital performance were the primary drivers of the favorability. For the quarter, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 4.9%. Our 2016 goal is approximately 4%.  Based on strong performance year-to-date and our confidence in future cash conversion, we have raised our 2016 free cash flow forecast to approximately $1.3 billion. This is up more than $200 million from our prior range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. 
We have a proud history of returning cash to shareholders. Since 2011, our free cash flow as a percentage of net income has averaged 100%. Over that same timeframe, we've returned more than $6.5 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends of $1.5 billion and share buybacks of $5.1 billion. 
You may have noted that we referenced cash flow ROIC a few times today. Our definition is free cash flow divided by gross fixed assets plus working capital. Our goal is period-over-period improvement in this metric, and we are doing well in 2016 with improved free cash flow and balanced capital expenditures and working capital. 
Please go to Slide 16. Our strong cash performance in the third quarter and our expectations moving forward enable us to, one, continue to invest in strategic growth programs, as Mike outlined earlier. In addition to the core strategic investments, we're also investing in long-term growth through innovative and differentiated products in areas such as controls for buildings as a resource, intelligent monitoring and self-healing systems, just to name a few.  Two, we've paid an annual dividend for 106 years and have consistently raised the dividend over time. Over the past 5 years, we've raised our annual dividend at a 20% compound annual growth rate. In October, we announced a dividend increase of 25% to $0.40 per quarter or to $1.60 per share annually. Three, we will continue to purchase sweeping shares sufficient to offset dilution, roughly $250 million per year. Four, we continue to see an increasing number of positive, potential acquisition targets. And five, we strive to maintain a strong balance sheet with BBB metrics to provide optionality as our markets continue to evolve. We will continue to create long-term value for our shareholders through capital allocation, as we have consistently done for years. 
Please go to Slide 17. Our intention is to give you our best view of what we're seeing in our end markets sitting here today and how that translates to our revenue guidance for the remainder of 2016. We've broken it down by major end markets and geographies. As you can see by the variation of colors and symbols, our end markets are seeing a wide variation in trends. Markets for North America commercial and residential HVAC, as well as European transport and commercial HVAC are generally positive, while global Industrial markets remain soft. We are forecasting global transport markets to be down low single digits. Our forecast for North America trailer volumes has not changed and we expect the market to be down slightly for the year. This implies a decline in the second half after a single digit growth in the first half of the year. Asian HVAC markets are expected to be flat to down, and Industrial markets in Asia remain under pressure. Golf car markets are slightly down, offset by increases in the utility vehicle markets. 
All of our revenue growth forecasts are shown on an organic basis. We are forecasting mid single digit growth in commercial HVAC in total, high single digit growth in residential HVAC, which is essentially an all North America business for us, and a small decline in transport globally. 
Please go to Slide 18. 
Aggregating those market backdrops, we expect organic revenues for the full year 2016 to be up approximately 2% versus 2015, with foreign exchange presenting a headwind of about 1 percentage point. We expect organic revenues to be up approximately 4% for Climate and down 3% for Industrial. Adjusted operating margins, which exclude restructuring costs, are expected to be at the high end of our previous ranges for the enterprise at 12% and for Climate at 14.5%. Adjusted Industrial margins are expected to be at the midpoint of our previous range of 10% to 11%. 
Please go to Slide 19. 
Transitioning to earnings, the reported earnings per share range is estimated to be $5.62 to $5.67, and the adjusted range is $4.17 to $4.22, up $0.14 to $0.15. At the midpoint, this represents a 12% increase in earnings per share over 2015. Adjusted numbers exclude restructuring and the Hussmann gain. We have raised our full year guidance for free cash flow more than $200 million to approximately $1.3 billion from $1 billion to $1.1 billion, reflecting continued strong cash flows through 2016. For the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect Climate revenues to be up 2% to 4% organically, while Industrial revenues are expected to be down 6% to 8%. Adjusted fourth quarter earnings per share is forecast to be between $0.88 and $0.93, excluding restructuring charges of about $0.02. The midpoint is consistent with or slightly higher than our previous guidance midpoint of $0.90 per share. 
With that, I will turn it back to Mike for a few closing comments."

As we conclude, I want to emphasize a few points that I think are important for you to have as takeaways as we head into the final quarter and into 2017. 
First, we're performing well, with a solid strategy punctuated with excellent execution over time. As a result, we have delivered consistent, reliable top-tier financial performance on organic growth, EPS growth and cash flow over Industrial and Climate cycles. 
Second, our management team is effective in anticipating and seeing around the corners. Our commercial HVAC business is strong and focused on the right growth areas with equipment, controls and service. We believe we have turned the corner with our Industrial segment and starting to realize margin improvement versus the quarter 2 trough. 
And our transport refrigeration business is resilient. And our team is capturing margin expansion despite downward sales. 
Finally, we're building a stronger, more valuable, more sustainable and less cyclical Ingersoll-Rand. The results we reported today are a direct result of the strategic work, persistence and tenacity of the talented people that represent the unique culture we've built. I'm proud of our people who continue to deliver for our customers and our shareholders. 
Our momentum is strong as we conclude the year and head into 2017.  And with that, Sue and I will now be happy to take your questions."

So in essence, you're going to have a volume challenge. You're also going to have some investments there occurring in some of the business. For instance, we're doing some investment in the Club Car business, as well as in new products for the CTS business. So it's really a story about volume and investments, and a little bit less on the Industrial side with commodities, but also some impact there."

So again, I think where we're at, at $992 million at the end of the third quarter is fabulous. We brought it forward, and we brought it forward by paying attention to things like terms on accounts receivable, making sure that accounts receivable is balanced with accounts payable terms across the globe; with working through inventories and making sure inventories were there to serve the customer, but not too much to have additional product on hand. So we've really managed this very, very carefully. And so what you'll see in the fourth quarter is really that instead of doing heroics to end the quarter, we've normalized it, which is really how we want to operate the business and how we want our cash flow to come in."

We're going to remain focused in terms of the price cost spread. We know we'll have a few headwinds on the sale side, but we'll still have a bit of deflation that occurs on the basis of copper that we already have locked in and some of the aluminum that we have locked in for 2017. We're also going to hit productivity really, really hard in the business. That's part of our hallmark of our operational excellence. And we're going to offset inflation. We're going to continue to press on corporate. So earnings per share growth next year, I think, is going to come from all of the different parts of the business, as well as tax. Now tax is something that we're really proud of. And we're really proud of because it's -- we started to talk about a low 20s tax rate earlier in the year. We got there faster than we expected. But we got there by really doing what we call operationalizing tax, which is basically we assign tax partners to each of our SBUs. They're working projects within the SBUs to actually work down the effective tax rate, things like trading hubs, things like energy credit, things like really legal entity simplification. So we've really operationalized that. I think it's kind of cutting edge. I still don't think our tax rate is going to go below the low 20s. I think that's where it should be. So yes, we'll get some tailwind out of that going into 2017, because I think the low 20s is where we project the rate. But I think it's operational also and something that I think is really good for Ingersoll-Rand."

But what we see happening, and again, the third quarter came out better than we had hoped at 60 basis points, which was really about 50-50 material deflation and the other price. As we start to look at 2017, I think what 2017 does is it reverts to what we've said all along, which is that we would have a 20 to 30 basis points spread between price and cost. And as you start to look at commodities for 2017, so steel has moved around a little bit. We saw an increase earlier in the summer to over $800 a ton. We currently see spot prices back in the $700 range. So we have about a 6-month time lag between when those prices move around and when we see it translated. That means I'm going to see some steel inflation in the fourth quarter, as well as probably the first quarter of 2017. However, I still continue to see tailwinds coming out of copper and aluminum going into 2017, helping us to offset that balance. So we have line of sight to what we think the commodities are going to do, and therefore, we have line of sight what our costs are so that we can price per our operating model with top line margin expansion and get back to the 20 to 30 basis points for the year."

So we're winning a lot of that sort of work, and we're loading up on that work as well. With that being said, performance contracting is an interesting place for us to play, and there is a healthy amount of pull-through that comes both not just in equipment, but in service. Performance contracts always have a healthy service component that comes along with the guarantee."

I mean, Michael, in the context of the last couple of years on the third quarter call, you definitely -- one year, I think you provided a constructive range for EPS growth. And then last year, you just talked about kind of the rhetoric around what you liked in terms of your overall HVAC portfolio. But are -- do you think you have a good line of sight to '17 on a forward basis versus previous periods? In other words, from '14, '15? Or are you -- do you think there's more uncertainty in terms of the outlook this time versus the last couple of years when you're reporting 3Q?"

And so there's not a lot of acrimony inside the company to understand what good performance looks like. So that's what you'd expect from us next year. And I'll dial that in as we get closer into next year."
