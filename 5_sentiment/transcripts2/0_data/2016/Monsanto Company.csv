I'm joined this morning by Hugh Grant, our Chairman and CEO; Brett Begemann, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Pierre Courduroux, our CFO; and by Dr.  , our Chief Technology Officer. Also joining me from the IR team are Tim Baker, Patel and Ashley Wissmann. 
Our first quarter call provides the initial insights into our fiscal year with a summary of our first quarter results and importantly, our views into our outlook for the rest of the year. Additionally, as we always do in the first quarter, we will provide our annual R&D pipeline and product performance update. This call is being webcast, and you can access the webcast, supporting slides and the replay at monsanto.com. We have provided you today with EPS and other measures on both a GAAP and ongoing business basis. Where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to GAAP in the slides and in the press release, both of which are on the website.  
This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may vary in a material way from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in the safe harbor language in our most recent 10-K and in today's press release. The forward-looking statements are current only as of the date of this call, and the company disclaims any obligation to update them or the factors that may affect actual results.
First and foremost, let me review our first quarter results as shown on Slide 4. Our first quarter ongoing loss per share of $0.11 was better than expected on the basis of lower-than-expected operating expenses and better Intacta sales in Brazil. When compared to the prior year, currency accounted for approximately half of the decline in ongoing earnings per share. On an as-reported basis, our first quarter loss per share was $0.56, reflecting $0.46 for restructuring charges, consistent with our planned actions to reduce annual spend by $500 million by fiscal year '18. 
Finally, our free cash flow for the first quarter was more than $1 billion as compared to $969 million in the prior year, reflecting the reduction in inventory and modest growth in our prepays. 
With that brief summary, let me hand it to Hugh to provide the strategic outlook."

First of all, a special thanks to the 130 of you who joined us at our recent biannual investor event. We were pleased to share with you our long-term outlook and importantly, an early preview into our outstanding pipeline and our product performance, which we'll build upon today. 
Consistent with that earlier event, I'd like to start to talk today with the topic of industry consolidation right at the beginning. First, we've had an incredible standalone growth plan backed by our commitment to innovation in the industry's broadest, deepest and most proven pipeline. Second, we expect industry consolidation to continue and it should, given the opportunities for significant synergies and value creation in R&D across the industry. Third, we expect to continue to be the partner of choice across the industry whether it's through our broad licensing approach, through collaboration and partnerships or through strategic M&A. 
Yes, 2 of our largest competitors recently announced that they're combining, but they're also 2 of our largest technology licensees, and we expect that to continue given the opportunities of our unparalleled pipeline. 
Finally, we'll continue with a disciplined approach to evaluating M&A opportunities as we seek a strong strategic fit and synergistic value. 
So with that, let's move to the update for the quarter and the annual R&D pipeline update, which is more relevant than ever given the macro trends in agriculture as shown on Slide 5. We see innovation in agriculture as being pivotal and addressing the 3 megatrends namely: sustainable food security, Climate change and industry consolidation. And we believe our innovation poises us in a unique position to lead in all of these areas. 
As we move to Slide 6, this is our third consecutive year of more than 20 advancements, and our core pipeline is still expected to deliver up to $25 billion in peak net sales, and this is before considering the upside value from our transformational new growth platforms. We continue to see significant growth from our core, spanning the spectrum of grower needs. This ranges from breeding enhancements to deliver yield to multi-generational projects in the categories of insect and weed control. Further, our new platforms in Climate and the BioAg Alliance are beginning to show meaningful progress in the relatively untapped category of plant health and fertility. Collectively, this progress drives our ability to deliver what we expect to be greater than 1.3 billion acres of technology upgrades by 2025, providing sustainable intensification on our existing 400 million-acre footprint, as shown on Slide 7. 
Today, [indiscernible] the headwinds from currency and commodity prices that we outlined at the start of this fiscal year have not yet updated and in fact, currency has become a much stronger headwind with the recent events in Argentina. We're pleased to see the early decisive approach of the new President, and we believe that his actions, particularly the lifting of export taxes in grain, will see longer-term benefits for agriculture for which we're well positioned to participate. However, the approximate 35% to 40% devaluation of the Argentine peso is expected to create an estimated $0.20 to $0.25 charge in Q2. And with that increased headwinds, we now expect our fiscal year '16 ongoing EPS to trend to the lower half of our guidance range of $5.10 to $5.60, as shown on Slide 8. 
Despite this currency pressure, we still have a stronger outlook for cash generation, and we continue to expect the free cash flow to be in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion. And we've continued our discipline spend management with plans now in place to deliver on $500 million of annual cost savings by fiscal year '18. 
Despite these near-term headwinds, we continue to confirm our long-term growth targets to deliver greater than 20% compounded annual growth and our ongoing earnings per share from the end of fiscal year '16, fiscal year '19, as outlined in Slide 9. In that time frame, we expect demand transfer grain to continue and improve grower margins. We expect currency to remain relatively consistent with today's rates and importantly, we expect our innovation to carry 80% of the expected gross profit growth with continued industry-leading corn hybrid renewal and growth from the Intacta and Roundup Ready 2 XTEND blockbusters in soybeans. The breadth, depth and productivity of our pipeline gives us confidence in both our long-term growth targets as well as the strong role that we believe we will play in addressing the evolving landscape across agriculture. With the unique vantage point that we have from our pipeline and the technology enhanced to create the 9 to 14 gene stacks by 2025, we expect to lead and define the integrated solutions for the industry. 
So with that introduction, let me hand over to Brett for the operational update."
528414,316175092,915826,"Monsanto Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 06, 2016",2016-01-06,"Earnings Calls","Monsanto Company","Executives","Thanks, Hugh, and good morning to everyone on the line. Delivery of our near-term and long-term targets that Hugh just shared with you hinges on our ability to deliver on our key operational priorities namely:  Delivering $3.5 billion of expected gross pr",1090,"Thanks, Hugh, and good morning to everyone on the line. Delivery of our near-term and long-term targets that Hugh just shared with you hinges on our ability to deliver on our key operational priorities namely:  Delivering $3.5 billion of expected gross profit growth from fiscal year '16 to fiscal year '19; upgrading the industry's largest seed technology platform to the Xtend technology; monetizing our new growth platforms, and maintaining our financial discipline as outlined on Slide 10. 
Let's look at these priorities in more detail with an update on relevant key milestones from the first quarter and how those will inform the rest of fiscal year '16
First, let's take a look at our global corn seed franchise. With industry-leading share positions in almost every one of our major corn regions, as shown on Slide 11, we plan to drive our growth off of this leading footprint from a combination of continued share gains and annual price-mix lift gains in germplasm. Even in this challenging ag environment, we continue to target a whole share in every major corn-growing region in fiscal year '16. And while it is still early days to estimate share gains, we are confident that we grew our corn brand share in the summer season in Brazil. And in the northern hemisphere, the dealer and grower order book volumes and pre-pays in the U.S. are tracking modestly ahead of the prior year, despite the continued compressed commodity prices. 
Not only do we continue to pursue our plan to hold or grow share in every major corn-growing region in fiscal year '16, but we continue to target to deliver positive, low-single-digit price-mix lift in corn germplasm globally, exclusive of currency impacts. In Brazil, we've been able to deliver germplasm price-mix lift of 10%, exclusive of currency in the first quarter, which has allowed us to moderate a portion of the currency downsides, and we will continue to target to do so going forward. In the U.S. order book, after our pricing ladder adjustments, the year 1 to 3 hybrids make up 50% to 60% of the portfolio, consistent with the trends we outlined on Slide 12. The continuation of our industry-leading performance supports these targeted mix lift. However, our realized mix lift will ultimately be determined in the second and third quarters, where we will be closely monitoring discounting in this environment of compressed grower margins. 
Moving beyond corn to soybeans, our second largest gross profit driver for fiscal year '19, we continue to see great uptick of our Intacta technology in South America. Our results came in better than forecasted in the first quarter in part due to Intacta sales, and we remain confident in our target to penetrate 30 million acres across South America in just the third year of launch, as you can see on Slide 13. With its greater than 4 [ph] bushel average yield advantage and reduction in insecticide sprays, growers continue to demand Intacta technology in what we see as 100 million-acre opportunity in South America. And while Intacta has had the fastest penetration of any biotech trait to date, we expect Roundup Ready 2 XTEND soybeans to top this level with greater than 3 million acres expected this year in its first year of commercial launch. Based on our U.S. reservation system, we feel confident in the demand for more than 3 million acres of the technology. We've also been progressing with our dicamba chemistry strategy and closed on multiple supplier agreements, as shown on Slide 14. These agreements are expected to provide us with adequate supply of dicamba in the early years following launch and together with our pending self-manufacturing plants, are expected to provide a balanced approach to cost effective dicamba supply. 
Not to be outdone, Bollgard II XtendFlex cotton is expected to penetrate 1.5 million acres this season in the U.S, double the more than 750,000 acres in fiscal year '15's limited commercial introduction. Not only do we expect this to create value from improved weed control, but we expect these new varieties to drive share in deltapine seed, just as it did in fiscal year '15. 
Moving beyond our core businesses, we continue to progress with our plans for the coming U.S. season at Climate, where we're working towards the closing of our most recent agreement with John Deere, which uniquely positions us with exclusive third-party near real-time connectivity and in-cab visualization of data. This agreement marks our third connectivity agreement with the major equipment dealers and is a great addition to our industry-leading retail network to the top 6 U.S. ag retailers. In addition, this agreement is accelerating both grower and retailer interest in the technology. This reach, combined with the capabilities of our advisors and the adoption we've secured to date, as shown on Slide 15, establishes Climate as the digital ag platform, and we expect to continue that momentum in fiscal year '16 with expected penetration to 12 million paid acres and platform adoption to an expected 90 million acres, as shown on Slide 16. 
Our success, however, is based on more than gross profit growth drivers I have just outlined. It is also predicated on the continuation of discipline, discipline in how we manage our existing Ag Productivity business segment and discipline in how we execute our restructuring and cost-savings plans. On the Ag Productivity front, we saw the tough comparison we expected in the first quarter results, with generic prices down significantly versus the prior year and very challenging comparisons on currencies, particularly in Brazil. We experienced year-over-year yield declines in pricing of more than 20%, inclusive of currency. Overall, however, as shown on Slide 17, we still expect to sell roughly 300 million gallons for the full year as we expect to continue to manage our price premium closely and pick up the decline in volumes from Q1 in the latter half of the year. 
Moving to the topic of disciplined spend management, we now have restructuring plans and cost-savings initiatives in place that aligns to our target to deliver $500 million in annual savings by fiscal year '18. The actions we disclosed earlier today build from the foundation we outlined on Slide 18 to streamline the organization to create enduring and durable savings. We are focused on creating scale and efficiency while still delivering outstanding innovation and customer service through the creation of 4 commercial hubs an R&D Center of Excellence and from fully leveraging data analytics. 
With that, let me pass it to Pierre for the financial update. Pierre?"

Before I go into the financial view on our business outlook for the year, let me start with the results from the first quarter, as shown on Slide 4. First, we delivered a loss of $0.11 per share on",1052,"Thanks, Brett, and good morning to everyone on the line. Before I go into the financial view on our business outlook for the year, let me start with the results from the first quarter, as shown on Slide 4. First, we delivered a loss of $0.11 per share on an ongoing basis, which was better than our expected ongoing loss of $0.23 to $0.33. That improvement versus our expectation was driven by lower operating expenses and by better-than-expected results in Intacta in Brazil. Specifically, operating expenses, excluding restructuring charges were 9% lower than the prior year, mostly driven by currency. 
From a year-to-year perspective, currency and particularly the Brazilian reais, accounted for approximately half of the decline in ongoing earnings per share. On a constant currency basis, the decrease in earnings per share versus the prior year was mostly due to the decline in that productivity gross profit related to the anticipated glyphosate price declines and the impact of the timing of glyphosate deliveries. Seeds and Genomics gross profit was mostly impacted by the reduction in corn volumes arising from timing shifts and lower planting acres in the southern hemisphere. Offsetting some of those decline was the $125 million gross profit growth in soybeans before the effect of currency led by the strong performance of Intacta. 
Second, on an as-reported basis, we reported a loss of $0.56 per share, reflecting $210 million of after-tax restructuring charges in the quarter. We have now recorded approximately 70% of the expecting restructuring charges, and this sets us on pace for the $500 million of annual cost savings we're expecting by fiscal year '18, as outlined on Slide 19. 
Third, from a cash flow perspective, we delivered more than $1 billion of free cash, representing a 6% increase versus the prior year. As expected, this reflects the cash benefit of the implementation of a disciplined corn seeds production plan that drove significant inventory reductions as well as growth in our prepays in the U.S. 
Moving to the outlook for the year, with the recent currency devaluation in Argentina, we now expect to trend to the lower half of our ongoing earnings per share guidance of $5.10 to $5.60 for the full year, as shown on Slide 20. We expect an approximate $0.20 to $0.25 net downside to our ongoing EPS in the second quarter related to the approximate $0.35 to 40% weakening of the Argentine peso versus the U.S. dollar. We are expecting to book a one time significant charge in the second quarter related to our net balance sheet exposure and expect modest variability in the adjustment thereafter as we will mark to the currency evolution every month. 
Altogether, from a currency perspective, we are now expecting $0.60 to $0.70 of currency headwinds for the full year versus the prior expectation of $0.35 to $0.40, with the Argentine peso accounting for the majority of this increase. 
Despite some moderating in our outlook for currency and corn price-mix lift with the competitive pricing dynamics in this challenging environment, we still see an opportunity for a 5% to 7% growth in Seeds and Genomics gross profit. We continue to expect this growth to come from the benefit of the $275 million or more in expected licensing agreements from corn, germplasm mix lift in the low single-digits exclusive of currency from targeted corn share gains and from the growth in our Intacta soybeans. This growth is expected to be partially offset by the expected cost of $70 million to $80 million associated with the Roundup Ready 2 XTEND launch and the $90 million to $100 million of incremental corn cost of goods coming from the smaller corn seed production plans. 
For Ag Productivity, we continue to expect gross profit to be in the range of $900 million to $1.1 [ph] billion as we expect to sell roughly 300 million gallons for the full year at price is expected to improve slightly as we move through the fiscal year. Based on the estimated savings from the additional restructuring actions, continued cost savings and currency benefits, we now expect operating expenses, exclusive of the restructuring and environmental litigation settlement expenses, to be flat versus fiscal year '15, inclusive of new platform spend. 
Our income and expense considering the expected impact from the Argentine peso devaluation is expected to be approximately $100 million to $120 million worse than the prior year on a full year basis. Beyond the operating profit drivers, the net effect of our ongoing $3 billion accelerated share repurchase, including increased financing, should generate a net annual EPS benefit of $0.24 to $0.27, unchanged from our prior guidance. We continue to expect the year [ph] to start to close and be trued up in the next 3 months, closing up another key step in the progress of our capital allocation strategy. 
From a capital allocation perspective, we remain committed to a balanced approach between share repurchases, dividends, capital investments and investments in technology, as shown on the Slide 21. This approach, combined with our commitment to a solid investment-grade credit rating that allows access to commercial paper, should allow us to operate with strategic flexibility to invest in high-growth opportunities that support our strategy while giving us the latitude to execute on larger-scale opportunities as appropriate. Backing this strategy is our ability to convert earnings into strong cash generation. 
Overall, even as our earnings guidance moves to the lower half of our range, we still expect to generate $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion of free cash flow in fiscal year '16. We see the opportunity to grow this in future year, absent the approximately $200 million to $250 million of after-tax restructuring charge cost we expect to incur in fiscal year '16. 
As I shared at our investor event, my focus is on return on innovation, financial discipline and balanced capital allocation, all of which support long-term growth and return value to our share owners. Continuing to execute well on these pillars, along with delivering on the innovation in our pipeline, provides the gateway to the rapid future business growth necessary to deliver on our plan to grow our ongoing EPS by more than 20% annually from fiscal year '17 to fiscal year '19. 
Thanks. I'll now turn the time over to Robb for the annual pipeline update."

This is an exciting time for technology. The convergence of the advances in biology and data science are transforming agriculture, both expanding the breadth of what's possible today and accelerating the pace of innovation. 
On Slide 4, you can see the unparalleled diversity of platforms and the significant number of technologies that we draw upon both internally and externally to drive new innovations. And as excited as I am about what we do in our own world-class research organization, I'm really equally proud of the work we do through collaborations with academics, public and private sector partners and strategic M&A deals. Over the last few years, we've initiated of venture capital investments in 20-plus organizations in key areas of agricultural productivity, digital agriculture and biologicals, complementing our company's integrated systems approach to drive future growth, which brings me to a key point: Innovation is delivering the growth engine that will take us well into the next decade. On the heels of 2 $1 billion-plus blockbuster product launches expected with Intacta and Xtend, this is a robust pipeline of multi-generational upgrades expected to deliver up to $25 billion in peak net sales in the core alone, as shown on Slides 5 through 7, with considerable upside potential from our new platforms. 
I'm particularly excited about our 30 advancements this year, which is the third consecutive year of greater than 20 pipeline advancements, as shown on Slide 8. And I think this progress showcases the breadth and depth of our integrated yield pipeline, which really fuels innovation for the industry. 
As we look at the agronomic focal points for our grower, yield is by far the biggest one, and our pipeline value aligns with that targeting to deliver estimated peak net sales of up to $14.5 billion. Now breeding is clearly our cornerstone, and as you'll see on Slide 9, we're expanding our capability and advantage and further transforming our breeding program. The success of our breeding program has been built on 3 competitive advantages. We have the largest and most diverse germplasm library on the planet and as paired with the industry-best discovery technologies such as high-throughput screening, advanced markers and seed shipping. And finally, we have the largest global integrated testing network, which we leverage to identify, select and deploy the best-performing seeds globally. But now, using genome-wide selection, we expect to create a step change in breeding, allowing us to significantly increase the size and rate of our germplasm screening. We expect to be able to analyze 10x more breeding process by the beginning of the next decade based essentially on D&A sequence knowledge and predictive analytics, which we expect will translate to a 30% increase in genetic gain, giving us even more horsepower to upgrade our global germplasm portfolio every year. 
So this competitive advantage in R&D is what feeds our biggest commercial advantage. On Slide 10, I'm pleased to share with you that for the 10th consecutive year, DEKALB corn has been delivering an average yield increase of 7 to 10 bushels advantage in the U.S. across a gamut of growing conditions, which really underscores the consistent performance advantage. Final harvest results for this year once again show a strong performance advantage of more than 7 bushels per acre versus the competition. 
And it doesn't stop there. On Slide 11, with our advances in molecular breeding, our class of 2017 is expected to deliver 6 to 10 bushels more than our best commercial hybrids today. 
Let's look at soybeans next on Slide 12. Roundup Ready 2 Yield, the established second-generation platform for herbicide tolerance, continues to deliver a greater than 4 bushel per acre average advantage as compared to the original Roundup Ready soybeans. And our new generation of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans provides superior weed control and has that same high yield as Roundup Ready 2 varieties. As we look to the future, the class of 2017 Roundup Ready 2 Xtend varieties shows increasing yield performance, which reflects the benefit of the improved mix of the latest genetics in the new platform and the accelerating use of molecular markers in soybeans. 
And finally, the panel on the right shows the greater than 70 varieties for this spring's expected launch of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans, showcasing the genetic breadth and product performance that sets up our biggest expected biotech seed launch. 
Moving to cotton, our leading delta pine and cotton varieties on Slide 13 demonstrates 70 pounds of then per acre performance advantage for the sixth consecutive year, again underscoring consistent yield advantage and setting up the rapid adoption of Bollgard II XtendFlex. Continuing in the yield category is our work in Yield and Stress. We are streamlining our focus based on insights from the last decade. And through our joint research collaboration with BASF, we've been able to identify a series of key-enabling traits that we believe will lead to increase yield. And I'd like to highlight 2 projects leveraging this trait-first approach, as shown on Slide 14. That is the next generation of higher-yielding corn and soy, both in Phase 1. And in collaboration with BASF, our next-generation higher-yielding corn exhibits stronger roots and stalks and in soy, the novel soybean yield trait demonstrated of plants with more pods in its first year of field testing. 
We're also highlighting 2 new breeding projects that are making significant breakthroughs in yield beyond our annual germplasm refresh. On Slide 15, our high-density corn systems are examples of how we're leveraging germplasm, which can perform at higher plant populations and drive yield. With the potential to aggregate this with insights from our Climate Script Creator, we can help growers target precise seed placement to optimize yield. 
Let's move to weed control. 2016 represents the 20th anniversary of the Roundup Ready trait, a platform that has penetrated over 350 million acres, making it the largest trait platform in the world. With our Roundup Ready Xtend crop system shown on Slide 16, we are going to refresh that broad platform, and we're progressing third and fourth generation weed control systems to provide additional modes of action and weed control well into the future. 
Complementarily linked to these systems is chemistry. We have 5 next-generation chemistries for weed control advancing in our crop protection pipeline shown in Slide 17. And these products target much needed improvements and solutions beyond what's possible in the market today. Xtend the Max and the Roundup Ready Xtend contain our proprietary VaporGrip technology, which will offer superior season-long weed control with residual activity in new, easy to use low volatility dicamba formulations. We're also working on a pre-mix of weren't herbicide in dicamba, which will combine the crops in encapsulated form of acetyl core with dicamba, and this will make it easier to apply multiple modes of action in a single application to control both grass and broadleaf weeds, making it, I think, a very effective component of our Roundup Ready Xtend system across soybean, corn and cotton and with a fit on up to 100 million acres at peak penetration. So these novel chemistry formulations, along with the robust pipeline of multigenerational herbicide trait upgrades that are coming beyond Xtend, are expected to deliver up to $4.5 billion in peak net sales. 
Jumping even further into the future, we're developing the next-generation complex gene stacks that will become the future platforms. Our technology team has already discovered the stacked corn and soybean trait products that we expect to launch in 2025. 
On Slide 18, you can see that the future corn product is expected to have 14 traits: 4 unique belowground insect protection traits; 4 unique aboveground insect protection traits; 5 unique herbicide tolerance traits plus a novel yield in stress trait. And as you can see on the bottom of the slide, the story repeats. The future soybean stacks we have in hand are expected to give rise to a 9-gene stack in that same time frame. I think the point is, is that we know today, which products are going to redefine the competitive standard in 2025. Our global regulatory track record, combined with our leading seed and licensing footprint, makes us a partner of choice in this industry, and we're currently working with several parties to codevelop the next-generation of weed control, pairing traits from new breakthrough chemistry modes of action, as shown on Slide 19. And by working in parallel to develop new weed control systems, these exciting collaborations and partnerships are expected to allow us to create next-generation products far more quickly. 
Insect control is another critical grower need where like weed control, we have a pipeline of multigenerational upgrades of novel insect protection traits in progress. And these are valued at up to $4 billion in net peak sales. As you look across the key crops on Slides 20 to 22, you can see that we have 4 products in Phase 4. And by the end of the decade, we expect to launch all of these products from SmartStax PRO across the Americas to the second generation of Intacta for South America, and all of which target some of the most significant pests in agriculture. And this year, several of these are progressing in our pipeline, including the fourth generation corn rootworm, the fourth generation aboveground insect protection in corn as well as the third generation insect protection in soybeans. These products are expected to deliver new modes of action for increased durability, and many offer broader spectrum of control. 
I'd like to highlight the work that we're doing with Likethis. The Bollgard platform has revolutionized cotton protection around the world with its control of the bollworm and other caterpillar pests. I believe the Likethis product will be an equivalent breakthrough product for controlling sucking and piercing insects such as Lygus, thrips and leafhoppers, which have emerged as the major pests in cotton production. This technology will not only protect yield, but farmers today are spraying extensively to control these pests, which combined with estimated losses, cost farmers nearly $200 million annually. 
Rounding out our core is our focus to deliver disease control solutions in an integrated system, and these are estimated to deliver peak net sales of up to $3.5 billion. First in corn, on Slide 23, across the major diseases such as stock rot, northern corn leaf blight and Goss’s Wilt, it's clear that our breeding techniques are providing growers with enhanced disease protection. To complement this, we're pleased to share the advancement of our Acceleron seed treatment and enhanced fungicide offering moving to Phase 4. This new chemical seed treatment in corn has averaged an impressive 3 bushels per-acre yield increase versus the standard seed treatment and provides growers with early-season disease control and late-season stock rot suppression. Our disease solutions expand beyond breeding in chemistry. And today, we're announcing that we have identified lead genes for transgenic broad-spectrum disease control. And layer on top of this, the disease insights provided by our Climate Field Health advisor, and we're developing an unparalleled integrated disease control system. 
Additionally, as shown on Slide 24, we continue to make progress in our vegetable business with conventional breeding techniques, this year advancing disease-resistant tomatoes and cucumbers. One of the most exciting new products in our pipeline is a novel molecule for nematode control shown on Slide 25. So nematodes are a persistent soil pest across all crops, resulting in about $1 billion in crop losses in U.S. soybeans alone and in excess of $10 billion in losses annually across all row crops across the globe. In its second year of expanded field testing, the Nemastrike technology is showing outstanding field performance across several crops, and we expect it will become a key component of our Acceleron seed treatment portfolio as well as attract licensing interest from third parties. And building on the success with NEMASTRIKE, as shown on Slide 26, we've expanded our crop chemical approach through our collaboration with Nimbus Therapeutics. Using their unique computationally driven approach, we've identified a novel fungicide chemistry currently in Phase 1 that is demonstrating increased yield protection in corn in the presence of Isaac Tony and ian disease versus both untreated and commercial standard checks. These projects, whether in breeding, biotechnology, crop protection or climate, demonstrate the breadth and depth of our systems approach to delivering disease control solutions. 
So now, shifting to our new growth platforms. I'd like to begin with microbials on Slide 27. We're in collaboration with Novozymes we're working to understand, which microbes we can use to treat seeds to improve nutrient uptake, promote growth and provide insect control and disease protection. In the early phase work, microbial strains are advancing from discovery to Phase 1 for disease and insect control. And in the later stage, our enhanced corn inoculant lead, as shown on Slide 28, is advancing from Phase 2 to Phase 4 and is planned for a 2017 U.S. launch. This enhanced formulation delivers critical seed stability, and our 2015 yield data showed a greater than 4 bushel per-acre average yield advantage. Ultimately, the interplay between this technology and our data science tools will allow us to position the right seed in the right field with the right microbial supplement to stimulate productivity and yield. 
The other platform within biologicals is our BioDirect platform shown on Slide 29, where we're developing new topically applied RNAi base tools to target plant disease, insect and weed control as well as targets that enhance bee health. And first in bee health on Slide 30, the BioDirect technology is demonstrating significant improvement in beehive survival by targeting the virile mite, a pest that feeds on the bee. With this efficacy, we've advanced this project to Phase 2. 
And in the BioDirect canola flea beetle project on Slide 31, it's advancing to Phase 1. Today, flea beetles cost about $300 million in damages in North America alone, and this technology would provide growers with an alternative solution to the median mix currently used to control flea beetles. So with the significant strides we've made in BioDirect manufacturing, we see tangible solutions coming to market to help growers. 
Let's shift to our digital ag platform shown on Slide 32. In just 2 years after acquisition, we have a fully populated pipeline supporting our digital ag platform. First, let's look at the exciting field results for our Nitrogen Advisor. Nutrients are one of agriculture's most significant inputs with a global market of more than $180 billion. This year, our Nitrogen Advisor was on millions of acres, as you can easily on Slide 33, and we saw phenomenal results across the sample of more than 3,800 fields. Over 10% of those fields showed a nitrogen shortfall, which resulted in significant yield loss. And more than 40% of the field had excess nitrogen. When you add it all up, it exceeds $10 per acres of value on average. And across the U.S. market, that's $1 billion opportunity. Now, we're developing models to optimize within a field where there's significant variation of nitrogen levels at any given time. And in fact, we're advancing our subfield nitrogen tool, which will be field tested during the 2016 season. 
And finally, as we develop models for our other crops like wheat and canola, we'll start to unlock more of that multibillion opportunity. 
Moving to Slide 34. Other highlights for the platform are our foundational connectivity, data capture and visualization tools where we're seeing real commercial progress in a rapidly evolving pipeline. Just a few weeks ago, we launched our Climate FieldView Drive, which enables seamless connectivity while passing through the field. Our recent agreement with John Deere enables near real-time connectivity through their wireless data server. And so at the end of the day, regardless of the brand of their equipment, growers will have access to seamless data transfer to the cloud, unlocking our unique ability to deliver actionable insights to millions of acres. 
I'd like to wrap up by summarizing a few key points on Slide 35. First, we have never had a sense of complacency about our R&D leadership. And now, once again, we're transforming our efforts. And the efforts we're making now to change breeding are raising the bar dramatically on what it will take to compete in this industry in the future. In the area of biotechnology, we're putting in place literally today, the future 14 gene stack products for corn and the 9 gene stack for soybean that we believe will create an incredible competitive advantage and unique value to our growers. We have novel, new next-generation seed treatments, fungicides, herbicides and biologicals progressing in our crop protection portfolio. And with the progress we're seeing in our new platforms, there's been a translation from concept to reality that's played out in just 2 short seasons. Importantly, we're integrating these technologies starting at the research level just like we've been doing in our core breeding and biotech platforms for years. 
Second point, all of these innovation, not only makes for an incredibly exciting time for technology, but it plays the role, I think, of significant importance in addressing the key global macro trends that you discussed. The innovations we deliver will create more yield to meet the increasing global demand for grains in a more sustainable, targeted and precise manner. 
And finally, I think what's clear is our unique breeding and biotech engine has been transformative to the crop protection industry. Today, the growing depth of our pipeline, along with our new digital ag and biologicals platforms, gives us a unique view on how their crop protection landscape will continue to evolve going forward and places us in a position of strength in our dynamic industry. 
So thanks for your time today. I'll turn it back over to Laura for the Q&A."

I'd say most of the targets that we've approached in the weed control area are designed to supplement support and ensure the long-term performance of the Roundup Ready trait system. And incidentally, in addition to those external projects, you'll note that we had released today that talked about some of the investments that we've made in start-up companies through our venture capital fund, which we've made an investment in over 20 startups that again cover chemistry, biologicals and data science tools.

It also goes to market through seed multipliers, which are a step removed from us.

So I think today, we covered a number of ways, the breadth, the depth and the productivity of our pipeline and imply that gives us confidence in both our long-term growth targets as well as the strong role that we believe we play and address in the evolving landscape across agriculture within a sector that's changing at the moment. So with the unique vantage point that we have from our pipeline and the technology that we have in hand we had in hand than 9 to 14 genes stacks that we believe we'll define the future of agriculture, but Robb outlined today, we see ourselves in a position of strength in a dynamic industry. So, I guess, the bottom line for us is we continue to view this as a time of opportunity. We have a balance of innovation, which is kind of the heart of who we are in discipline can grow our long-term competitive position.

Also joining me from the IR team are Tim Boeker, Priyal Patel and Ashley Wissmann. 
Our first quarter call provides the initial insights into our fiscal year with the summary of our first quarter results, and importantly, our views into our outlook for the rest of the year. Additionally, as we always do in the first quarter, we will provide our annual R&D pipeline and product performance update. 
This call is being webcast and you can access the webcast, supporting slides and the replay at monsanto.com. 
We have provided you today with EPS and other measures on both a GAAP and ongoing business basis. Where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to GAAP in the slides and in the press release, both of which are on the website.  
This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may vary in a material way from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in the safe harbor language in our most recent 10-K and in today's press release. 
The forward-looking statements are current only as of the date of this call and the company disclaims any obligation to update them or the factors that may affect actual results.
First and foremost, let me review our first quarter results as shown on Slide 4. Our first quarter ongoing loss per share of $0.11 was better than expected on the basis of lower-than-expected operating expenses and better Intacta sales in Brazil. When compared to the prior year, currency accounted for approximately half of the decline in ongoing earnings per share. On an as-reported basis, our first quarter loss per share was $0.56, reflecting $0.46 for restructuring charges, consistent with our planned actions to reduce annual spend by $500 million by fiscal year '18. 
Finally, our free cash flow for the first quarter was more than $1 billion as compared to $969 million in the prior year, reflecting the reduction in inventory and modest growth in our prepays. 
With that brief summary, let me hand it to Hugh to provide the strategic outlook."

First of all, a special thanks to the 130 of you who joined us at our recent biannual investor event. We were pleased to share with you our long-term outlook, and importantly, an early preview into our outstanding pipeline and our product performance, which we'll build upon today. 
Consistent with that earlier event, I'd like to start the talk today with the topic of industry consolidation right at the beginning. First, we've had an incredible stand-alone growth plan backed by our commitment to innovation and the industry's broadest, deepest and most proven pipeline. Second, we expect industry consolidation to continue, and it should, given the opportunities for significant synergies and value creation in R&D across the industry. Third, we expect to continue to be the partner of choice across the industry whether it's through our broad licensing approach, through collaboration and partnerships or through strategic M&A. 
Yes, 2 of our largest competitors recently announced that they're combining, but they're also 2 of our largest technology licensees and we expect that to continue given the opportunities of our unparalleled pipeline. 
Finally, we'll continue with a disciplined approach to evaluating M&A opportunities as we seek a strong strategic fit and synergistic value. 
So with that, let's move to the update for the quarter and our annual R&D pipeline update, which is more relevant than ever given the macro trends in agriculture as shown on Slide 5. We see innovation in agriculture as being pivotal in addressing the 3 mega trends, namely: sustainable food security, climate change and industry consolidation, and we believe our innovation puts us in a unique position to lead in all of these areas. 
As we move to Slide 6, this is our third consecutive year of more than 20 advancements and our core pipeline is still expected to deliver up to $25 billion in peak net sales and this is before considering the upside value from our transformational new growth platforms. We continue to see significant growth from our core, spanning the spectrum of grower needs. This ranges from breeding enhancements to deliver yield to multi-generational projects in the categories of insect and weed control. Further, our new platforms in Climate and the BioAg Alliance are beginning to show meaningful progress in the relatively untapped category of plant health and fertility. Collectively, this progress drives our ability to deliver what we expect to be greater than 1.3 billion acres of technology upgrades by 2025, providing sustainable intensification on our existing 400-million acre footprint, as shown on Slide 7. 
Today, however, the headwinds from currency and commodity prices that we outlined at the start of this fiscal year have not yet abated, and in fact, currency has become a much stronger headwind with the recent events in Argentina. We're pleased to see the early decisive approach of the new President and we believe that his actions, particularly the lifting of export taxes in grain, will create longer-term benefits for agriculture from which we're well positioned to participate. However, the approximate 35% to 40% devaluation of the Argentine peso is expected to create an estimated $0.20 to $0.25 charge in Q2, and with that increased headwind, we now expect our fiscal year '16 ongoing EPS to trend to the lower half of our guidance range of $5.10 to $5.60, as shown on Slide 8. 
Despite this currency pressure, we still have a stronger outlook for cash generation and we continue to expect our free cash flow to be in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion. And we've continued our discipline spend management with plans now in place to deliver on $500 million of annual cost savings by fiscal year '18. 
Despite these near-term headwinds, we continue to confirm our long-term growth targets to deliver greater than 20% compounded annual growth and our ongoing earnings per share from the end of fiscal year '16 to fiscal year '19, as outlined in Slide 9. In that time frame, we expect demand transfer grain to continue and improve grower margins. We expect currency to remain relatively consistent with today's rates. And importantly, we expect our innovation to carry 80% of expected gross profit growth with continued industry-leading corn hybrid renewal and growth from the Intacta and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend blockbusters in soybeans. The breadth, depth and productivity of our pipeline gives us confidence in both our long-term growth targets as well as the strong role that we believe we will play in addressing the evolving landscape across agriculture. With the unique vantage point that we have from our pipeline and the technology on hand to create the 9 to 14 gene stacks by 2025, we expect to lead and define the integrated solutions for the industry. 
So with that introduction, let me hand over to Brett for the operational update."
528414,316175092,915898,"Monsanto Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 06, 2016",2016-01-06,"Earnings Calls","Monsanto Company","Executives","Thanks, Hugh, and good morning to everyone on the line. Delivery of our near-term and long-term targets that Hugh just shared with you hinges on our ability to deliver on our key operational priorities, namely: delivering $3.5 billion of expected gross pr",1090,"Thanks, Hugh, and good morning to everyone on the line. Delivery of our near-term and long-term targets that Hugh just shared with you hinges on our ability to deliver on our key operational priorities, namely: delivering $3.5 billion of expected gross profit growth from fiscal year '16 to fiscal year '19, upgrading the industry's largest seed technology platform to the Xtend technology, monetizing our new growth platforms and maintaining our financial discipline as outlined on Slide 10. 
Let's look at these priorities in more detail with an update on relevant key milestones from the first quarter and how those will inform the rest of fiscal year '16. First, let's take a look at our global corn seed franchise. With industry-leading share positions in almost every one of our major corn regions, as shown on Slide 11, we plan to drive our growth off of this leading footprint from a combination of continued share gains and annual price-mix lift gains in germplasm. Even in this challenging ag environment, we continue to target to hold or grow share in every major corn-growing region in fiscal year '16. And while it is still early days to estimate share gains, we are confident that we grew our corn brand share in the summer season in Brazil. And in the Northern Hemisphere, the dealer and grower order book volumes and prepays in the U.S. are tracking modestly ahead of the prior year despite the continued compressed commodity prices. 
Not only do we continue to pursue our plan to hold or grow share in every major corn-growing region in fiscal year '16, but we continue to target to deliver positive low single-digit price-mix lift in corn germplasm globally exclusive of currency impacts. In Brazil, we've been able to deliver germplasm price-mix lift of 10% exclusive of currency in the first quarter, which has allowed us to moderate a portion of the currency downsides, and we will continue to target to do so going forward. In the U.S. order book, after our pricing ladder adjustments, the year 1 to 3 hybrids make up 50% to 60% of the portfolio, consistent with the trends we outlined on Slide 12. The continuation of our industry-leading performance supports these targeted mix lift. However, our realized mix lift will ultimately be determined in the second and third quarters where we will be closely monitoring discounting in this environment of compressed grower margins. 
Moving beyond corn to soybeans, our second largest gross profit driver for fiscal year '19, we continue to see great uptake of our Intacta technology in South America. Our results came in better than forecasted in the first quarter in part due to Intacta sales and we remain confident in our target to penetrate 30 million acres across South America in just the third year of launch, as you can see on Slide 13. With its greater than 4-bushel average yield advantage and reduction in insecticide sprays, growers continue to demand Intacta technology in what we see as a 100-million acre opportunity in South America. And while Intacta has had the fastest penetration of any biotech trait to date, we expect Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans to top this level with greater than 3 million acres expected this year in its first year of commercial launch. Based on our U.S. reservation system, we feel confident in the demand for more than 3 million acres of the technology. 
We've also been progressing with our dicamba chemistry strategy and closed on multiple supplier agreements, as shown on Slide 14. These agreements are expected to provide us with adequate supply of dicamba in the early years following launch, and together with our pending self-manufacturing plans, are expected to provide a balanced approach to cost-effective dicamba supply. 
Not to be outdone, Bollgard II XtendFlex cotton is expected to penetrate 1.5 million acres this season in the U.S, double the more than 750,000 acres in fiscal year '15's limited commercial introduction. Not only do we expect this to create value from improved weed control, but we expect these new varieties to drive share in Deltapine seed, just as it did in fiscal year '15. 
Moving beyond our core businesses. We continue to progress with our plans for the coming U.S. season at Climate where we're working towards the closing of our most recent agreement with John Deere, which uniquely positions us with exclusive third-party near real-time connectivity and in-cab visualization of data. This agreement marks our third connectivity agreement with the major equipment dealers and is a great addition to our industry-leading retail network to the top 6 U.S. ag retailers. In addition, this agreement is accelerating both grower and retailer interest in the technology. This reach, combined with the capabilities of our advisers and the adoption we've secured to date, as shown on Slide 15, establishes Climate as the digital ag platform and we expect to continue that momentum in fiscal year '16 with expected penetration to 12 million paid acres and platform adoption to an expected 90 million acres, as shown on Slide 16. 
Our success, however, is based on more than gross profit growth drivers I have just outlined. It is also predicated on the continuation of discipline: discipline in how we manage our existing Ag Productivity business segment and discipline in how we execute our restructuring and cost-savings plans. On the Ag Productivity front, we saw the tough comparison we expected in the first quarter results with generic prices down significantly versus the prior year and very challenging comparisons on currencies, particularly in Brazil. We experienced year-over-year declines in pricing of more than 20% inclusive of currency. Overall, however, as shown on Slide 17, we still expect to sell roughly 300 million gallons for the full year as we expect to continue to manage our price premium closely and pick up the decline in volumes from Q1 in the latter half of the year. 
Moving to the topic of disciplined spend management. We now have restructuring plans and cost-savings initiatives in place that align to our target to deliver $500 million in annual savings by fiscal year '18. The actions we disclosed earlier today build from the foundation we outlined on Slide 18 to streamline the organization to create enduring and durable savings. We are focused on creating scale and efficiency while still delivering outstanding innovation and customer service through the creation of 4 commercial hubs, an R&D Center of Excellence and from fully leveraging data analytics. 
With that, let me pass it to Pierre for the financial update. Pierre?"

Before I go into the financial review and our business outlook for the year, let me start with the results from the first quarter, as shown on Slide 4. First, we delivered a loss of $0.11 per share",1056,"Thanks, Brett, and good morning to everyone on the line. Before I go into the financial review and our business outlook for the year, let me start with the results from the first quarter, as shown on Slide 4. First, we delivered a loss of $0.11 per share on an ongoing basis, which was better than our expected ongoing loss of $0.23 to $0.33. That improvement versus our expectation was driven by lower operating expenses and by better-than-expected results in Intacta in Brazil. Specifically, operating expenses, excluding restructuring charges, were 9% lower than the prior year mostly driven by currency. 
From a year-to-year perspective, currency, and particularly the Brazilian reais, accounted for approximately half of the decline in ongoing earnings per share. On a constant currency basis, the decrease in earnings per share versus the prior year was mostly due to the decline in Ag Productivity gross profit related to the anticipated glyphosate price declines and the impact of the timing of glyphosate deliveries. 
Seeds and Genomic gross profit was mostly impacted by the anticipated reduction in corn volumes arising from timing shifts and lower planted acres in the Southern Hemisphere. Offsetting some of those decline was the $125 million of gross profit growth in soybeans before the effect of currency, led by the strong performance of Intacta. 
Second, on an as-reported basis, we reported a loss of $0.56 per share, reflecting $210 million of after-tax restructuring charges in the quarter. We have now recorded approximately 70% of the expecting restructuring charges and this sets us on pace for the $500 million of annual cost savings we're expecting by fiscal year '18, as outlined on Slide 19. 
Third, from a cash flow perspective, we delivered more than $1 billion of free cash, representing a 6% increase versus the prior year. As expected, this reflects the cash benefit of the implementation of a disciplined corn seeds production plan that drove significant inventory reductions as well as modest growth in our prepays in the U.S. 
Moving to the outlook for the year. With the recent currency devaluation in Argentina, we now expect to trend to the lower half of our ongoing earnings per share guidance of $5.10 to $5.60 for the full year, as shown on Slide 20. We expect an approximate $0.20 to $0.25 net downside to our ongoing EPS in the second quarter related to the approximate 35% to 40% weakening of the Argentine peso versus the U.S. dollar. We are expecting to book a onetime significant charge in the second quarter related to our net balance sheet exposure and expect modest variability in the adjustment thereafter as we will mark to the currency evolution every month. 
Altogether, from a currency perspective, we are now expecting $0.60 to $0.70 of currency headwinds for the full year versus the prior expectation of $0.35 to $0.40 with the Argentine peso accounting for the majority of this increase. 
Despite some moderating in our outlook for currency and corn price-mix lift with the competitive pricing dynamics in this challenging kind of environment, we still see an opportunity for a 5% to 7% growth in Seeds and Genomics gross profit. We continue to expect this growth to come from the benefit of the $275 million or more in expected licensing agreements from corn, germplasm mix lift in the low single digit exclusive of currency, from targeted corn share gains and from the growth in our Intacta soybeans. This growth is expected to be partially offset by the expected cost of $70 million to $80 million associated with the Roundup Ready 2 Xtend launch and the $90 million to $100 million of incremental corn cost of goods coming from the smaller corn seed production plans. 
For Ag Productivity, we continue to expect gross profit to be in the range of $900 million to $1.1 billion as we expect to sell roughly 300 million gallons for the full year at prices expected to improve slightly as we move through the fiscal year. Based on the estimated savings from the additional restructuring actions, continued cost savings and currency benefits, we now expect operating expenses, exclusive of restructuring and environmental and litigation settlement expenses, to be flat versus fiscal year '15 inclusive of new platform spend. 
Other income and expense, considering the expected impact from the Argentine peso devaluation, is expected to be approximately $100 million to $120 million worse than the prior year on a full year basis. 
Beyond the operating profit drivers, the net effect of our ongoing $3 billion accelerated share repurchase including increased financing should generate a net annual EPS benefit of $0.24 to $0.27, unchanged from our prior guidance. We continue to expect the year to start to close and be trued up in the next 3 months, closing up another key step in the progress of our capital allocation strategy. 
From a capital allocation perspective, we remain committed to a balanced approach between share repurchases, dividends, capital investments and investments in technology, as shown on the Slide 21. This approach, combined with our commitment to a solid investment grade credit rating that allows access to commercial paper, should allow us to operate with strategic flexibility to invest in high-growth opportunities that support our strategy while giving us the latitude to execute on larger-scale opportunities as appropriate. Backing this strategy is our ability to convert earnings into strong cash generation. 
Overall, even as our earnings guidance moves to the lower half of our range, we still expect to generate $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion of free cash flow in fiscal year '16. We see the opportunity to grow this in future year absent the approximately $200 million to $250 million of after-tax restructuring charge costs we expect to incur in fiscal year '16. 
As I shared at our investor event, my focus is on return on innovation, financial discipline and balanced capital allocation, all of which support long-term growth and return of value to our share owners. Continuing to execute well on these pillars, along with delivering on the innovation in our pipeline, provides the gateway to the rapid future business growth necessary to deliver on our plan to grow our ongoing EPS by more than 20% annually from fiscal year '17 to fiscal year '19. 
Thanks. And I'll turn the time over to Robb for the annual pipeline update."

This is an exciting time for technology. The convergence of the advances in biology and data science are transforming agriculture, both expanding the breadth of what's possible today and accelerating the pace of innovation. 
On Slide 4, you can see the unparalleled diversity of platforms and the significant number of technologies that we draw upon both internally and externally to drive new innovations. And as excited as I am about what we do in our own world-class research organization, I'm really equally proud of the work we do through collaborations with academics, public and private sector partners and strategic M&A deals. Over the last few years, we've initiated venture capital investments in 20-plus organizations in key areas of agricultural productivity, digital agriculture and biologicals complementing our company's integrated systems approach to drive future growth, which brings me to a key point: innovation is delivering the growth engine that will take us well into the next decade. On the heels of 2 $1 billion-plus blockbuster product launches expected with Intacta and Xtend, this is a robust pipeline of multi-generational upgrades expected to deliver up to $25 billion in peak net sales in the core alone, as shown on Slides 5 through 7 with considerable upside potential from our new platforms. 
I'm particularly excited about our 30 advancements this year, which is the third consecutive year of greater than 20 pipeline advancements, as shown on Slide 8. And I think this progress showcases the breadth and depth of our integrated yield pipeline, which really fuels innovation for the industry. 
As we look at the agronomic focal points for a grower, yield is by far the biggest one and our pipeline value aligns with that targeting to deliver estimated peak net sales of up to $14.5 billion. 
Now breeding is clearly our cornerstone, and as you'll see on Slide 9, we're expanding our capability and advantage and further transforming our breeding program. The success of our breeding program has been built on 3 competitive advantages. We have the largest and most diverse germplasm library on the planet and as paired with the industry-best discovery technologies such as high-throughput screening, advanced markers and seed shipping. And finally, we have the largest global integrated testing network, which we leverage to identify, select and deploy the best-performing seeds globally. But now, using genome wide selection, we expect to create a step change in breeding, allowing us to significantly increase the size and rate of our germplasm screening. We expect to be able to analyze 10x more breeding crosses by the beginning of the next decade based essentially on DNA sequence knowledge and predictive analytics, which we expect will translate to a 30% increase in genetic gain, giving us even more horsepower to upgrade our global germplasm portfolio every year. 
So this competitive advantage in R&D is what feeds our biggest commercial advantage. On Slide 10, I'm pleased to share with you that for the 10th consecutive year, DEKALB corn has been delivering an average yield increase of 7 to 10 bushels advantage in the U.S. across a gamut of growing conditions, which really underscores the consistent performance advantage. Final harvest results for this year once again show a strong performance advantage of more than 7 bushels per acre versus the competition. 
And it doesn't stop there. On Slide 11, with our advances in molecular breeding, our class of 2017 is expected to deliver 6 to 10 bushels more than our best commercial hybrids today. 
Let's look at soybeans next on Slide 12. Roundup Ready 2 Yield, the established second-generation platform for herbicide tolerance, continues to deliver a ""greater than 4 bushel per acre"" average advantage as compared to the original Roundup Ready soybeans. And our new generation of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans provides superior weed control and has that same high yield as Roundup Ready 2 varieties. As we look to the future, the class of 2017 Roundup Ready 2 Xtend varieties shows increasing yield performance, which reflects the benefit of the improved mix of the latest genetics in the new platform and the accelerating use of molecular markers in soybeans. 
And finally, the panel on the right shows the greater than 70 varieties for this spring's expected launch of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans, showcasing the genetic breadth and product performance that sets up our biggest expected biotech seed launch. 
Moving to cotton. Our leading DeltaPine Land cotton varieties on Slide 13 demonstrate 70 pounds of lint-per-acre performance advantage for the sixth consecutive year, again underscoring consistent yield advantage and setting up the rapid adoption of Bollgard II XtendFlex. 
Continuing in the yield category is our work in Yield and Stress. We are streamlining our focus based on insights from the last decade. And through our joint research collaboration with BASF, we've been able to identify a series of key-enabling traits that we believe will lead to increased yield and I'd like to highlight 2 projects leveraging this trait-first approach, as shown on Slide 14, that is the next generation of higher-yielding corn and soy both in Phase 1. And in collaboration with BASF, our next-generation higher-yielding corn exhibits stronger roots and stalks, and in soy, the novel soybean yield trait demonstrated of plants with more pods in its first year of field testing. 
We're also highlighting 2 new breeding projects that are making significant breakthroughs in yield beyond our annual germplasm refresh. On Slide 15, our high-density corn systems are examples of how we're leveraging germplasm, which can perform at higher plant populations, and drive yield. With the potential to aggregate this with insights from our Climate Script Creator, we can help growers target precise seed placement to optimize yield. 
Let's move to weed control. 2016 represents the 20th anniversary of the Roundup Ready trait, a platform that has penetrated over 350 million acres, making it the largest trait platform in the world. With our Roundup Ready Xtend crop system shown on Slide 16, we are going to refresh that broad platform and we're progressing third- and fourth-generation weed control systems to provide additional modes of action and weed control well into the future. 
Complementarily linked to these systems is chemistry. We have 5 next-generation chemistries for weed control advancing in our crop protection pipeline shown in Slide 17, and these products target much needed improvements and solutions beyond what's possible in the market today. Xtendimax and the Roundup Ready Xtend contain our proprietary VaporGrip technology, which will offer superior season-long weed control with residual activity in new, easy-to-use, low-volatility dicamba formulations. We're also working on a premix of warrant herbicide and dicamba, which will combine the crop-safe encapsulated form of acetochlor with dicamba and this will make it easier to apply multiple modes of action in a single application to control both grass and broadleaf weeds making it, I think, a very effective component of our Roundup Ready Xtend system across soybean, corn and cotton and with a fit on up to 100 million acres at peak penetration. 
So these novel chemistry formulations, along with the robust pipeline of multigenerational herbicide trait upgrades that are coming behind Xtend, are expected to deliver up to $4.5 billion in peak net sales. 
Jumping even further into the future. We're developing the next-generation complex gene stacks that will become the future platforms. Our technology team has already discovered the stacked corn and soybean trait products that we expect to launch in 2025. On Slide 18, you can see that the future corn product is expected to have 14 traits: 4 unique belowground insect protection traits, 4 unique aboveground insect protection traits; 5 unique herbicide tolerance traits plus a novel Yield and Stress trait. 
And as you can see on the bottom of the slide, the story repeats. The future soybean stacks we have in hand are expected to give rise to a 9-gene stack in that same time frame. I think the point is, is that we know today which products are going to redefine the competitive standard in 2025. Our global regulatory track record, combined with our leading seed and licensing footprint, makes us a partner of choice in this industry. And we're currently working with several parties to codevelop the next-generation of weed control, pairing traits from new breakthrough chemistry modes of action, as shown on Slide 19. And by working in parallel to develop new weed control systems, these exciting collaborations and partnerships are expected to allow us to create next-generation products far more quickly. 
Insect control is another critical grower need where, like weed control, we have a pipeline of multigenerational upgrades of novel insect protection traits in progress and these are valued at up to $4 billion in net peak sales. 
As you look across the key crops on Slides 20 to 22, you can see that we have 4 products in Phase 4, and by the end of the decade, we expect to launch all of these products from SmartStax PRO across the Americas to the second generation of Intacta for South America and all of which target some of the most significant pests in agriculture. And this year, several of these are progressing in our pipeline including the fourth-generation corn rootworm, the fourth-generation aboveground insect protection in corn as well as the third-generation insect protection in soybeans. These products are expected to deliver new modes of action for increased durability and many offer broader spectrum of control. 
I'd like to highlight the work that we're doing with lygus. The Bollgard platform has revolutionized cotton protection around the world with its control of the bollworm and other caterpillar pests. I believe the lygus product will be an equivalent breakthrough product for controlling sucking and piercing insects such as lygus, thrips and leafhoppers, which have emerged as the major pests in cotton production. This technology will not only protect yield, but farmers today are spraying extensively to control these pests, which, combined with estimated losses, cost farmers nearly $200 million annually. 
Rounding out our core is our focus to deliver disease control solutions in an integrated system and these are estimated to deliver peak net sales of up to $3.5 billion. First in corn, on Slide 23, across the major diseases such as stalk rot, northern corn leaf blight and Goss’s Wilt, it's clear that our breeding techniques are providing growers with enhanced disease protection. To complement this, we're pleased to share the advancement of our Acceleron seed treatment, an enhanced fungicide offering, moving to Phase 4. This new chemical seed treatment in corn has averaged an impressive 3-bushels per acre yield increase versus the standard seed treatment and provides growers with early-season disease control and late-season stalk rot suppression. 
Our disease solutions expand beyond breeding and chemistry. And today, we're announcing that we have identified lead genes for transgenic broad-spectrum disease control. And layer on top of this, the disease insights provided by our Climate Field Health Advisor and we're developing an unparalleled integrated disease control system. 
Additionally, as shown on Slide 24, we continue to make progress in our vegetable business with conventional breeding techniques, this year advancing disease-resistant tomatoes and cucumbers. One of the most exciting new products in our pipeline is a novel molecule for nematode control shown on Slide 25. So nematodes are a persistent soil pest across all crops, resulting in about $1 billion in crop losses in U.S. soybeans alone and in excess of $10 billion in losses annually across all row crops across the globe. 
In its second year of expanded field testing, the NEMASTRIKE technology is showing outstanding field performance across several crops and we expect it will become a key component of our Acceleron seed treatment portfolio as well as attract licensing interest from third parties. 
And building on the success with NEMASTRIKE, as shown on Slide 26, we've expanded our crop chemical approach through a collaboration with Nimbus Therapeutics. Using their unique computationally driven approach, we've identified a novel fungicide chemistry currently in Phase 1 that is demonstrating increased yield protection in corn in the presence of Rhizoctonia and Fusarium disease versus both untreated and commercial standard checks. These projects, whether in breeding, biotechnology, crop protection or climate, demonstrate the breadth and depth of our systems approach to delivering disease control solutions. 
So now shifting to our new growth platforms, I'd like to begin with microbials on Slide 27 where, in collaboration with Novozymes, we're working to understand which microbes we can use to treat seeds to improve nutrient uptake, promote growth and provide insect control and disease protection. In the early phase work, microbial strains are advancing from discovery to Phase 1 for disease and insect control. And in the later stage, our enhanced-corn inoculant lead, as shown on Slide 28, is advancing from Phase 2 to Phase 4 and is planned for a 2017 U.S. launch. This enhanced formulation delivers critical seed stability and our 2015 yield data showed a greater than 4-bushel per acre average yield advantage. Ultimately, the interplay between this technology and our data science tools will allow us to position the right seed in the right field with the right microbial supplement to stimulate productivity and yield. 
The other platform within biologicals is our BioDirect platform shown on Slide 29 where we're developing new topically applied RNAi-based tools to target plant disease, insect and weed control as well as targets that enhance bee health. And first in bee health on Slide 30, the BioDirect technology is demonstrating significant improvement in beehive survival by targeting the varroa mite, a pest that feeds on the bee. With this efficacy, we've advanced this project to Phase 2. 
And in the BioDirect canola flea beetle project on Slide 31, it's advancing to Phase 1. Today, flea beetles cost about $300 million in damages in North America alone and this technology would provide growers with an alternative solution to the neonics currently used to control flea beetles. 
So with the significant strides we've made in BioDirect manufacturing, we see tangible solutions coming to market to help growers. 
Let's shift to our digital ag platform shown on Slide 32. In just 2 years after acquisition, we have a fully populated pipeline supporting our digital ag platform. First, let's look at the exciting field results for our Nitrogen Advisor. Nutrients are one of agriculture's most significant inputs with a global market of more than $180 billion. This year, our Nitrogen Advisor was on millions of acres, as you can easily on Slide 33, and we saw phenomenal results across a sample of more than 3,800 fields. Over 10% of those fields showed a nitrogen shortfall, which resulted in significant yield loss. And more than 40% of the field had excess nitrogen. When you add it all up, it exceeds $10 per acre of value on average, and across the U.S. market, that's $1 billion opportunity. Now we're developing models to optimize within a field where there's significant variation of nitrogen levels at any given time. And in fact, we're advancing our subfield nitrogen tool, which will be field tested during the 2016
season.
And finally, as we develop models for our other crops, like wheat and canola, we'll start to unlock more of that multibillion dollar opportunity. 
Moving to Slide 34. Other highlights for the platform are our foundational connectivity, data capture and visualization tools, where we're seeing real commercial progress in a rapidly evolving pipeline. Just a few weeks ago, we launched our Climate FieldView Drive, which enables seamless connectivity while passing through the field. Our recent agreement with John Deere enables near real-time connectivity through their wireless data server. And so at the end of the day, regardless of the brand of their equipment, growers will have access to seamless data transfer to the cloud, unlocking our unique ability to deliver actionable insight to millions of acres. 
I'd like to wrap up by summarizing a few key points on Slide 35. First, we have never had a sense of complacency about our R&D leadership. And now, once again, we're transforming our efforts. And the efforts we're making now to change breeding are raising the bar dramatically on what it will take to compete in this industry in the future. In the area of biotechnology, we're putting in place, literally, today the future 14-gene stack products for corn and the 9-gene stack for soybean that we believe will create an incredible competitive advantage and unique value to our growers. We have novel new next-generation seed treatments, fungicides, herbicides and biologicals progressing in our crop protection portfolio. And with the progress we're seeing in our new platforms, there's been a translation from concept to reality that's played out in just 2 short seasons. Importantly, we're integrating these technologies starting at the research level, just like we've been doing in our core breeding and biotech platforms for years. 
Second point, all of this innovation, not only makes for an incredibly exciting time for technology, but it plays a role, I think, of significant importance in addressing the key global macro trends that you discussed. The innovations we deliver will create more yield to meet the increasing global demand for grains in a more sustainable, targeted and precise manner. 
And finally, I think what's clear is our unique breeding and biotech engine has been transformative to the crop protection industry. Today, the growing depth of our pipeline, along with our new digital ag and biologicals platforms, gives us a unique view on how the crop protection landscape will continue to evolve going forward and places us in a position of strength in a dynamic industry. 
So thanks for your time today. I'll turn it back over to Laura for the Q&A."

And frankly, as the industry goes through challenges, I think that opportunity becomes even greater. Growers are looking for help. A lot has changed in the industry since last spring.

The operating environment has become tougher as well and I think because of that, there's a greater need now than there was last spring to be able to quantify what that opportunity would look like and quantify the -- what that integrated platform would look like.

It also goes to market through seed multipliers, which are a step removed from us.

I -- as you look at Roundup and you're right, we did say that we would expect it through the latter half of the year that we would see some improvement in price. We haven't seen that start to occur yet. It's been more flattish, which really leads to the wider range that we've given around our Ag Productivity business this year. If you assume price is kind of float around where they are today, then we were at the low end of that range and if they do get some lift throughout the rest of the year, we would see a float to the higher end of that range, but that's what drives the breadth of that range. I think a couple of things to keep in mind is China prices clearly an impact on what the price is, but also what kind of margin opportunity the generics participate in. So we watch the generic price in the marketplace. That's what our farmers are looking at. We don't price based on what's going on in China. We price based on the generics in the market, and we have not seen them start to lift those prices. But in most of the world, we feel like we're in a pretty good place right now with some hope that the price will continue or will lift towards the latter half of the year."

They commute, so they're not triggered by a change of control and that allows consistency regardless of what companies do and then how the genealogy plays out, and I expect that, that will continue. The name of the game thus for us going forward, and it is coincidental with Robb's presentation today. Companies win when they deliver innovation.

When you look at places like Eastern Europe where you have improving genetics replacing really old genetics from before, not a stronger competition. We can get pretty healthy gains there, and we have over the past 5 years, and that's leapfrogged us into the #1 position over there. Then, of course, in Argentina, as an example, we have a really, really strong position in Argentina. And it's -- we never give up on our opportunity to grow, but I'm thrilled every year that we hold that position down there because it's a really strong position. And then in Brazil, we find ourselves in a unique situation right now, where our competitor is challenged with a trade offering in the marketplace and, quite frankly, we're getting an opportunity to grow there. So we're taking advantage of that and growing our footprint, and that's the part of the confidence we have in the summer season that we had improvement this year. So each market is going to be a little bit different, but we feel good about our position."

So with the unique vantage point that we have from our pipeline and the technology that we have in hand to create the 9 to 14-gene stacks that we believe will define the future of agriculture, that Robb outlined today, we see ourselves in a position of strength in a dynamic industry. So, I guess, the bottom line for us is we continue to view this as a time of opportunity. We have a balance of innovation, which is kind of the heart of who we are, and discipline can grow a long-term competitive position.

Also joining me from the IR team are Tim Boeker, Priyal Patel and Ashley Wissmann. 
Our first quarter call provides the initial insights into our fiscal year with the summary of our first quarter results, and importantly, our views into our outlook for the rest of the year. Additionally, as we always do in the first quarter, we will provide our annual R&D pipeline and product performance update. 
This call is being webcast and you can access the webcast, supporting slides and the replay at monsanto.com. 
We have provided you today with EPS and other measures on both a GAAP and ongoing business basis. Where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to GAAP in the slides and in the press release, both of which are on the website.  
This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may vary in a material way from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in the safe harbor language in our most recent 10-K and in today's press release. 
The forward-looking statements are current only as of the date of this call and the company disclaims any obligation to update them or the factors that may affect actual results.
First and foremost, let me review our first quarter results as shown on Slide 4. Our first quarter ongoing loss per share of $0.11 was better than expected on the basis of lower-than-expected operating expenses and better Intacta sales in Brazil. When compared to the prior year, currency accounted for approximately half of the decline in ongoing earnings per share. On an as-reported basis, our first quarter loss per share was $0.56, reflecting $0.46 for restructuring charges, consistent with our planned actions to reduce annual spend by $500 million by fiscal year '18. 
Finally, our free cash flow for the first quarter was more than $1 billion as compared to $969 million in the prior year, reflecting the reduction in inventory and modest growth in our prepays. 
With that brief summary, let me hand it to Hugh to provide the strategic outlook."

First of all, a special thanks to the 130 of you who joined us at our recent biannual investor event. We were pleased to share with you our long-term outlook, and importantly, an early preview into our outstanding pipeline and our product performance, which we'll build upon today. 
Consistent with that earlier event, I'd like to start the talk today with the topic of industry consolidation right at the beginning. First, we've an incredible stand-alone growth plan backed by our commitment to innovation and the industry's broadest, deepest and most proven pipeline. Second, we expect industry consolidation to continue, and it should, given the opportunities for significant synergies and value creation in R&D across the industry. Third, we expect to continue to be the partner of choice across the industry whether it's through our broad licensing approach, through collaboration and partnerships or through strategic M&A. 
Yes, 2 of our largest competitors recently announced that they're combining, but they're also 2 of our largest technology licensees and we expect that to continue given the opportunities of our unparalleled pipeline. 
Finally, we'll continue with a disciplined approach to evaluating M&A opportunities as we seek a strong strategic fit and synergistic value. 
So with that, let's move to the update for the quarter and our annual R&D pipeline update, which is more relevant than ever given the macro trends in agriculture as shown on Slide 5. We see innovation in agriculture as being pivotal in addressing the 3 mega trends, namely: sustainable food security, climate change and industry consolidation, and we believe our innovation puts us in a unique position to lead in all of these areas. 
As we move to Slide 6, this is our third consecutive year of more than 20 advancements and our core pipeline is still expected to deliver up to $25 billion in peak net sales and this is before considering the upside value from our transformational new growth platforms. We continue to see significant growth from our core, spanning the spectrum of grower needs. This ranges from breeding enhancements to deliver yield to multi-generational projects in the categories of insect and weed control. Further, our new platforms in Climate and the BioAg Alliance are beginning to show meaningful progress in the relatively untapped category of plant health and fertility. Collectively, this progress drives our ability to deliver what we expect to be greater than 1.3 billion acres of technology upgrades by 2025, providing sustainable intensification on our existing 400-million acre footprint, as shown on Slide 7. 
Today, however, the headwinds from currency and commodity prices that we outlined at the start of this fiscal year have not yet abated, and in fact, currency has become a much stronger headwind with the recent events in Argentina. We're pleased to see the early decisive approach of the new President and we believe that his actions, particularly the lifting of export taxes in grain, will create longer-term benefits for agriculture for which we're well positioned to participate. However, the approximate 35% to 40% devaluation of the Argentine peso is expected to create an estimated $0.20 to $0.25 charge in Q2, and with that increased headwind, we now expect our fiscal year '16 ongoing EPS to trend to the lower half of our guidance range of $5.10 to $5.60, as shown on Slide 8. 
Despite this currency pressure, we still have a stronger outlook for cash generation and we continue to expect our free cash flow to be in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion. And we've continued our discipline spend management with plans now in place to deliver on $500 million of annual cost savings by fiscal year '18. 
Despite these near-term headwinds, we continue to confirm our long-term growth targets to deliver greater than 20% compounded annual growth and our ongoing earnings per share from the end of fiscal year '16 to fiscal year '19, as outlined in Slide 9. In that time frame, we expect demand transfer grain to continue and improve grower margins. We expect currency to remain relatively consistent with today's rates. And importantly, we expect our innovation to carry 80% of expected gross profit growth with continued industry-leading corn hybrid renewal and growth from the Intacta and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend blockbusters in soybeans. The breadth, depth and productivity of our pipeline gives us confidence in both our long-term growth targets as well as the strong role that we believe we will play in addressing the evolving landscape across agriculture. With the unique vantage point that we have from our pipeline and the technology on hand to create the 9 to 14 gene stacks by 2025, we expect to lead and define the integrated solutions for the industry. 
So with that introduction, let me hand over to Brett for the operational update."
528414,316175092,916033,"Monsanto Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 06, 2016",2016-01-06,"Earnings Calls","Monsanto Company","Executives","Thanks, Hugh, and good morning to everyone on the line. Delivery of our near-term and long-term targets that Hugh just shared with you hinges on our ability to deliver on our key operational priorities, namely: delivering $3.5 billion of expected gross pr",1090,"Thanks, Hugh, and good morning to everyone on the line. Delivery of our near-term and long-term targets that Hugh just shared with you hinges on our ability to deliver on our key operational priorities, namely: delivering $3.5 billion of expected gross profit growth from fiscal year '16 to fiscal year '19, upgrading the industry's largest seed technology platform to the Xtend technology, monetizing our new growth platforms and maintaining our financial discipline as outlined on Slide 10. 
Let's look at these priorities in more detail with an update on relevant key milestones from the first quarter and how those will inform the rest of fiscal year '16. First, let's take a look at our global corn seed franchise. With industry-leading share positions in almost every one of our major corn regions, as shown on Slide 11, we plan to drive our growth off of this leading footprint from a combination of continued share gains and annual price-mix lift gains in germplasm. Even in this challenging ag environment, we continue to target to hold or grow share in every major corn-growing region in fiscal year '16. And while it is still early days to estimate share gains, we are confident that we grew our corn brand share in the summer season in Brazil. And in the Northern Hemisphere, the dealer and grower order book volumes and prepays in the U.S. are tracking modestly ahead of the prior year despite the continued compressed commodity prices. 
Not only do we continue to pursue our plan to hold or grow share in every major corn-growing region in fiscal year '16, but we continue to target to deliver positive low single-digit price-mix lift in corn germplasm globally exclusive of currency impacts. In Brazil, we've been able to deliver germplasm price-mix lift of 10% exclusive of currency in the first quarter, which has allowed us to moderate a portion of the currency downsides, and we will continue to target to do so going forward. In the U.S. order book, after our pricing ladder adjustments, the year 1 to 3 hybrids make up 50% to 60% of the portfolio, consistent with the trends we outlined on Slide 12. The continuation of our industry-leading performance supports this targeted mix lift. However, our realized mix lift will ultimately be determined in the second and third quarters where we will be closely monitoring discounting in this environment of compressed grower margins. 
Moving beyond corn to soybeans, our second largest gross profit driver for fiscal year '19, we continue to see great uptake of our Intacta technology in South America. Our results came in better than forecasted in the first quarter in part due to Intacta sales and we remain confident in our target to penetrate 30 million acres across South America in just the third year of launch, as you can see on Slide 13. With its greater than 4-bushel average yield advantage and reduction in insecticide sprays, growers continue to demand Intacta technology in what we see as a 100-million acre opportunity in South America. And while Intacta has had the fastest penetration of any biotech trait to date, we expect Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans to top this level with greater than 3 million acres expected this year in its first year of commercial launch. Based on our U.S. reservation system, we feel confident in the demand for more than 3 million acres of the technology. 
We've also been progressing with our dicamba chemistry strategy and closed on multiple supply agreements, as shown on Slide 14. These agreements are expected to provide us with adequate supply of dicamba in the early years following launch, and together with our pending self-manufacturing plans, are expected to provide a balanced approach to cost-effective dicamba supply. 
Not to be outdone, Bollgard II XtendFlex cotton is expected to penetrate 1.5 million acres this season in the U.S., double the more than 750,000 acres in fiscal year '15's limited commercial introduction. Not only do we expect this to create value from improved weed control, but we expect these new varieties to drive share in Deltapine seed, just as it did in fiscal year '15. 
Moving beyond our core businesses. We continue to progress with our plans for the coming U.S. season at Climate where we're working towards the closing of our most recent agreement with John Deere, which uniquely positions us with exclusive third-party near real-time connectivity and in-cab visualization of data. This agreement marks our third connectivity agreement with the major equipment dealers and is a great addition to our industry-leading retail network to the top 6 U.S. ag retailers. In addition, this agreement is accelerating both grower and retailer interest in the technology. This reach, combined with the capabilities of our advisers and the adoption we've secured to date, as shown on Slide 15, establishes Climate as the digital ag platform and we expect to continue that momentum in fiscal year '16 with expected penetration to 12 million paid acres and platform adoption to an expected 90 million acres, as shown on Slide 16. 
Our success, however, is based on more than gross profit growth drivers I have just outlined. It is also predicated on the continuation of discipline: discipline in how we manage our existing Ag Productivity business segment and discipline in how we execute our restructuring and cost-savings plans. On the Ag Productivity front, we saw the tough comparison we expected in the first quarter results with generic prices down significantly versus the prior year and very challenging comparisons on currencies, particularly in Brazil. We experienced year-over-year declines in pricing of more than 20% inclusive of currency. Overall, however, as shown on Slide 17, we still expect to sell roughly 300 million gallons for the full year as we expect to continue to manage our price premium closely and pick up the decline in volumes from Q1 in the latter half of the year. 
Moving to the topic of disciplined spend management. We now have restructuring plans and cost-savings initiatives in place that align to our target to deliver $500 million in annual savings by fiscal year '18. The actions we disclosed earlier today build from the foundation we outlined on Slide 18 to streamline the organization to create enduring and durable savings. We are focused on creating scale and efficiency while still delivering outstanding innovation and customer service through the creation of 4 commercial hubs, an R&D Center of Excellence and from fully leveraging data analytics. 
With that, let me pass it to Pierre for the financial update. Pierre?"

Before I go into the financial review and our business outlook for the year, let me start with the results from the first quarter, as shown on Slide 4. First, we delivered a loss of $0.11 per share",1055,"Thanks, Brett, and good morning to everyone on the line. Before I go into the financial review and our business outlook for the year, let me start with the results from the first quarter, as shown on Slide 4. First, we delivered a loss of $0.11 per share on an ongoing basis, which was better than our expected ongoing loss of $0.23 to $0.33. That improvement versus our expectation was driven by lower operating expenses and by better-than-expected results in Intacta in Brazil. Specifically, operating expenses, excluding restructuring charges, were 9% lower than the prior year mostly driven by currency. 
From a year-to-year perspective, currency, and particularly the Brazilian reais, accounted for approximately half of the decline in ongoing earnings per share. On a constant currency basis, the decrease in earnings per share versus the prior year was mostly due to the decline in Ag Productivity gross profit related to the anticipated glyphosate price declines and the impact of the timing of glyphosate deliveries. 
Seeds and Genomic gross profit was mostly impacted by the anticipated reduction in corn volumes arising from timing shifts and lower planted acres in the Southern Hemisphere. Offsetting some of the decline was the $125 million of gross profit growth in soybeans before the effect of currency, led by the strong performance of Intacta. 
Second, on an as-reported basis, we reported a loss of $0.56 per share, reflecting $210 million of after-tax restructuring charges in the quarter. We have now recorded approximately 70% of the expecting restructuring charges and this sets us on pace for the $500 million of annual cost savings we're expecting by fiscal year '18, as outlined on Slide 19. 
Third, from a cash flow perspective, we delivered more than $1 billion of free cash, representing a 6% increase versus the prior year. As expected, this reflects the cash benefit of the implementation of a disciplined corn seeds production plan that drove significant inventory reductions as well as modest growth in our prepays in the U.S. 
Moving to the outlook for the year. With the recent currency devaluation in Argentina, we now expect to trend to the lower half of our ongoing earnings per share guidance of $5.10 to $5.60 for the full year, as shown on Slide 20. We expect an approximate $0.20 to $0.25 net downside to our ongoing EPS in the second quarter related to the approximate 35% to 40% weakening of the Argentine peso versus the U.S. dollar. We are expecting to book a onetime significant charge in the second quarter related to our net balance sheet exposure and expect modest variability in the adjustment thereafter as we will mark to the currency evolution every month. 
Altogether, from a currency perspective, we are now expecting $0.60 to $0.70 of currency headwinds for the full year versus the prior expectation of $0.35 to $0.40 with the Argentine peso accounting for the majority of this increase. 
Despite some moderating in our outlook for currency and corn price-mix lift with the competitive pricing dynamics in this challenging kind of environment, we still see an opportunity for a 5% to 7% growth in Seeds and Genomics gross profit. We continue to expect this growth to come from the benefit of the $275 million or more in expected licensing agreements from corn, germplasm mix lift in the low single digit exclusive of currency, from targeted corn share gains and from the growth in our Intacta soybeans. This growth is expected to be partially offset by the expected cost of $70 million to $80 million associated with the Roundup Ready 2 Xtend launch and the $90 million to $100 million of incremental corn cost of goods coming from the smaller corn seed production plans. 
For Ag Productivity, we continue to expect gross profit to be in the range of $900 million to $1.1 billion as we expect to sell roughly 300 million gallons for the full year at prices expected to improve slightly as we move through the fiscal year. Based on the estimated savings from the additional restructuring actions, continued cost savings and currency benefits, we now expect operating expenses, exclusive of restructuring and environmental and litigation settlement expenses, to be flat versus fiscal year '15 inclusive of new platform spend. 
Other income and expense, considering the expected impact from the Argentine peso devaluation, is expected to be approximately $100 million to $120 million worse than the prior year on a full year basis. 
Beyond the operating profit drivers, the net effect of our ongoing $3 billion accelerated share repurchase including increased financing should generate a net annual EPS benefit of $0.24 to $0.27, unchanged from our prior guidance. We continue to expect the year to start to close and be trued up in the next 3 months, closing up another key step in the progress of our capital allocation strategy. 
From a capital allocation perspective, we remain committed to a balanced approach between share repurchases, dividends, capital investments and investments in technology, as shown on Slide 21. This approach, combined with our commitment to a solid investment grade credit rating that allows access to commercial paper, should allow us to operate with strategic flexibility to invest in high-growth opportunities that support our strategy while giving us the latitude to execute on larger-scale opportunities as appropriate. Backing this strategy is our ability to convert earnings into strong cash generation. 
Overall, even as our earnings guidance moves to the lower half of our range, we still expect to generate $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion of free cash flow in fiscal year '16. We see the opportunity to grow this in future year absent the approximately $200 million to $250 million of after-tax restructuring charge costs we expect to incur in fiscal year '16. 
As I shared at our investor event, my focus is on return on innovation, financial discipline and balanced capital allocation, all of which support long-term growth and return of value to our share owners. Continuing to execute well on these pillars, along with delivering on the innovation in our pipeline, provides the gateway to the rapid future business growth necessary to deliver on our plan to grow our ongoing EPS by more than 20% annually from fiscal year '17 to fiscal year '19. 
Thanks. And I'll turn the time over to Robb for the annual pipeline update."

This is an exciting time for technology. The convergence of the advances in biology and data science are transforming agriculture, both expanding the breadth of what's possible today and accelerating the pace of innovation. 
On Slide 4, you can see the unparalleled diversity of platforms and the significant number of technologies that we draw upon both internally and externally to drive new innovations. And as excited as I am about what we do in our own world-class research organization, I'm really equally proud of the work we do through collaborations with academics, public and private sector partners and strategic M&A deals. Over the last few years, we've initiated venture capital investments in 20-plus organizations in key areas of agricultural productivity, digital agriculture and biologicals complementing our company's integrated systems approach to drive future growth, which brings me to a key point: innovation is delivering the growth engine that will take us well into the next decade. On the heels of 2 $1 billion-plus blockbuster product launches expected with Intacta and Xtend, this is a robust pipeline of multi-generational upgrades expected to deliver up to $25 billion in peak net sales in the core alone, as shown on Slides 5 through 7 with considerable upside potential from our new platforms. 
I'm particularly excited about our 30 advancements this year, which is the third consecutive year of greater than 20 pipeline advancements, as shown on Slide 8. And I think this progress showcases the breadth and depth of our integrated yield pipeline, which really fuels innovation for the industry. 
As we look at the agronomic focal points for a grower, yield is by far the biggest one and our pipeline value aligns with that targeting to deliver estimated peak net sales of up to $14.5 billion. 
Now breeding is clearly our cornerstone, and as you'll see on Slide 9, we're expanding our capability and advantage and further transforming our breeding program. The success of our breeding program has been built on 3 competitive advantages. We have the largest and most diverse germplasm library on the planet and as paired with the industry-best discovery technologies such as high-throughput screening, advanced markers and seed shipping. And finally, we have the largest global integrated testing network, which we leverage to identify, select and deploy the best-performing seeds globally. But now, using genome wide selection, we expect to create a step change in breeding, allowing us to significantly increase the size and rate of our germplasm screening. We expect to be able to analyze 10 times more breeding crosses by the beginning of the next decade based essentially on DNA sequence knowledge and predictive analytics, which we expect will translate to a 30% increase in genetic gain, giving us even more horsepower to upgrade our global germplasm portfolio every year. 
So this competitive advantage in R&D is what feeds our biggest commercial advantage. On Slide 10, I'm pleased to share with you that for the 10th consecutive year, DEKALB corn has been delivering an average yield increase of 7 to 10 bushels advantage in the U.S. across a gamut of growing conditions, which really underscores the consistent performance advantage. Final harvest results for this year once again show a strong performance advantage of more than 7 bushels per acre versus the competition. 
And it doesn't stop there. On Slide 11, with our advances in molecular breeding, our class of 2017 is expected to deliver 6 to 10 bushels more than our best commercial hybrids today. 
Let's look at soybeans next on Slide 12. Roundup Ready 2 Yield, the established second-generation platform for herbicide tolerance, continues to deliver a ""greater than 4 bushel per acre"" average advantage as compared to the original Roundup Ready soybeans. And our new generation of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans provides superior weed control and has that same high yield as Roundup Ready 2 varieties. As we look to the future, the class of 2017 Roundup Ready 2 Xtend varieties shows increasing yield performance, which reflects the benefit of the improved mix of the latest genetics in the new platform and the accelerating use of molecular markers in soybeans. 
And finally, the panel on the right shows the greater than 70 varieties for this spring's expected launch of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans, showcasing the genetic breadth and product performance that sets up our biggest expected biotech seed launch. 
Moving to cotton. Our leading DeltaPine Land cotton varieties on Slide 13 demonstrate 70 pounds of lint-per-acre performance advantage for the sixth consecutive year, again underscoring consistent yield advantage and setting up the rapid adoption of Bollgard II XtendFlex. 
Continuing in the yield category is our work in Yield and Stress. We are streamlining our focus based on insights from the last decade. And through our joint research collaboration with BASF, we've been able to identify a series of key-enabling traits that we believe will lead to increased yield and I'd like to highlight 2 projects leveraging this trait-first approach, as shown on Slide 14, that is the next generation of higher-yielding corn and soy both in Phase 1. And in collaboration with BASF, our next-generation higher-yielding corn exhibits stronger roots and stalks, and in soy, the novel soybean yield trait demonstrated plants with more pods in its first year of field testing. 
We're also highlighting 2 new breeding projects that are making significant breakthroughs in yield beyond our annual germplasm refresh. On Slide 15, our high-density corn systems are examples of how we're leveraging germplasm, which can perform at higher plant populations, and drive yield. With the potential to aggregate this with insights from our Climate Script Creator, we can help growers target precise seed placement to optimize yield. 
Let's move to weed control. 2016 represents the 20th anniversary of the Roundup Ready trait, a platform that has penetrated over 350 million acres, making it the largest trait platform in the world. With our Roundup Ready Xtend crop system shown on Slide 16, we are going to refresh that broad platform and we're progressing third- and fourth-generation weed control systems to provide additional modes of action and weed control well into the future. 
Complementarily linked to these systems is chemistry. We have 5 next-generation chemistries for weed control advancing in our crop protection pipeline shown in Slide 17, and these products target much needed improvements and solutions beyond what's possible in the market today. Xtendimax and Roundup Ready Xtend contain our proprietary VaporGrip technology, which will offer superior season-long weed control with residual activity in new, easy-to-use, low-volatility dicamba formulations. We're also working on a premix of warrant herbicide and dicamba, which will combine the crop-safe encapsulated form of acetochlor with dicamba and this will make it easier to apply multiple modes of action in a single application to control both grass and broadleaf weeds making it, I think, a very effective component of our Roundup Ready Xtend system across soybean, corn and cotton and with a fit on up to 100 million acres at peak penetration. 
So these novel chemistry formulations, along with the robust pipeline of multigenerational herbicide trait upgrades that are coming behind Xtend, are expected to deliver up to $4.5 billion in peak net sales. 
Jumping even further into the future. We're developing the next-generation complex gene stacks that will become the future platforms. Our technology team has already discovered the stacked corn and soybean trait products that we expect to launch in 2025. On Slide 18, you can see that the future corn product is expected to have 14 traits: 4 unique belowground insect protection traits, 4 unique aboveground insect protection traits; 5 unique herbicide tolerance traits plus a novel Yield and Stress trait. 
And as you can see on the bottom of the slide, the story repeats. The future soybean stacks we have in hand are expected to give rise to a 9-gene stack in that same time frame. I think the point is, is that we know today which products are going to redefine the competitive standard in 2025. Our global regulatory track record, combined with our leading seed and licensing footprint, makes us a partner of choice in this industry. And we're currently working with several parties to codevelop the next-generation of weed control, pairing traits from new breakthrough chemistry modes of action, as shown on Slide 19. And by working in parallel to develop new weed control systems, these exciting collaborations and partnerships are expected to allow us to create next-generation products far more quickly. 
Insect control is another critical grower need where, like weed control, we have a pipeline of multigenerational upgrades of novel insect protection traits in progress and these are valued at up to $4 billion in net peak sales. 
As you look across the key crops on Slides 20 to 22, you can see that we have 4 products in Phase 4, and by the end of the decade, we expect to launch all of these products from SmartStax PRO across the Americas to the second generation of Intacta for South America and all of which target some of the most significant pests in agriculture. And this year, several of these are progressing in our pipeline including the fourth-generation corn rootworm, the fourth-generation aboveground insect protection in corn as well as the third-generation insect protection in soybeans. These products are expected to deliver new modes of action for increased durability and many offer broader spectrum of control. 
I'd like to highlight the work that we're doing with lygus. The Bollgard platform has revolutionized cotton protection around the world with its control of the bollworm and other caterpillar pests. I believe the lygus product will be an equivalent breakthrough product for controlling sucking and piercing insects such as lygus, thrips and leafhoppers, which have emerged as the major pests in cotton production. This technology will not only protect yield, but farmers today are spraying extensively to control these pests, which, combined with estimated losses, cost farmers nearly $200 million annually. 
Rounding out our core is our focus to deliver disease control solutions in an integrated system and these are estimated to deliver peak net sales of up to $3.5 billion. First in corn, on Slide 23, across the major diseases such as stalk rot, northern corn leaf blight and Goss’s Wilt, it's clear that our breeding techniques are providing growers with enhanced disease protection. To complement this, we're pleased to share the advancement of our Acceleron seed treatment, an enhanced fungicide offering, moving to Phase 4. This new chemical seed treatment in corn has averaged an impressive 3-bushels per acre yield increase versus the standard seed treatment and provides growers with early-season disease control and late-season stalk rot suppression. 
Our disease solutions expand beyond breeding and chemistry. And today, we're announcing that we have identified lead genes for transgenic broad-spectrum disease control. And layer on top of this, the disease insights provided by our Climate Field Health Advisor and we're developing an unparalleled integrated disease control system. 
Additionally, as shown on Slide 24, we continue to make progress in our vegetable business with conventional breeding techniques, this year advancing disease-resistant tomatoes and cucumbers. One of the most exciting new products in our pipeline is a novel molecule for nematode control shown on Slide 25. So nematodes are a persistent soil pest across all crops, resulting in about $1 billion in crop losses in U.S. soybeans alone and in excess of $10 billion in losses annually across all row crops across the globe. 
In its second year of expanded field testing, the NEMASTRIKE technology is showing outstanding field performance across several crops and we expect it will become a key component of our Acceleron seed treatment portfolio as well as attract licensing interest from third parties. 
And building on the success with NEMASTRIKE, as shown on Slide 26, we've expanded our crop chemical approach through a collaboration with Nimbus Therapeutics. Using their unique computationally driven approach, we've identified a novel fungicide chemistry currently in Phase 1 that is demonstrating increased yield protection in corn in the presence of Rhizoctonia and Fusarium disease versus both untreated and commercial standard checks. These projects, whether in breeding, biotechnology, crop protection or climate, demonstrate the breadth and depth of our systems approach to delivering disease control solutions. 
So now shifting to our new growth platforms, I'd like to begin with microbials on Slide 27 where, in collaboration with Novozymes, we're working to understand which microbes we can use to treat seeds to improve nutrient uptake, promote growth and provide insect control and disease protection. In the early phase work, microbial strains are advancing from discovery to Phase 1 for disease and insect control. And in the later stage, our enhanced-corn inoculant lead, as shown on Slide 28, is advancing from Phase 2 to Phase 4 and is planned for a 2017 U.S. launch. This enhanced formulation delivers critical seed stability and our 2015 yield data showed a greater than 4-bushel per acre average yield advantage. Ultimately, the interplay between this technology and our data science tools will allow us to position the right seed in the right field with the right microbial supplement to stimulate productivity and yield. 
The other platform within biologicals is our BioDirect platform shown on Slide 29 where we're developing new topically applied RNAi-based tools to target plant disease, insect and weed control as well as targets that enhance bee health. And first in bee health on Slide 30, the BioDirect technology is demonstrating significant improvement in beehive survival by targeting the varroa mite, a pest that feeds on the bee. With this efficacy, we've advanced this project to Phase 2. 
And in the BioDirect canola flea beetle project on Slide 31, it's advancing to Phase 1. Today, flea beetles cause about $300 million in damages in North America alone and this technology would provide growers with an alternative solution to the neonics currently used to control flea beetles. 
So with the significant strides we've made in BioDirect manufacturing, we see tangible solutions coming to market to help growers. 
Let's shift to our digital ag platform shown on Slide 32. In just 2 years after acquisition, we have a fully populated pipeline supporting our digital ag platform. First, let's look at the exciting field results for our Nitrogen Advisor. Nutrients are one of agriculture's most significant inputs with a global market of more than $180 billion. This year, our Nitrogen Advisor was on millions of acres, as you can see on Slide 33, and we saw phenomenal results across a sample of more than 3,800 fields. Over 10% of those fields showed a nitrogen shortfall, which resulted in significant yield loss. And more than 40% of the field had excess nitrogen. When you add it all up, it exceeds $10 per acre of value on average, and across the U.S. market, that's $1 billion opportunity. Now we're developing models to optimize within a field where there's significant variation of nitrogen levels at any given time. And in fact, we're advancing our subfield nitrogen tool, which will be field tested during the 2016
season.
And finally, as we develop models for our other crops, like wheat and canola, we'll start to unlock more of that multibillion dollar opportunity. 
Moving to Slide 34. Other highlights for the platform are our foundational connectivity, data capture and visualization tools, where we're seeing real commercial progress in a rapidly evolving pipeline. Just a few weeks ago, we launched our Climate FieldView Drive, which enables seamless connectivity while passing through the field. Our recent agreement with John Deere enables near real-time connectivity through their wireless data server. And so at the end of the day, regardless of the brand of their equipment, growers will have access to seamless data transfer to the cloud, unlocking our unique ability to deliver actionable insight to millions of acres. 
I'd like to wrap up by summarizing a few key points on Slide 35. First, we have never had a sense of complacency about our R&D leadership. And now, once again, we're transforming our efforts. And the efforts we're making now to change breeding are raising the bar dramatically on what it will take to compete in this industry in the future. In the area of biotechnology, we're putting in place, literally today, the future 14-gene stack products for corn and the 9-gene stack for soybean that we believe will create an incredible competitive advantage and unique value to our growers. We have novel new next-generation seed treatments, fungicides, herbicides and biologicals progressing in our crop protection portfolio. And with the progress we're seeing in our new platforms, there's been a translation from concept to reality that's played out in just 2 short seasons. Importantly, we're integrating these technologies starting at the research level, just like we've been doing in our core breeding and biotech platforms for years. 
Second point, all of this innovation not only makes for an incredibly exciting time for technology, but it plays a role, I think, of significant importance in addressing the key global macro trends that you discussed. The innovations we deliver will create more yield to meet the increasing global demand for grains in a more sustainable, targeted and precise manner. 
And finally, I think what's clear is our unique breeding and biotech engine has been transformative to the crop protection industry. Today, the growing depth of our pipeline, along with our new digital ag and biologicals platforms, gives us a unique view on how the crop protection landscape will continue to evolve going forward and places us in a position of strength in a dynamic industry. 
So thanks for your time today. I'll turn it back over to Laura for the Q&A."

The belief that we had last April, we still have that the -- there is a significant opportunity there for the integrated platform. And frankly, as the industry goes through challenges, I think that opportunity becomes even greater. Growers are looking for help. A lot has changed in the industry since last spring. The industry has gotten tougher, and I would say we expected some of that. The operating environment has become tougher as well and I think because of that, there's a greater need now than there was last spring to be able to quantify what that opportunity would look like and quantify the -- what that integrated platform would look like. So engagement becomes more important now than it did before with Syngenta and we haven't seen much, much progress in that front.

I'd say most of the targets that we've approached in the weed control area are designed to supplement support and ensure the long-term performance of the Roundup Ready trait system. And incidentally, in addition to those external projects, you'll note that we had a release today that talked about some of the investments that we've made in start-up companies through our venture capital fund, which we've made an investment in over 20 start-ups that again cover chemistry, biologicals and data science tools.

In Brazil, the farmer has choices. They can buy their seed and pay right upfront. They can buy their seed and agree to pay at POD or, legally, they can save seed and pay with POD. As we've said, the big shift has occurred, and a vast majority of farmers are buying new seed every year, but they get that choice. It also goes to market through seed multipliers, which are a step removed from us. So we do not have the kind of insight in the marketplace that we enjoy in the U.S., where we have a large branded business ourselves and a handful of other large branded players that we can get information from as a licensee. So we just don't have that down there. What I can tell you today is, I feel really confident in our 30 million acres of Intacta in Brazil, and I'm really excited about the demand that we see from the farmers. It's too early for us to be able to call how much of that was prepaid and how much of that was bought seed and whether or not it's going to be above 30 million acres. But I feel really good about the 30 million acres that we laid out today."

I -- as you look at Roundup and you're right, we did say that we would expect it through the latter half of the year that we would see some improvement in price. We haven't seen that start to occur yet. It's been more flattish, which really leads to the wider range that we've given around our Ag Productivity business this year. If you assume prices kind of float around where they are today, then we were at the low end of that range and if they do get some lift throughout the rest of the year, we would see it float to the higher end of that range, but that's what drives the breadth of that range. I think a couple of things to keep in mind is China prices clearly an impact on what the price is, but also what kind of margin opportunity the generics participate in. So we watch the generic price in the marketplace. That's what our farmers are looking at. We don't price based on what's going on in China. We price based on the generics in the market, and we have not seen them start to lift those prices. But in most of the world, we feel like we're in a pretty good place right now with some hope that the price will continue or will lift towards the latter half of the year."

When you look at places like Eastern Europe where you have improving genetics replacing really old genetics from before, not a stronger competition. We can get pretty healthy gains there, and we have over the past 5 years, and that's leapfrogged us into the #1 position over there. Then, of course, in Argentina, as an example, we have a really, really strong position in Argentina. And it's -- we never give up on our opportunity to grow, but I'm thrilled every year that we hold that position down there because it's a really strong position. And then in Brazil, we find ourselves in a unique situation right now, where our competitor is challenged with a trade offering in the marketplace and, quite frankly, we're getting an opportunity to grow there. So we're taking advantage of that and growing our footprint, and that's the part of the confidence we have in the summer season that we had improvement this year. So each market is going to be a little bit different, but we feel good about our position."

So I think today, we've covered a number of ways, the breadth, the depth and the productivity of our pipeline and why that gives us confidence in both our long-term growth targets as well as the strong role that we believe we play and address in the evolving landscape across agriculture within a sector that is changing at the moment. So with the unique vantage point that we have from our pipeline and the technology that we have in hand to create the 9 to 14-gene stacks that we believe will define the future of agriculture, that Robb outlined today, we see ourselves in a position of strength in a dynamic industry. So, I guess, the bottom line for us is we continue to view this as a time of opportunity. We have a balance of innovation, which is kind of the heart of who we are, and discipline can grow a long-term competitive position. So thanks very much for joining us on the call this morning, and the very best to you all in the new year. Thanks very much."

Our second quarter call marks the midpoint of the critical northern hemisphere ag season. And today, we will provide a summary of our second quarter results as well as our views into our outlook for the rest of the year. This call is being webcast, and you can access the webcast, supporting slides and the replay at monsanto.com. We've provided you today with EPS and other measures on both a GAAP and ongoing business basis. Where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to the nearest GAAP measure in the slides and in the press release, both of which are on the website. This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may vary -- may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in our most recent 10-Q and in today's press release. The forward-looking statements are current only as of the date of this call, and the company disclaims any obligation to update them or the factors that may affect actual results. 
First, let me review our second quarter results, as shown on Slide 4 and 5. We delivered ongoing earnings per share of $2.42 within our guidance range for the quarter. When compared to the prior year, our ongoing earnings per share is close to flat when measured on a currency-neutral basis. On an as-reported basis, our second quarter earnings per share is $2.41, reflecting $0.01 [ph] for restructuring charges, environmental and litigation matters and income from discontinued operations. 
Finally, our free cash flow for the first half of our fiscal year was $906 million as compared to $986 million in the prior year. 
With that brief summary, let me hand it to Hugh to provide the strategic outlook."

With",1143,"Thank you, Laura, and good morning to all of you. Just a month ago, Pierre shared our revised outlook for our business, reflecting the challenging times for this industry and how the macro trends that we've been highlighting have continued to soften. With our near-term outlook remaining relatively consistent and recent consolidation events, I'd like to use my time with you today to share our longer-term outlook and provide a quick update on our strategy. 
There are really 3 key variables to our strategy and our optimism for the opportunity to grow our business in fiscal year '17 and beyond, as outlined on Slide 6. 
First, demand growth for our key crops continues to be strong, and the needs to help farmers meet that demand through sustainable solutions remains a global priority. With these demand trends in our portfolio, we remain bullish in agriculture and our position as the industry leader. 
Second, innovation has been, and is expected to remain, the critical differentiator in unlocking increment yield from existing acres, and we remained the undisputed industry leader in biotech, breeding, biologicals and now in digital ad solutions. This innovation, as evidenced by the industry's broadest, deepest and most proven pipeline, drives our strong standalone growth plan. Not only does this give us the confidence that from the midpoint of our current [ph] year guidance, we can deliver a baseline CAGR in the mid-teens for ongoing EPS for the next 3 years, but it fuels our belief that we continue to be the innovation engine for the industry making us the partner of choice in leading ag technologies. 
And this brings us clearly to our third point. We believe the industry will continue to rationalize, focusing investment to our highest return options. We now see this translating into further R&D or commercial partnerships for which we're uniquely positioned to participate and no longer see large-scale M&A as a likely opportunity. 
Let me be clear, our strategy is not and was not dependent on large-scale M&A, rather our strategy's innovation driven and entirely collaborative, and our vision for fun integrated solutions for the farm of the future requires that strategic approach. These solutions encompass seed, crop protection and nutrition management, as outlined on Slide 7. Importantly, digital agriculture is expected to become the standard for growers, large and small, who will need to manage each input precisely and responsibly. 
Let's take a quick look at the innovation platform advantages that make us the best positioned to execute in the strategy and unlock the next layers of potential. Through our breeding and biotech platforms, we fill an outstanding foundation in seed and seed-related technology. Today, our seed track footprint reaches approximately 400 million acres in our core crops, underpinned by our unique germplasm libraries, global-branded seed share and industry-leading biotech trait position. Within this footprint, we're the world's largest sellers in seed treatments with our own Acceleron brands of seed-applied solutions now reaching more than 75 million acres by [indiscernible] extensive use of markers allow us to protect the seed for many diseases through breeding traits. 
Further, with enhancing the seed supply solutions with microbial treatments developed through our BioAg Alliance with Novozymes and with our plans for our Phase 4 nematicide NEMASTRIKE, which is a potential net present value now estimated at $1 billion. 
Moving to our control platform through the combination of our proficiency in biotech and chemistry, we've long been the leaders in these systems with our Roundup trait readies traits and our strong position Roundup, the world's most widely used herbicide. We're again on the verge of upgrading the industry's largest trade platform with our Roundup Ready a stand crop system across multiple crops. This includes plans to invest in dicamba production capacity and broad sourcing agreements for a molecule that we expect to become the world's second-most widely used herbicide. And beyond this, with third and fourth generation, we control platforms in the pipeline to upgrade yet again. 
We've also transformed insect control through our biotech leadership in corn, soybeans and cotton, as evidenced by our broadly penetrated insect control traits, including SmartStax corn, Bollgard II Cotton and Intacta soybeans with next-generation replacements already in Phase 4 of the pipeline. Further, with lygus control in cotton, we're targeting to deliver the first biotech solution for piercing sucking insects that cost nearly $200 million of annual losses in U.S. cotton alone. Beyond these biotech solutions are the BioDirect are in the technologies for the future differentiated approaches to insect control. 
Finally, with the climate digital ag platform with the ability to integrate solutions for growers through the application of industry-leading capabilities and data science and software engineering. This year, our field health and nitrogen advisers will be available across 120 [ph] million acres in corn and soybeans in the U.S. And through our agreements with the leading pharma equipment manufacturers and ag retailers, we've the unique ability to drive on farm connectivity and adoption onto our FieldView platform. This will become the integrator of technologies literally row by row and acre by acre. 
To further develop these platforms, particularly in the area of crop protection solutions, we'll focus on the collaboration model that enhances our existing R&D and commercial base through licensing, partnerships, collaborations and smaller scale M&A, as shown on Slide 8. Our emphasis is on developing proprietary synergistic solutions to address unmet needs or upgrade current solutions to unlock further yield. This is about creating new value or displacing existing value in the current $57 billion global crop protection input space, and our leading seed footprint and field testing network, combined with our extensive genomics knowledge gives us a unique advantage in attracting partners. 
So how does this look in practice? These partnerships and collaborations could range from those included in our Roundup Ready Plus program that currently reaches 50 million acres in North America to opportunities in seed treatments and in digital ag. Our R&D investment considers the development of new molecules through the same collaborative approach peered with discovery programs that leverage our Genomics knowledge, similar to the science used to develop NemaStrike nematicide in just 5 short years. This unique approach also fungicide elaboration with them as therapeutics and our next-generation herbicide Poland development program. 
Smaller scale M&A remains an opportunistic tool to create additional layers of growth in crop protection solutions, and we will continue to take a disciplined approach seeking strong strategic fit and synergistic value. With our pace and breadth of proven innovation developed both internally and through broadscale partnerships and collaborations, we expect to continue to lead and define integrated solutions for the industry. And importantly, despite near-term headwinds, we remain confident in the foundation and in the milestones we continue to deliver to make that vision a reality. 
So with that, Brett's going to highlight the progress of all these milestones. Brett?"

Despite the continuation of near-term currency and commodity price headwinds, we continue to deliver on key milestones that set up our next-generation platforms across weed, insect, disease and nutri",1726,"Thanks, Hugh, and good morning to everyone on the line. Despite the continuation of near-term currency and commodity price headwinds, we continue to deliver on key milestones that set up our next-generation platforms across weed, insect, disease and nutrition management. Today, I'd like to share those milestones. What are we seeing on the ground, and why we have the confidence in our innovation-based growth drivers. 
Let's begin with our largest and most durable platform, our global corn business. Globally, in a market challenged with extreme currency headwinds, we expect our full year gross profit to be down low to mid-single digits as a percent, with currency being the single largest driver of the decline year-over-year. We continue to expect full year corn germplasm price mix lift in local currency to be flat even after competitive discounts, and we expect the increases in volumes from share gains and the upcoming season in the southern hemisphere to potentially more than offset the incremental corn cost of goods, resulting from our lowered seed production plants. 
Let's take a look at some of the regional highlights, as shown on Slide 9. In the U.S., on a growing acreage base, our year 1 to 3 hybrids are tracking to 50% to 60% of the portfolio, and SmartStax remains roughly at the same percentage of the portfolio as last year. Our disciplined response to our competitors action has been effective, as we expect to hold or grow our leading share position while retaining the premium pricing our yield advantage learners. Further, we are planning for our new disease-yield hybrids for the U.S. markets. These products, offering a combination of genetics with disease resistance, are made possible only through our extensive investment and marker technology. They are expected to be available for the 2017 season and will be the latest solution to help farmers with industry-leading comprehensive protection against major corn diseases. 
In Brazil, we demonstrated discipline to offset some of the currency weakness, with 20% plus germplasm price increases in local currency expected for the full year. We grew share in the first season of the year, and our VT Triple PRO product is the first to offer belowground insect protection in the country with strong conversion to the new trade platform. 
In Argentina, our share remains well above 50% in a region where acres have estimated to have to decline 15% to 20% versus prior year. With our strong portfolio and share position, we are well positioned to participate in the expected growth in the area planted in the upcoming season. With the reduction in grain export taxes and the devaluation of the peso, we continue to be optimistic about the future prospects for agriculture in Argentina. 
Finally, across Europe and Africa, we also expect to hold or grow share in a region of declining corn acres. 
Outside of these commercial milestones in global corn, we are commencing with our seed production plans for next year and expect to increase the scale from the current year, which should reduce a significant portion of the corn COGS headwinds for the next fiscal year. This creates a strong foundation from which we can continue to launch our new hybrids as well as 7 different late-stage technologies that have licensing and launch opportunities in the near future. 
Let's shift to soybeans and specifically, to Intacta, where we've had an outstanding year, achieving 35 million acres of penetration across South America, as shown on Slide 10. This is more than twice our fiscal year '15 penetration, which is a tremendous accomplishment in our third year of launch. We currently expect to reach 75 million acres by 2019 and ultimately expect the generations for insect-protected Soybean technology to fully penetrate the 100 million acre opportunity in South America. The trait is offered in varieties with a fit across all of Brazil, and we've expanded our seed production for 2017, increasing to greater than 70 products for Argentina. 
Our other blockbuster soybean growth driver is Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans, as shown on Slide 11. As you know, we received our China import approval back in early February and now are very pleased to see the recent opening of the EPA comment period for the in-crop use of M 1691, a low volatility dicamba formulation. This marks a critical step forward for the Roundup Ready Extent crop system. According to the EPA, this first label for in-crop use is expected by late summer to early fall, and we expect approval for the in-crop use of extended mass and Roundup Ready Xtend, both mid-technology shortly thereafter to be ready for the fiscal year '17 season. We still await final EU approval of the stacked product and continue to be frustrated by the unexpected administrative delays after receiving the European Food Safety Authority's positive opinion June. The demand for the technology is strong, and we continue to be positioned to provide our new Roundup Ready 2 Xtend varieties for 3 million acres this year, but we are at a point where every day counts to be able to provide that experience to our growers. 
Not to be outdone, Bollgard II XtendFlex Cotton is now expected to penetrate more than 2 million acres in the U.S, as shown on Slide 12. And we anticipate that these new varieties will drive continued share gains on the order of 3 or more points, further proving the pent-up demand from farmers for our new varieties. Not only are we progressing with the key milestones for these 2 products in the Roundup Ready extent system, but we are moving forward in planning our potential investment in dicamba capacity, as shown on Slide 13. The Roundup Ready Xtend crop system will enable the upgrade of the industry's largest seed technology platform, and this investment will allow us to more fully participate in the value we create through integrated solutions. To ensure there is efficient supply of the expected 250 million acres of opportunity in the next decade, we continue to plan for the dicamba manufacturing investment to provide cost-effective timely dicamba to our growers. This capital investment is expected to be in the range of $900 million to $1 billion over the course of 3 years. Once complete, we expect it would supply 25% to 35% of the fully mature demand and provide a return on investment in the mid-teens from incremental dicamba sales alone, accelerating the 30-plus percent when considering the total system benefits of having our own capacity and relevance and pricing. 
We expect the economies of scale with the proximity to the Luling plant, logistical advantages with convenient access to the Americas and a strong formulation pipeline to deliver crop safety and convenience to our growers. We also continue to balance this planned investment with supply agreements across a diversified set of producers, which has already led to some additional planned capacity. We simply are the best positioned to prime the supply pump that will be needed to fuel this blockbuster weed control system upgrade while further strengthening our integrated solutions platform. 
Before we leave our core business outlook, I wanted to highlight that we are disappointed by the recent cottonseed price control order notification in India. We, together with our partner, Michiko, continue to challenge elements of the attempt to fix cotton trade fees and licensing terms before the High Court of Delhi and remain confident in the merits of our legal claims. While the potential impact to us is in the tens of millions of dollars, the real loss is the loss of access to new technologies for the growers in India. 
Beyond the core business drivers, I'd like to provide a brief update on our transformation status, as outlined on Slide 14. We continue to focus on scale and efficiency while still delivering outstanding innovation and customer service through the creation of our 4 commercial hubs and our R&D center of excellence in Saint Louis as well as by leveraging the power and data analytics. Our continued progress with our planning and execution of our actions is further confirmation of our confidence in delivering $500 million of cost savings by fiscal year '18 and in our ability to transform our way of working. 
Moving to our new platforms, we continue to progress toward our key milestones in climate, as shown on Slide 15. We are working toward closing our most recent agreement with John Deere, still expected this fiscal year. This agreement marks our third connectivity agreement with a major equipment manufacturer, following agreements with AGCO and CNH and is a great addition to our industry-leading retail network to the top 6 U.S. ag retailers. 
We also recently announced connectivity agreements with several agronomic and retailer software systems as well as the John Deere operations center, connecting our Climate FieldView platform to the farm management systems of more than 80% of the top retailers across the corn belt and the largest U.S. ag equipment provider. This reach and level of connectivity, combined with the capabilities of our advisers and the adoption we have secured to date, establishes Climate as the leading digital ag platform. We expect to continue that momentum in fiscal year '16, where we have expanded our pro availability by more than 50% from 2015 to 120 million acres across corn and soybeans in the heart of the Midwest. With this expansion, we are making nice progress towards our targeted penetration of 12 million paid acres and platform adoption to an expected 90 million acres. 
Moving beyond the U.S, we are now expanding our infield beta testing plans for 2017 in Brazil and now expect our first product launch in 2 years. As I tile these milestones together, it comes together quite simply. We now have the latest set of innovative agronomic tools that deliver yield along with weed, insect, disease and fertility management, and we expect the deliverables from this year to create momentum to continue to build our industry-leading platforms and integrated solutions vision. There is no doubt the fiscal year '16 is challenging, but we still -- we will emerge as a leaner and stronger organization with our best corn hybrids, our new Roundup Ready extent system and Intacta soybeans all poised to deliver strong growth in fiscal year '17 and beyond. 
With that, let me pass it to Pierre for the financial outlook."

Not only do we continue to focus on delivering on the operational milestones we've shared with you, but we remain focused on our financial pillars, return on innovation, financial discipline and balanced capita",1542,"Thanks, Brett, and good morning to everyone. Not only do we continue to focus on delivering on the operational milestones we've shared with you, but we remain focused on our financial pillars, return on innovation, financial discipline and balanced capital allocation. Together, these factors should position us well to deliver on our long-term integrated solutions growth strategy. But first, let's focus on the second quarter. 
We delivered ongoing earnings per share of $2.42, in line with our guidance. And when setting aside significant currency headwinds, particularly the devaluation of the Argentine peso, it's essentially in line with the prior year. On this currency-neutral basis, that negative impact from glyphosate declines increased discounting in the U.S. in corn and soybeans, lower soybean volumes and higher cost of goods were offset by the benefits from our reduced share accounts, Brazil corn pricing, increased Intacta penetration and reduced operating expenses. 
From a GP margin perspective, in the second quarter, our [indiscernible] gross profit as a percent of net sales fell flat at 54% [ph]. Global corn gross profit margins were flat, as increased cost of goods from lower production plants combined with tactical discounting to counter competitive offers offset the mixed lift benefits from new hybrid introduction and the price increases in local currencies in Brazil. 
In global soybeans, gross profit margins declined slightly as a result of Roundup Ready Xtend launch costs and the discounting in the U.S., which more than offset the benefit from increasing Intacta penetration. Vegetable margins improved due to lower costs arising from improved operation. And finally, ag productivity gross profit margins declined due to lower Roundup pricing. 
As we look to the full year, we continue to expect $4.40 to $5.10 of ongoing earnings per share, as shown on Slide 16, which still assumes $0.90 to $1 of currency headwinds. On an as-reported basis, our estimates for earnings per share have improved to $3.72 to $4.48, primarily due to a change in the expected timing for the accounting of restructuring expenses. 
Let's look at the specific components of our outlook. First, we continue to target a seed and genomic gross profit that is relatively flat, meaning plus or minus 2% to 3% for the full year. Exclusive of estimated currency headwinds of roughly $400 million, Seeds and Genomics gross profit is estimated to be up single digits, driven primarily by the expected increase in licensing deals, increased Intacta penetration and global corn footprint expansion. We expect more than $300 million to as much as $450 million of benefits from licensing deal in fiscal year '16, mostly within these segments. 
Our Ag Productivity gross profit outlook is still expected to be roughly at the midpoint of our range of $900 million to $1.1 billion. We expect to recover some of the volume declines from the first half of the fiscal year, as we continue to ship through a higher ratio of branded volumes. We could see our full year volumes somewhat software than our roughly 300 million gallons of capacity, but we are not expecting material volume variance at these points. 
From an operating expense perspective, we remain on track to deliver $165 million to $210 million in savings from our restructuring actions in fiscal year '16. These savings, together with spending discipline and currency benefits, contribute to our expectation that operating expense will be down slightly for the year, inclusive of increased investments in new platform. 
Assuming the Argentine peso exchange rate remain close to a ratio of 1:15 [ph] at the close of the fiscal year, we still expect over expense nets to increase year-over-year by approximately $180 million. The other key currency assumption underpinning our outlook assumes the Brazilian reais at a ratio of close to 1:4 [ph]. Texas continue to trend lower, potentially now even below the low end of our range of 25% to 27%. Beyond those profit drivers, the net effect of the benefit from our share repurchases, including net financing expense, should generate a net earnings per share benefit of $0.24 to $0.27, with 437 [ph] million shares outstanding at the close of our second quarter. We expect to continue to convert our earnings into cash for disciplined management of working capital and expect free cash flow for the year to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion, with investing cash outflows now expected to be in the range of $800 million to $1 billion. 
With that, let's move to how we deploy cash and our plans for the future, as shown on Slide 17. We just closed out our $3 billion [indiscernible] in the second quarter. And since announcing our capital allocation strategy in June of '14, we have successfully deployed more than $13 billion, with more than $11 billion returned to our owners through share repurchases and dividends. Given the seasonality of our business, we expect our net debt to ongoing EBITDA ratio to peak at the end of the third quarter and end the fiscal year somewhere between our long-term target of $1.5 billion and a ratio 2.0 [ph] we'd see at the end of the second quarter. This capital structure continues to provide the necessary financial flexibility to pursue organic and external growth opportunities while still returning excess capital to our share owners. 
Looking ahead to fiscal year '17, we see the opportunity for strong growth in ongoing earnings per share, as shown on Slide 18. Assuming stable currencies, this expected growth is driven by our soybean innovation growth drivers, the durability of our global corn platform, continued financial discipline and improved cost of goods outlook for corn and soybeans. Our Soybean innovation drivers are expected to continue record setting adoption rates on their run to target opportunity, with both Intacta and Roundup Ready Xtend soybeans and anticipated to make a meaningful step up next year. By 2019, we expect 2/3 of the U.S. acres to be penetrated by Roundup Ready Xtend soybeans and approximately 75 million acres across South America to be penetrated by Intacta. 
In addition, we expect the roughly $70 million to $80 million of Xtend launch costs to decrease significantly next fiscal year, reducing to a very low amounts by the third year of commercialization. From our global corn perspective, it's still too early to estimate specific pricing and volume dynamics, but we do expect to see benefits from the launch of new hybrids globally from expected double-digit price increases in local currency for Brazil and Argentina and from higher seed production plans. We have just completed those plants for the northern hemisphere and already expect to see a significant improvement next year that will offset part of the $90 million to $100 million of corn cobs headwinds we anticipate for this year. We will provide an updated estimate after we lock in production for the southern hemisphere and after we see our final production yields in the northern hemisphere. 
Currency is assumed to be relatively stable to today's assumption would translate to an estimated $180 million reduction of our expenses due to the absence of the significant Argentine peso devaluation. 
On the financial discipline front, we continue to track towards the expected $375 million to $420 million of savings in fiscal year '17 from our restructuring and cost-savings initiatives. This would represent an increase of nearly $200 million in savings compared to this year's target. These savings represent only one element of the projected total spend for next year, as items such as inflation, new investments, commissions and incentives are still to be estimated, but it certainly indicates great progress towards our targeted $500 million of savings by fiscal year '18. 
Finally, while we still expect to see licensing opportunities in fiscal year '17, it is too early to estimate their impact, but it could be lower than this year as we expect the higher-than-typical contribution in '16. 
This growth opportunity extends beyond fiscal year '17, as we continue to target a baseline mid-teens compounded annual growth rate for ongoing EPS from the midpoint of the fiscal year '16 guidance to fiscal year '19. This baseline projection, while likely not linear, is built upon continued momentum from the corn and soybean growth drivers we just outlined; continued benefits from financial discipline and our capital allocation strategy; the assumption that at productivity gross profit will remain in today's expected range; and importantly, an outlook for currency commodity price that anticipates little to no change from today's assumption. That being said, any appreciable improvement in these variables could accelerate us back to our earlier track of greater than 20% compounded annual growth rate in this time frame. However, as CFO, I continue to believe it is more prudent to wait for the evolution of the northern hemisphere's crop season to reassess. 
My focus remains unchanged, return on innovation, financial discipline and balanced capital allocation. These, together with the sound and disciplined approach to delivering on our integrated solutions strategy, supports long-term growth, expanding industry-leading EBITDA margins and return of value to our share owners. Continuing to execute well on these pillars along with delivering with innovation in our pipeline, provides the gateway to rapid future business growth.

We continue -- in fact, I'd say the more we see, the more we believe that's an opportunity. And when you look at how growers are challenge at the moment, we're desperate for those kind of solutions. I'd say we also believe that we've got strong independent strategy, so it's tough at the moment, but even as tough times growers are reaching for the best technology that they can possibly find. So I need -- I think we are clear in this. We saw an opportunity with Syngenta, and that opportunity was to accelerate that process, but it was never contingent or dependent on it. So we  Syngenta is gone. We will not and we would not have done an overpriced deal. So I think now we are looking at how we get to the same destination, but using a different path. And I think that we get there isn't to be driven more on a product by product basis. It's going to be driven by collaboration, bringing other people chemistry up on that acre. And I think it's going to be driven by some of the works that we underscored this morning like the new nematicide from NEMASTRIKE. And differently, some of the new smaller companies like Nimbus Therapeutics. So we're not anchored on the methodology, but I do think we're anchored on the opportunity set. And the reality today is I think we're better poised than our competitors to integrate those 3 pieces together because our belief in this is beta science is going to be the anchor that pulls it together. So this isn't been -- this hasn't been a cost and synergy tax play. This has been about growth and creating new value and develop new insights for the growers. So that's why I made the comments this morning. We need to get real. The land scape has shifted, and we need to focus on driving integration by our means."

It was an expensive exercise for everybody. And so to Brett and Pierce point, here's how we think about next year. Philosophically, our pricing discipline and our price to the value that we create, we will maintain that approach. It's hard to call at the stage where commodity prices. We'll get some good time as we see how this year's spring and harvest shapes up, but the thought of bringing incremental bushels and at pricing against those is something that we will maintain next year. And we've seen growers from our order books this year albeit at lower prices because they're under tremendous pressure. We've seen growers reaching for those level 1, level 2, level 3 hybrids, which is an indication that they are going to look for the best technology. So at this stage, based on what we've seen and what we've experienced competitive price and notwithstanding, we will stay the course for this that what falls [ph] for the last decade plus."

So when you look at it today, they're spending substantially more to control weeds, for example, in soybeans than they would have been spending a few years ago because of the resistant weeds. Tomorrow, they'll be able to spend less because they'll use less other herbicides. We'll still encourage them to use multiple molecules, but they'll use less to digital to weeds so it will be a good deal for farmers with a look at the total benefits of the old system both looking at seed and the chemistry package."

I think the window in the space are those are going to be able to combine these technologies and unlock bushel rather than unlocking $1 of cost synergies. So hard to call, but I think as we look at it today and in the comments that I made earlier and in my prepared remarks, for us, the path in this is going to be driven less by large scale M&A and my guess is a lot more by collaborative efforts in bringing chemistry up onto our 400 million-acre footprint.

I mean, overtime rebuilding from the currency. If you look at the calendar year -- at the fiscal year, unfortunately what happened to us is with the pricing from last season, so entering into the first quarter, a big part of our Brazilian business happened before we took those actions because, as you know, we price in Brazil in the fourth quarter for season that goes in the fourth and first quarter.

When you get into the [indiscernible] season and summer season to come, definitely what you're mentioning is totally valid. That's exactly what we are trying to do.

There's another piece of this though that I think is also relevant. As it becomes harder to control some of the tough to control weeds and you have to spray more herbicide, you have more risk of challenging the crop with additional herbicides as well as the lack of weed control also damages the yield as you clean up that field, the farmer's going to see the benefit of that as well.

Our second quarter call marks the midpoint of the critical northern hemisphere ag season. And today, we will provide a summary of our second quarter results as well as our views into our outlook for the rest of the year. This call is being webcast, and you can access the webcast, supporting slides and the replay at monsanto.com. We've provided you today with EPS and other measures on both a GAAP and ongoing business basis. Where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to the nearest GAAP measure in the slides and in the press release, both of which are on the website. This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may vary -- may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in our most recent 10-Q and in today's press release. The forward-looking statements are current only as of the date of this call, and the company disclaims any obligation to update them or the factors that may affect actual results. 
First, let me review our second quarter results, as shown on Slide 4 and 5. We delivered ongoing earnings per share of $2.42 within our guidance range for the quarter. When compared to the prior year, our ongoing earnings per share is close to flat when measured on a currency-neutral basis. On an as-reported basis, our second quarter earnings per share is $2.41, reflecting $0.01 for restructuring charges, environmental and litigation matters and income from discontinued operations. 
Finally, our free cash flow for the first half of our fiscal year was $906 million as compared to $986 million in the prior year. 
With that brief summary, let me hand it to Hugh to provide the strategic outlook."

With",1142,"Thank you, Laura, and good morning to all of you. Just a month ago, Pierre shared our revised outlook for our business, reflecting the challenging times for this industry and how the macro trends that we've been highlighting have continued to soften. With our near-term outlook remaining relatively consistent and recent consolidation events, I'd like to use my time with you today to share our longer-term outlook and provide a quick update on our strategy. 
There are really 3 key variables that anchor strategy and our optimism for the opportunity to grow our business in fiscal year '17 and beyond, as outlined on Slide 6. 
First, demand growth for our key crops continues to be strong and the needs to help farmers meet that demand through sustainable solutions remains a global priority. With these demand trends in our portfolio, we remain bullish in agriculture and our position as the industry leader. 
Second, innovation has been, and is expected to remain, the critical differentiator in unlocking incremental yield from existing acres, and we remain the undisputed industry leader in biotech, breeding, biologicals and now, in digital ag solutions. This innovation, as evidenced by the industry's broadest, deepest and most proven pipeline, drives our strong standalone growth plan. Not only does this give us the confidence that from the midpoint of our current year guidance, we can deliver a baseline CAGR in the mid-teens for ongoing EPS for the next 3 years, but it fuels our belief that we can continue to be the innovation engine for the industry, making us the partner of choice in leading ag technologies. 
And this brings us clearly to our third point. We believe the industry will continue to rationalize, focusing investment to the highest return options. We now see this translating into further R&D or commercial partnerships for which we are uniquely positioned to participate and no longer see large-scale M&A as a likely opportunity. 
Let me be clear. Our strategy is not and was not dependent on large-scale M&A, rather, our strategy is innovation driven and entirely collaborative, and our vision for fully integrated solutions for the farm of the future requires that strategic approach. 
These solutions encompass seed, crop protection and nutrition management, as outlined on Slide 7. Importantly, digital agriculture is expected to become the standard for growers, large and small, who will need to manage each input precisely and responsibly. 
Let's take a quick look at the innovation platform advantages that make us the best positioned to execute in the strategy and unlock the next layers of yield potential. Through our breeding and biotech platforms, we fill an outstanding foundation in seed and seed-related technology. Today, our seed track footprint reaches approximately 400 million acres in our core crops, underpinned by our unique germplasm libraries, global-branded seed share and industry-leading biotech trait position. Within this footprint, we're the world's largest sellers in seed treatments with our own Acceleron brand of seed-applied solutions now reaching more than 75 million acres, while an extensive use of markers allow us to protect the seed for many diseases through breeding traits. Further, we're enhancing these seed applied solutions with microbial treatments developed through our BioAg Alliance with Novozymes and with our plans for our Phase 4 nematicide NEMASTRIKE, which has a potential net present value now estimated at $1 billion. 
Moving to our weed control platform through the combination of our proficiency in biotech and chemistry, we've long been the leader in these systems with our Roundup Ready traits and our strong position in Roundup, the world's most widely used herbicide. We're again on the verge of upgrading the industry's largest trait platform with our Roundup Ready Xtend crop system across multiple crops. This includes plans to invest in dicamba production capacity and broad sourcing agreements for a molecule that we expect to become the world's second-most widely used herbicide. And beyond this, with third and fourth generation weed control platforms in the pipeline to upgrade yet again. 
We've also transformed insect control through our biotech leadership in corn, soybeans and cotton, as evidenced by our broadly penetrated insect control traits, including SmartStax corn, Bollgard II Cotton and Intacta soybeans with next-generation replacements already in phase 4 in the pipeline. Further, with lygus control in cotton, we're targeting to deliver the first biotech solution for piercing sucking insects that cost nearly $200 million of annual losses in U.S. cotton alone. Beyond these biotech solutions are the BioDirect RNAi technologies for future differentiated approaches to insect control. 
Finally, with the climate digital ag platform with the ability to integrate solutions for growers through the application of industry-leading capabilities and data science and software engineering. This year, our field health and nitrogen advisers will be available across 120 million acres in corn and soybeans in the U.S,  and through our agreements with the leading pharma equipment manufacturers and ag retailers with the unique ability to drive on farm connectivity and adoption on to our FieldView platform. This will become the integrator of technologies literally row-by-row and acre-by-acre. 
To further develop these platforms, particularly in the area of crop protection solutions, we'll focus on the collaboration model that enhances our existing R&D and commercial base through licensing, partnerships, collaborations and smaller scale M&A, as shown on Slide 8. Our emphasis is on developing proprietary synergistic solutions to address unmet needs or upgrade current solutions to unlock further yield. This is about creating new value or displacing existing value in the current $57 billion global crop protection input space, and our leading seed footprint and field testing network, combined with our extensive genomics knowledge, gives us a unique advantage in attracting partners. 
So how does this look in practice? These partnerships and collaborations could range from those included in our Roundup Ready Plus program that currently reaches 50 million acres in North America to opportunities in seed treatments and in digital ag. Our R&D investment considers the development of new molecules through the same collaborative approach paired with discovery programs that leverage our Genomics knowledge, similar to the science used to develop NemaStrike nematicide in just 5 short years. This unique approach also includes a fungicide development collaboration with Nimbus Therapeutics and our next-generation herbicide tolerance trait development program. 
Smaller scale M&A remains an opportunistic tool to create additional layers of growth in crop protection solutions, and we will continue to take a disciplined approach seeking strong strategic fit and synergistic value. With our pace and breadth of proven innovation, developed both internally and through broadscale partnerships and collaborations, we expect to continue to lead and define integrated solutions for the industry. And importantly, despite near-term headwinds, we remain confident in the foundation and in the milestones we continue to deliver to make that vision a reality. 
So with that, Brett's going to highlight the progress of all these milestones. Brett?"

Despite the continuation of near-term currency and commodity price headwinds, we continue to deliver on key milestones that set up our next-generation platforms across weed, insect, disease and nutri",1725,"Thanks, Hugh, and good morning to everyone on the line. Despite the continuation of near-term currency and commodity price headwinds, we continue to deliver on key milestones that set up our next-generation platforms across weed, insect, disease and nutrition management. Today, I'd like to share those milestones, what are we seeing on the ground, and why we have the confidence in our innovation-based growth drivers. 
Let's begin with our largest and most durable platform, our global corn business. Globally, in a market challenged with extreme currency headwinds, we expect our full year gross profit to be down low to mid-single digits as a percent, with currency being the single largest driver of the decline year-over-year. We continue to expect full year corn germplasm price mix lift in local currency to be flat even after competitive discounts. And we expect the increases in volumes from share gains in the upcoming season in the southern hemisphere to potentially more than offset the incremental corn cost of goods, resulting from our lowered seed production plans.
Let's take a look at some of the regional highlights, as shown on Slide 9. In the U.S., on a growing acreage base, our year 1 to 3 hybrids are tracking to 50% to 60% of the portfolio, and SmartStax remains roughly at the same percentage of the portfolio as last year. Our disciplined response to our competitors' action has been effective, as we expect to hold or grow our leading share position while maintaining the premium pricing our yield advantage garners. Further, we are planning for our new disease-yield hybrids for the U.S. market. These products, offering a combination of genetics with disease resistance, are made possible only through our extensive investment in marker technology. They are expected to be available for the 2017 season and will be the latest solution to help farmers with industry-leading comprehensive protection against major corn diseases. 
In Brazil, we demonstrated discipline to offset some of the currency weakness, with 20%-plus germplasm price increases in local currency expected for the full year. We grew share in the first season of the year, and our VT Triple PRO product is the first to offer belowground insect protection in the country with strong conversion to the new trait platform. 
In Argentina, our share remains well above 50% in a region where acres have estimated to -- have declined 15% to 20% versus prior year. With our strong portfolio and share position, we are well positioned to participate in the expected growth in the area planted in the upcoming season. With the reduction in grain export taxes and the devaluation of the peso, we continue to be optimistic about the future prospects for agriculture in Argentina.  Finally, across Europe and Africa, we also expect to hold or grow share in a region of declining corn acres. 
Outside of these commercial milestones in global corn, we are commencing with our seed production plans for next year and expect to increase the scale from the current year, which should reduce a significant portion of the corn COGS headwinds for the next fiscal year. This creates a strong foundation from which we can continue to launch our new hybrids as well as 7 different late-stage technologies that have licensing and launch opportunities in the near future. 
Let's shift to soybeans and, specifically, to Intacta, where we've had an outstanding year, achieving 35 million acres of penetration across South America, as shown on Slide 10. This is more than twice our fiscal year '15 penetration, which is a tremendous accomplishment in our third year of launch. We currently expect to reach 75 million acres by 2019 and ultimately expect the multi-generations for insect-protected soybean technology to fully penetrate the 100 million acre opportunity in South America. The trait is offered in varieties with a fit across all of Brazil, and we've expanded our seed production for 2017, increasing to greater than 70 products for Argentina. 
Our other blockbuster soybean growth driver is Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans, as shown on Slide 11. As you know, we received our China import approval back in early February and now are very pleased to see the recent opening of the EPA comment period for the in-crop use of M1691, a low volatility dicamba formulation. This marks a critical step forward for the Roundup Ready Xtend crop system. According to the EPA, this first label for in-crop use is expected by late summer to early fall, and we expect approval for the in-crop use of Xtendimax and Roundup Xtend, both with VaporGrip technology shortly thereafter to be ready for the fiscal year '17 season. We still await final EU approval of the stacked product and continue to be frustrated by the unexpected administrative delays after receiving the European Food Safety Authority's positive opinion last June. The demand for the technology is strong, and we continue to be positioned to provide our new Roundup Ready 2 Xtend varieties for 3 million acres this year, but we are at a point where every day counts to be able to provide that experience to our growers. 
Not to be outdone, Bollgard II XtendFlex Cotton is now expected to penetrate more than 2 million acres in the U.S, as shown on Slide 12. And we anticipate that these new varieties will drive continued share gains on the order of 3 or more points, further proving the pent-up demand from farmers for our new varieties. Not only are we progressing with the key milestones for these 2 products in the Roundup Ready Xtend system, but we are moving forward in planning our potential investment in dicamba capacity, as shown on Slide 13. 
The Roundup Ready Xtend crop system will enable the upgrade of the industry's largest seed technology platform, and this investment will allow us to more fully participate in the value we create through integrated solutions. To ensure there is sufficient supply of the expected 250 million acres of opportunity in the next decade, we continue to plan for the dicamba manufacturing investment to provide cost-effective timely dicamba to our growers. This capital investment is expected to be in the range of $900 million to $1 billion over the course of 3 years. Once complete, we expect it would supply 25% to 35% of the fully mature demand and provide a return on investment in the mid-teens from incremental dicamba sales alone, accelerating the 30-plus percent when considering the total system benefits of having our own capacity and relevance in pricing. 
We expect the economies of scale with proximity to the Luling plant, logistical advantages with convenient access to the Americas and a strong formulation pipeline to deliver crop safety and convenience to our growers. We also continue to balance this planned investment with supply agreements across a diversified set of producers, which has already led to some additional planned capacity. We simply are the best positioned to prime the supply pump that will be needed to fuel this blockbuster weed control system upgrade while further strengthening our integrated solutions platform. 
Before we leave our core business outlook, I wanted to highlight that we are disappointed by the recent cottonseed price control order notification in India. We, together with our partner, Mahyco, continue to challenge elements of the attempt to fix cotton trade fees and licensing terms before the High Court of Delhi and remain confident in the merits of our legal claims. While the potential impact to us is in the tens of millions of dollars, the real loss is the loss of access to new technologies for the growers in India. 
Beyond the core business drivers, I'd like to provide a brief update on our transformation status, as outlined on Slide 14. We continue to focus on scale and efficiency while still delivering outstanding innovation and customer service through the creation of our 4 commercial hubs and our R&D center of excellence in St. Louis as well as by leveraging the power in data analytics. Our continued progress with our planning and execution of our actions is further confirmation of our confidence in delivering $500 million of cost savings by fiscal year '18 and in our ability to transform our way of working. 
Moving to our new platforms, we continue to progress toward our key milestones in climate, as shown on Slide 15. We are working toward closing our most recent agreement with John Deere, still expected this fiscal year. This agreement marks our third connectivity agreement with a major equipment manufacturer, following agreements with AGCO and CNH, and is a great addition to our industry-leading retail network to the top 6 U.S. ag retailers. 
We also recently announced connectivity agreements with several agronomic and retailer software systems as well as the John Deere operations center, connecting our Climate FieldView platform to the farm management systems of more than 80% of the top retailers across the corn belt and the largest U.S. ag equipment provider. This reach and level of connectivity, combined with the capabilities of our advisers and the adoption we have secured to date, establishes Climate as the leading digital ag platform. 
We expect to continue that momentum in fiscal year '16, where we have expanded our Pro availability by more than 50% from 2015 to 120 million acres across corn and soybeans in the heart of the Midwest. With this expansion, we are making nice progress towards our targeted penetration of 12 million paid acres and platform adoption to an expected 90 million acres. 
Moving beyond the U.S, we are now expanding our in-field beta testing plans for 2017 in Brazil, and now expect our first product launch in 2 years. 
As I tie all these milestones together, it comes together quite simply. We now have the latest set of innovative agronomic tools that deliver yield along with weed, insect, disease and fertility management, and we expect the deliverables from this year to create momentum to continue to build our industry-leading platforms and integrated solutions vision. There is no doubt the fiscal year '16 is challenging, but we still -- we will emerge as a leaner and stronger organization with our best corn hybrids, our new Roundup Ready Xtend system and Intacta soybeans all poised to deliver strong growth in fiscal year '17 and beyond. 
With that, let me pass it to Pierre for the financial outlook."
528414,318280157,957633,"Monsanto Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2016",2016-04-06,"Earnings Calls","Monsanto Company","Executives","Thanks, Brett, and good morning to everyone. Not only do we continue to focus on delivering on the operational milestones Brett shared with you, but we remain focused on our financial pillars: return on innovation, financial discipline and balanced capita",1540,"Thanks, Brett, and good morning to everyone. Not only do we continue to focus on delivering on the operational milestones Brett shared with you, but we remain focused on our financial pillars: return on innovation, financial discipline and balanced capital allocation. Together, these factors should position us well to deliver on our long-term integrated solutions growth strategy. But first, let's focus on the second quarter. 
We delivered ongoing earnings per share of $2.42, in line with our guidance. And when setting aside significant currency headwinds, particularly the devaluation of the Argentine peso, it's essentially in line with the prior year. On this currency-neutral basis, the negative impact from glyphosate declines increased discounting in the U.S. in corn and soybeans, lower soybean volumes and higher cost of goods were offset by the benefits from our reduced share accounts, Brazil corn pricing, increased Intacta penetration and reduced operating expenses. 
From a GP margin perspective, in the second quarter, our Seeds & Genomics gross profit as a percent of net sales fell flat at 54%. Global corn gross profit margins were flat as increased cost of goods from lower production plants, combined with tactical discounting to counter competitive offers, offset the mixed lift benefits from new hybrid introduction and the price increases in local currencies in Brazil. 
In global soybeans, gross profit margins declined slightly as a result of Roundup Ready Xtend launch costs and the discounting in the U.S., which more than offset the benefit from increased Intacta penetration. Vegetable margins improved due to lower costs arising from improved operation. And finally, ag productivity gross profit margins declined due to lower Roundup pricing. 
As we look to the full year, we continue to expect $4.40 to $5.10 of ongoing earnings per share, as shown on Slide 16, which still assumes $0.90 to $1 of currency headwinds. On an as-reported basis, our estimates for earnings per share have improved to $3.72 to $4.48, primarily due to a change in the expected timing for the accounting of restructuring expenses. 
Let's look at the specific components of our outlook. First, we continue to target a Seed & Genomics gross profit that is relatively flat, meaning plus or minus 2% to 3% for the full year. Exclusive of estimated currency headwinds of roughly $400 million, Seeds & Genomics gross profit is estimated to be up single digits, driven primarily by the expected increase in licensing deals, increased Intacta penetration and global corn footprint expansion. We expect more than $300 million to as much as $450 million of benefits from licensing deal in fiscal year '16, mostly within these segments. 
Our Ag Productivity gross profit outlook is still expected to be roughly at the midpoint of our range of $900 million to $1.1 billion. We expect to recover some of the volume declines from the first half of the fiscal year, as we continue to shift to a higher ratio of branded volumes. We could see our full year volumes somewhat softer than our roughly 300 million gallons of capacity, but we are not expecting material volume variance at these points. 
From an operating expense perspective, we remain on track to deliver $165 million to $210 million in savings from our restructuring actions in fiscal year '16. These savings, together with spending discipline and currency benefits, contribute to our expectation that operating expense will be down slightly for the year, inclusive of increased investments in new platform. 
Assuming the Argentine peso exchange rate remain close to a ratio of 1:15 at the close of the fiscal year, we still expect over expense nets to increase year-over-year by approximately $180 million. The other key currency assumption underpinning our outlook assumes the Brazilian reais at a ratio of close to 1:4. Taxes continue to trend lower, potentially now even below the low end of our range of 25% to 27%. Beyond those profit drivers, the net effect of the benefit from our share repurchases, including net financing expense, should generate a net earnings per share benefit of $0.24 to $0.27, with 437 million shares outstanding at the close of our second quarter. We expect to continue to convert our earnings into cash for disciplined management of working capital and expect free cash flow for the year to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion, with investing cash outflows now expected to be in the range of $800 million to $1 billion. 
With that, let's move to how we deployed cash and our plans for the future, as shown on Slide 17. We just closed out our $3 billion ASR in the second quarter. And since announcing our capital allocation strategy in June of '14, we have successfully deployed more than $13 billion, with more than $11 billion returned to our owners through share repurchases and dividends. Given the seasonality of our business, we expect our net debt to ongoing EBITDA ratio to peak at the end of the third quarter and end the fiscal year somewhere between our long-term target of 1.5 and a ratio of 2.0 we see [ph] at the end of the second quarter. This capital structure continues to provide the necessary financial flexibility to pursue organic and external growth opportunities while still returning excess capital to our share owners. 
Looking ahead to fiscal year '17, we see the opportunity for strong growth in ongoing earnings per share, as shown on Slide 18. Assuming stable currencies, this expected growth is driven by: our soybean innovation growth drivers; the durability of our global corn platform; continued financial discipline; and improved cost of goods outlook for corn and soybeans. Our soybean innovation drivers are expected to continue record-setting adoption rates on their ramp to the target opportunity, with both Intacta and Roundup Ready Xtend soybeans anticipated to make a meaningful step-up next year. By 2019, we expect 2/3 of the U.S. acres to be penetrated by Roundup Ready Xtend soybeans and approximately 75 million acres across South America to be penetrated by Intacta. 
In addition, we expect the roughly $70 million to $80 million of Xtend launch costs to decrease significantly next fiscal year, reducing to a very low amounts by the third year of commercialization. From a global corn perspective, it's still too early to estimate specific pricing and volume dynamics, but we do expect to see benefits from the launch of new hybrids globally from expected double-digit price increases in local currency for Brazil and Argentina and from higher seed production plans. We have just completed those plans for the northern hemisphere and already expect to see a significant improvement next year that will offset part of the $90 million to $100 million of corn COGS headwinds we anticipate for this year. We will provide an updated estimate after we lock in production for the southern hemisphere and after we see our final production yields in the northern hemisphere. 
Currency is assumed to be relatively stable to today's assumption would translate to an estimated $180 million reduction of our expenses due to the absence of the significant Argentine peso devaluation. 
On the financial discipline front, we continue to track towards the expected $375 million to $420 million of savings in fiscal year '17 from our restructuring and cost-savings initiatives. This would represent an increase of nearly $200 million in savings compared to this year's target. These savings represent only 1 element of the projected total spend for next year, as items such as inflation, new investments, commissions and incentives are still to be estimated, but it certainly indicates great progress towards our targeted $500 million of savings by fiscal year '18. 
Finally, while we still expect to see licensing opportunities in fiscal year '17, it is too early to estimate their impact but it could be lower than this year as we expect the higher-than-typical contribution in '16. 
This growth opportunity extends beyond fiscal year '17, as we continue to target a baseline mid-teens compounded annual growth rate for ongoing EPS from the midpoint of the fiscal year '16 guidance to fiscal year '19. This baseline projection, while likely not linear, is built upon continued momentum from the corn and soybean growth drivers we just outlined; continued benefits from financial discipline and our capital allocation strategy; the assumption that at productivity gross profit will remain in today's expected range; and importantly, an outlook for currency and commodity price that anticipates little to no change from today's assumption. 
That being said, any appreciable improvement in these variables could accelerate us back to our earlier track of greater than 20% compounded annual growth rate in this time frame. However, as CFO, I continue to believe it is more prudent to wait for the evolution of the northern hemisphere's crop season to reassess. 
My focus remains unchanged, return on innovation, financial discipline and balanced capital allocation. These, together with the sound and disciplined approach to delivering on our integrated solutions strategy, support long-term growth, expanding industry-leading EBITDA margins and return of value to our share owners. Continuing to execute well on these pillars, along with delivering on the innovation in our pipeline, provides the gateway to rapid future business growth.

Yes, I think what hasn't changed this time is we still believe there's an opportunity for that integrated solutions. We still think there is an opportunity bring in chemistry and biology together on that acre and use some data science as the glue that holds that together. So that's been unwavering. We continue -- in fact, I'd say, the more we see, the more we believe that that's an opportunity. And when you look at how growers are challenged at the moment, we are best for those kind of solutions. I'd say, we also believe that we got strong independent strategy. So it's tough and ike at the moment, but even as tough times growers are reaching for the best technology that they can possibly find. So I need -- I think we are clear in this. We saw an opportunity with Syngenta, and that opportunity was to accelerate that process, but it was never contingent or dependent on it. So we -- Syngenta is gone. We will not and we would not have done an overpriced deal. So I think now we are looking at how we get to the same destination, but using a different path. And I think the way you get there is going to be driven more on a product-by-product basis. It's going to be driven by collaboration, bringing other people chemistry up on that acre. And I think it's going to be driven by some of the works that we underscored this morning, like the new nematicide from NEMASTRIKE, and frankly, some of the new smaller companies out there, like Nimbus Therapeutics. So we're now anchored on the methodology, but I do think we're anchored on the opportunity set. And the reality today is, I think we're better placed than our competitors to integrate those 3 pieces together because our belief in this is the science is going to be the anchor that pulls it together. So this isn't been -- this hasn't been a cost and synergy or tax play, this has been about growth and creating new value and develop new insights for the growers. So that's why I made the comments this morning we need to get real. The landscape has shifted, and we need to focus on driving that integration by other means."

We're sitting here in the spring of new year still waiting, so unusually slow delay even for Europe and very frustrating. The good news is we've got the greenlight for Chinese import approvals in February, and then that was compounded last week, I guess, by the beginning the consultation period here in the U.S. for the first formulation. So the last, last piece of this is the administrative sign-off through the EU. All the science is done. All the heavy lifting is done. So it's that rubber stamp but frustrating. And we're at a point now where days count and so the spring is -- it looks like one of the springs is setting up -- drying a lot of places has gotten potentially stretching out, but we've got retail and growers desperately holding to get chance to take a sneak peek of this technology and frustrated by European bureaucrats. So it's very unfortunate. We're now in contingency plan.

Even though they weren't in a position or won't be in a position to spray the herbicide system to see the weed control, they get to see the variety performance. This is the challenge now with the [indiscernible] kind of, call it, slowdown and that's why it's so frustrating, is it limits the farmers' appetite to be willing to try the varieties. And to Hugh's point, today's what will matter. And it's all about now how much we'll be able to accelerate for next year and how much exposure can we get for the farmers this year to get to see them. I'll tell you, though, that demand for this product is really high. Farmers can't wait to get their hands on it. We know there is challenges out there. It's a great product.

It was an expensive exercise for everybody. And so to Brett and Pierce's point, here's how we're thinking about next year. Philosophically, our pricing discipline and our price to the value that we create, we will maintain that approach. It's hard to call at the stage where commodity prices will be. We'll get some time as we see how this year's spring and harvest shapes up. But the esos [ph] of bringing incremental bushels and pricing against those is something that we will maintain next year. And we've seen growers from our order books this year, albeit at lower prices, because they're under tremendous pressure. We've seen growers reaching for those level 1, level 2, level 3 hybrids, which is an indication that they are going to look for the best technology. So at this stage, based on what we've seen and what we've experienced competitive price and notwithstanding, we will stay the course that's what follows for the last decade-plus."

And the really cool thing about dicamba is they all know what it's been around for a long time, and they feel very comfortable with that technology. So when you look at it today, they're spending substantially more to control weeds, for example, in soybeans than they would have been spending a few years ago because of the resistant weeds. Tomorrow, they'll be able to spend less, because they'll use less other herbicides. We'll still encourage them to use multiple molecules, but they'll use less to control their weeds.

There's another piece of this, though, that I think is also relevant. As it becomes harder to control some of the tough-to-control weeds and you have to spray more herbicides, you have more risk of challenging the crop with the additional herbicides as well as the lack of weed control also damages the yield. As you clean up that field, the farmer is going to see the benefit of that as well. So it'll be hard to tell which it's coming from, but both of those are going to add to the overall system and the guilt from the varieties. The earlier cleanup on our varieties, best germplasm. So a lot of parallels for the Roundup Ready 2 system."

Our second quarter call marks the midpoint of the critical northern hemisphere ag season. And today, we will provide a summary of our second quarter results as well as our views into our outlook for the rest of the year. This call is being webcast, and you can access the webcast, supporting slides and the replay at monsanto.com. We've provided you today with EPS and other measures on both a GAAP and ongoing business basis. Where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to the nearest GAAP measure in the slides and in the press release, both of which are on the website. This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may vary -- may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in our most recent 10-Q and in today's press release. The forward-looking statements are current only as of the date of this call, and the company disclaims any obligation to update them or the factors that may affect actual results. 
First, let me review our second quarter results, as shown on Slide 4 and 5. We delivered ongoing earnings per share of $2.42, within our guidance range for the quarter. When compared to the prior year, our ongoing earnings per share is close to flat when measured on a currency-neutral basis. On an as-reported basis, our second quarter earnings per share is $2.41, reflecting $0.01 for restructuring charges, environmental and litigation matters and income from discontinued operations. 
Finally, our free cash flow for the first half of our fiscal year was $906 million as compared to $986 million in the prior year. 
With that brief summary, let me hand it to Hugh to provide the strategic outlook."

Just a month ago, Pierre shared our revised outlook for our business, reflecting the challenging times for this industry and how the macro trends that we've been highlighting have continued to soften. With",1147,"Thank you, Laura, and good morning to all of you. Just a month ago, Pierre shared our revised outlook for our business, reflecting the challenging times for this industry and how the macro trends that we've been highlighting have continued to soften. With our near-term outlook remaining relatively consistent and recent consolidation events, I'd like to use my time with you today to share our longer-term outlook and provide a quick update on our strategy. 
There are really 3 key variables that anchor our strategy and our optimism for the opportunity to grow our business in fiscal year '17 and beyond, as outlined on Slide 6. 
First, demand growth for our key crops continues to be strong and the needs to help farmers meet that demand through sustainable use solutions remains a global priority. With these demand trends in our portfolio, we remain bullish in agriculture and are positioned as the industry leader. 
Second, innovation has been, and is expected to remain, the critical differentiator in unlocking incremental yield from existing acres, and we remain the undisputed industry leader in biotech, breeding, biologicals and now, in digital ag solutions. This innovation, as evidenced by the industry's broadest, deepest and most proven pipeline, drives our strong standalone growth plan. Not only does this give us the confidence that from the midpoint of our current year guidance, we can deliver a baseline CAGR in the mid-teens for ongoing EPS for the next 3 years, but it fuels our belief that we can continue to be the innovation engine for the industry, making us the partner of choice in leading ag technologies. 
And this brings us squarely to our third point. We believe the industry will continue to rationalize, focusing investment to the highest return options. We now see this translating into further R&D or commercial partnerships for which we are uniquely positioned to participate and no longer see large-scale M&A as a likely opportunity. 
Let me be clear. Our strategy is not and was not dependent on large-scale M&A, rather, our strategy is innovation driven and it's highly collaborative, and our vision for fully integrated solutions for the farm of the future requires that strategic approach. 
These solutions encompass seeds, crop protection and nutrition management, as outlined on Slide 7. Importantly, digital agriculture is expected to become the standard for growers, large and small, who will need to manage each input precisely and responsibly. 
Let's take a quick look at the innovation platform advantages that make us the best positioned to execute on the strategy and unlock the next layers of yield potential. Through our breeding and biotech platforms, we've built an outstanding foundation in seeds and seed-related technology. Today, our seed trait footprint reaches approximately 400 million acres in our core crops, underpinned by our unique germplasm libraries, global-branded seed share and industry-leading biotech trait position. Within this footprint, we're the world's largest seller of seed treatments, with our own Acceleron brand of seed-applied solutions now reaching more than 75 million acres, while our extensive use of markers allows us to protect the seed for many diseases through breeding traits. Further, we're enhancing these seed applied solutions with microbial treatments developed through our BioAg Alliance with Novozymes and with our plans for our Phase 4 nematicide NEMASTRIKE, which has a potential net present value now estimated at $1 billion. 
Moving to our weed control platform, through the combination of our proficiency in biotech and chemistry, we've long been the leaders in these systems with our Roundup Ready traits and our strong position in Roundup, the world's most widely used herbicide. We're again on the verge of upgrading the industry's largest trait platform with our Roundup Ready Xtend crop system across multiple crops. This includes plans to invest in dicamba production capacity and broad sourcing agreements for a molecule that we expect to become the world's second-most widely used herbicide. And beyond this, we've third and fourth generation weed control platforms in the pipeline to upgrade yet again. 
We've also transformed insect control through our biotech leadership in corn, soybeans and cotton, as evidenced by our broadly penetrated insect control traits, including SmartStax corn, Bollgard II Cotton and Intacta soybeans, with next-generation replacements already in phase 4 in the pipeline. Further, with lygus control in cotton, we're targeting to deliver the first biotech solution for piercing sucking insects that cause nearly $200 million of annual losses in U.S. cotton alone. Beyond these biotech solutions are the BioDirect RNAi technologies for future differentiated approaches to insect control. 
Finally, with the climate digital ag platform, we've the ability to integrate solutions for growers through the application of industry-leading capabilities in data science and software engineering. This year, our field health and nitrogen advisers will be available across 120 million acres in corn and soybeans in the U.S.,  and through our agreements with the leading farm equipment manufacturers and ag retailers, we've the unique ability to drive on-farm connectivity and adoption onto our FieldView platform. This will become the integrator of technologies literally row by row and acre by acre. 
To further develop these platforms, particularly in the area of crop protection solutions, we'll focus on a collaboration model that enhances our existing R&D and commercial base through licensing, partnerships, collaborations and smaller scale M&A, as shown on Slide 8. Our emphasis is on developing proprietary synergistic solutions to address unmet needs or upgrade current solutions to unlock further yield. This is about creating new value or displacing existing value in the current $57 billion global crop protection input space, and our leading seed footprint and field testing network, combined with our extensive genomics knowledge, gives us a unique advantage in attracting partners. 
So how does this look in practice? These partnerships and collaborations could range from those included in our Roundup Ready Plus program that currently reaches 50 million acres in North America to opportunities in seed treatments and in digital ag. Our R&D investment considers the development of new molecules through the same collaborative approach paired with discovery programs that leverage our genomics knowledge, similar to the science used to develop NemaStrike nematicide in just 5 short years. This unique approach also includes our fungicide development collaboration with Nimbus Therapeutics and our next-generation herbicide tolerance trait development program. 
Smaller scale M&A remains an opportunistic tool to create additional layers of growth in crop protection solutions, and we will continue to take a disciplined approach seeking strong strategic fit and synergistic value. With our pace and breadth of proven innovation, developed both internally and through broadscale partnerships and collaborations, we expect to continue to lead and define integrated solutions for the industry. And importantly, despite near-term headwinds, we remain confident in the foundation and in the milestones that we continue to deliver to make that vision a reality. 
So with that, Brett's going to highlight the progress towards these milestones. Brett?"

Despite the continuation of near-term currency and commodity price headwinds, we continue to deliver on key milestones that set up our next-generation platforms across weed, insect, disease and nutri",1725,"Thanks, Hugh, and good morning to everyone on the line. Despite the continuation of near-term currency and commodity price headwinds, we continue to deliver on key milestones that set up our next-generation platforms across weed, insect, disease and nutrition management. Today, I'd like to share those milestones, what are we seeing on the ground, and why we have the confidence in our innovation-based growth drivers. 
Let's begin with our largest and most durable platform, our global corn business. Globally, in a market challenged with extreme currency headwinds, we expect our full year gross profit to be down low to mid-single digits as a percent, with currency being the single largest driver of the decline year-over-year. We continue to expect full year corn germplasm price mix lift in local currency to be flat even after competitive discounts. And we expect the increases in volumes from share gains in the upcoming season in the southern hemisphere to potentially more than offset the incremental corn cost of goods resulting from our lowered seed production plans.
Let's take a look at some of the regional highlights, as shown on Slide 9. In the U.S., on a growing acreage base, our year 1 to 3 hybrids are tracking to 50% to 60% of the portfolio, and SmartStax remains roughly at the same percentage of the portfolio as last year. Our disciplined response to our competitors' action has been effective, as we expect to hold or grow our leading share position while maintaining the premium pricing our yield advantage garners. Further, we are planning for our new Disease Shield hybrids for the U.S. market. These products, offering a combination of genetics with disease resistance, are made possible only through our extensive investment in marker technology. They are expected to be available for the 2017 season and will be the latest solution to help farmers with industry-leading comprehensive protection against major corn diseases. 
In Brazil, we demonstrated discipline to offset some of the currency weakness, with 20%-plus germplasm price increases in local currency expected for the full year. We grew share in the first season of the year, and our VT Triple PRO product is the first to offer belowground insect protection in the country with strong conversion to the new trait platform. 
In Argentina, our share remains well above 50% in a region where acres have estimated to -- have declined 15% to 20% versus prior year. With our strong portfolio and share position, we are well positioned to participate in the expected growth in the area planted in the upcoming season. With the reduction in grain export taxes and the devaluation of the peso, we continue to be optimistic about the future prospects for agriculture in Argentina.  Finally, across Europe and Africa, we also expect to hold or grow share in a region of declining corn acres. 
Outside of these commercial milestones in global corn, we are commencing with our seed production plans for next year and expect to increase the scale from the current year, which should reduce a significant portion of the corn COGS headwinds for the next fiscal year. This creates a strong foundation from which we can continue to launch our new hybrids as well as 7 different late-stage technologies that have licensing and launch opportunities in the near future. 
Let's shift to soybeans, and specifically to Intacta, where we've had an outstanding year, achieving 35 million acres of penetration across South America, as shown on Slide 10. This is more than twice our fiscal year '15 penetration, which is a tremendous accomplishment in our third year of launch. We currently expect to reach 75 million acres by 2019 and ultimately expect the multi-generations for insect-protected soybean technology to fully penetrate the 100 million acre opportunity in South America. The trait is offered in varieties with a fit across all of Brazil, and we've expanded our seed production for 2017, increasing to greater than 70 products for Argentina. 
Our other blockbuster soybean growth driver is Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans, as shown on Slide 11. As you know, we received our China import approval back in early February and now are very pleased to see the recent opening of the EPA comment period for the in-crop use of M1691, a low volatility dicamba formulation. This marks a critical step forward for the Roundup Ready Xtend crop system. According to the EPA, this first label for in-crop use is expected by late summer to early fall, and we expect approval for the in-crop use of Xtendimax and Roundup Xtend, both with VaporGrip technology, shortly thereafter to be ready for the fiscal year '17 season. We still await final EU approval of the stacked product and continue to be frustrated by the unexpected administrative delays after receiving the European Food Safety Authority's positive opinion last June. The demand for the technology is strong, and we continue to be positioned to provide our new Roundup Ready 2 Xtend varieties for 3 million acres this year, but we are at a point where every day counts to be able to provide that experience to our growers. 
Not to be outdone, Bollgard II XtendFlex Cotton is now expected to penetrate more than 2 million acres in the U.S, as shown on Slide 12. And we anticipate that these new varieties will drive continued share gains on the order of 3 or more points, further proving the pent-up demand from farmers for our new varieties. Not only are we progressing with the key milestones for these 2 products in the Roundup Ready Xtend system, but we are moving forward in planning our potential investment in dicamba capacity, as shown on Slide 13. 
The Roundup Ready Xtend crop system will enable the upgrade of the industry's largest seed technology platform, and this investment will allow us to more fully participate in the value we create through integrated solutions. To ensure there is sufficient supply of the expected 250 million acres of opportunity in the next decade, we continue to plan for the dicamba manufacturing investment to provide cost-effective timely dicamba to our growers. This capital investment is expected to be in the range of $900 million to $1 billion over the course of 3 years. Once complete, we expect it would supply 25% to 35% of the fully mature demand and provide a return on investment in the mid-teens from incremental dicamba sales alone, accelerating to 30-plus percent when considering the total system benefits of having our own capacity and relevance in pricing. 
We expect economies of scale with proximity to the Luling plant, logistical advantages with convenient access to the Americas and a strong formulation pipeline to deliver crop safety and convenience to our growers. We also continue to balance this planned investment with supply agreements across a diversified set of producers, which has already led to some additional planned capacity. We simply are the best positioned to prime the supply pump that will be needed to fuel this blockbuster weed control system upgrade while further strengthening our integrated solutions platform. 
Before we leave our core business outlook, I wanted to highlight that we are disappointed by the recent cottonseed price control order notification in India. We, together with our partner, Mahyco, continue to challenge elements of the attempt to fix cotton trade fees and licensing terms before the High Court of Delhi and remain confident in the merits of our legal claims. While the potential impact to us is in the tens of millions of dollars, the real loss is the loss of access to new technologies for the growers in India. 
Beyond the core business drivers, I'd like to provide a brief update on our transformation status, as outlined on Slide 14. We continue to focus on scale and efficiency while still delivering outstanding innovation and customer service through the creation of our 4 commercial hubs and our R&D center of excellence in St. Louis as well as by leveraging the power in data analytics. Our continued progress with our planning and execution of our actions is further confirmation of our confidence in delivering $500 million of cost savings by fiscal year '18 and in our ability to transform our way of working. 
Moving to our new platforms, we continue to progress toward our key milestones in climate, as shown on Slide 15. We are working toward closing our most recent agreement with John Deere, still expected this fiscal year. This agreement marks our third connectivity agreement with a major equipment manufacturer, following agreements with AGCO and CNH, and is a great addition to our industry-leading retail network through the top 6 U.S. ag retailers. 
We also recently announced connectivity agreements with several agronomic and retailer software systems as well as the John Deere operations center, connecting our Climate FieldView platform to the farm management systems of more than 80% of the top retailers across the corn belt and the largest U.S. ag equipment provider. This reach and level of connectivity, combined with the capabilities of our advisers and the adoption we have secured to date, establishes Climate as the leading digital ag platform. 
We expect to continue that momentum in fiscal year '16, where we have expanded our Pro availability by more than 50% from 2015 to 120 million acres across corn and soybeans in the heart of the Midwest. With this expansion, we are making nice progress towards our targeted penetration of 12 million paid acres and platform adoption to an expected 90 million acres. 
Moving beyond the U.S, we are now expanding our in-field beta testing plans for 2017 in Brazil, and now expect our first product launch in 2 years. 
As I tie all these milestones together, it comes together quite simply. We now have the latest set of innovative agronomic tools that deliver yield along with weed, insect, disease and fertility management, and we expect the deliverables from this year to create momentum to continue to build our industry-leading platforms and integrated solutions vision. There is no doubt that fiscal year '16 is challenging, but we still -- we will emerge as a leaner and stronger organization with our best corn hybrids, our new Roundup Ready Xtend system and Intacta soybeans all poised to deliver strong growth in fiscal year '17 and beyond. 
With that, let me pass it to Pierre for the financial outlook."
528414,318280157,957708,"Monsanto Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2016",2016-04-06,"Earnings Calls","Monsanto Company","Executives","Thanks, Brett, and good morning to everyone. Not only do we continue to focus on delivering on the operational milestones Brett shared with you, but we remain focused on our financial pillars: return on innovation, financial discipline and balanced capita",1540,"Thanks, Brett, and good morning to everyone. Not only do we continue to focus on delivering on the operational milestones Brett shared with you, but we remain focused on our financial pillars: return on innovation, financial discipline and balanced capital allocation. Together, these factors should position us well to deliver on our long-term integrated solutions growth strategy. But first, let's focus on the second quarter. 
We delivered ongoing earnings per share of $2.42, in line with our guidance. And when setting aside significant currency headwinds, particularly the devaluation of the Argentine peso, it's essentially in line with the prior year. On this currency-neutral basis, the negative impact from glyphosate declines, increased discounting in the U.S. in corn and soybeans, lower soybean volumes and higher corn cost of goods were offset by the benefits from our reduced share counts, Brazil corn pricing, increased Intacta penetration and reduced operating expenses. 
From a GP margin perspective, in the second quarter, our Seeds and Genomics gross profit as a percent of net sales held flat at 54%. Global corn gross profit margins were flat as increased cost of goods from lower production plants, combined with tactical discounting to counter competitive offers, offset the mix lift benefits from new hybrid introduction and the price increases in local currencies in Brazil. 
In global soybeans, gross profit margins declined slightly as a result of Roundup Ready Xtend launch costs and the discounting in the U.S., which more than offset the benefit from increased Intacta penetration. Vegetable margins improved due to lower costs arising from improved operation. And finally, ag productivity gross profit margins declined due to lower Roundup pricing. 
As we look to the full year, we continue to expect $4.40 to $5.10 of ongoing earnings per share, as shown on Slide 16, which still assumes $0.90 to $1 of currency headwinds. On an as-reported basis, our estimates for earnings per share have improved to $3.72 to $4.48, primarily due to a change in the expected timing for the accounting of restructuring expenses. 
Let's look at the specific components of our outlook. First, we continue to target a Seed & Genomics gross profit that is relatively flat, meaning plus or minus 2% to 3% for the full year. Exclusive of estimated currency headwinds of roughly $400 million, Seeds and Genomics gross profit is estimated to be up single digits, driven primarily by the expected increase in licensing deals, increased Intacta penetration and global corn footprint expansion. We expect more than $300 million to as much as $450 million of benefits from licensing deals in fiscal year '16, mostly within these segments. 
Our Ag Productivity gross profit outlook is still expected to be roughly at the midpoint of our range of $900 million to $1.1 billion. We expect to recover some of the volume declines from the first half of the fiscal year as we continue to shift to a higher ratio of branded volumes. We could see our full year volumes somewhat softer than our roughly 300 million gallons of capacity, but we are not expecting material volume variance at this point. 
From an operating expense perspective, we remain on track to deliver $165 million to $210 million in savings from our restructuring actions in fiscal year '16. These savings, together with spending discipline and currency benefits, contribute to our expectation that operating expense will be down slightly for the year, inclusive of increased investments in new platform. 
Assuming the Argentine peso exchange rates remain close to a ratio of 1:15 at the close of the fiscal year, we still expect other expense net to increase year-over-year by approximately $180 million. The other key currency assumption underpinning our outlook assumes the Brazilian Real at a ratio of close to 1:4. Taxes continue to trend lower, potentially now even below the low end of our range of 25% to 27%. Beyond those profit drivers, the net effect of the benefit from our share repurchases, including net financing expense, should generate a net earnings per share benefit of $0.24 to $0.27, with 437 million shares outstanding at the close of our second quarter. We expect to continue to convert our earnings into cash for disciplined management of working capital and expect free cash flow for the year to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion, with investing cash outflows now expected to be in the range of $800 million to $1 billion. 
With that, let's move to how we've deployed cash and our plans for the future, as shown on Slide 17. We just closed out our $3 billion ASR in the second quarter. And since announcing our capital allocation strategy in June of '14, we have successfully deployed more than $13 billion, with more than $11 billion returned to our owners through share repurchases and dividends. Given the seasonality of our business, we expect our net debt to ongoing EBITDA ratio to peak at the end of the third quarter and end the fiscal year somewhere between our long-term target of 1.5 and a ratio of 2.0 [indiscernible] at the end of the second quarter. This capital structure continues to provide the necessary financial flexibility to pursue organic and external growth opportunities while still returning excess capital to our share owners. 
Looking ahead to fiscal year '17, we see the opportunity for strong growth in ongoing earnings per share, as shown on Slide 18. Assuming stable currencies, this expected growth is driven by our soybean innovation growth drivers, the durability of our global corn platform, continued financial discipline and improved cost of goods outlook for corn and soybeans. Our soybean innovation drivers are expected to continue record-setting adoption rates on their ramp to the target opportunity, with both Intacta and Roundup Ready Xtend soybeans anticipated to make a meaningful step-up next year. By 2019, we expect 2/3 of the U.S. acres to be penetrated by Roundup Ready Xtend soybeans and approximately 75 million acres across South America to be penetrated by Intacta. 
In addition, we expect the roughly $70 million to $80 million of Xtend launch costs to decrease significantly next fiscal year, reducing to a very low amount by the third year of commercialization. From a global corn perspective, it's still too early to estimate specific pricing and volume dynamics, but we do expect to see benefits from the launch of new hybrids globally, from expected double-digit price increases in local currency for Brazil and Argentina and from higher seed production plans. We have just completed those plans for the northern hemisphere and already expect to see a significant improvement next year that will offset part of the $90 million to $100 million of corn COGS headwinds we anticipate for this year. We will provide an updated estimate after we lock in production for the southern hemisphere and after we see our final production yields in the northern hemisphere. 
Currency is assumed to be relatively stable to today's assumption, which translates to an estimated $180 million reduction of our expenses due to the absence of the significant Argentine peso devaluation. 
On the financial discipline front, we continue to track towards the expected $375 million to $420 million of savings in fiscal year '17 from our restructuring and cost-savings initiatives. This would represent an increase of nearly $200 million in savings compared to this year's target. These savings represent only one element of the projected total spend for next year, as items such as inflation, new investments, commissions and incentives are still to be estimated, but it certainly indicates great progress towards our targeted $500 million of savings by fiscal year '18. 
Finally, while we still expect to see licensing opportunities in fiscal year '17, it is too early to estimate their impact, but it could be lower than this year as we expect a higher-than-typical contribution in '16. 
This growth opportunity extends beyond fiscal year '17, as we continue to target a baseline mid-teens compounded annual growth rate for our ongoing EPS from the midpoint of the fiscal year '16 guidance to fiscal year '19. This baseline projection, while likely not linear, is built upon continued momentum from the corn and soybean growth drivers we just outlined, continued benefits from financial discipline in our capital allocation strategy, the assumption that ag productivity gross profit will remain in today's expected range; and importantly, an outlook for currency and commodity price that anticipates little to no change from today's assumption. 
That being said, any appreciable improvement in these variables could accelerate us back to our earlier track of greater than 20% compounded annual growth rate in this time frame. However, as CFO, I continue to believe it is more prudent to wait for the evolution of the northern hemisphere's crop season to reassess. 
My focus remains unchanged, return on innovation, financial discipline and balanced capital allocation. These, together with a sound and disciplined approach to delivering on our integrated solutions strategy, supports long-term growth, expanding industry-leading EBITDA margins and return of value to our share owners. Continuing to execute well on these pillars, along with delivering on the innovation in our pipeline, provides the gateway to rapid future business growth. 
Thank you for your time today. I'll now turn it back to Laura for the Q&A."

I think what hasn't changed throughout this time is we still believe there's an opportunity for the integrated solutions. We still think there is an opportunity around bringing chemistry and biology together on that acre and using data science as the glue that holds that together. So that's been unwavering. We continue -- in fact, I'd say, the more we see, the more we believe that that's an opportunity. And when you look at how growers are challenged at the moment, they're desperate for those kind of solutions. I'd say, we also believe that we've got a strong independent strategy. So it's tough in ag at the moment, but even in tough times, growers are reaching for the best technology that they can possibly find. So I need -- I need to be really clear on this. We saw an opportunity with Syngenta, and that opportunity was to accelerate that process, but it was never contingent or dependent on it. So we -- Syngenta is gone. We will not and we would not have done an overpriced deal. So I think now we are looking at how we get to the same destination, but using a different path. And I think the way of getting there is going to be driven more on a product-by-product basis. It's going to be driven by collaboration, bringing other people's chemistry up on that acre. And I think it's going to be driven by some of the work that we underscored this morning, like the new nematicide from NEMASTRIKE, and frankly, some of the new smaller companies out there, like Nimbus Therapeutics. So we're not anchored on the methodology, but I do think we're anchored on the opportunity set. And the reality today is I think we're better placed than our competitors to integrate those 3 pieces together because our belief in this is data science is going to be the anchor that pulls it together. So this isn't being -- this hasn't been a cost synergy or tax play, this has been about growth and creating new value and developing new insights for the grower. So that's why I made the comments this morning we need to get real. The landscape has shifted, and we need to focus on driving that integration by other means."

We're sitting here in the spring of a new year still waiting, so an unusually slow delay even for Europe and very frustrating. The good news is we got the green light for Chinese import approvals in February, and then that was compounded last week, I guess, by the beginning of the consultation period here in the U.S. for the first formulation. So the last, last piece in this is the administrative sign-off through the EU. All the science is done. All the heavy lifting is done. So it's that rubber stamp, but frustrating. And we're at a point now where days count, and so the spring is -- it looks like one of these springs that's setting up dry in a lot of places, has got the potential of stretching out, but we've got our retail and growers desperately hoping that they get a chance to take a sneak peek at this technology and frustrated by European bureaucrats. So it's very unfortunate. We're now in contingency planning.

This is the challenge now with the EFSA's kind of, call it, slowdown, and that's why it's so frustrating, is it limits the farmers' appetite to be willing to try the varieties. And to Hugh's point, the days will matter. And it's all about now how much we'll be able to accelerate for next year and how much exposure can we get for the farmers this year to get to see them.

It was an expensive exercise for everybody. And so to Brett and Pierre's point, here's how we're thinking about next year. Philosophically, our pricing discipline and our price to the value that we create, we will maintain that approach. It's hard to call at this stage where commodity prices will be. We'll get some time as we see how this year's spring and harvest shapes up. But the ethos of bringing incremental bushels and pricing against those is something that we will maintain next year. And we've seen growers from our order books this year, albeit at lower prices because they're under tremendous pressure, we've seen growers reaching for those level 1, level 2, level 3 hybrids, which is an indication that they are going to look for the best technology. So at this stage, based on what we've seen and what we've experienced, competitive pricing notwithstanding, we will stay the course that's worked for us for the last decade-plus."

But generally speaking, exactly to Hugh's point, the farmer's looking at it as what's it costing me to control weeds today and what's it going to cost me to control weeds tomorrow with the new system. And the really cool thing about dicamba is they all know it, it's been around for a long time, and they feel very comfortable with that technology. So when you look at it today, they're spending substantially more to control weeds, for example, in soybeans than they would have been spending a few years ago because of the resistant weeds. Tomorrow, they'll be able to spend less, because they'll use less other herbicides. We'll still encourage them to use multiple molecules, but they'll use less to control their weeds. So it'll be a good deal for farmers then they look at the total benefit of the old system, both looking at seed and the chemistry package."

It's hard to plant, and the price change that occurred with the announcement of the corn-expected planting, beans look pretty attractive now. So -- and then you have the weather. And I always say, by the time you get to April, the weather between now and the end of May will have a whole lot more to do with how many acres of corn actually end up getting planted than what the farmers' intentions are to -- based on from a generalization. They're not going to swing a whole lot from where they already intended to plant. And our order book would say the weren't quite as bullish on corn as the USDA, but we'll see how that one plays out.

I mean, over time, rebuilding from the currency, the -- if you look at the calendar year -- at the fiscal year, unfortunately what happened to us is with the pricing from last season, so entering into the first quarter, a big part of our Brazilian business happened before we took those actions because, as you know, we price, in Brazil, in the fourth quarter for a season that goes into fourth and first quarter. So when you look at our fiscal year this year, the real loss for us regarding Brazil was the first quarter when we didn't have any pricing offsets. When you get into the safrinha season and the summer season to come, definitely what you're mentioning is totally valid. That's exactly what we are trying to do.

There's another piece of this, though, that I think is also relevant. As it becomes harder to control some of the tough-to-control weeds and you have to spray more herbicides, you have more risk of challenging the crop with the additional herbicides as well as the lack of weed control also damages the yield. As you clean up that field, the farmer is going to see the benefit of that as well.

Good morning to those on the phone and on thanks very much for joining us today. Today, in a departure from our previous calls, I'd like to open with a few brief comments and then pass it to Pierre, who will address our third quarter results and the outlook for the year, followed by the operational outlook for fiscal year '17 and beyond with Brett. At the end of this call, I will close by covering our longer-term strategic view and my perspective on our unique integrated solutions vision for agriculture. 
But first, let me address the Bayer proposal and other strategic alternatives directly. Over the past several weeks, with the support of our board and advisers, I've personally been in discussions with Bayer's management regarding this proposal, along with others regarding other strategic alternatives. Regarding Bayer Specifically, there's no formal update at this point. We've said that we remain open, and we believe that our efforts and continued constructive dialogue could allow our joint teams to explore potential next steps. By any value discussion is more complex given the fact that the industry is running at a low point in the ag cycle, we recognize the potential value these types of combinations create as they accelerate innovation and increase choice for farmers across a broader set of crops, geographies and production practices while improving the sustainability of agriculture around the world. We continue to believe in the value potential of the right combination. Of course, there can be no assurance that these discussions will lead to any transaction nor on what terms. It's clear that Monsanto remains the partner of choice in this industry, and I assure you that we'll continue to actively explore these opportunities and pursue value-enhancing strategic options. 
Our belief in the long-term opportunity is unchanged, and our growth prospects beyond fiscal year '16 with or without a deal remain strong. The global ag cycle is at a point, and we've seen a series of recent economic and political challenges. These are huge events around the world that create unstability. Today, however, we see potential for positive resolution on the horizon for some of these challenges, particularly for our Argentinian soybean business, for our Roundup Ready Xtend soybean blockbuster and the recent announcement on reregistration of [indiscernible] in Europe. At this tide turns and turn up well, with the changes that we've made to our business, we'll be well positioned to strengthen our leadership role in this space with our financial discipline and our steadfast commitment to innovation. 
So with that, let me pass it to Pierre."

Despite the fact that this has been a tough year and this was a tough quarter given the events that you alluded to, as a company, we've remain focused on delivering on our strategy while taking the necessary act",1831,"Thanks, Hugh, and good morning to everyone. Despite the fact that this has been a tough year and this was a tough quarter given the events that you alluded to, as a company, we've remain focused on delivering on our strategy while taking the necessary actions to set the stage for future growth as illustrated by the following. We have stayed true to our philosophy of pricing to the value of our innovation. We have delivered on significant strategic portfolio management and licensing commitments, resulting in an approximate $370 million EBIT contribution for this fiscal year as compared to $274 million in 2015. We are tracking very well towards our restructuring plan savings at a cost now closer to the low end of the range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion while transforming and modernizing the way we work. And we have delivered on our capital allocation commitment. This demonstrates our ability to maintain our focus on the variables we control despite an unprecedented level of challenges affecting our business. These actions set us up nicely for momentum going into the anticipated return in the ag cycle with an expected return to growth in earnings per share in fiscal year '17, which accelerates to a mid-teens earnings per share growth rate from fiscal year '17 to '21. 
With that, let's focus on here and now and review our third quarter results as shown on Slide 4 and 5. On an as-reported basis, our third quarter earnings per share is $1.63, reflecting $0.54 for restructuring charges, environmental and litigation matters and a charge for Argentine-related tax matters. The Argentine-related tax matter resulted in a charge of $219 million, which refers primarily to a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, mostly driven by recent commodity losses in our Argentine subsidiary. With growth in the business, we would expect to see this allowance reverse partially or in full over time. On an ongoing basis, this translates into $2.17 of earnings per share, over partly offset by the benefits of share repurchases and increase row crop licensing EBIT contributions, we encountered several headwinds in the quarter. These included the expected absence of last year's crop licensing agreements and the anticipated life declines but also Roundup Ready Xtend-related cost and lower soybean volumes, amplified by the delay in EU import approval as well as lower cotton gross profit in India arising from pricing regulations and declines in planted acres. 
Finally, our free cash flow year-to-date is a sue of $234 million as compared to a use of $789 million in the prior year, reflecting strong working capital management. From a year-to-date perspective, our Syngenta gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was nearly flat at 62%. Global corn gross profit margin was down just slightly as increased COGS from lower production plan, combined with discounting to counter competitive offers, more than offset the mix benefit from new hybrid introductions at price increases in local currency in regions like Brazil. 
In global soybeans, gross profit margins declined approximately 3 percentage points, primarily as a result of cost associated with Roundup Ready Xtend launch, which were amplified by the delayed European import approval. These more than offset the pricing benefit from increasing pent-up penetration that was partly masked by the weak reais at a critical point in the season. Our cotton business gross profit margin production was due primarily to Indian pricing controls that were enacted in the third quarter of this fiscal year, while margins improved due to lower cost arising from better operations. 
And finally, our other crops segment margins improved with closure of the licensing deal with ForEx Genetics. 
Moving to Ag Productivity. Gross profit margins declined due to the lower Roundup pricing and the absence of the $274 million licensing deal with Scotch. Looking forward, we are seeing signs of a positive resolutions for several of the headwinds we've been tracking. First, the EU Commission just affirmed that an 18-month extension of the existing authorization for glyphosate use would be completed by the June 30 deadline. In addition, we anticipate the receipt of the EU import approval from Roundup Ready Xtend shortly thereafter. And finally, Argentina announced an interim policy that supports mandatory testing for Intacta, leading into what we expect to be a strong start for our Southern Hemisphere business. 
However, despite these positive developments and expectations, with the result of the third quarter, we now expect to be at the low end of our ongoing fiscal year '16 earnings per share range of $4.40 to $5.10, which assumes approximately $0.85 of currency headwinds. After the inclusion of the Argentine-related tax matters and the favorable change in the expected amount and timing of restructuring expense, this translate into a full year as reported earnings per share guidance at the low end of an adjusted range of $3.36 to $4.14. 
Now let's take a look at the individual components within our 2016 guidance as shown on Slide 6. First, with recent revisions, we expect [indiscernible] to be down just under 5% for the full year. Importantly, exclusive of estimated currency headwinds of roughly $350 million, [indiscernible] gross profit margin is expected to be flat to up slightly. Practically, on a currency-neutral basis, we expect the benefit of alfalfa license, increasing pent-up penetration in global corn volumes to offset the roughly $150 million impact of the Roundup Ready Xtend soybeans related cost and share loss, the impact of the pricing controls in India cotton and decline in planted acres there. Of the approximately $370 million of EBIT benefits from licensing and strategic deals expected in fiscal year '16, we recorded approximately $210 million in gross profit, reflecting the onetime upfront fee related to our of alfalfa trade and license and technology license to [indiscernible] Genetics International. We expect the remainder of the EBIT benefit, which is mostly derived from the expected $145 million gain from the soybean joint venture and plant sale to be recorded in other income in the fourth quarter. 
Our Ag Productivity gross profit outlook is now trending towards the lower end of our range of $900 million to $1.1 billion as earlier estimates had assumed that one of our smaller licensing and asset sale deal would benefit gross profit that was ultimately recorded in other income. For the full year, we continue to expect to sell the higher ratio of branded Roundup volume as compared to the prior fiscal year. However, we expect that full year volumes will be below our roughly 300 million gallons of capacity but not to the point of generating material volume variances. From a price perspective, our competitive intelligent leads us to believe that we are nearing the bottom for generic glyphosate pricing in the market, and we are not expecting significant moves from this point forward. We remain on track to deliver $165 million to $210 million in savings from our restructuring actions in fiscal year '16, primarily benefiting operating expenses. The savings, combined with spending discipline and currency benefits, contribute to our expectation that even after increased investments in new platform, we expect to see operating spend down slightly before estimated restructuring charges and environmental and litigation matters. 
Assuming the Argentine pesos exchange rates remain closer to ratio of 1:14 at the close of the fiscal year, we now expect over expense net to be relatively flat year-over-year as the nearly $180 million impact from the devaluation in Argentina is now being offset by gains on noncore asset sales of approximately $170 million. 
Our tax rate is expected to increase to 32% to 34% for the full year inclusive of Argentine-related tax matter. Looking out 2 fiscal year '17, we expect our tax rate to be in the more range of 25% to 27%, which is more aligned to recent prior years. Finally, the net effect of the benefit from our share repurchases, including net finance expense, should generate a net earnings per share benefit of $0.20 to $0.25 with 437 million shares outstanding at the close of our third quarter. 
Consistent with our updated earnings projections and based on the possible slight delay in the close of the sale of the precision ag equipment business to John Deere, we now adjusted our free cash flow guidance for the year to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion as shown on Slide 7. At the peak of our working capital cycle and as for the successful execution of the $3 billion accelerated stock share repurchase in the second quarter, our net debt to ongoing EBITDA ratio sits at 2.6 at the close of the third quarter. We expect this to revert to ratio in the range of 2.1 to 2.2 at the end of the fiscal year following strong expected collections. 
Looking ahead to fiscal year '17 and assuming relatively stable foreign currencies, we expect a return to growth in earnings per share as shown on Slide 8. As we shared at Q2, our expectation is that our long-term growth would not be linear, with next year at a slower pace as we recover and reset the trajectory with the early days of Roundup Ready Xtend penetration. This expected growth is driven by the continued penetration of our soybean blockbusters, the durability of our global corn platform and an improved cost of goods outlook for both corn and soybeans. From a year-over-year perspective, this growth is expected to be partially offset by decline in glyphosate pricing, particularly in the first half of fiscal year '17 via lower level of noncore licensing deals and by a slight increase in spend, with inflation and expected increases in commissions and incentives offsetting the benefits from our restructuring plan. We also expect a more normalized effective tax rate of 25% to 27% for the coming fiscal year. Once we get a better line of sight on the closure of the Northern Hemisphere crop season and finalize our operational plans, we will provide a more refined outlook for '17. 
Beyond fiscal year '17, the opportunity significantly accelerates as the growth drivers of '17 are expected to expand, continuing to generate the best margins amongst our ag peers with streamline operations and portfolio advantages driving our multilayered growth into the next decade. We continue to target a mid-teens compounded annual growth rate in earnings per share from fiscal year '17 now advancing to fiscal year '21 from fiscal year '19 as we move our long-range plan and march forward. Practically, our estimated EPS for fiscal year '19 has not changed significantly from our previous guidance. We are now simply expanding the horizon. 
In closing, our financial focus remains consistent: return on innovation, financial discipline and balanced capital allocation. These, together with a sound and disciplined approach delivering on our integrated solution strategy, support long-term growth and industry-leading ongoing EBITDA margins and return on capital as shown on Slide 9. 
With that, I will pass it to Brett to walk through the operational outlook. Brett?"

While there are factors contributing to a dynamic environment in ag today, our organization is focused on delivering against the milestones that set the foundation for rapid growth and, importantly, with an optimized operating cost structure. This focus is balanced across our broad portfolio and key growth drivers as outlined on Slide 10, whether it is our seed business, crop protection or Climate, all of which I'll update you on today and our outlook for fiscal year '17. 
Let's begin with soybeans on Slide 11. Our soybean innovation drivers are expected to continue record-setting adoption rates toward their target opportunity, with both Intacta and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans anticipated to make a meaningful step-up in penetration next year. 
Let's start with 100 million-acre insect protection opportunity in South America, where we are on a good path to penetrate 75 million acres by fiscal year '19. After achieving unexpected 35 million acres of Intacta Roundup Ready 2 PRO technology penetration across South America this year, we now believe that Intacta will be planted on 45 million to 55 million acres in South America and fiscal year '17. A royalty collection system in Argentina that operates consistently and with integrity would move us to the high end of that range. 
Moving to Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans on Slide 12. We now estimate that our introduction this year is just above 1 million acres across our brands and licensees. Despite the repeated delays on the EU import approval, which we expect shortly, we know that farmers want the technology, and we're producing aggressively to be in a strong position for the coming selling season. To that end, our brands and licensees have plans in place to supply roughly 15 million acres of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans in fiscal year '17. In addition, we expect roughly $150 million of incremental cost and soybeans share losses related to the launch and subsequent delays in the EU import approval to decrease by 2/3 next year. To enable the full benefits of the system, there's also good progress on the herbicide approvals as well. The EPA's public comment period for the over-the-top use of dicamba herbicide closed late last month, and we're happy to share that to date, of the more than 850 comments posted so far, more than 75% of those are comments from growers, dealers, academics and others in support of the new use. The EPA has indicated they expect to conclude that the process for approval of the label for in-crop use of dicamba formulations by late summer to early fall. 
Our plans to enable a reliable supply of those dicamba formulations at our Louisiana facility continue. And in the interim, we have supply agreements in place to meet the demand for what we envision will be the #2 molecule in crop protection behind [indiscernible] From a global corn perspective, as shown on Slide 13, the fact that stands out is the durability of the portfolio in a challenging environment. This is illustrated by the expectation that we held or grew our global genetic share. Although our global germplasm price/mix, excluding currency, is expected to be down slightly for this fiscal year with anticipated stable to improving corn acres in commodity prices, we expect to see global price/mix lift move to the positive in fiscal year '17. As we finalize our price guards, we'll share more. This lift is then expected to accelerate in later years due to performance from breeding gains. 
We also expect improved cost of goods for a more normalized seed production plants, leading 3 significant reduction in the $90 million to $100 million of headwinds we experienced this year. As 
we review by region, let's look first at the U.S. We expect planted acres to be in the range of 91 million to 92 million acres, and we expect to grow our genetic share on that footprint, delivering the second highest year of U.S. corn sales volume in the history of the company. With new generations from our advanced breeding programs and the next generations of corn insect control traits coming from SmartStax PRO and towards the end of this plan, our U.S. business looks promising. In Europe, with an estimated 8 points of share gain in the past 8 years, we look forward to continuing to be the fastest-growing corn seed brand in the region. In Argentina, with an expected lift in commodity prices and reduction in export taxes, we believe that corn acres in the country could increase greater than 20%. Given our historic share in Argentina corn, this bodes well for the season ahead and beyond. In Brazil, we also see the outlook improving. We expect that acres planted with corn will increase in the mid-single digits and that the ramp-up of VT Triple PRO traded hybrids will continue again in 2017 as farmer trade up to better insect control. I'm also pleased to share that for the upcoming summer season in brazil, we expect double-digit germplasm price increases in local currency, coming on the back of 20% plus price increases in Brazil for fiscal year '16, offsetting some of the currency downside. 
Other notable developments occurred in our complementary crops as outlined on Slide 14. I'll begin with our U.S. cotton business. The latest addition to that portfolio is Bollgard II XtendFlex Cotton in its second year of launch. We expect it to be on about 3 million acres in U.S. this year or 4x last year's acres. With strong farmer demand for Bollgard II XtendFlex and our new cotton varieties, we expect to gain 3 or more brand share points this year or 6 points in the last 2 years. Our vegetable business is also experiencing positive momentum and operational excellence we manage and supply well, now boasting the lowest inventory in 7 years while delivering nice GP growth exclusive of currency. 
In our Ag Productivity segment, we're maintaining our emphasis on cost discipline and portfolio optimization. As we near the anticipated bottom of the generic pricing cycle here in the fourth quarter, we expect the pricing comparison for the first half of next fiscal year to be a headwind. However, this should be partially motivated by some expected volume recovery for the full year. 
Let's transition to Climate, as shown on Slide 15. Last month, we provided an update that highlighted how we're on track for our targeted penetration of more than 12 million paid acres. That number is now expected to be more than 13 million paid acres for fiscal year '16. Overall, we are seeing paid offerings up more than 2.5x versus prior year and now expect to continue that momentum into fiscal year '17 with targeted penetration of 25 million acres with paid services, nearly doubling this year's results. It's clear that farmers are seeing the value that The Climate field platform provides, and that step-up to paid acres builds from the total platform footprint for the technology, which is also ahead of target at more than 92 million acres. More than 75% of those platform acres are with growers who are monthly active users of our digital tools. In addition to strong product penetration results, recent farmer survey results indicate that growers now identify The Climate field new platform as the #1 digital ag brand in the industry. Global expansion of Climate FieldView is also on track, with a pre-launch in Brazil this fall and a launch in Eastern Canada in the spring of 2017. Climate has now forged partnerships across more than 10 retail, software and equipment platforms, with these relationship serving as yet another strategic differentiator. One of the significant agreements is with John Deere, and we're on track to launch our in-cap connectivity offering with Deere's new wireless data server technology for the 2016 fall harvest. 
In our other new technology platform, led by our BioAg Alliance with Novozymes, we're testing microbes this year on a scale that's unmatched in the industry. On the same time, we are preparing to the launch of our first alliance microbial seed treatment for corn, which demonstrated a greater than 4-bushel average yield advantage in fiscal year '15 field trials. This upstream corn inoculant will be marketed under the Acceleron brand in the U.S. and as Jumpstart XL in remaining geographies. As this product expands to additional crops, it has the potential to penetrate approximately 100 million acres by 2025, making it one of the largest biological products in the ag industry. 
Last but no less important is an update on our continued spend discipline as outlined on Slide 16. Our savings are on track. And with lower estimated cost, we're looking to continue to drive efficiency through the business. We continue to track towards the expected $500 million of savings from our restructuring and cost savings initiatives by fiscal year '18, reaching an expected $375 million to $420 million by fiscal year '17. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Hugh."

I'll focus from here forward on the strategic outlook for our business. I mentioned at the outset that our view about what's to come hasn't changed. Despite ongoing industry dynamics and recent challenges, there's one unwavering constant",1011,"Thank you, Brett. I'll focus from here forward on the strategic outlook for our business. I mentioned at the outset that our view about what's to come hasn't changed. Despite ongoing industry dynamics and recent challenges, there's one unwavering constant which is our commitment to an integrated solution strategy that bring seeds, traits, chemistry and data science tools to farmers around the world. We're uniquely placed with our seed position and our digital ag platform with Climate. We believe that this strategy will create tremendous value for society, for farmers and for our owners as outlined on Slide 17. And the world's going to need it. The long-term demand trends remain robust and reinforced by the most recent report. It indicates that year-over-year global demand growth for soybeans and corn continues to be strong, with another 1 billion bushels of corn needed for the year ahead. Beyond that, we see robust demand continuing for decades to come. 
The need to help farmers meet that demand through sustainable intensification of agronomic solutions remains a global priority. We continue to see innovation in agriculture as being the answer to satisfy these demand curves as well as the differentiator in unlocking incremental yield from existing acres. We are best positioned to answer that need. Our leadership in this area is evidenced by the industry's most proven pipeline, with up to $25 billion [ph] and expect that peak net sales and corn platforms alone. By better integrating these technological advances, this approach will allow farmers to maximize yield, minimize risk, improved sustainability and optimize their overall profit as selecting the right seed traits and weed, insect and disease control, with accurate data insights so the farmers can manage their operations not just acre by acre but increasingly, row by row. And so unique innovation offer that underpins our own strong stand-alone growth plan as well as the industrial logic for Bayer's proposal to acquire Monsanto as shown on Slide 18. It starts with our leading seed and trait platform that reaches more than 400 million acres globally and strong our leading germplasm share in corn, soybeans, cotton and vegetables globally. For the world's largest seller of seed applied solutions, we're enhancing our Acceleron seed treatments with plans for our new Phase 4 [indiscernible] as well as with microbial treatments developed through our BioAg Alliance with Novozymes. 
Finally, Climate has emerged as the digital ag platform, driven by fundamental competitive advantages, Climate uniquely combine core data and software capabilities, broad commercial reach and unprecedented adoption, all of which we'll continue to build as the integrated hub for seeds, traits and chemistries, and that's really recognized by others in our industry. To further expand the value of this innovation platform, our technology organization has moved forward with unprecedented trials of next-generation technology in the lab and in the field. Overall, this is stacking up to be  another stellar year with projections of the fourth year in a row with more than 20 phase advancements. You'll get a chance to see our next wave of innovation at [indiscernible] in August 17 and 18, so mark your calendars to plan to join us for this event. 
To further enhance our unique position to deliver the integrated solution strategy, we're continually optimizing our portfolio as shown on Slide 19. As a part of this optimization and further bolstering our position as a partner of choice and innovation, we've recently entered into several distinct technology agreements. Some contribute directly to the bottom line in fiscal year '16, and importantly, they all contribute to our long-term vision. So let's take a quick look at some of the most significant agreements. We just announced that DuPont Pioneer is a new licensee of the Antarctic trait stack pending Brazil approvals, which is yet another endorsement of the strength of this rapidly penetrating technology. We exclusively licensed our alfalfa traits and technologies to [indiscernible] Genetics International, and we're in the process of forming a strategic joint venture with Remington Holding Company to more effectively manage our sorgum germplasm assets. Both transactions unlock value and create R&D focus while still generating new technologies for our broad customers in a collaborative manner. 
We also recently negotiated and signed several agreements that coupled with our own internally developed proprietary technologies and expect to accelerate and enhance the drive to the next generation of seed and trait solutions. Finally, consistent with our collaborative approach to new chemistry solution development, as shown on Slide 20, we announced a new agreement with Sumitomo Chemical Company to establish future generation weed control traits stacks in several crops. It features a new PPO chemistry appeared with the related tolerance gene that not only overcomes wheat resistance issues but also controls problematic wheats. Importantly, this new herbicide in trait are being developed in parallel, allowing farmers to access the benefits of this technology earlier than a more traditional, sequential development approach. We plan to announce other chemistry collaboration in the near future as we continue to evaluate additional opportunities to drive returns around our innovation and align our portfolio to our integrated solutions mission. 
Pierre touched on this earlier and as I wrap up, I think it bears repeating. Our continued commitment to operate as the most innovative company in this space with a foundation of disciplined spend and portfolio management will position us well for the expected rebound in our industry. Many in this industry have [indiscernible] integrated strategies, but we believe we're the best positioned to make this strategy a reality. With our truly unique asset position in traits, seeds and digital ag as well as our pace and our breadth of program innovation, we expect to continue to lead and define integrated solutions for agriculture while continuing to deliver industry-leading ongoing EBITDA margins and return on capital across our peer set, along with strong cash flow to fuel future growth as shown on Slide 21. Quite simply, this is what makes partnering with Monsanto today such as an attractive unique proposition. 
So with that, Laura, let's move to the Q&A session."

So Intacta traits on 44 million to 55 million acres, as Brett mentioned, this is our assumptions today, and the demand in the market is still very strong. So we see this one as a key driver for growth. We also anticipate that Xtend on 50 million acres next year, so that's also something that will carry us into '17 with momentum. And we also anticipate that some of the headwinds we have this year, we said 1 -- 2/3 of the headwinds we've been seeing this year related to the launch of Xtend will disappear. It's about $100 million of benefits we are anticipating next year. We also mention cost of goods momentum in both corn and soy. And there, again, around $100 million there. And the return to positive pricing in corn. On top of that obviously, our assumption is, right now, we're not going to be seeing the devaluation in Argentina comparable to what we've seen this year. So these are done all the positive elements that we see as building momentum entering into '17. However, we have to balance those with a couple of other things we are actually watching at this point in time. What we expect is that we will have a tough comparison in glyphosate, mostly in the first part of the year. our anticipation is that glyphosate pricing is going to stay pretty much where it is right now. And if you look at the first half of fiscal year '16, we enjoyed pricing. We're higher than when they are today. So we anticipate this one to be a tough comp for us entering into '17. The other elements that we highlighted today is that from a deals perspective, so this year, we have the benefit of $370 million in deals. We are not anticipating at this point in time, based on the portfolio of opportunities we have in front of us, that the deals are going to be of that magnitude next year. And we'll give a little more Clarity on that, I mean, when we have our operation plans in place. Tax rate will also be a little more challenging next year. I mean, based on what we are looking at right now. And we also have to balance the benefit of our restructuring actions with inflationary increase, increased commissions based on the success of our channel model in the U.S. and obviously South America and also incentives. So if you add to that the impact of India on our cotton business, these are the things we want to clarify, and that's why, as you mentioned, we wanted to be cautious entering into '17, although, as you mentioned, we also see a lot of tailwinds there."

I think, P.J., if you think about our highest premium product that we sell across the U.S., it's our SmartStax products. And as we look at this year, SmartStax is going to make up a similar percentage to our overall business as in last year. So I do",331,"Yes. I think, P.J., if you think about our highest premium product that we sell across the U.S., it's our SmartStax products. And as we look at this year, SmartStax is going to make up a similar percentage to our overall business as in last year. So I do not see farmers trading down. We have farmers on the fringes of warm areas that may trade down, but it's not material. We had to make some adjustments in our pricing ladder that we talked about last year to adjust for the significant pullback in the commodity price, of which now we're seeing rebound a little bit. And we had to address some of the competitive issues in the marketplace, which we did, I would argue very, effectively. And that's why I'm confident today to say that actually for genitive share, we're upping for brand share. We held our own on the marketplace. So I feel really good about how we ended up in the U.S. corn business. And when I look at South America, boy, farmers are not slowing down there at all. We're seeing -- we took a significant price increases in corn last year in Brazil. We're doing it again this year. Now granted, there's a currency offset and it's not offsetting all of it, but farmers are quickly moving to our new Triple PRO in Brazil to get better control. So I think even in these challenging times, farmers look for the best seed, the best traits to drive productivity on their farm and they need it more than ever. And I think we see that this year. It's really disappointing that we ended up with ongoing delays with the EU, but I have to tell you farmers were lined up to by the Xtend technology this year, and I'm really optimistic about that when next year. So tough conditions do not slow down farmers' appetite. As you said, they're looking for ways to drive productivity and profitability."

The expectations were 85 million acres, and the market ended up being 83 million. So you saw a lot of returns in the third quarter. Right now, people are looking at the market more in the range of 82 million. So this is also this element of timing, the huge return that happened last year. And at the end of the fourth quarter, that's also driving some of the comps when you're looking at the Q3. But definitely, the delay can expense from a cost perspective but also from last year perspective has been the big impact in our third quarter."

As I'm sure you understand, there's a limit to what I can talk about because these have been private conversations. But let me try and give you a little bit the landscape to the last piece your point. I think it's complex because we're at the low point of the ag cycle. And I think the tone in some of the comments today, we see some of the early signs of this cycle beginning to turn. As we look at the Bayer proposal and as we examine some of the other strategic alternatives that have emerged, I'm personally engaged in those discussions along with the board to support the board and their advisers. And I would say this gets down to 2 things. It gets down to value, and it gets down to certainty. So we are convinced the longer this runs, we are convinced in the value of that integrated strategy. We spent a bit of time talking about it today. And we are convinced that we have a unique position as an integrator because of our seed or unique position in seed and the emerging strength of our data science position. So in 2 short years, I think you've seen Climate transition from theory to reality, and I think in the next 2 years, that becomes even more important. So as we look at the trough, as we look at the Bayer proposal and some of these other strategic alternatives, we are focused, my team and I, we're focused very, very clearly on creation of shareholder value. And that's where this begins, and it's where it ends. So we're going to take a very rational approach to this. Bear in mind where this cycle is and the need for value-creation, and we're going to really -- we're going to really focus on the uniqueness of Monsanto and its part as a key integrator. So I don't know if that answers your question. There's probably a scope of what I can discuss on the call."

So real briefly, our strategy isn't where it started, but in the early days of working with the Climate in San Francisco, they were very adamant and they were right that this is about driving our experience. And in the early days, it's about delighting growers and sharing the insights with them. So as Brett talked about, 95 million acres up on the platform. The first round of this for us, David, was gain experience and the same way that all apps are developed, so gain in experience and let growers work with us on their farms and their fields. The Nitrogen Advisor has been additional functionality, and we have priced for that. And in the last 2 short years, we've got all of U.S. retail distribution up on the platform. We then -- we're in discussion concluded machinery manufacturers. And I think the next natural step in this is to see some competitive companies and some alternative offerings up in that platform as well. So the grower experience -- he doesn't need multiple iPads in the cab. And I think as we move through this progression, then price -- pricing to value and retain in the piece of that value in the same way that we've done with traits becomes a natural next step. And that's, I think, the experience 15 years of trait development blends beautifully into the next handful of years on the data science development and how we brought the license this platform with others."

So I feel good about our position though and our cost position and how we're competing in that industry. We're down a little bit on volumes this year, but I think that we're going to recover those back next year as we see the momentum building across the marketplace. So we're in a good place.

They basically use the grain up to buy their inputs. In the case of Brazil, keep in mind how currency has impacted our business negatively. It helps put the Brazilian farmer in a pretty good position right now. Buying in local currency and selling in U.S. dollars is not a bad place for them. So we feel okay. I mean, with all the disruption that's occurred in Brazil in the last year, I'm actually optimistic about Brazil right now. With position of the farmer and their ability to access credit and buy products, farming looks good. And we've got Intacta, and we've got strong corn business that's growing, and we've priced up in the environment and it seems to be holding. So we look good in South America. When you get to Eastern Europe, it's a mixed deck over there. In the Far East, there are some real challenges, call them geopolitical challenges in Ukraine. We've tended to manage our credit very aggressively. In other words, we don't extend a lot of credit, and we seem to be doing quite okay over there. That has impacted some of the pricing. Some of the farmers have gone to lower-priced seed that which has impacted our global pricing. But overall, we're in a good place, and we continue to be conservative on how we manage the credit."

It's difficult to comment but we are an agricultural business. We develop the technology on a 10-year horizon. We've been in existence for about 15 years, so you can't -- we've done many of these calls together over the years. You can look at the downcycle in an ag economy. Farmers would never farm if they saw about the peaks and troughs. So you have to see through that when you're either buying a farm or if you're developing technology. So I guess the headline in this is, if you're valuing a unique company like Monsanto, I would argue you can't look 1 quarter. You can't look at a year. You need to take a 10- or a 20-year view, and that's how we develop technologies, and that's when you look at the promise -- when you look at the promise of Climate or you look at the value the pipeline that Robb and his team developed, I think you have to take that long view. We've been very clear since May that we were open to these discussions, but that the value had to be reflected in the company and the proposition that we have. And the Bayer proposal was financially inadequate. We are looking at that proposal relative to other strategic alternatives. But you have to take the long view on this because the vagaries of commodity markets are either punishing or they develop elation, but you had to take a line on that. That's what we've always felt our resource models. That's how we've always built these products on a 7- and a 10-year development cycle. And that's how we will look at -- I guess I would finish by saying, we are absolutely committed to optimizing shareowner value, and we will look at the proposal in hand and we will evaluate these other strategic alternatives against that benchmark. That's what we need to do. Thank you for your question. And with that, I want to thank you for your patience because we were a little bit tardy in finishing today. Let me just make 2 or 3 points at the risk of repetition, and it kind of ties to Jeff's last point on the call. 2016 has been a challenging year for our industry, it's been a challenging year for the company, but our core businesses have done well but have suffered from some regulatory delays that we're beginning to see, a little on the call today, we're beginning to see turn. Despite this, innovation in this industry is needed, and it's recognized by growers. And I think today, we're uniquely placed as a key player in any integrated platform strategy. So regardless of how that integration strategy plays out, we have a central role in that. So as I mentioned on the last question, I'm personally committed to the optimizing -- optimization of shareholder value. So we really pleased that you joined us this morning. We are moving forward with preparation for the social stock, and we hope to see you there on August 17 and 18. And if I was you, I'd be booking the slots soon because those are hot tickets and they're selling fast. So with that, thanks very much for the call today and for your continued support."

Good morning to those on the phone and thanks very much for joining us today. Today, in a departure from our previous calls, I'd like to open with a few brief comments and then pass it to Pierre, who will address our third quarter results and the outlook for the year, followed by the operational outlook for fiscal year '17 and beyond with Brett. At the end of this call, I will close by covering our longer-term strategic view and my perspective on our unique integrated solutions vision for agriculture. 
But first, let me address the Bayer proposal and other strategic alternatives directly. Over the past several weeks, with the support of our board and advisers, I have personally been in discussions with Bayer's management regarding this proposal, along with others regarding other strategic alternatives. Regarding Bayer specifically, there's no formal to this point. We've said that we remain open and we believe that our efforts and continued constructive dialogue could allow our joint teams to explore potential next steps. 
By any value discussion is more complex given the fact that the industry is running at a low point in the ag cycle, we recognize the potential value these types of combinations create as they accelerate innovation and increase choice for farmers across a broader set of crops, geographies and production practices while improving the sustainability of agriculture around the world. We continue to believe in the value potential of the right combination. Of course, there can be no assurance that these discussions will lead to any transaction nor on what terms. It's clear that Monsanto remains the partner of choice in this industry and I assure you that we'll continue to actively explore these opportunities and pursue value-enhancing strategic options. 
Our belief in the long-term opportunity is unchanged and our growth prospects beyond fiscal year '16, with or without a deal, remain strong. The global ag cycle is at a point and we've seen a series of recent economic and political challenges. These are huge events around the world that create instability. Today, however, we see potential for positive resolution on the horizon for some of these challenges, particularly for our Argentinian soybean business, for our Roundup Ready Xtend soybean blockbuster and the recent announcement on reregistration of glyphosate in Europe. As this tide turns and turn up well, with the changes that we've made to our business, we'll be well positioned to strengthen our leadership role in this space with our financial discipline and our steadfast commitment to innovation. 
So with that, let me pass it to Pierre."

Despite the fact that this has been a tough year and this was a tough quarter given the events that you alluded to, as a company, we've remain focused on delivering on our strategy while taking the necessary act",1841,"Thanks, Hugh, and good morning to everyone. Despite the fact that this has been a tough year and this was a tough quarter given the events that you alluded to, as a company, we've remain focused on delivering on our strategy while taking the necessary actions to set the stage for future growth as illustrated by the following. We have stayed true to our philosophy of pricing to the value of our innovation. We have delivered on significant strategic portfolio management and licensing commitments, resulting in an approximate $370 million EBIT contribution for this fiscal year as compared to $274 million in 2015. We are tracking very well towards our restructuring planned savings at a cost now closer to the low end of the range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, while transforming and modernizing the way we work. And we have delivered on our capital allocation commitment. This demonstrates our ability to maintain our focus on the variables we control, despite an unprecedented level of challenges affecting our business. These actions set us up nicely for momentum going into the anticipated rebound in the ag cycle with an expected return to growth in earnings per share in fiscal year '17, which accelerates to a mid-teens earning per share growth rate from fiscal year '17 to '21. 
With that, let's focus on the here and now and review our third quarter results as shown on Slide 4 and 5. On an as-reported basis, our third quarter earnings per share is $1.63, reflecting $0.54 for restructuring charges, environmental and litigation matters and a charge for Argentine-related tax matters. The Argentine-related tax matter resulted in a charge of $219 million, which refers primarily to a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, mostly driven by recent cumulative losses in our Argentine subsidiary. With growth in the business, we would expect to see this allowance reverse partially or in full over time. 
On an ongoing basis, this translates into $2.17 of earnings per share. Although partly offset by the benefits of share repurchases and increase row crop licensing EBIT contributions, we encountered several headwinds in the quarter. These included the expected absence of last year's Scotts licensing agreements and the anticipated glyphosate pricing declines, but also Roundup Ready Xtend-related cost and lower soybean volumes, amplified by the delayed EU import approval as well as lower cotton gross profit in India arising from pricing regulations and declines in planted acres. 
Finally, our free cash flow year-to-date is a use of $224 million as compared to a use of $789 million in the prior year, reflecting strong working capital management. From a year-to-date perspective, our Seeds and Genomics gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was nearly flat at 62%. Global corn gross profit margin was down just slightly as increased COGS from lower production plans, combined with discounting to counter competitive offers, more than offset the mix lift benefit from new hybrid introductions and price increases in local currency in regions like Brazil. 
In global soybeans, gross profit margins declined approximately 3 percentage points, primarily as a result of cost associated with Roundup Ready Xtend launch, which were amplified by the delayed European import approval. These more than offset the pricing benefit from increased Intacta penetration that was partly masked by the weak reais at a critical point in the season. Our cotton business gross profit margin reduction was due primarily to Indian pricing controls that were enacted in the third quarter of this fiscal year, while vegetable margins improved due to lower cost arising from better operations. And finally, our other crop segment margins improved with closure of the alfalfa  licensing deal with Forage Genetics. 
Moving to Ag Productivity, gross profit margins declined due to the lower Roundup pricing and the absence of the $274 million licensing deal with Scotts. Looking forward, we are seeing signs of a positive resolution for several of the headwinds we've been tracking. First, the EU Commission just affirmed that an 18-month extension of the existing authorization for glyphosate use would be completed by the June 30 deadline. In addition, we anticipate the receipt of the EU import approval from Roundup Ready Xtend stack shortly thereafter. And finally, Argentina announced an interim policy that supports mandatory testing for Intacta, leading into what we expect to be a strong start for our Southern Hemisphere business. 
However, despite these positive developments and expectations, with the results of the third quarter, we now expect to be at the low end of our ongoing fiscal year '16 earnings per share range of $4.40 to $5.10, which assumes approximately $0.85 of currency headwinds. After the inclusion of the Argentine-related tax matters and the favorable change in the expected amount and timing of restructuring expense, this translate into a full year as-reported earnings per share guidance at the low end of an adjusted range of $3.36 to $4.14. 
Now let's take a look at the individual components within our 2016 guidance, as shown on Slide 6. First, with recent revisions, we expect Seed and Genomics gross profit to be down just under 5% for the full year. Importantly, exclusive of estimated currency headwinds of roughly $350 million, Seeds and Genomics gross profit is anticipated to be flat to up slightly. Practically, on a currency-neutral basis, we expect the benefit of the alfalfa license, increased Intacta penetration and global corn volumes, to offset the roughly $150 million impact of the Roundup Ready Xtend soybeans related cost and share loss, the impact of the pricing controls in India cotton and decline in planted acres there. 
Of the approximately $370 million of EBIT benefits from licensing and strategic deals expected in fiscal year '16, we recorded approximately $210 million in gross profit, reflecting the onetime upfront fee related to our of alfalfa trades and technology license to Forage Genetics International. We expect the remainder of the EBIT benefit, which is mostly derived from the expected $145 million gain from the sorghum joint venture and plant sale to be recorded in other income in the fourth quarter. 
Our Ag Productivity gross profit outlook is now trending towards the lower end of our range of $900 million to $1.1 billion as earlier estimates had assumed one of our smaller licensing and asset sales deal would benefit gross profit that was ultimately recorded in other income. For the full year, we continue to expect to sell a higher ratio of branded Roundup volume as compared to the prior fiscal year. However, we expect that full year volumes will be below our roughly 300 million gallons of capacity but not to the point of generating material volume variances. 
From a price perspective, our competitive intelligent leads us to believe that we are nearing the bottom for generic glyphosate pricing in the market, and we are not expecting significant moves from this point forward. We remain on track to deliver $165 million to $210 million in savings from our restructuring actions in fiscal year '16, primarily benefiting operating expenses. These savings, combined with spending discipline and currency benefits, contribute to our expectation that even after increased investments in new platform, we expect to see operating spend down slightly before estimated restructuring charges and environmental and litigation matters. 
Assuming the Argentine pesos exchange rates remain closer to ratio of 1:14 at the close of the fiscal year, we now expect over expense net to be relatively flat year-over-year as the nearly $180 million impact from the devaluation in Argentina is now being offset by gains on noncore asset sales of approximately $170 million. Our tax rate is expected to increase to 32% to 34% for the full year inclusive of Argentine-related tax matter. Looking out to fiscal year '17, we expect our tax rate to be more in the range of 25% to 27%, which is more aligned to recent prior years. Finally, the net effect of the benefit from our share repurchases including net financing expense should generate a net earnings per share benefit of $0.20 to $0.25 with 437 million shares outstanding at the close of our third quarter. 
Consistent with our updated earnings projections and based on the possible slight delay in the close of the sale of the precision ag equipment business to John Deere, we now adjusted our free cash flow guidance for the year to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion as shown on Slide 7. At the peak of our working capital cycle and as for the successful execution of the $3 billion accelerated stock share repurchase in the second quarter, our net debt to ongoing EBITDA ratio sits at 2.6 at the close of the third quarter. We expect this to revert to ratio in the range of 2.1 to 2.2 at the end of the fiscal year following strong expected collections. 
Looking ahead to fiscal year '17 and assuming relatively stable foreign currencies, we expect a return to growth in earnings per share as shown on Slide 8. As we shared at Q2, our expectation is that our long-term growth would not be linear, with next year marking a slower pace as we recover and reset the trajectory with the early days of Roundup Ready Xtend penetration. This expected growth is driven by the continued penetration of our soybean blockbusters, the durability of our global corn platform and an improved cost of goods outlook for both corn and soybeans. From a year-over-year perspective, this growth is expected to be partially offset by decline in glyphosate pricing, particularly in the first half of fiscal year '17 by a lower level of non-core licensing deals and by a slight increase in spend, with inflation and expected increases in commissions and incentives offsetting the benefits from our restructuring plan. We also expect a more normalized effective tax rate of 25% to 27% for the coming fiscal year. Once we get a better line of sight on the closure of the Northern Hemisphere crop season and finalize our operational plans, we will provide a more refined outlook for '17. 
Beyond fiscal year '17, the opportunity significantly accelerates as the growth drivers of '17 are expected to expand, continuing to generate the best margins amongst our ag peers with streamline operations and portfolio advantages driving our multilayered growth into the next decade. We continue to target a mid-teens compounded annual growth rate in earnings per share from fiscal year '17, now advancing to fiscal year '21 from fiscal year '19, as we move our long-range plan and march forward. Practically, our estimated EPS for fiscal year '19 has not changed significantly from our previous guidance. We are now simply expanding the horizon. 
In closing, our financial focus remains consistent: return on innovation, financial discipline and balanced capital allocation. These, together with a sound and disciplined approach delivering on our integrated solution strategy, support long-term growth and industry-leading ongoing EBITDA margins and return on capital as shown on Slide 9. 
With that, I will pass it to Brett to walk through the operational outlook. Brett?"

While there are factors contributing to a dynamic environment in ag today, our organization is focused on delivering against the milestones that set a foundation for rapid growth and importantly, w",1510,"Thanks, Pierre, and good morning to everyone on the line. While there are factors contributing to a dynamic environment in ag today, our organization is focused on delivering against the milestones that set a foundation for rapid growth and importantly, with an optimized operating cost structure. This focus is balanced across our broad portfolio and key growth drivers as outlined on Slide 10, whether it is our seed business, crop protection or Climate, all of which I'll update you on today and our outlook for fiscal year '17. 
Let's begin with soybeans on Slide 11. Our soybean innovation drivers are expected to continue record-setting adoption rates toward their target opportunity, with both Intacta and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans anticipated to make a meaningful step-up in penetration next year. 
Let's start with 100 million acre insect protection opportunity in South America, where we are on a good path to penetrate 75 million acres by fiscal year '19. After achieving an expected 35 million acres of Intacta Roundup Ready 2 PRO technology penetration across South America this year, we now believe that Intacta will be planted on 45 million to 55 million acres in South America in fiscal year '17. A royalty collection system in Argentina that operates consistently and with integrity would move us to the high end of that range. 
Moving to Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans on Slide 12, we now estimate that our introduction this year is just above 1 million acres across our brands and licensees. Despite the repeated delays on the EU import approval, which we expect shortly, we know that farmers want the technology and we're producing aggressively to be in a strong position for the coming selling season. To that end, our brands and licensees have plans in place to supply roughly 15 million acres of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans in fiscal year '17. In addition, we expect roughly $150 million of incremental cost and soybean share losses related to the launch and subsequent delays in the EU import approval to decrease by 2/3 next year. 
To enable the full benefits of the system, there is also good progress on the herbicide approvals as well. The EPA's public comment period for the over-the-top use of dicamba herbicide closed late last month. And we're happy to share that to date, of the more than 850 comments posted so far, more than 75% of those are comments from growers, dealers, academics and others in support of the new use. The EPA has indicated they expect to conclude the process for approval of the label for in-crop use of dicamba formulations by late summer to early fall. Our plans to enable a reliable supply of those dicamba formulations at our Luling, Louisiana facility continue. And in the interim, we have supply agreements in place to meet the demand for what we envision will be the #2 molecule in crop protection behind glyphosate.
From a global corn perspective, as shown on Slide 13, the factor that stands out is the durability of the portfolio in a challenging environment. This is illustrated by the expectation that we held or grew our global genetic share. Although our global germplasm price mix excluding currency is expected to be down slightly for this fiscal year with anticipated stable to improving corn acres and commodity prices, we expect to see global price mix lift move to the positive in fiscal year '17. As we finalize our price guards, we'll share more. This lift is then expected to accelerate in later years due to performance from breeding gains. We also expect improved cost of goods from more normalized seed production plants, leading to a significant reduction in the $90 million to $100 million of headwinds we experienced this year. 
As we review by region, let's look first at the U.S. We expect planted acres to be in the range of 91 million to 92 million acres and we expect to grow our genetic share on that footprint, delivering the second highest year of U.S. corn sales volume in the history of the company. With new generations from our advanced breeding programs and the next generations of corn insect control traits coming from SmartStax PRO and Trecepta toward the end of this plan, our U.S. business looks promising. In Europe, with an estimated 8 points of share gain in the past 8 years, we look forward to continuing to be the fastest-growing corn seed brand in the region. 
In Argentina, with an expected lift in commodity prices and reduction in export taxes, we believe that corn acres in the country could increase greater than 20%. Given our historic share in Argentina corn, this bodes well for the season ahead and beyond. In Brazil, we also see the outlook improving. We expect that acres planted with corn will increase in the mid-single digits and that the ramp-up of VT Triple PRO traded hybrids will continue again in 2017 as farmer trade up to better insect control. I'm also pleased to share that for the upcoming summer season in Brazil, we expect double-digit germplasm price increases in local currency, coming on the back of 20% plus price increases in Brazil for fiscal year '16, offsetting some of the currency downside. 
Other notable developments occurred in our complementary crops as outlined on Slide 14. I'll begin with our U.S. cotton business. The latest addition to that portfolio is Bollgard II XtendFlex Cotton in its second year of launch. We expect it to be on about 3 million acres in the U.S. this year or 4x last year's acres. With strong farmer demand for Bollgard II XtendFlex and our new cotton varieties, we expect to gain 3 or more brand share points this year or 6 points in the last 2 years. Our vegetable business is also experiencing positive momentum and operational excellence. We're managing supply well, now boasting the lowest inventory in 7 years while delivering nice GP growth exclusive of currency. 
In our Ag Productivity segment, we're maintaining our emphasis on cost discipline and portfolio optimization. As we near the anticipated bottom of the generic pricing cycle here in the fourth quarter, we expect the pricing comparison for the first half of next fiscal year to be a headwind. However, this should be partially moderated by some expected volume recovery for the full year. 
Let's transition to Climate, as shown on Slide 15. Last month, we provided an update that highlighted how we're on track for our targeted penetration of more than 12 million paid acres. That number is now expected to be more than 13 million paid acres for fiscal year '16. Overall, we are seeing paid offerings up more than 2.5x versus prior year and now expect to continue that momentum into fiscal year '17 with targeted penetration of 25 million acres with paid services nearly doubling this year's results. It's clear that farmers are seeing the value that the Climate FieldView platform provides and that step-up to paid acres builds from the total platform footprint for the technology, which is also ahead of target at more than 92 million acres. More than 75% of those platform acres are with growers who are monthly active users of our digital tools. 
In addition to strong product penetration results, recent farmer survey results indicate that growers now identify the Climate FieldView platform as the #1 digital ag brand in the industry. Global expansion of Climate FieldView is also on track, with a pre-launch in Brazil this fall and a launch in Eastern Canada in the spring of 2017. Climate has now forged partnerships across more than 10 retail, software and equipment platforms, with these relationship serving as yet another strategic differentiator. One of the significant agreements is with John Deere, and we're on track to launch our in-cab connectivity offering with Deere's new wireless data server technology for the 2016 fall harvest. 
In our other new technology platform led by our BioAg Alliance with Novozymes, we're testing microbes this year on a scale that's unmatched in the industry. At the same time, we are preparing for the launch of our first alliance microbial seed treatment for corn, which demonstrated a greater than 4-bushel average yield advantage in fiscal year '15 field trials. This upstream corn inoculant will be marketed under the Acceleron brand in the U.S. and as JumpStart XL in remaining geographies. As this product expands to additional crops, it has the potential to penetrate approximately 100 million acres by 2025, making it one of the largest biological products in the ag industry. 
The last but no less important is an update on our continued spend discipline as outlined on Slide 16. Our savings are on track and with lower estimated cost, we're looking to continue to drive efficiency through the business. We continue to track towards the expected $500 million of savings from our restructuring and cost savings initiatives by fiscal year '18, reaching an expected $375 million to $420 million by fiscal year '17. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Hugh."

I mentioned at the outset that our view about what's to come hasn't changed. Despite ongoing industry dynamics and recent challenges, there's one unwavering constant which is our commitment to an integrated solution strategy that bring seeds, traits, chemistry and data science tools to farmers around the world. We're uniquely placed with our seed position and our digital ag platform with Climate. We believe that this strategy will create tremendous value for society, for farmers and for our owners as outlined on Slide 17, and the world is going to need it. The long-term demand trends remain robust and are reinforced by the most recent WASDE report. It indicates that year-over-year global demand growth for soybeans and corn continues to be strong, with another billion bushels of corn needed for the year ahead. Beyond that, we see robust demand continuing for decades to come. 
The need to help farmers meet that demand through sustainable intensification of agronomic solutions remains a global priority. We continue to see innovation in agriculture as being the answer to satisfy these demand curves as well as the differentiator in unlocking incremental yield from existing acres. We are best positioned to answer that need. Our leadership in this area is evidenced by the industry's most proven pipeline, one with up to $25 billion in expected peak net sales in core platforms alone. 
By better integrating these technological advances, this approach will allow farmers to maximize yield, minimize risk, improve sustainability and optimize their overall profit. It's about selecting the right seeds, traits and weed, insect and disease control with accurate data insights so that farmers can manage their operations, not just acre by acre, but increasingly row by row. It's our unique innovation platform that underpins our own strong standalone growth plan as well as the industrial logic for Bayer's proposal to acquire Monsanto, as shown on Slide 18. It starts with our leading seed and trait platform that reaches more than 400 million acres globally and strong -- our leading germplasm share in corn, soybeans, cotton and vegetables globally. We're the world's largest seller of seed-applied solutions, we're enhancing our Acceleron seed treatments with plans for our new Phase 4 nematicide, NEMASTRIKE, as well as with microbial treatments developed through our BioAg Alliance with Novozymes. 
Finally, Climate has emerged as the digital ag platform, driven by fundamental competitive advantages. Climate uniquely combines core data and software capabilities, broad commercial reach and unprecedented adoption, all of which that we'll continue to build as we integrate and hub for seeds, traits and chemistries, and that's clearly recognized by others in our industry. 
To further expand the value of this innovation platform, our technology organization has moved forward with unprecedented trials of next-generation technology in the lab and in the field. Overall, this is stacking up to be  another stellar year with projections of this being the fourth year in a row with more than 20 phase advancements. You'll get the chance to see our next wave of innovation at Whistle Stop in August 17 and 18, so mark your calendars to plan and join us for this event. 
To further enhance our unique position to deliver the integrated solution strategy, we're continually optimizing our portfolio as shown on Slide 19. As a part of this optimization and further bolstering our position as the partner of choice and innovation, we've recently entered into several distinct technology agreements. Some contribute directly to the bottom line in fiscal year '16 and importantly, they all contribute to our long-term vision. So let's take a quick look, at some of the most significant agreements. 
We just announced that DuPont Pioneer is a new licensee of the Intacta trait stack, pending Brazil approvals, which is yet another endorsement of the strength of this rapidly penetrating technology. We exclusively licensed our alfalfa traits and technologies to Forage Genetics International, and we're in the process of forming a strategic joint venture with Remington Holding Company to more effectively manage our elite sorghum germplasm assets. Both transactions unlock value and they create R&D focus, while still generating new technologies for our grower customers in a collaborative manner. We also recently negotiated and signed several gene editing agreements, that coupled with our own internally developed proprietary technologies, are expect to accelerate and enhance the drive to the next generation of seed and trait solutions. 
Finally, consistent with our collaborative approach to new chemistry solution development, as shown on Slide 20, we announced a new agreement with Sumitomo Chemical Company to establish future generation weed control traits stacks in several crops. It features a new PPO chemistry paired with the related tolerance gene, that not only overcomes wheat resistance issues, but also controls problematic wheats. Importantly, this new herbicide and trait are being developed in parallel, allowing farmers to access the benefits of this technology earlier than a more traditional, sequential development approach. We plan to announce other chemistry collaborations in the near future as we continue to evaluate additional opportunities to drive returns on our innovation and align our portfolio to our integrated solutions mission. 
Pierre touched on this earlier, and as I wrap up, I think it bears repeating. Our continued commitment to operate as the most innovative company in this space with a foundation of disciplined spend and portfolio management will position us well for the expected rebound in our industry. Many in this industry have theorized an integrated strategies, but we believe we're the best positioned to make this strategy a reality. With our truly unique asset position and traits, seeds and digital ag, as well as our pace and our breadth of proven innovation, we expect to continue to lead and define integrated solutions for agriculture while continuing to deliver industry-leading ongoing EBITDA margins and return on capital across our peer set, along with strong cash flow to fuel future growth as shown on Slide 21. Quite simply, this is what makes partnering with Monsanto today such as an attractive unique proposition. 
So with that, Laura, let's move to the Q&A section."

And actually, entering into 2017, we indeed believe we have momentum, and this momentum will carry us into '18 and '19 and we will enjoy a couple of tailwinds, definitely. So Intacta traits on 44 million to 55 million acres, as Brett mentioned, this",493,"Yes. And actually, entering into 2017, we indeed believe we have momentum, and this momentum will carry us into '18 and '19 and we will enjoy a couple of tailwinds, definitely. So Intacta traits on 44 million to 55 million acres, as Brett mentioned, this is our assumptions today, and the demand in the market is still very strong. So we see this one as a key driver for growth. We also anticipate that Xtend on 50 million acres next year, so that's also something that will carry us into '17 with momentum. And we also anticipate that some of the headwinds we have this year, we said 1 -- the 2/3 of the headwinds we've been seeing this year related to the launch of Xtend will disappear. So it's about $100 million of benefits we are anticipating next year. We also mention cost of goods momentum in both corn and soy. And there, again, around $100 million there. And the return to positive pricing in corn. On top of that obviously, there is the -- our assumption is, right now, we're not going to be seeing a devaluation in Argentina comparable to what we've seen this year. So these are done all the positive elements that we see as building momentum entering into '17. However, we have to balance those with a couple of other things, we are actually watching at this point in time. What we expect is that we will have a tough comparison in glyphosate, mostly in the first part of the year. Our anticipation is that glyphosate pricing is going to stay pretty much where it is right now. And if you look at the first half of fiscal year '16, we enjoyed pricing. We're higher than when they are today. So we anticipate this one to be a tough comp for us entering into '17. The other elements that we highlighted today is that from a deals perspective, so this year, we have the benefit of $370 million in deals. We are not anticipating at this point in time, based on the portfolio of opportunities we have in front of us, that the deals are going to be of that magnitude next year. And we'll give a little more clarity on that, I mean, when we have our operation plans in place. Tax rate will also be a little more challenging next year. I mean, based on what we are looking at right now. And we also have to balance the benefit of our restructuring actions with inflationary increase, increased commissions based on the success of our Channel model in the U.S. and obviously South America and also incentives. So if you add to that, the impact of India on our cotton business, these are the things we want to clarify, and that's why, as you mentioned, we wanted to be cautious entering into '17, although, as you mentioned, we also see a lot of tailwinds there."

I think, P.J., if you think about our highest premium product that we sell across the U.S., it's our SmartStax products. And as we look at this year, SmartStax is going to make up a similar percentage to our overall business as they did last year. So I do not see farmers trading down. We have farmers on the fringes of rootworm areas that may trade down, but it's not material. We had to make some adjustments in our pricing ladder that we talked about last year to adjust for the significant pullback in the commodity price, of which now we're seeing rebound a little bit. And we had to address some of the competitive issues in the marketplace, which we did, I would argue very, effectively. And that's why I'm confident today to say that actually I think for genetic share, we're up and for brand share, we held our own in the marketplace. So I feel really good about how we ended up in the U.S. corn business. And when I look to South America, boy, farmers are not slowing down there at all. We're seeing -- we took a significant price increases in corn last year in Brazil. We're doing it again this year. Now granted, there's a currency offset and it's not offsetting all of it, but farmers are quickly moving to our new Triple PRO in Brazil to get better bug control. So I think even in these challenging times, farmers look for the best seed and the best traits to drive productivity on their farm and they need it more than ever. And I think we see that this year. It's really disappointing that we ended up with ongoing delays with the EU, but I have to tell you farmers were lined up to buy the Xtend technology this year, and I'm really optimistic about that when next year. So tough conditions do not slow down farmers' appetite. As you said, they're looking for ways to drive productivity and profitability."

Right now, people are looking at a market more in the range of 82 million. So this is -- also this element of timing, there's a huge return that happened last year.

But let me try and give you a little bit the landscape to the last piece of your point. I think it is complex because we're at the low point of the ag cycle. And I think the tone in some of the comments today, we see some of the early signs of this cycle beginning to turn. As we look at the Bayer proposal and as we examine some of the other strategic alternatives that have emerged, I'm personally engaged in those discussions along with the board to support the board and our advisers. And I would say this gets down to 2 things. It gets down to value, and it gets down to certainty. So we are convinced the longer this runs, we're convinced in the value of that integrated strategy. We've spent a bit of time talking about it today. And we're convinced that we have a unique position as an integrator because of our seeds, our unique position in seed and the emerging strength of our data science position. So in 2 short years, I think you've seen climate transition from theory to reality, and I think in the next 2 years that becomes even more important. So as we look at the trough, as we look at the Bayer proposal and some of these other strategic alternatives, we are focused -- my team and I, we're focused very, very clearly on creation of shareholder value. And that's where this begins, and it's where it ends. So we're going to take a very rational approach to this, bearing in mind to where the cycle is and the need for value creation, and we're going to really -- we're going to really focus on the uniqueness of Monsanto and its part as a key integrator. So I don't know if that answers your question, but it's probably up to the scope of what I can discuss on a call."

So I -- real briefly, our strategy isn't where it started, but in the early days of working with the climate team in San Francisco, they were very adamant and they were right that this is about driving a grower experience. And in the early days, it's about delighting growers and sharing the insights with them. So as Brett talked about, 95 million acres up on the platform. The first round of this for us, David, was gain an experience and the same way that all apps are developed. So gain an experience and letting growers work with us on their farms and their fields. The Nitrogen Advisor has been additional functionality, and we have priced for that. And in the last 2 short years, we've got all of U.S. retail distribution up on the platform. We then -- we're in -- we're either in discussion or concluded to all the machinery manufacturers. And I think the next natural step in this is to see some of our competitive companies and some alternative offerings up in that platform as well. So the grower experience -- he doesn't need multiple iPads in the cab. And I think as we move through this progression, then price -- pricing to value and retaining a piece of that value in the same way that we've done with traits becomes a natural next step. And that's, I think, the experience of 15 years of trait development blends beautifully into the next handful of years on data science development and how we broadly license this platform with others."

So what we've seen play out, unfortunately, over the last 6 months has been the challenge of operating in the EU system between the parliamentarian votes and the commissions' final decision. And we effectively, we watch the 2 teams play volleyball for 6 months. And today, it was great to see that the commission move forward on a science-based decision to extend the product. So we're, as you said, the delay has been tough. We're delighted to have the approval and the extension and are moving forward.

So it's purely looking at where we were priced last year, in the first half of the year versus where we're priced right now, and that creates a bit of a headwind for us going into next year that we'll have to manage against. I feel good about our position though and our cost position and how we're competing in that industry. We're down a little bit on volumes this year, but I think that we're going to recover those back next year as we see the momentum building across the marketplace. So we're in a good place.

I think as you go around the world, every farmer finds themselves in a different position as do we.

I think as you go around the world, every farmer finds themselves in a different position as do we. If you think about Argentina, for example, we use significant barter for our business down there, so a big chunk of our sales are to the barter system, which minimizes our credit risk with the Argentine former. They basically use the grain to buy their inputs. In the case of Brazil, keep in mind with how currency has impacted our business negatively. It helps put the Brazilian farmer in a pretty good position right now. Buying in local currency and selling in U.S. dollars is not a bad place for them. So we feel reasonably okay. I mean, with all the disruption that's occurred in Brazil in the last year, I'm actually optimistic about Brazil right now with the position of the farmer and their ability to access credit and buy products, farming looks good. And we've got Intacta, and we've got a strong corn business that's growing, and we've priced up in that environment and it seems to be holding. So we look good in South America. When you get to Eastern Europe, its mixed deck over there. There as you -- in the Far East, there's some real challenges, call them geopolitical challenges with the Ukraine. We've tended to manage our credit very aggressively. In other words, we don't extend a lot of credit, and we seem to be doing quite okay over there. That has impacted some of the pricing. Some of the farmers have gone to lower-priced seed, which has impacted our global pricing. But overall, we're in a good place, and we continue to be conservative on how we manage the credit."

And I have to tell you, some of the other companies out there that are struggling with the performance of their products, the Channel brands are really interesting one for them to consider to become seedsmen's for because they get access to the phenomenal pipeline of genetics and traits from Monsanto, and they get to handle the brand that they sell directly to farmers, which in many cases, as they've been used to and that's a model they came out of.

Thank you for your -- thanks for your question, and this will be the last question and as I indicated earlier, these are private conversations. It's difficult to comment extensively, but we're an agricultural business. We are developing technologies on a 10-year horizon. We've been in existence for about 15 years, so you can't -- we've done many of these calls together over the years. You can look at the downcycle in an ag economy. Farmers would never farm if they saw about the peaks and troughs. So you have to see through that when you're either buying a farm or if you're developing technology. So I guess the headline in this is, if you're valuing a unique company like Monsanto, I would argue you can't look at 1 quarter. You can't look at a year. You need to take a 10- or a 20-year view, and that's how we develop technologies, and that's when you look at the promise of Climate, or you look at the value of the pipeline that Rob Fraley and his team have developed, I think you have to take that long view. We've been very clear since May that we were open to these discussions, but that the value had to be reflected for the company and the proposition that we have. And the Bayer proposal was financially inadequate. We are looking at that proposal relative to other strategic alternatives. But you have to take the long view in this because the vagaries of the commodity markets are either punishing or they develop elation, but you have to kind of take a line through that. And that's how we've always built our resource models. That's how we've always built these products on a 7- and a 10-year development cycle. And that's how we will look at this. And I guess I would finish by saying, we are absolutely committed to optimizing shareowner value, and we will look at the proposal in hand, and we will evaluate these other strategic alternatives against that benchmark. That's what we need to do. Thank you for your question. And with that, I want to thank you for your patience because we were a little bit tardy in our finish today. Let me just make 2 or 3 points at the risk of repetition, and it kind of ties to Jeff's last point on the call. 2016 has been a challenging year for our industry. It's been a challenging year for the company, but our core businesses have done well, but have suffered from some regulatory delays that we're beginning to see, literally on the call today, we're beginning to see turn. Despite this, innovation in this industry is needed, and it's recognized by growers. And I think today, we're uniquely placed as a key player in any integrated platform strategy. So regardless of how that integration strategy plays out, we have a central role in that. So as I mentioned in the last question, I'm personally committed to the optimizing -- optimization of shareholder value. So we're really pleased that you joined us this morning. We are moving forward with preparation for personal stock, and we hope to see you there on August 17 and 18. And if I was you, I'd be booking the slots soon because those are hot tickets and they're selling fast. So with that, thanks very much for the call today and for your continued support."

Good morning to those on the phone and thanks very much for joining us today. Today, in a departure from our previous calls, I'd like to open with a few brief comments and then pass it to Pierre, who will address our third quarter results and the outlook for the year, followed by the operational outlook for fiscal year '17 and beyond with Brett. At the end of this call, I will close by covering our longer-term strategic view and my perspective on our unique integrated solutions vision for agriculture. 
But first, let me address the Bayer proposal and other strategic alternatives directly. Over the past several weeks, with the support of our board and advisers, I have personally been in discussions with Bayer's management regarding this proposal, along with others regarding other strategic alternatives. Regarding Bayer specifically, there's no formal update at this point. We've said that we remain open and we believe that our efforts and continued constructive dialogue could allow our joint teams to explore potential next steps. 
But any value discussion is more complex given the fact that the industry is running at a low point in the ag cycle, we recognize the potential value these types of combinations create as they accelerate innovation and increase choice for farmers across a broader set of crops, geographies and production practices while improving the sustainability of agriculture around the world. We continue to believe in the value potential of the right combination. Of course, there can be no assurance that these discussions will lead to any transaction nor on what terms. It's clear that Monsanto remains the partner of choice in this industry and I assure you that we'll continue to actively explore these opportunities and pursue value-enhancing strategic options. 
Our belief in the long-term opportunity is unchanged and our growth prospects beyond fiscal year '16, with or without a deal, remain strong. The global ag cycle is at a low point and we've seen a series of recent economic and political challenges. These are huge events around the world that create instability. Today, however, we see potential for positive resolution on the horizon for some of these challenges, particularly for our Argentinian soybean business, for our Roundup Ready Xtend soybean blockbuster and the recent announcement on reregistration of glyphosate in Europe. As this tide turns and turn up well, with the changes that we've made to our business, we'll be well positioned to strengthen our leadership role in this space with our financial discipline and our steadfast commitment to innovation. 
So with that, let me pass it to Pierre."
528414,318279627,1003447,"Monsanto Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 29, 2016",2016-06-29,"Earnings Calls","Monsanto Company","Executives","Thanks, Hugh, and good morning to everyone. Despite the fact that this has been a tough year and this was a tough quarter given the events that you alluded to, as a company, we've remain focused on delivering on our strategy while taking the necessary act",1841,"Thanks, Hugh, and good morning to everyone. Despite the fact that this has been a tough year and this was a tough quarter given the events that you alluded to, as a company, we've remain focused on delivering on our strategy while taking the necessary actions to set the stage for future growth as illustrated by the following. We have stayed true to our philosophy of pricing to the value of our innovation. We have delivered on significant strategic portfolio management and licensing commitments, resulting in an approximate $370 million EBIT contribution for this fiscal year as compared to $274 million in 2015. We are tracking very well towards our restructuring plan savings at a cost now closer to the low end of the range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, while transforming and modernizing the way we work. And we have delivered on our capital allocation commitment. This demonstrates our ability to maintain our focus on the variables we control, despite an unprecedented level of challenges affecting our business. These actions set us up nicely for momentum going into the anticipated rebound in the ag cycle with an expected return to growth in earnings per share in fiscal year '17, which accelerates to a mid-teens earning per share growth rate from fiscal year '17 to '21. 
With that, let's focus on the here and now and review our third quarter results as shown on Slide 4 and 5. On an as-reported basis, our third quarter earnings per share is $1.63, reflecting $0.54 for restructuring charges, environmental and litigation matters and a charge for Argentine-related tax matters. The Argentine-related tax matter resulted in a charge of $219 million, which refers primarily to a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, mostly driven by recent cumulative losses in our Argentine subsidiary. With growth in the business, we would expect to see this allowance reverse partially or in full over time. 
On an ongoing basis, this translates into $2.17 of earnings per share. Although partly offset by the benefits of share repurchases and increase row crop licensing EBIT contributions, we encountered several headwinds in the quarter. These included the expected absence of last year's Scotts licensing agreements and the anticipated glyphosate pricing declines, but also Roundup Ready Xtend-related costs and lower soybean volumes, amplified by the delayed EU import approval as well as lower cotton gross profit in India arising from pricing regulations and declines in planted acres. 
Finally, our free cash flow year-to-date is a use of $224 million as compared to a use of $789 million in the prior year, reflecting strong working capital management. From a year-to-date perspective, our Seeds and Genomics gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was nearly flat at 62%. Global corn gross profit margin was down just slightly as increased COGS from lower production plans, combined with discounting to counter competitive offers, more than offset the mix lift benefit from new hybrid introductions and price increases in local currency in regions like Brazil. 
In global soybeans, gross profit margins declined approximately 3 percentage points, primarily as a result of cost associated with Roundup Ready Xtend launch, which were amplified by the delayed European import approval. These more than offset the pricing benefit from increased Intacta penetration that was partly masked by the weak reais at a critical point in the season. Our cotton business gross profit margin reduction was due primarily to Indian pricing controls that were enacted in the third quarter of this fiscal year, while vegetable margins improved due to lower cost arising from better operations. And finally, our other crop segment margins improved with closure of the alfalfa  licensing deal with Forage Genetics. 
Moving to Ag Productivity, gross profit margins declined due to the lower Roundup pricing and the absence of the $274 million licensing deal with Scotts. Looking forward, we are seeing signs of a positive resolution for several of the headwinds we've been tracking. First, the EU Commission just affirmed that an 18-month extension of the existing authorization for glyphosate use would be completed by the June 30 deadline. In addition, we anticipate the receipt of the EU import approval for Roundup Ready Xtend stack shortly thereafter. And finally, Argentina announced an interim policy that supports mandatory testing for Intacta, leading into what we expect to be a strong start for our Southern Hemisphere businesses. 
However, despite these positive developments and expectations, with the results of the third quarter, we now expect to be at the low end of our ongoing fiscal year '16 earnings per share range of $4.40 to $5.10, which assumes approximately $0.85 of currency headwinds. After the inclusion of the Argentine-related tax matters and the favorable change in the expected amount and timing of restructuring expense, this translates into a full year as-reported earnings per share guidance at the low end of an adjusted range of $3.36 to $4.14. 
Now let's take a look at the individual components within our 2016 guidance, as shown on Slide 6. First, with recent revisions, we expect Seeds and Genomics gross profit to be down just under 5% for the full year. Importantly, exclusive of estimated currency headwinds of roughly $350 million, Seeds and Genomics gross profit is anticipated to be flat to up slightly. Practically, on a currency-neutral basis, we expect the benefit of the alfalfa license, increased Intacta penetration and global corn volumes, to offset the roughly $150 million impact of the Roundup Ready Xtend soybeans related cost and share loss, the impact of the pricing controls in India cotton and declines in planted acres there. 
Of the approximately $370 million of EBIT benefits from licensing and strategic deals expected in fiscal year '16, we recorded approximately $210 million in gross profit, reflecting the onetime upfront fee related to our alfalfa trades and technology license to Forage Genetics International. We expect the remainder of the EBIT benefit, which is mostly derived from the expected $145 million gain from the sorghum joint venture and plant sale to be recorded in other income in the fourth quarter. 
Our Ag Productivity gross profit outlook is now trending towards the lower end of our range of $900 million to $1.1 billion, as earlier estimates had assumed one of our smaller licensing and asset sales deal would benefit gross profit that was ultimately recorded in other income. For the full year, we continue to expect to sell a higher ratio of branded Roundup volume as compared to the prior fiscal year. However, we expect that full year volumes will be below our roughly 300 million gallons of capacity but not to the point of generating material volume variances. 
From a price perspective, our competitive intelligence leads us to believe that we are nearing the bottom for generic glyphosate pricing in the market, and we are not expecting significant moves from this point forward. We remain on track to deliver $165 million to $210 million in savings from our restructuring actions in fiscal year '16, primarily benefiting operating expenses. These savings, combined with spending discipline and currency benefits, contribute to our expectation that even after increased investments in new platforms, we expect to see operating spend down slightly before estimated restructuring charges and environmental and litigation matters. 
Assuming the Argentine peso exchange rates remain closer to ratio of 1:14 at the close of the fiscal year, we now expect over expense net to be relatively flat year-over-year as the nearly $180 million impact from the devaluation in Argentina is now being offset by gains on noncore asset sales of approximately $170 million. Our tax rate is expected to increase to 32% to 34% for the full year inclusive of Argentine-related tax matter. Looking out to fiscal year '17, we expect our tax rate to be more in the range of 25% to 27%, which is more aligned to recent prior years. Finally, the net effect of the benefit from our share repurchases including net financing expense should generate a net earnings per share benefit of $0.20 to $0.25 with 437 million shares outstanding at the close of our third quarter. 
Consistent with our updated earnings projections and based on the possible slight delay in the close of the sale of the precision ag equipment business to John Deere, we now adjusted our free cash flow guidance for the year to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion as shown on Slide 7. At the peak of our working capital cycle and after the successful execution of the $3 billion accelerated stock share repurchase in the second quarter, our net debt to ongoing EBITDA ratio sits at 2.6 at the close of the third quarter. We expect this to revert to a ratio in the range of 2.1 to 2.2 at the end of the fiscal year following strong expected collections. 
Looking ahead to fiscal year '17 and assuming relatively stable foreign currencies, we expect a return to growth in earnings per share as shown on Slide 8. As we shared at Q2, our expectation is that our long-term growth would not be linear, with next year marking a slower pace as we recover and reset the trajectory with the early days of Roundup Ready Xtend penetration. This expected growth is driven by the continued penetration of our soybean blockbusters, the durability of our global corn platform and an improved cost of goods outlook for both corn and soybeans. From a year-over-year perspective, this growth is expected to be partially offset by decline in glyphosate pricing, particularly in the first half of the fiscal year '17 by a lower level of non-core licensing deals and by a slight increase in spend, with inflation and expected increases in commissions and incentives offsetting the benefits from our restructuring plan. We also expect a more normalized effective tax rate of 25% to 27% for the coming fiscal year. Once we get a better line of sight on the closure of the Northern Hemisphere crop season and finalize our operational plans, we will provide a more refined outlook for '17. 
Beyond fiscal year '17, the opportunity significantly accelerates as the growth drivers of '17 are expected to expand, continuing to generate the best margins amongst our ag peers with streamline operations and portfolio advantages driving our multilayered growth into the next decade. We continue to target a mid-teens compounded annual growth rate in earnings per share from fiscal year '17, now advancing to fiscal year '21 from fiscal year '19, as we move our long-range plan and march forward. Practically, our estimated EPS for fiscal year '19 has not changed significantly from our previous guidance. We are now simply expanding the horizon. 
In closing, our financial focus remains consistent: return on innovation, financial discipline and balanced capital allocation. These, together with a sound and disciplined approach delivering on our integrated solution strategy, support long-term growth and industry-leading ongoing EBITDA margins and return on capital as shown on Slide 9. 
With that, I will pass it to Brett to walk through the operational outlook. Brett?"

While there are factors contributing to a dynamic environment in ag today, our organization is focused on delivering against the milestones that set a foundation for rapid growth and importantly, with an optimized operating cost structure. This focus is balanced across our broad portfolio and key growth drivers as outlined on Slide 10, whether it is our seed business, crop protection or Climate, all of which I'll update you on today and our outlook for fiscal year '17. 
Let's begin with soybeans on Slide 11. Our soybean innovation drivers are expected to continue record-setting adoption rates toward their target opportunity, with both Intacta and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans anticipated to make a meaningful step-up in penetration next year. 
Let's start with the 100 million acre insect protection opportunity in South America, where we are on a good path to penetrate 75 million acres by fiscal year '19. After achieving an expected 35 million acres of Intacta Roundup Ready 2 PRO technology penetration across South America this year, we now believe that Intacta will be planted on 45 million to 55 million acres in South America in fiscal year '17. A royalty collection system in Argentina that operates consistently and with integrity would move us to the high end of that range. 
Moving to Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans on Slide 12, we now estimate that our introduction this year is just above 1 million acres across our brands and licensees. Despite the repeated delays on the EU import approval, which we expect shortly, we know that farmers want the technology and we're producing aggressively to be in a strong position for the coming selling season. To that end, our brands and licensees have plans in place to supply roughly 15 million acres of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans in fiscal year '17. In addition, we expect roughly $150 million of incremental cost and soybean share losses related to the launch and subsequent delays in the EU import approval to decrease by 2/3 next year. 
To enable the full benefits of the system, there is also good progress on the herbicide approvals as well. The EPA's public comment period for the over-the-top use of dicamba herbicide closed late last month. And we're happy to share that to date, of the more than 850 comments posted so far, more than 75% of those are comments from growers, dealers, academics and others in support of the new use. The EPA has indicated they expect to conclude the process for approval of the label for in-crop use of dicamba formulations by late summer to early fall. Our plans to enable a reliable supply of those dicamba formulations at our Luling, Louisiana facility continue. And in the interim, we have supply agreements in place to meet the demand for what we envision will be the #2 molecule in crop protection behind glyphosate.
From a global corn perspective, as shown on Slide 13, the factor that stands out is the durability of the portfolio in a challenging environment. This is illustrated by the expectation that we held or grew our global genetic share. Although our global germplasm price mix excluding currency is expected to be down slightly for this fiscal year with anticipated stable to improving corn acres and commodity prices, we expect to see global price mix lift move to the positive in fiscal year '17. As we finalize our price guards, we'll share more. This lift is then expected to accelerate in later years due to performance from breeding gains. We also expect improved cost of goods from more normalized seed production plants, leading to a significant reduction in the $90 million to $100 million of headwinds we experienced this year. 
As we review by region, let's look first at the U.S. We expect planted acres to be in the range of 91 million to 92 million acres and we expect to grow our genetic share on that footprint, delivering the second highest year of U.S. corn sales volume in the history of the company. With new generations from our advanced breeding programs and the next generations of corn insect control traits coming from SmartStax PRO and Trecepta toward the end of this plan, our U.S. business looks promising. In Europe, with an estimated 8 points of share gain in the past 8 years, we look forward to continuing to be the fastest-growing corn seed brand in the region. 
In Argentina, with an expected lift in commodity prices and reduction in export taxes, we believe that corn acres in the country could increase greater than 20%. Given our historic share in Argentina corn, this bodes well for the season ahead and beyond. In Brazil, we also see the outlook improving. We expect that acres planted with corn will increase in the mid-single digits and that the ramp-up of VT Triple PRO traded hybrids will continue again in 2017 as farmers trade up to better insect control. I'm also pleased to share that for the upcoming summer season in Brazil, we expect double-digit germplasm price increases in local currency, coming on the back of 20% plus price increases in Brazil for fiscal year '16, offsetting some of the currency downside. 
Other notable developments occurred in our complementary crops as outlined on Slide 14. I'll begin with our U.S. cotton business. The latest addition to that portfolio is Bollgard II XtendFlex Cotton in its second year of launch. We expect it to be on about 3 million acres in the U.S. this year or 4x last year's acres. With strong farmer demand for Bollgard II XtendFlex and our new cotton varieties, we expect to gain 3 or more brand share points this year or 6 points in the last 2 years. Our vegetable business is also experiencing positive momentum and operational excellence. We're managing supply well, now boasting the lowest inventory in 7 years while delivering nice GP growth exclusive of currency. 
In our Ag Productivity segment, we're maintaining our emphasis on cost discipline and portfolio optimization. As we near the anticipated bottom of the generic pricing cycle here in the fourth quarter, we expect the pricing comparison for the first half of next fiscal year to be a headwind. However, this should be partially moderated by some expected volume recovery for the full year. 
Let's transition to Climate, as shown on Slide 15. Last month, we provided an update that highlighted how we were on track for our targeted penetration of more than 12 million paid acres. That number is now expected to be more than 13 million paid acres for fiscal year '16. Overall, we are seeing paid offerings up more than 2.5x versus prior year and now expect to continue that momentum into fiscal year '17 with targeted penetration of 25 million acres with paid services nearly doubling this year's results. It's clear that farmers are seeing the value that the Climate FieldView platform provides and that step-up to paid acres builds from the total platform footprint for the technology, which is also ahead of target at more than 92 million acres. More than 75% of those platform acres are with growers who are monthly active users of our digital tools. 
In addition to strong product penetration results, recent farmer survey results indicate that growers now identify the Climate FieldView platform as the #1 digital ag brand in the industry. Global expansion of Climate FieldView is also on track, with a pre-launch in Brazil this fall and a launch in Eastern Canada in the spring of 2017. Climate has now forged partnerships across more than 10 retail, software and equipment platforms, with these relationships serving as yet another strategic differentiator. One of the significant agreements is with John Deere, and we're on track to launch our in-cab connectivity offering with Deere's new wireless data server technology for the 2016 fall harvest. 
In our other new technology platform led by our BioAg Alliance with Novozymes, we're testing microbes this year on a scale that's unmatched in the industry. At the same time, we are preparing for the launch of our first alliance microbial seed treatment for corn, which demonstrated a greater than 4-bushel average yield advantage in fiscal year '15 field trials. This upstream corn inoculant will be marketed under the Acceleron brand in the U.S. and as JumpStart XL in remaining geographies. As this product expands to additional crops, it has the potential to penetrate approximately 100 million acres by 2025, making it one of the largest biological products in the ag industry. 
The last but no less important is an update on our continued spend discipline as outlined on Slide 16. Our savings are on track and with lower estimated cost, we're looking to continue to drive efficiency through the business. We continue to track towards the expected $500 million of savings from our restructuring and cost savings initiatives by fiscal year '18, reaching an expected $375 million to $420 million by fiscal year '17. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Hugh."

I'll focus from here forward on the strategic outlook for our business. I mentioned at the outset that our view about what's to come hasn't changed. Despite ongoing industry dynamics and recent challenges, there's one unwavering constant",1023,"Thank you, Brett. I'll focus from here forward on the strategic outlook for our business. I mentioned at the outset that our view about what's to come hasn't changed. Despite ongoing industry dynamics and recent challenges, there's one unwavering constant which is our commitment to an integrated solution strategy that bring seeds, traits, chemistry and data science tools to farmers around the world. We're uniquely placed with our seed position and our digital ag platform with Climate. We believe that this strategy will create tremendous value for society, for farmers and for our owners as outlined on Slide 17, and the world is going to need it. The long-term demand trends remain robust and are reinforced by the most recent WASDE report. It indicates that year-over-year global demand growth for soybeans and corn continues to be strong, with another billion bushels of corn needed for the year ahead. Beyond that, we see robust demand continuing for decades to come. 
The need to help farmers meet that demand through sustainable intensification of agronomic solutions remains a global priority. We continue to see innovation in agriculture as being the answer to satisfy these demand curves as well as the differentiator in unlocking incremental yield from existing acres. We are best positioned to answer that need. Our leadership in this area is evidenced by the industry's most proven pipeline, one with up to $25 billion in expected peak net sales in core platforms alone. 
By better integrating these technological advances, this approach will allow farmers to maximize yield, minimize risk, improve sustainability and optimize their overall profit. It's about selecting the right seeds, traits and weed, insect and disease control with accurate data insights so that farmers can manage their operations, not just acre by acre, but increasingly row by row. It's our unique innovation platform that underpins our own strong standalone growth plan as well as the industrial logic for Bayer's proposal to acquire Monsanto, as shown on Slide 18. It starts with our leading seed and trait platform that reaches more than 400 million acres globally and strong -- our leading germplasm share in corn, soybeans, cotton and vegetables globally. We're the world's largest seller of seed-applied solutions, we're enhancing our Acceleron seed treatments with plans for our new Phase 4 nematicide, NEMASTRIKE, as well as with microbial treatments developed through our BioAg Alliance with Novozymes. 
Finally, Climate has emerged as the digital ag platform, driven by fundamental competitive advantages. Climate uniquely combines core data and software capabilities, broad commercial reach and unprecedented adoption, all of which that we'll continue to build as we integrate and hub for seeds, traits and chemistries, and that's clearly recognized by others in our industry. 
To further expand the value of this innovation platform, our technology organization has moved forward with unprecedented trials of next-generation technology in the lab and in the field. Overall, this is stacking up to be another stellar year with projections of this being the fourth year in a row with more than 20 phase advancements. You'll get the chance to see our next wave of innovation at Whistle Stop on August 17 and 18, so mark your calendars to plan and join us for this event. 
To further enhance our unique position to deliver the integrated solution strategy, we're continually optimizing our portfolio as shown on Slide 19. As a part of this optimization and further bolstering our position as the partner of choice in innovation, we've recently entered into several distinct technology agreements. Some contribute directly to the bottom line in fiscal year '16 and importantly, they all contribute to our long-term vision. So let's take a quick look at some of the most significant agreements. 
We just announced that DuPont Pioneer is a new licensee of the Intacta trait stack, pending Brazil approvals, which is yet another endorsement of the strength of this rapidly penetrating technology. We exclusively licensed our alfalfa traits and technologies to Forage Genetics International, and we're in the process of forming a strategic joint venture with Remington Holding Company to more effectively manage our elite sorghum germplasm assets. Both transactions unlock value and they create R&D focus, while still generating new technologies for our grower customers in a collaborative manner. We also recently negotiated and signed several gene editing agreements, that coupled with our own internally developed proprietary technologies, are expected to accelerate and enhance the drive to the next generation of seed and trait solutions. 
Finally, consistent with our collaborative approach to new chemistry solution development, as shown on Slide 20, we announced a new agreement with Sumitomo Chemical Company to establish future generation weed control traits stacks in several crops. It features a new PPO chemistry paired with the related tolerance gene, that not only overcomes wheat resistance issues, but also controls problematic wheats. Importantly, this new herbicide and trait are being developed in parallel, allowing farmers to access the benefits of this technology earlier than a more traditional, sequential development approach. We plan to announce other chemistry collaborations in the near future as we continue to evaluate additional opportunities to drive returns on our innovation and align our portfolio to our integrated solutions vision. 
Pierre touched on this earlier, and as I wrap up, I think it bears repeating. Our continued commitment to operate as the most innovative company in this space with a foundation of disciplined spend and portfolio management will position us well for the expected rebound in our industry. Many in this industry have theorized in integrated strategies, but we believe we're the best positioned to make this strategy a reality. With our truly unique asset position in traits, seeds and digital ag, as well as our pace and our breadth of proven innovation, we expect to continue to lead and define integrated solutions for agriculture while continuing to deliver industry-leading ongoing EBITDA margins and return on capital across our peer set, along with strong cash flow to fuel future growth as shown on Slide 21. Quite simply, this is what makes partnering with Monsanto today such an attractive, unique proposition. 
So with that, Laura, let's move to the Q&A section."

And actually, entering into 2017, we indeed believe we have momentum, and this momentum will carry us into '18 and '19 and we will enjoy a couple of tailwinds, definitely.

And actually, entering into 2017, we indeed believe we have momentum, and this momentum will carry us into '18 and '19 and we will enjoy a couple of tailwinds, definitely. So Intacta traits on 44 million to 55 million acres, as Brett mentioned, this is our assumptions today, and the demand in the market is still very strong. So we see this one as a key driver for growth. We also anticipate Xtend on 15 million acres next year, so that's also something that will carry us into '17 with momentum. And we also anticipate that some of the headwinds we have this year, we said 1 -- the 2/3 of the headwinds we've been seeing this year related to the launch of Xtend will disappear. So it's about $100 million of benefits we are anticipating next year. We also mention cost of goods momentum in both corn and soy. And there, again, around $100 million there. And the return to positive pricing in corn. On top of that obviously, there is the -- our assumption is, right now, we're not going to be seeing a devaluation in Argentina comparable to what we've seen this year. So these are done all the positive elements that we see as building momentum entering into '17. However, we have to balance those with a couple of other things, we are actually watching at this point in time. What we expect is that we will have a tough comparison in glyphosate, mostly in the first part of the year. Our anticipation is that glyphosate pricing is going to stay pretty much where it is right now. And if you look at the first half of fiscal year '16, we enjoyed pricing. We're higher than when they are today. So we anticipate this one to be a tough comp for us entering into '17. The other elements that we highlighted today is that from a deals perspective, so this year, we have the benefit of $370 million in deals. We are not anticipating at this point in time, based on the portfolio of opportunities we have in front of us, that the deals are going to be of that magnitude next year. And we'll give a little more clarity on that, I mean, when we have our operation plans in place. Tax rate will also be a little more challenging next year. I mean, based on what we are looking at right now. And we also have to balance the benefit of our restructuring actions with inflationary increase, increased commissions based on the success of our Channel model in the U.S. and obviously South America and also incentives. So if you add to that, the impact of India on our cotton business, these are the things we want to clarify, and that's why, as Hugh mentioned, we wanted to be cautious entering into '17, although, as you mentioned, we also see a lot of tailwinds there."

I think, P.J., if you think about our highest premium product that we sell across the U.S., it's our SmartStax products. And as we look at this year, SmartStax is going to make up a similar percentage to our overall business as it did last year. So I do not see farmers trading down. We have farmers on the fringes of rootworm areas that may trade down, but it's not material. We had to make some adjustments in our pricing ladder that we talked about last year to adjust for the significant pullback in the commodity price, of which now we're seeing rebound a little bit. And we had to address some of the competitive issues in the marketplace, which we did, I would argue, very effectively. And that's why I'm confident today to say that actually I think for genetic share, we're up and for brand share, we held our own in the marketplace. So I feel really good about how we ended up in the U.S. corn business. And when I look to South America, boy, farmers are not slowing down, down there at all. We're seeing -- we took a significant price increases in corn last year in Brazil. We're doing it again this year. Now granted, it's a currency offset and it's not offsetting all of it, but farmers are quickly moving to our new Triple PRO in Brazil to get better bug control. So I think even in these challenging times, farmers look for the best seed and the best traits to drive productivity on their farm and they need it more than ever. And I think we see that this year. It's really disappointing that we ended up with ongoing delays with the EU, but I have to tell you farmers were lined up to buy the Xtend technology this year, and I'm really optimistic about that one next year. So tough conditions do not slow down farmers' appetite. As Hugh said, they're looking for ways to drive productivity and profitability."

Right now, people are looking at a market more in the range of 82 million. So this is -- also this element of timing, there's a huge return that happened last year. And at the end of the fourth quarter, that's also driving some of the comps when you're looking at the Q3. But definitely, the delays in expense from a cost perspective but also from a share perspective has been the big impact in our third quarter."

But let me try and give you a little bit the landscape to the last piece of your point. I think it is complex because we're at the low point of the ag cycle. And I think the tone in some of the comments today, we see some of the early signs of this cycle beginning to turn. As we look at the Bayer proposal and as we examine some of the other strategic alternatives that have emerged, I'm personally engaged in those discussions along with the board, the support of the board and our advisers. And I would say this gets down to 2 things. It gets down to value, and it gets down to certainty. So we're convinced -- the longer this runs, we're convinced in the value of that integrated strategy. We've spent a bit of time talking about it today. And we're convinced that we have a unique position as an integrator because of our seeds, our unique position in seed and the emerging strength of our data science position. So in 2 short years, I think you've seen climate transition from theory to reality, and I think in the next 2 years that becomes even more important. So as we look at the trough, as we look at the Bayer proposal and some of these other strategic alternatives, we're focused -- my team and I, we're focused very, very clearly on creation of shareholder value. And that's where this begins, and it's where it ends. So we're going to take a very rational approach to this, bearing in mind to where the cycle is and the need for value creation, and we're going to really -- we're going to really focus on the uniqueness of Monsanto and its part as a key integrator. So I don't know if that answers your question, but it's probably up to the scope of what I can discuss on a call."

And in the early days, it's about delighting growers and sharing the insights with them. So as Brett talked about, 95 million acres up on the platform. The first round of this for us, David, was gaining experience and the same way that all apps are developed. So gaining experience and letting growers work with us on their farms and their fields. The Nitrogen Advisor has been additional functionality, and we have priced for that. And in the last 2 short years, we've got all of U.S. retail distribution up on the platform. We then -- we're either in discussion or concluded to all the machinery manufacturers. And I think the next natural step in this is to see some of our competitive companies and some alternative offerings up in that platform as well. So the grower experience -- he doesn't need multiple iPads in the cab. And I think as we move through this progression, then price -- pricing to value and retaining a piece of that value in the same way that we've done with traits becomes a natural next step. And that's, I think, the experience of 15 years of trait development blends beautifully into the next handful of years on data science development and how we broadly license this platform with others."

So what we've seen play out, unfortunately, over the last 6 months has been the challenge of operating in the EU system between the parliamentarian votes and the commissions' final decision. And we -- effectively, we watch the 2 teams play volleyball for 6 months. And today, it was great to see that the commission moved forward on a science-based decision to extend the product. So we're -- as you said, the delay has been tough. We're delighted to have the approval and the extension and are moving forward.

I feel good about our position though and our cost position and how we're competing in that industry. We're down a little bit on volumes this year, but I think that we're going to recover those back next year as we see the momentum building across the marketplace. So we're in a good place.

I think as you go around the world, every farmer finds themselves in a different position as do we. If you think about Argentina, for example, we use significant barter for our business down there, so a big chunk of our sales are through the barter system, which minimizes our credit risk with the Argentine former. They basically use the grain to buy their inputs. In the case of Brazil, keep in mind with how currency has impacted our business negatively. It helps put the Brazilian farmer in a pretty good position right now. Buying in local currency and selling in U.S. dollars is not a bad place for them. So we feel reasonably okay. I mean, with all the disruption that's occurred in Brazil in the last year, I'm actually optimistic about Brazil right now with the position of the farmer and their ability to access credit and buy products, farming looks good. And we've got Intacta, and we've got a strong corn business that's growing, and we've priced up in that environment and it seems to be holding. So we look good in South America. When you get to Eastern Europe, it's mixed deck over there. There as you've -- in the Far East, there's some real challenges, call them geopolitical challenges with the Ukraine. We've tended to manage our credit very aggressively. In other words, we don't extend a lot of credit, and we seem to be doing quite okay over there. That has impacted some of the pricing. Some of the farmers have gone to lower-priced seed, which has impacted our global pricing. But overall, we're in a good place, and we continue to be conservative on how we manage the credit."

And I have to tell you, some of the other companies out there that are struggling with the performance of their products, the Channel brands are really interesting one for them to consider to become seedsmen for because they get access to the phenomenal pipeline of genetics and traits from Monsanto, and they get to handle a brand that they sell directly to farmers, which in many cases, they've been used to and that's the model they came out of.

Thank you for your -- thanks for your question, and this will be the last question and as I indicated earlier, these are private conversations. So it's difficult to comment extensively, but we're an agricultural business. We are developing technologies on a 10-year horizon. We've been in existence for about 15 years, so you can't -- we've done many of these calls together over the years. You can look at the downcycle in an ag economy. Farmers would never farm if they thought about the peaks and troughs. So you have to see through that when you're either buying a farm or if you're developing technology. So I guess the headline in this is, if you're valuing a unique company like Monsanto, I would argue you can't look at 1 quarter. You can't look at a year. You need to take a 10- or a 20-year view, and that's how we develop technologies, and that's when you look at the promise of Climate, or you look at the value of the pipeline that Rob Fraley and his team have developed, I think you have to take that long view. We've been very clear since May that we were open to these discussions, but that the value had to be reflected for the company and the proposition that we have. And the Bayer proposal was financially inadequate. We are looking at that proposal relative to other strategic alternatives. But you have to take the long view in this because the vagaries of the commodity markets are either punishing or they develop elation, but you have to kind of take a line through that. And that's how we've always built our resource models. That's how we've always built these products on a 7- and a 10-year development cycle. And that's how we will look at this. I guess I would finish by saying, we are absolutely committed to optimizing shareowner value, and we will look at the proposal in hand, and we will evaluate these other strategic alternatives against that benchmark. That's what we need to do. Thank you for your question. And with that, I want to thank you for your patience because we were a little bit tardy in our finish today. Let me just make 2 or 3 points at the risk of repetition, and it kind of ties to Jeff's last point on the call. 2016 has been a challenging year for our industry. It's been a challenging year for the company, but our core businesses have done well, but have suffered from some regulatory delays that we're beginning to see, literally on the call today, we're beginning to see turn. Despite this, innovation in this industry is needed, and it's recognized by growers. And I think today, we're uniquely placed as a key player in any integrated platform strategy. So regardless of how that integration strategy plays out, we have a central role in that. So as I mentioned in the last question, I'm personally committed to the optimizing -- optimization of shareholder value. So we're really pleased that you joined us this morning. We are moving forward with preparation for Whistle Stop, and we hope to see you there on August 17 and 18. And if I was you, I'd be booking a slot soon because those are hot tickets and they're selling fast. So with that, thanks very much for the call today and for your continued support."

Our third quarter call marks the passage of a significant portion of the Northern Hemisphere ag season. And today, we will provide a summary of our third quarter results as well as the outlook for the balance of this year and the years ahead. This call is being webcast and you can access the webcast, supporting slides and the replay at monsanto.com. 
We have provided you today with EPS and other measures on both the GAAP and ongoing business basis. Where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in the slides and in the press release, both of which are on the website. 
This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. 
A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in our most recent 10-Q and in today's press release. The forward-looking statements are current only as of the date of this call and the company disclaims any obligation to update them or the factors that may affect actual results.

Good morning to those on the phone and thanks very much for joining us today. Today, in a departure from our previous calls, I'd like to open with a few brief comments and then pass it to Pierre, who will address our third quarter results and the outlook for the year, followed by the operational outlook for fiscal year '17 and beyond with Brett. At the end of this call, I will close by covering our longer-term strategic view and my perspective on our unique integrated solutions vision for agriculture. 
But first, let me address the Bayer proposal and other strategic alternatives directly. Over the past several weeks, with the support of our board and advisers, I have personally been in discussions with Bayer's management regarding this proposal, along with others regarding other strategic alternatives. Regarding Bayer specifically, there's no formal update at this point. We've said that we remain open and we believe that our efforts and continued constructive dialogue could allow our joint teams to explore potential next steps. 
But any value discussion is more complex given the fact that the industry is running at a low point in the ag cycle, we recognize the potential value these types of combinations create as they accelerate innovation and increase choice for farmers across a broader set of crops, geographies and production practices while improving the sustainability of agriculture around the world. We continue to believe in the value potential of the right combination. Of course, there can be no assurance that these discussions will lead to any transaction nor on what terms. It's clear that Monsanto remains the partner of choice in this industry and I assure you that we'll continue to actively explore these opportunities and pursue value-enhancing strategic options. 
Our belief in the long-term opportunity is unchanged and our growth prospects beyond fiscal year '16, with or without a deal, remain strong. The global ag cycle is at a low point and we've seen a series of recent economic and political challenges. These are huge events around the world that create instability. Today, however, we see potential for positive resolution on the horizon for some of these challenges, particularly for our Argentinian soybean business, for our Roundup Ready Xtend soybean blockbuster and the recent announcement on reregistration of glyphosate in Europe. As this tide turns and turn up well, with the changes that we've made to our business, we'll be well positioned to strengthen our leadership role in this space with our financial discipline and our steadfast commitment to innovation. 
So with that, let me pass it to Pierre."

Despite the fact that this has been a tough year and this was a tough quarter given the events that you alluded to, as a company, we've remain focused on delivering on our strategy while taking the necessary act",1841,"Thanks, Hugh, and good morning to everyone. Despite the fact that this has been a tough year and this was a tough quarter given the events that you alluded to, as a company, we've remain focused on delivering on our strategy while taking the necessary actions to set the stage for future growth as illustrated by the following. We have stayed true to our philosophy of pricing to the value of our innovation. We have delivered on significant strategic portfolio management and licensing commitments, resulting in an approximate $370 million EBIT contribution for this fiscal year as compared to $274 million in 2015. We are tracking very well towards our restructuring plan savings at a cost now closer to the low end of the range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, while transforming and modernizing the way we work. And we have delivered on our capital allocation commitment. This demonstrates our ability to maintain our focus on the variables we control, despite an unprecedented level of challenges affecting our business. These actions set us up nicely for momentum going into the anticipated rebound in the ag cycle with an expected return to growth in earnings per share in fiscal year '17, which accelerates to a mid-teens earning per share growth rate from fiscal year '17 to '21. 
With that, let's focus on the here and now and review our third quarter results as shown on Slide 4 and 5. On an as-reported basis, our third quarter earnings per share is $1.63, reflecting $0.54 for restructuring charges, environmental and litigation matters and a charge for Argentine-related tax matters. The Argentine-related tax matter resulted in a charge of $219 million, which refers primarily to a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, mostly driven by recent cumulative losses in our Argentine subsidiary. With growth in the business, we would expect to see this allowance reverse partially or in full over time. 
On an ongoing basis, this translates into $2.17 of earnings per share. Although partly offset by the benefits of share repurchases and increase row crop licensing EBIT contributions, we encountered several headwinds in the quarter. These included the expected absence of last year's Scotts licensing agreements and the anticipated glyphosate pricing declines, but also Roundup Ready Xtend-related costs and lower soybean volumes, amplified by the delayed EU import approval as well as lower cotton gross profit in India arising from pricing regulations and declines in planted acres. 
Finally, our free cash flow year-to-date is a use of $224 million as compared to a use of $789 million in the prior year, reflecting strong working capital management. From a year-to-date perspective, our Seeds and Genomics gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was nearly flat at 62%. Global corn gross profit margin was down just slightly as increased COGS from lower production plans, combined with discounting to counter competitive offers, more than offset the mix lift benefit from new hybrid introductions and price increases in local currency in regions like Brazil. 
In global soybeans, gross profit margins declined approximately 3 percentage points, primarily as a result of cost associated with Roundup Ready Xtend launch, which were amplified by the delayed European import approval. These more than offset the pricing benefit from increased Intacta penetration that was partly masked by the weak reais at a critical point in the season. Our cotton business gross profit margin reduction was due primarily to Indian pricing controls that were enacted in the third quarter of this fiscal year, while vegetable margins improved due to lower cost arising from better operations. And finally, our other crop segment margins improved with closure of the alfalfa  licensing deal with Forage Genetics. 
Moving to Ag Productivity, gross profit margins declined due to the lower Roundup pricing and the absence of the $274 million licensing deal with Scotts. Looking forward, we are seeing signs of a positive resolution for several of the headwinds we've been tracking. First, the EU Commission just affirmed that an 18-month extension of the existing authorization for glyphosate use would be completed by the June 30 deadline. In addition, we anticipate the receipt of the EU import approval for Roundup Ready Xtend stack shortly thereafter. And finally, Argentina announced an interim policy that supports mandatory testing for Intacta, leading into what we expect to be a strong start for our Southern Hemisphere businesses. 
However, despite these positive developments and expectations, with the results of the third quarter, we now expect to be at the low end of our ongoing fiscal year '16 earnings per share range of $4.40 to $5.10, which assumes approximately $0.85 of currency headwinds. After the inclusion of the Argentine-related tax matters and the favorable change in the expected amount and timing of restructuring expense, this translates into a full year as-reported earnings per share guidance at the low end of an adjusted range of $3.36 to $4.14. 
Now let's take a look at the individual components within our 2016 guidance, as shown on Slide 6. First, with recent revisions, we expect Seeds and Genomics gross profit to be down just under 5% for the full year. Importantly, exclusive of estimated currency headwinds of roughly $350 million, Seeds and Genomics gross profit is anticipated to be flat to up slightly. Practically, on a currency-neutral basis, we expect the benefit of the alfalfa license, increased Intacta penetration and global corn volumes, to offset the roughly $150 million impact of the Roundup Ready Xtend soybeans related cost and share loss, the impact of the pricing controls in India cotton and declines in planted acres there. 
Of the approximately $370 million of EBIT benefits from licensing and strategic deals expected in fiscal year '16, we recorded approximately $210 million in gross profit, reflecting the onetime upfront fee related to our alfalfa trades and technology license to Forage Genetics International. We expect the remainder of the EBIT benefit, which is mostly derived from the expected $145 million gain from the sorghum joint venture and plant sale to be recorded in other income in the fourth quarter. 
Our Ag Productivity gross profit outlook is now trending towards the lower end of our range of $900 million to $1.1 billion, as earlier estimates had assumed one of our smaller licensing and asset sales deal would benefit gross profit that was ultimately recorded in other income. For the full year, we continue to expect to sell a higher ratio of branded Roundup volume as compared to the prior fiscal year. However, we expect that full year volumes will be below our roughly 300 million gallons of capacity but not to the point of generating material volume variances. 
From a price perspective, our competitive intelligence leads us to believe that we are nearing the bottom for generic glyphosate pricing in the market, and we are not expecting significant moves from this point forward. We remain on track to deliver $165 million to $210 million in savings from our restructuring actions in fiscal year '16, primarily benefiting operating expenses. These savings, combined with spending discipline and currency benefits, contribute to our expectation that even after increased investments in new platforms, we expect to see operating spend down slightly before estimated restructuring charges and environmental and litigation matters. 
Assuming the Argentine peso exchange rates remain closer to ratio of 1:14 at the close of the fiscal year, we now expect over expense net to be relatively flat year-over-year as the nearly $180 million impact from the devaluation in Argentina is now being offset by gains on noncore asset sales of approximately $170 million. Our tax rate is expected to increase to 32% to 34% for the full year inclusive of Argentine-related tax matter. Looking out to fiscal year '17, we expect our tax rate to be more in the range of 25% to 27%, which is more aligned to recent prior years. Finally, the net effect of the benefit from our share repurchases including net financing expense should generate a net earnings per share benefit of $0.20 to $0.25 with 437 million shares outstanding at the close of our third quarter. 
Consistent with our updated earnings projections and based on the possible slight delay in the close of the sale of the precision ag equipment business to John Deere, we now adjusted our free cash flow guidance for the year to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion as shown on Slide 7. At the peak of our working capital cycle and after the successful execution of the $3 billion accelerated stock share repurchase in the second quarter, our net debt to ongoing EBITDA ratio sits at 2.6 at the close of the third quarter. We expect this to revert to a ratio in the range of 2.1 to 2.2 at the end of the fiscal year following strong expected collections. 
Looking ahead to fiscal year '17 and assuming relatively stable foreign currencies, we expect a return to growth in earnings per share as shown on Slide 8. As we shared at Q2, our expectation is that our long-term growth would not be linear, with next year marking a slower pace as we recover and reset the trajectory with the early days of Roundup Ready Xtend penetration. This expected growth is driven by the continued penetration of our soybean blockbusters, the durability of our global corn platform and an improved cost of goods outlook for both corn and soybeans. From a year-over-year perspective, this growth is expected to be partially offset by decline in glyphosate pricing, particularly in the first half of the fiscal year '17 by a lower level of non-core licensing deals and by a slight increase in spend, with inflation and expected increases in commissions and incentives offsetting the benefits from our restructuring plan. We also expect a more normalized effective tax rate of 25% to 27% for the coming fiscal year. Once we get a better line of sight on the closure of the Northern Hemisphere crop season and finalize our operational plans, we will provide a more refined outlook for '17. 
Beyond fiscal year '17, the opportunity significantly accelerates as the growth drivers of '17 are expected to expand, continuing to generate the best margins amongst our ag peers with streamline operations and portfolio advantages driving our multilayered growth into the next decade. We continue to target a mid-teens compounded annual growth rate in earnings per share from fiscal year '17, now advancing to fiscal year '21 from fiscal year '19, as we move our long-range plan and march forward. Practically, our estimated EPS for fiscal year '19 has not changed significantly from our previous guidance. We are now simply expanding the horizon. 
In closing, our financial focus remains consistent: return on innovation, financial discipline and balanced capital allocation. These, together with a sound and disciplined approach delivering on our integrated solution strategy, support long-term growth and industry-leading ongoing EBITDA margins and return on capital as shown on Slide 9. 
With that, I will pass it to Brett to walk through the operational outlook. Brett?"

While there are factors contributing to a dynamic environment in ag today, our organization is focused on delivering against the milestones that set a foundation for rapid growth and importantly, w",1512,"Thanks, Pierre, and good morning to everyone on the line. While there are factors contributing to a dynamic environment in ag today, our organization is focused on delivering against the milestones that set a foundation for rapid growth and importantly, with an optimized operating cost structure. This focus is balanced across our broad portfolio and key growth drivers as outlined on Slide 10, whether it is our seed business, crop protection or Climate, all of which I'll update you on today and our outlook for fiscal year '17. 
Let's begin with soybeans on Slide 11. Our soybean innovation drivers are expected to continue record-setting adoption rates toward their target opportunity, with both Intacta and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans anticipated to make a meaningful step-up in penetration next year. 
Let's start with the 100 million acre insect protection opportunity in South America, where we are on a good path to penetrate 75 million acres by fiscal year '19. After achieving an expected 35 million acres of Intacta Roundup Ready 2 PRO technology penetration across South America this year, we now believe that Intacta will be planted on 45 million to 55 million acres in South America in fiscal year '17. A royalty collection system in Argentina that operates consistently and with integrity would move us to the high end of that range. 
Moving to Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans on Slide 12, we now estimate that our introduction this year is just above 1 million acres across our brands and licensees. Despite the repeated delays on the EU import approval, which we expect shortly, we know that farmers want the technology and we're producing aggressively to be in a strong position for the coming selling season. To that end, our brands and licensees have plans in place to supply roughly 15 million acres of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans in fiscal year '17. In addition, we expect roughly $150 million of incremental cost and soybean share losses related to the launch and subsequent delays in the EU import approval to decrease by 2/3 next year. 
To enable the full benefits of the system, there is also good progress on the herbicide approvals as well. The EPA's public comment period for the over-the-top use of dicamba herbicide closed late last month. And we're happy to share that to date, of the more than 850 comments posted so far, more than 75% of those are comments from growers, dealers, academics and others in support of the new use. The EPA has indicated they expect to conclude the process for approval of the label for in-crop use of dicamba formulations by late summer to early fall. Our plans to enable a reliable supply of those dicamba formulations at our Luling, Louisiana facility continue. And in the interim, we have supply agreements in place to meet the demand for what we envision will be the #2 molecule in crop protection behind glyphosate.
From a global corn perspective, as shown on Slide 13, the factor that stands out is the durability of the portfolio in a challenging environment. This is illustrated by the expectation that we held or grew our global genetic share. Although our global germplasm price mix excluding currency is expected to be down slightly for this fiscal year with anticipated stable to improving corn acres and commodity prices, we expect to see global price mix lift move to the positive in fiscal year '17. As we finalize our price guards, we'll share more. This lift is then expected to accelerate in later years due to performance from breeding gains. We also expect improved cost of goods from more normalized seed production plants, leading to a significant reduction in the $90 million to $100 million of headwinds we experienced this year. 
As we review by region, let's look first at the U.S. We expect planted acres to be in the range of 91 million to 92 million acres and we expect to grow our genetic share on that footprint, delivering the second highest year of U.S. corn sales volume in the history of the company. With new generations from our advanced breeding programs and the next generations of corn insect control traits coming from SmartStax PRO and Trecepta toward the end of this plan, our U.S. business looks promising. In Europe, with an estimated 8 points of share gain in the past 8 years, we look forward to continuing to be the fastest-growing corn seed brand in the region. 
In Argentina, with an expected lift in commodity prices and reduction in export taxes, we believe that corn acres in the country could increase greater than 20%. Given our historic share in Argentina corn, this bodes well for the season ahead and beyond. In Brazil, we also see the outlook improving. We expect that acres planted with corn will increase in the mid-single digits and that the ramp-up of VT Triple PRO traded hybrids will continue again in 2017 as farmers trade up to better insect control. I'm also pleased to share that for the upcoming summer season in Brazil, we expect double-digit germplasm price increases in local currency, coming on the back of 20% plus price increases in Brazil for fiscal year '16, offsetting some of the currency downside. 
Other notable developments occurred in our complementary crops as outlined on Slide 14. I'll begin with our U.S. cotton business. The latest addition to that portfolio is Bollgard II XtendFlex Cotton in its second year of launch. We expect it to be on about 3 million acres in the U.S. this year or 4x last year's acres. With strong farmer demand for Bollgard II XtendFlex and our new cotton varieties, we expect to gain 3 or more brand share points this year or 6 points in the last 2 years. Our vegetable business is also experiencing positive momentum and operational excellence. We're managing supply well, now boasting the lowest inventory in 7 years while delivering nice GP growth exclusive of currency. 
In our Ag Productivity segment, we're maintaining our emphasis on cost discipline and portfolio optimization. As we near the anticipated bottom of the generic pricing cycle here in the fourth quarter, we expect the pricing comparison for the first half of next fiscal year to be a headwind. However, this should be partially moderated by some expected volume recovery for the full year. 
Let's transition to Climate, as shown on Slide 15. Last month, we provided an update that highlighted how we were on track for our targeted penetration of more than 12 million paid acres. That number is now expected to be more than 13 million paid acres for fiscal year '16. Overall, we are seeing paid offerings up more than 2.5x versus prior year and now expect to continue that momentum into fiscal year '17 with targeted penetration of 25 million acres with paid services nearly doubling this year's results. It's clear that farmers are seeing the value that the Climate FieldView platform provides and that step-up to paid acres builds from the total platform footprint for the technology, which is also ahead of target at more than 92 million acres. More than 75% of those platform acres are with growers who are monthly active users of our digital tools. 
In addition to strong product penetration results, recent farmer survey results indicate that growers now identify the Climate FieldView platform as the #1 digital ag brand in the industry. Global expansion of Climate FieldView is also on track, with a pre-launch in Brazil this fall and a launch in Eastern Canada in the spring of 2017. Climate has now forged partnerships across more than 10 retail, software and equipment platforms, with these relationships serving as yet another strategic differentiator. One of the significant agreements is with John Deere, and we're on track to launch our in-cab connectivity offering with Deere's new wireless data server technology for the 2016 fall harvest. 
In our other new technology platform led by our BioAg Alliance with Novozymes, we're testing microbes this year on a scale that's unmatched in the industry. At the same time, we are preparing for the launch of our first alliance microbial seed treatment for corn, which demonstrated a greater than 4-bushel average yield advantage in fiscal year '15 field trials. This upstream corn inoculant will be marketed under the Acceleron brand in the U.S. and as JumpStart XL in remaining geographies. As this product expands to additional crops, it has the potential to penetrate approximately 100 million acres by 2025, making it one of the largest biological products in the ag industry. 
The last but no less important is an update on our continued spend discipline as outlined on Slide 16. Our savings are on track and with lower estimated cost, we're looking to continue to drive efficiency through the business. We continue to track towards the expected $500 million of savings from our restructuring and cost savings initiatives by fiscal year '18, reaching an expected $375 million to $420 million by fiscal year '17. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Hugh."

I'll focus from here forward on the strategic outlook for our business. I mentioned at the outset that our view about what's to come hasn't changed. Despite ongoing industry dynamics and recent challenges, there's one unwavering constant",1023,"Thank you, Brett. I'll focus from here forward on the strategic outlook for our business. I mentioned at the outset that our view about what's to come hasn't changed. Despite ongoing industry dynamics and recent challenges, there's one unwavering constant which is our commitment to an integrated solution strategy that bring seeds, traits, chemistry and data science tools to farmers around the world. We're uniquely placed with our seed position and our digital ag platform with Climate. We believe that this strategy will create tremendous value for society, for farmers and for our owners as outlined on Slide 17, and the world is going to need it. The long-term demand trends remain robust and are reinforced by the most recent WASDE report. It indicates that year-over-year global demand growth for soybeans and corn continues to be strong, with another billion bushels of corn needed for the year ahead. Beyond that, we see robust demand continuing for decades to come. 
The need to help farmers meet that demand through sustainable intensification of agronomic solutions remains a global priority. We continue to see innovation in agriculture as being the answer to satisfy these demand curves as well as the differentiator in unlocking incremental yield from existing acres. We are best positioned to answer that need. Our leadership in this area is evidenced by the industry's most proven pipeline, one with up to $25 billion in expected peak net sales in core platforms alone. 
By better integrating these technological advances, this approach will allow farmers to maximize yield, minimize risk, improve sustainability and optimize their overall profit. It's about selecting the right seeds, traits and weed, insect and disease control with accurate data insights so that farmers can manage their operations, not just acre by acre, but increasingly row by row. It's our unique innovation platform that underpins our own strong standalone growth plan as well as the industrial logic for Bayer's proposal to acquire Monsanto, as shown on Slide 18. It starts with our leading seed and trait platform that reaches more than 400 million acres globally and strong -- our leading germplasm share in corn, soybeans, cotton and vegetables globally. We're the world's largest seller of seed-applied solutions, we're enhancing our Acceleron seed treatments with plans for our new Phase 4 nematicide, NEMASTRIKE, as well as with microbial treatments developed through our BioAg Alliance with Novozymes. 
Finally, Climate has emerged as the digital ag platform, driven by fundamental competitive advantages. Climate uniquely combines core data and software capabilities, broad commercial reach and unprecedented adoption, all of which that we'll continue to build as we integrate and hub for seeds, traits and chemistries, and that's clearly recognized by others in our industry. 
To further expand the value of this innovation platform, our technology organization has moved forward with unprecedented trials of next-generation technology in the lab and in the field. Overall, this is stacking up to be another stellar year with projections of this being the fourth year in a row with more than 20 phase advancements. You'll get the chance to see our next wave of innovation at Whistle Stop on August 17 and 18, so mark your calendars to plan and join us for this event. 
To further enhance our unique position to deliver the integrated solution strategy, we're continually optimizing our portfolio as shown on Slide 19. As a part of this optimization and further bolstering our position as the partner of choice in innovation, we've recently entered into several distinct technology agreements. Some contribute directly to the bottom line in fiscal year '16 and importantly, they all contribute to our long-term vision. So let's take a quick look at some of the most significant agreements. 
We just announced that DuPont Pioneer is a new licensee of the Intacta trait stack, pending Brazil approvals, which is yet another endorsement of the strength of this rapidly penetrating technology. We exclusively licensed our alfalfa traits and technologies to Forage Genetics International, and we're in the process of forming a strategic joint venture with Remington Holding Company to more effectively manage our elite sorghum germplasm assets. Both transactions unlock value and they create R&D focus, while still generating new technologies for our grower customers in a collaborative manner. We also recently negotiated and signed several gene editing agreements, that coupled with our own internally developed proprietary technologies, are expected to accelerate and enhance the drive to the next generation of seed and trait solutions. 
Finally, consistent with our collaborative approach to new chemistry solution development, as shown on Slide 20, we announced a new agreement with Sumitomo Chemical Company to establish future generation weed control traits stacks in several crops. It features a new PPO chemistry paired with the related tolerance gene, that not only overcomes wheat resistance issues, but also controls problematic wheats. Importantly, this new herbicide and trait are being developed in parallel, allowing farmers to access the benefits of this technology earlier than a more traditional, sequential development approach. We plan to announce other chemistry collaborations in the near future as we continue to evaluate additional opportunities to drive returns on our innovation and align our portfolio to our integrated solutions vision. 
Pierre touched on this earlier, and as I wrap up, I think it bears repeating. Our continued commitment to operate as the most innovative company in this space with a foundation of disciplined spend and portfolio management will position us well for the expected rebound in our industry. Many in this industry have theorized in integrated strategies, but we believe we're the best positioned to make this strategy a reality. With our truly unique asset position in traits, seeds and digital ag, as well as our pace and our breadth of proven innovation, we expect to continue to lead and define integrated solutions for agriculture while continuing to deliver industry-leading ongoing EBITDA margins and return on capital across our peer set, along with strong cash flow to fuel future growth as shown on Slide 21. Quite simply, this is what makes partnering with Monsanto today such an attractive, unique proposition. 
So with that, Laura, let's move to the Q&A section."

And actually, entering into 2017, we indeed believe we have momentum, and this momentum will carry us into '18 and '19 and we will enjoy a couple of tailwinds, definitely. So Intacta traits on 44 million to 55 million acres, as Brett mentioned, this",492,"Yes. And actually, entering into 2017, we indeed believe we have momentum, and this momentum will carry us into '18 and '19 and we will enjoy a couple of tailwinds, definitely. So Intacta traits on 44 million to 55 million acres, as Brett mentioned, this is our assumptions today, and the demand in the market is still very strong. So we see this one as a key driver for growth. We also anticipate Xtend on 15 million acres next year, so that's also something that will carry us into '17 with momentum. And we also anticipate that some of the headwinds we have this year, we said 1 -- the 2/3 of the headwinds we've been seeing this year related to the launch of Xtend will disappear. So it's about $100 million of benefits we are anticipating next year. We also mention cost of goods momentum in both corn and soy. And there, again, around $100 million there. And the return to positive pricing in corn. On top of that obviously, there is the -- our assumption is, right now, we're not going to be seeing a devaluation in Argentina comparable to what we've seen this year. So these are done all the positive elements that we see as building momentum entering into '17. However, we have to balance those with a couple of other things, we are actually watching at this point in time. What we expect is that we will have a tough comparison in glyphosate, mostly in the first part of the year. Our anticipation is that glyphosate pricing is going to stay pretty much where it is right now. And if you look at the first half of fiscal year '16, we enjoyed pricing. We're higher than when they are today. So we anticipate this one to be a tough comp for us entering into '17. The other elements that we highlighted today is that from a deals perspective, so this year, we have the benefit of $370 million in deals. We are not anticipating at this point in time, based on the portfolio of opportunities we have in front of us, that the deals are going to be of that magnitude next year. And we'll give a little more clarity on that, I mean, when we have our operation plans in place. Tax rate will also be a little more challenging next year. I mean, based on what we are looking at right now. And we also have to balance the benefit of our restructuring actions with inflationary increase, increased commissions based on the success of our Channel model in the U.S. and obviously South America and also incentives. So if you add to that, the impact of India on our cotton business, these are the things we want to clarify, and that's why, as Hugh mentioned, we wanted to be cautious entering into '17, although, as you mentioned, we also see a lot of tailwinds there."

I think, P.J., if you think about our highest premium product that we sell across the U.S., it's our SmartStax products. And as we look at this year, SmartStax is going to make up a similar percentage to our overall business as it did last year. So I do not see farmers trading down. We have farmers on the fringes of rootworm areas that may trade down, but it's not material. We had to make some adjustments in our pricing ladder that we talked about last year to adjust for the significant pullback in the commodity price, of which now we're seeing rebound a little bit. And we had to address some of the competitive issues in the marketplace, which we did, I would argue, very effectively. And that's why I'm confident today to say that actually I think for genetic share, we're up and for brand share, we held our own in the marketplace. So I feel really good about how we ended up in the U.S. corn business. And when I look to South America, boy, farmers are not slowing down, down there at all. We're seeing -- we took a significant price increases in corn last year in Brazil. We're doing it again this year. Now granted, it's a currency offset and it's not offsetting all of it, but farmers are quickly moving to our new Triple PRO in Brazil to get better bug control. So I think even in these challenging times, farmers look for the best seed and the best traits to drive productivity on their farm and they need it more than ever. And I think we see that this year. It's really disappointing that we ended up with ongoing delays with the EU, but I have to tell you farmers were lined up to buy the Xtend technology this year, and I'm really optimistic about that one next year. So tough conditions do not slow down farmers' appetite. As Hugh said, they're looking for ways to drive productivity and profitability."

The expectations were 85 million acres, and the market ended up being 83 million. So you saw a lot of returns in the third quarter. Right now, people are looking at a market more in the range of 82 million. So this is -- also this element of timing, there's a huge return that happened last year. And at the end of the fourth quarter, that's also driving some of the comps when you're looking at the Q3. But definitely, the delays in expense from a cost perspective but also from a share perspective has been the big impact in our third quarter."

But let me try and give you a little bit the landscape to the last piece of your point. I think it is complex because we're at the low point of the ag cycle. And I think the tone in some of the comments today, we see some of the early signs of this cycle beginning to turn. As we look at the Bayer proposal and as we examine some of the other strategic alternatives that have emerged, I'm personally engaged in those discussions along with the board, the support of the board and our advisers. And I would say this gets down to 2 things. It gets down to value, and it gets down to certainty. So we're convinced -- the longer this runs, we're convinced in the value of that integrated strategy. We've spent a bit of time talking about it today. And we're convinced that we have a unique position as an integrator because of our seeds, our unique position in seed and the emerging strength of our data science position. So in 2 short years, I think you've seen climate transition from theory to reality, and I think in the next 2 years that becomes even more important. So as we look at the trough, as we look at the Bayer proposal and some of these other strategic alternatives, we're focused -- my team and I, we're focused very, very clearly on creation of shareholder value. And that's where this begins, and it's where it ends. So we're going to take a very rational approach to this, bearing in mind to where the cycle is and the need for value creation, and we're going to really -- we're going to really focus on the uniqueness of Monsanto and its part as a key integrator. So I don't know if that answers your question, but it's probably up to the scope of what I can discuss on a call."

So real briefly, our strategy isn't where it started, but in the early days of working with the climate team in San Francisco, they were very adamant and they were right that this is about driving a grower experience. And in the early days, it's about delighting growers and sharing the insights with them. So as Brett talked about, 95 million acres up on the platform. The first round of this for us, David, was gaining experience and the same way that all apps are developed. So gaining experience and letting growers work with us on their farms and their fields. The Nitrogen Advisor has been additional functionality, and we have priced for that. And in the last 2 short years, we've got all of U.S. retail distribution up on the platform. We then -- we're either in discussion or concluded to all the machinery manufacturers. And I think the next natural step in this is to see some of our competitive companies and some alternative offerings up in that platform as well. So the grower experience -- he doesn't need multiple iPads in the cab. And I think as we move through this progression, then price -- pricing to value and retaining a piece of that value in the same way that we've done with traits becomes a natural next step. And that's, I think, the experience of 15 years of trait development blends beautifully into the next handful of years on data science development and how we broadly license this platform with others."

So what we've seen play out, unfortunately, over the last 6 months has been the challenge of operating in the EU system between the parliamentarian votes and the commissions' final decision. And we -- effectively, we watch the 2 teams play volleyball for 6 months. And today, it was great to see that the commission moved forward on a science-based decision to extend the product. So we're -- as you said, the delay has been tough. We're delighted to have the approval and the extension and are moving forward.

And I really don't see anything in the near term that's going to shift that and move it in a different direction. So it's purely looking at where we were priced last year, in the first half of the year versus where we're priced right now, and seeing that, that creates a bit of a headwind for us going into next year that we'll have to manage against. I feel good about our position though and our cost position and how we're competing in that industry. We're down a little bit on volumes this year, but I think that we're going to recover those back next year as we see the momentum building across the marketplace. So we're in a good place.

I think as you go around the world, every farmer finds themselves in a different position as do we. If you think about Argentina, for example, we use significant barter for our business down there, so a big chunk of our sales are through the barter system, which minimizes our credit risk with the Argentine former. They basically use the grain to buy their inputs. In the case of Brazil, keep in mind with how currency has impacted our business negatively. It helps put the Brazilian farmer in a pretty good position right now. Buying in local currency and selling in U.S. dollars is not a bad place for them. So we feel reasonably okay. I mean, with all the disruption that's occurred in Brazil in the last year, I'm actually optimistic about Brazil right now with the position of the farmer and their ability to access credit and buy products, farming looks good. And we've got Intacta, and we've got a strong corn business that's growing, and we've priced up in that environment and it seems to be holding. So we look good in South America. When you get to Eastern Europe, it's mixed deck over there. There as you've -- in the Far East, there's some real challenges, call them geopolitical challenges with the Ukraine. We've tended to manage our credit very aggressively. In other words, we don't extend a lot of credit, and we seem to be doing quite okay over there. That has impacted some of the pricing. Some of the farmers have gone to lower-priced seed, which has impacted our global pricing. But overall, we're in a good place, and we continue to be conservative on how we manage the credit."

The Channel brand has really done well in the last couple of years. We've made some substantial improvements moving it to an agency, which created some confusion in our results for a couple of years as we made that transition, but it's going really well. And I have to tell you, some of the other companies out there that are struggling with the performance of their products, the Channel brands are really interesting one for them to consider to become seedsmen for because they get access to the phenomenal pipeline of genetics and traits from Monsanto, and they get to handle a brand that they sell directly to farmers, which in many cases, they've been used to and that's the model they came out of. So we feel really good about multi-brand strategy and how it's playing out."

Thank you for your -- thanks for your question, and this will be the last question and as I indicated earlier, these are private conversations. So it's difficult to comment extensively, but we're an agricultural business. We are developing technologies on a 10-year horizon. We've been in existence for about 15 years, so you can't -- we've done many of these calls together over the years. You can look at the downcycle in an ag economy. Farmers would never farm if they thought about the peaks and troughs. So you have to see through that when you're either buying a farm or if you're developing technology. So I guess the headline in this is, if you're valuing a unique company like Monsanto, I would argue you can't look at 1 quarter. You can't look at a year. You need to take a 10- or a 20-year view, and that's how we develop technologies, and that's when you look at the promise of Climate, or you look at the value of the pipeline that Rob Fraley and his team have developed, I think you have to take that long view. We've been very clear since May that we were open to these discussions, but that the value had to be reflected for the company and the proposition that we have. And the Bayer proposal was financially inadequate. We are looking at that proposal relative to other strategic alternatives. But you have to take the long view in this because the vagaries of the commodity markets are either punishing or they develop elation, but you have to kind of take a line through that. And that's how we've always built our resource models. That's how we've always built these products on a 7- and a 10-year development cycle. And that's how we will look at this. I guess I would finish by saying, we are absolutely committed to optimizing shareowner value, and we will look at the proposal in hand, and we will evaluate these other strategic alternatives against that benchmark. That's what we need to do. Thank you for your question. And with that, I want to thank you for your patience because we were a little bit tardy in our finish today. Let me just make 2 or 3 points at the risk of repetition, and it kind of ties to Jeff's last point on the call. 2016 has been a challenging year for our industry. It's been a challenging year for the company, but our core businesses have done well, but have suffered from some regulatory delays that we're beginning to see, literally on the call today, we're beginning to see turn. Despite this, innovation in this industry is needed, and it's recognized by growers. And I think today, we're uniquely placed as a key player in any integrated platform strategy. So regardless of how that integration strategy plays out, we have a central role in that. So as I mentioned in the last question, I'm personally committed to the optimizing -- optimization of shareholder value. So we're really pleased that you joined us this morning. We are moving forward with preparation for Whistle Stop, and we hope to see you there on August 17 and 18. And if I was you, I'd be booking a slot soon because those are hot tickets and they're selling fast. So with that, thanks very much for the call today and for your continued support."

Good morning to those on the phone and thanks very much for joining us today. Today, in a departure from our previous calls, I'd like to open with a few brief comments and then pass it to Pierre, who will address our third quarter results and the outlook for the year, followed by the operational outlook for fiscal year '17 and beyond with Brett. At the end of this call, I will close by covering our longer-term strategic view and my perspective on our unique integrated solutions vision for agriculture. 
But first, let me address the Bayer proposal and other strategic alternatives directly. Over the past several weeks, with the support of our board and advisers, I have personally been in discussions with Bayer's management regarding this proposal, along with others regarding other strategic alternatives. Regarding Bayer specifically, there's no formal update at this point. We've said that we remain open and we believe that our efforts and continued constructive dialogue could allow our joint teams to explore potential next steps. 
But any value discussion is more complex given the fact that the industry is running at a low point in the ag cycle, we recognize the potential value these types of combinations create as they accelerate innovation and increase choice for farmers across a broader set of crops, geographies and production practices while improving the sustainability of agriculture around the world. We continue to believe in the value potential of the right combination. Of course, there can be no assurance that these discussions will lead to any transaction nor on what terms. It's clear that Monsanto remains the partner of choice in this industry and I assure you that we'll continue to actively explore these opportunities and pursue value-enhancing strategic options. 
Our belief in the long-term opportunity is unchanged and our growth prospects beyond fiscal year '16, with or without a deal, remain strong. The global ag cycle is at a low point and we've seen a series of recent economic and political challenges. These are huge events around the world that create instability. Today, however, we see potential for positive resolution on the horizon for some of these challenges, particularly for our Argentinian soybean business, for our Roundup Ready Xtend soybean blockbuster and the recent announcement on reregistration of glyphosate in Europe. As this tide turns and turn up well, with the changes that we've made to our business, we'll be well positioned to strengthen our leadership role in this space with our financial discipline and our steadfast commitment to innovation. 
So with that, let me pass it to Pierre."
528414,318279627,1003879,"Monsanto Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 29, 2016",2016-06-29,"Earnings Calls","Monsanto Company","Executives","Thanks, Hugh, and good morning to everyone. Despite the fact that this has been a tough year and this was a tough quarter given the events that you alluded to, as a company, we've remain focused on delivering on our strategy while taking the necessary act",1841,"Thanks, Hugh, and good morning to everyone. Despite the fact that this has been a tough year and this was a tough quarter given the events that you alluded to, as a company, we've remain focused on delivering on our strategy while taking the necessary actions to set the stage for future growth as illustrated by the following. We have stayed true to our philosophy of pricing to the value of our innovation. We have delivered on significant strategic portfolio management and licensing commitments, resulting in an approximate $370 million EBIT contribution for this fiscal year as compared to $274 million in 2015. We are tracking very well towards our restructuring plan savings at a cost now closer to the low end of the range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, while transforming and modernizing the way we work. And we have delivered on our capital allocation commitment. This demonstrates our ability to maintain our focus on the variables we control, despite an unprecedented level of challenges affecting our business. These actions set us up nicely for momentum going into the anticipated rebound in the ag cycle with an expected return to growth in earnings per share in fiscal year '17, which accelerates to a mid-teens earning per share growth rate from fiscal year '17 to '21. 
With that, let's focus on the here and now and review our third quarter results as shown on Slide 4 and 5. On an as-reported basis, our third quarter earnings per share is $1.63, reflecting $0.54 for restructuring charges, environmental and litigation matters and a charge for Argentine-related tax matters. The Argentine-related tax matter resulted in a charge of $219 million, which refers primarily to a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, mostly driven by recent cumulative losses in our Argentine subsidiary. With growth in the business, we would expect to see this allowance reverse partially or in full over time. 
On an ongoing basis, this translates into $2.17 of earnings per share. Although partly offset by the benefits of share repurchases and increase row crop licensing EBIT contributions, we encountered several headwinds in the quarter. These included the expected absence of last year's Scotts licensing agreements and the anticipated glyphosate pricing declines, but also Roundup Ready Xtend-related costs and lower soybean volumes, amplified by the delayed EU import approval as well as lower cotton gross profit in India arising from pricing regulations and declines in planted acres. 
Finally, our free cash flow year-to-date is a use of $224 million as compared to a use of $789 million in the prior year, reflecting strong working capital management. From a year-to-date perspective, our Seeds and Genomics gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was nearly flat at 62%. Global corn gross profit margin was down just slightly as increased COGS from lower production plans, combined with discounting to counter competitive offers, more than offset the mix lift benefit from new hybrid introductions and price increases in local currency in regions like Brazil. 
In global soybeans, gross profit margins declined approximately 3 percentage points, primarily as a result of cost associated with Roundup Ready Xtend launch, which were amplified by the delayed European import approval. These more than offset the pricing benefit from increased Intacta penetration that was partly masked by the weak reais at a critical point in the season. Our cotton business gross profit margin reduction was due primarily to Indian pricing controls that were enacted in the third quarter of this fiscal year, while vegetable margins improved due to lower cost arising from better operations. And finally, our other crop segment margins improved with closure of the alfalfa licensing deal with Forage Genetics. 
Moving to Ag Productivity, gross profit margins declined due to the lower Roundup pricing and the absence of the $274 million licensing deal with Scotts. Looking forward, we are seeing signs of a positive resolution for several of the headwinds we've been tracking. First, the EU Commission just affirmed that an 18-month extension of the existing authorization for glyphosate use would be completed by the June 30 deadline. In addition, we anticipate the receipt of the EU import approval for Roundup Ready Xtend stack shortly thereafter. And finally, Argentina announced an interim policy that supports mandatory testing for Intacta, leading into what we expect to be a strong start for our Southern Hemisphere businesses. 
However, despite these positive developments and expectations, with the results of the third quarter, we now expect to be at the low end of our ongoing fiscal year '16 earnings per share range of $4.40 to $5.10, which assumes approximately $0.85 of currency headwinds. After the inclusion of the Argentine-related tax matters and the favorable change in the expected amount and timing of restructuring expense, this translates into a full year as-reported earnings per share guidance at the low end of an adjusted range of $3.36 to $4.14. 
Now let's take a look at the individual components within our 2016 guidance, as shown on Slide 6. First, with recent revisions, we expect Seeds and Genomics gross profit to be down just under 5% for the full year. Importantly, exclusive of estimated currency headwinds of roughly $350 million, Seeds and Genomics gross profit is anticipated to be flat to up slightly. Practically, on a currency-neutral basis, we expect the benefit of the alfalfa license, increased Intacta penetration and global corn volumes, to offset the roughly $150 million impact of the Roundup Ready Xtend soybeans related cost and share loss, the impact of the pricing controls in India cotton and declines in planted acres there. 
Of the approximately $370 million of EBIT benefits from licensing and strategic deals expected in fiscal year '16, we recorded approximately $210 million in gross profit, reflecting the onetime upfront fee related to our alfalfa trades and technology license to Forage Genetics International. We expect the remainder of the EBIT benefit, which is mostly derived from the expected $145 million gain from the sorghum joint venture and plant sale to be recorded in other income in the fourth quarter. 
Our Ag Productivity gross profit outlook is now trending towards the lower end of our range of $900 million to $1.1 billion, as earlier estimates had assumed one of our smaller licensing and asset sales deal would benefit gross profit that was ultimately recorded in other income. For the full year, we continue to expect to sell a higher ratio of branded Roundup volume as compared to the prior fiscal year. However, we expect that full year volumes will be below our roughly 300 million gallons of capacity but not to the point of generating material volume variances. 
From a price perspective, our competitive intelligence leads us to believe that we are nearing the bottom for generic glyphosate pricing in the market, and we are not expecting significant moves from this point forward. We remain on track to deliver $165 million to $210 million in savings from our restructuring actions in fiscal year '16, primarily benefiting operating expenses. These savings, combined with spending discipline and currency benefits, contribute to our expectation that even after increased investments in new platforms, we expect to see operating spend down slightly before estimated restructuring charges and environmental and litigation matters. 
Assuming the Argentine peso exchange rates remain closer to ratio of 1:14 at the close of the fiscal year, we now expect over expense net to be relatively flat year-over-year as the nearly $180 million impact from the devaluation in Argentina is now being offset by gains on noncore asset sales of approximately $170 million. Our tax rate is expected to increase to 32% to 34% for the full year inclusive of Argentine-related tax matter. Looking out to fiscal year '17, we expect our tax rate to be more in the range of 25% to 27%, which is more aligned to recent prior years. Finally, the net effect of the benefit from our share repurchases including net financing expense should generate a net earnings per share benefit of $0.20 to $0.25 with 437 million shares outstanding at the close of our third quarter. 
Consistent with our updated earnings projections and based on the possible slight delay in the close of the sale of the precision ag equipment business to John Deere, we now adjusted our free cash flow guidance for the year to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion as shown on Slide 7. At the peak of our working capital cycle and after the successful execution of the $3 billion accelerated stock share repurchase in the second quarter, our net debt to ongoing EBITDA ratio sits at 2.6 at the close of the third quarter. We expect this to revert to a ratio in the range of 2.1 to 2.2 at the end of the fiscal year following strong expected collections. 
Looking ahead to fiscal year '17 and assuming relatively stable foreign currencies, we expect a return to growth in earnings per share as shown on Slide 8. As we shared at Q2, our expectation is that our long-term growth would not be linear, with next year marking a slower pace as we recover and reset the trajectory with the early days of Roundup Ready Xtend penetration. This expected growth is driven by the continued penetration of our soybean blockbusters, the durability of our global corn platform and an improved cost of goods outlook for both corn and soybeans. From a year-over-year perspective, this growth is expected to be partially offset by decline in glyphosate pricing, particularly in the first half of the fiscal year '17 by a lower level of non-core licensing deals and by a slight increase in spend, with inflation and expected increases in commissions and incentives offsetting the benefits from our restructuring plan. We also expect a more normalized effective tax rate of 25% to 27% for the coming fiscal year. Once we get a better line of sight on the closure of the Northern Hemisphere crop season and finalize our operational plans, we will provide a more refined outlook for '17. 
Beyond fiscal year '17, the opportunity significantly accelerates as the growth drivers of '17 are expected to expand, continuing to generate the best margins amongst our ag peers with streamline operations and portfolio advantages driving our multilayered growth into the next decade. We continue to target a mid-teens compounded annual growth rate in earnings per share from fiscal year '17, now advancing to fiscal year '21 from fiscal year '19, as we move our long-range plan and march forward. Practically, our estimated EPS for fiscal year '19 has not changed significantly from our previous guidance. We are now simply expanding the horizon. 
In closing, our financial focus remains consistent: return on innovation, financial discipline and balanced capital allocation. These, together with a sound and disciplined approach delivering on our integrated solution strategy, support long-term growth and industry-leading ongoing EBITDA margins and return on capital as shown on Slide 9. 
With that, I will pass it to Brett to walk through the operational outlook. Brett?"

While there are factors contributing to a dynamic environment in ag today, our organization is focused on delivering against the milestones that set a foundation for rapid growth and importantly, with an optimized operating cost structure. This focus is balanced across our broad portfolio and key growth drivers as outlined on Slide 10, whether it is our seed business, crop protection or Climate, all of which I'll update you on today and our outlook for fiscal year '17. 
Let's begin with soybeans on Slide 11. Our soybean innovation drivers are expected to continue record-setting adoption rates toward their target opportunity, with both Intacta and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans anticipated to make a meaningful step-up in penetration next year. 
Let's start with the 100 million acre insect protection opportunity in South America, where we are on a good path to penetrate 75 million acres by fiscal year '19. After achieving an expected 35 million acres of Intacta Roundup Ready 2 PRO technology penetration across South America this year, we now believe that Intacta will be planted on 45 million to 55 million acres in South America in fiscal year '17. A royalty collection system in Argentina that operates consistently and with integrity would move us to the high end of that range. 
Moving to Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans on Slide 12, we now estimate that our introduction this year is just above 1 million acres across our brands and licensees. Despite the repeated delays on the EU import approval, which we expect shortly, we know that farmers want the technology and we're producing aggressively to be in a strong position for the coming selling season. To that end, our brands and licensees have plans in place to supply roughly 15 million acres of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans in fiscal year '17. In addition, we expect roughly $150 million of incremental cost and soybean share losses related to the launch and subsequent delays in the EU import approval to decrease by 2/3 next year. 
To enable the full benefits of the system, there is also good progress on the herbicide approvals as well. The EPA's public comment period for the over-the-top use of dicamba herbicide closed late last month. And we're happy to share that to date, of the more than 850 comments posted so far, more than 75% of those are comments from growers, dealers, academics and others in support of the new use. The EPA has indicated they expect to conclude the process for approval of the label for in-crop use of dicamba formulations by late summer to early fall. Our plans to enable a reliable supply of those dicamba formulations at our Luling, Louisiana facility continue. And in the interim, we have supply agreements in place to meet the demand for what we envision will be the #2 molecule in crop protection behind glyphosate.
From a global corn perspective, as shown on Slide 13, the factor that stands out is the durability of the portfolio in a challenging environment. This is illustrated by the expectation that we held or grew our global genetic share. Although our global germplasm price mix excluding currency is expected to be down slightly for this fiscal year with anticipated stable to improving corn acres and commodity prices, we expect to see global price mix lift move to the positive in fiscal year '17. As we finalize our price guards, we'll share more. This lift is then expected to accelerate in later years due to performance from breeding gains. We also expect improved cost of goods from more normalized seed production plants, leading to a significant reduction in the $90 million to $100 million of headwinds we experienced this year. 
As we review by region, let's look first at the U.S. We expect planted acres to be in the range of 91 million to 92 million acres and we expect to grow our genetic share on that footprint, delivering the second highest year of U.S. corn sales volume in the history of the company. With new generations from our advanced breeding programs and the next generations of corn insect control traits coming from SmartStax PRO and Trecepta toward the end of this plan, our U.S. business looks promising. In Europe, with an estimated 8 points of share gain in the past 8 years, we look forward to continuing to be the fastest-growing corn seed brand in the region. 
In Argentina, with an expected lift in commodity prices and reduction in export taxes, we believe that corn acres in the country could increase greater than 20%. Given our historic share in Argentina corn, this bodes well for the season ahead and beyond. In Brazil, we also see the outlook improving. We expect that acres planted with corn will increase in the mid-single digits and that the ramp-up of VT Triple PRO traded hybrids will continue again in 2017 as farmers trade up to better insect control. I'm also pleased to share that for the upcoming summer season in Brazil, we expect double-digit germplasm price increases in local currency, coming on the back of 20% plus price increases in Brazil for fiscal year '16, offsetting some of the currency downside. 
Other notable developments occurred in our complementary crops as outlined on Slide 14. I'll begin with our U.S. cotton business. The latest addition to that portfolio is Bollgard II XtendFlex Cotton in its second year of launch. We expect it to be on about 3 million acres in the U.S. this year or 4x last year's acres. With strong farmer demand for Bollgard II XtendFlex and our new cotton varieties, we expect to gain 3 or more brand share points this year or 6 points in the last 2 years. Our vegetable business is also experiencing positive momentum and operational excellence. We're managing supply well, now boasting the lowest inventory in 7 years while delivering nice GP growth exclusive of currency. 
In our Ag Productivity segment, we're maintaining our emphasis on cost discipline and portfolio optimization. As we near the anticipated bottom of the generic pricing cycle here in the fourth quarter, we expect the pricing comparison for the first half of next fiscal year to be a headwind. However, this should be partially moderated by some expected volume recovery for the full year. 
Let's transition to Climate, as shown on Slide 15. Last month, we provided an update that highlighted how we were on track for our targeted penetration of more than 12 million paid acres. That number is now expected to be more than 13 million paid acres for fiscal year '16. Overall, we are seeing paid offerings up more than 2.5x versus prior year and now expect to continue that momentum into fiscal year '17 with targeted penetration of 25 million acres with paid services nearly doubling this year's results. It's clear that farmers are seeing the value that the Climate FieldView platform provides and that step-up to paid acres builds from the total platform footprint for the technology, which is also ahead of target at more than 92 million acres. More than 75% of those platform acres are with growers who are monthly active users of our digital tools. 
In addition to strong product penetration results, recent farmer survey results indicate that growers now identify the Climate FieldView platform as the #1 digital ag brand in the industry. Global expansion of Climate FieldView is also on track, with a pre-launch in Brazil this fall and a launch in Eastern Canada in the spring of 2017. Climate has now forged partnerships across more than 10 retail, software and equipment platforms, with these relationships serving as yet another strategic differentiator. One of the significant agreements is with John Deere, and we're on track to launch our in-cab connectivity offering with Deere's new wireless data server technology for the 2016 fall harvest. 
In our other new technology platform led by our BioAg Alliance with Novozymes, we're testing microbes this year on a scale that's unmatched in the industry. At the same time, we are preparing for the launch of our first alliance microbial seed treatment for corn, which demonstrated a greater than 4-bushel average yield advantage in fiscal year '15 field trials. This upstream corn inoculant will be marketed under the Acceleron brand in the U.S. and as JumpStart XL in remaining geographies. As this product expands to additional crops, it has the potential to penetrate approximately 100 million acres by 2025, making it one of the largest biological products in the ag industry. 
The last but no less important is an update on our continued spend discipline as outlined on Slide 16. Our savings are on track and with lower estimated cost, we're looking to continue to drive efficiency through the business. We continue to track towards the expected $500 million of savings from our restructuring and cost savings initiatives by fiscal year '18, reaching an expected $375 million to $420 million by fiscal year '17. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Hugh."

I'll focus from here forward on the strategic outlook for our business. I mentioned at the outset that our view about what's to come hasn't changed. Despite ongoing industry dynamics and recent challenges, there's one unwavering constant",1023,"Thank you, Brett. I'll focus from here forward on the strategic outlook for our business. I mentioned at the outset that our view about what's to come hasn't changed. Despite ongoing industry dynamics and recent challenges, there's one unwavering constant which is our commitment to an integrated solution strategy that bring seeds, traits, chemistry and data science tools to farmers around the world. We're uniquely placed with our seed position and our digital ag platform with Climate. We believe that this strategy will create tremendous value for society, for farmers and for our owners as outlined on Slide 17, and the world is going to need it. The long-term demand trends remain robust and are reinforced by the most recent WASDE report. It indicates that year-over-year global demand growth for soybeans and corn continues to be strong, with another billion bushels of corn needed for the year ahead. Beyond that, we see robust demand continuing for decades to come. 
The need to help farmers meet that demand through sustainable intensification of agronomic solutions remains a global priority. We continue to see innovation in agriculture as being the answer to satisfy these demand curves as well as the differentiator in unlocking incremental yield from existing acres. We are best positioned to answer that need. Our leadership in this area is evidenced by the industry's most proven pipeline, one with up to $25 billion in expected peak net sales in core platforms alone. 
By better integrating these technological advances, this approach will allow farmers to maximize yield, minimize risk, improve sustainability and optimize their overall profit. It's about selecting the right seeds, traits and weed, insect and disease control with accurate data insights so that farmers can manage their operations, not just acre by acre, but increasingly row by row. It's our unique innovation platform that underpins our own strong standalone growth plan as well as the industrial logic for Bayer's proposal to acquire Monsanto, as shown on Slide 18. It starts with our leading seed and trait platform that reaches more than 400 million acres globally and strong -- our leading germplasm share in corn, soybeans, cotton and vegetables globally. We're the world's largest seller of seed-applied solutions, we're enhancing our Acceleron seed treatments with plans for our new Phase 4 nematicide, NEMASTRIKE as well as with microbial treatments developed through our BioAg Alliance with Novozymes. 
Finally, Climate has emerged as the digital ag platform, driven by fundamental competitive advantages. Climate uniquely combines core data and software capabilities, broad commercial reach and unprecedented adoption, all of which that we'll continue to build as we integrate and hub for seeds, traits and chemistries, and that's clearly recognized by others in our industry. 
To further expand the value of this innovation platform, our technology organization has moved forward with unprecedented trials of next-generation technology in the lab and in the field. Overall, this is stacking up to be another stellar year with projections of this being the fourth year in a row with more than 20 phase advancements. You'll get the chance to see our next wave of innovation at Whistle Stop on August 17 and 18, so mark your calendars to plan and join us for this event. 
To further enhance our unique position to deliver the integrated solution strategy, we're continually optimizing our portfolio as shown on Slide 19. As a part of this optimization and further bolstering our position as the partner of choice in innovation, we've recently entered into several distinct technology agreements. Some contribute directly to the bottom line in fiscal year '16 and importantly, they all contribute to our long-term vision. So let's take a quick look at some of the most significant agreements. 
We just announced that DuPont Pioneer is a new licensee of the Intacta trait stack, pending Brazil approvals, which is yet another endorsement of the strength of this rapidly penetrating technology. We exclusively licensed our alfalfa traits and technologies to Forage Genetics International, and we're in the process of forming a strategic joint venture with Remington Holding Company to more effectively manage our elite sorghum germplasm assets. Both transactions unlock value and they create R&D focus, while still generating new technologies for our grower customers in a collaborative manner. We also recently negotiated and signed several gene editing agreements, that coupled with our own internally developed proprietary technologies, are expected to accelerate and enhance the drive to the next generation of seed and trait solutions. 
Finally, consistent with our collaborative approach to new chemistry solution development, as shown on Slide 20, we announced a new agreement with Sumitomo Chemical Company to establish future generation weed control traits stacks in several crops. It features a new PPO chemistry paired with the related tolerance gene, that not only overcomes wheat resistance issues, but also controls problematic wheats. Importantly, this new herbicide and trait are being developed in parallel, allowing farmers to access the benefits of this technology earlier than a more traditional, sequential development approach. We plan to announce other chemistry collaborations in the near future as we continue to evaluate additional opportunities to drive returns on our innovation and align our portfolio to our integrated solutions vision. 
Pierre touched on this earlier, and as I wrap up, I think it bears repeating. Our continued commitment to operate as the most innovative company in this space with a foundation of disciplined spend and portfolio management will position us well for the expected rebound in our industry. Many in this industry have theorized in integrated strategies, but we believe we're the best positioned to make this strategy a reality. With our truly unique asset position in traits, seeds and digital ag, as well as our pace and our breadth of proven innovation, we expect to continue to lead and define integrated solutions for agriculture while continuing to deliver industry-leading ongoing EBITDA margins and return on capital across our peer set, along with strong cash flow to fuel future growth as shown on Slide 21. Quite simply, this is what makes partnering with Monsanto today such an attractive, unique proposition. 
So with that, Laura, let's move to the Q&A section."

And actually, entering into 2017, we indeed believe we have momentum, and this momentum will carry us into '18 and '19 and we will enjoy a couple of tailwinds, definitely.

And actually, entering into 2017, we indeed believe we have momentum, and this momentum will carry us into '18 and '19 and we will enjoy a couple of tailwinds, definitely. So Intacta traits on 44 million to 55 million acres, as Brett mentioned, this is our assumptions today, and the demand in the market is still very strong. So we see this one as a key driver for growth. We also anticipate Xtend on 15 million acres next year, so that's also something that will carry us into '17 with momentum. And we also anticipate that some of the headwinds we have this year, we said 1 -- the 2/3 of the headwinds we've been seeing this year related to the launch of Xtend will disappear. So it's about $100 million of benefits we are anticipating next year. We also mention cost of goods momentum in both corn and soy. And there, again, around $100 million there. And the return to positive pricing in corn. On top of that obviously, there is the -- our assumption is, right now, we're not going to be seeing a devaluation in Argentina comparable to what we've seen this year. So these are done all the positive elements that we see as building momentum entering into '17. However, we have to balance those with a couple of other things, we are actually watching at this point in time. What we expect is that we will have a tough comparison in glyphosate, mostly in the first part of the year. Our anticipation is that glyphosate pricing is going to stay pretty much where it is right now. And if you look at the first half of fiscal year '16, we enjoyed pricing. We're higher than when they are today. So we anticipate this one to be a tough comp for us entering into '17. The other elements that we highlighted today is that from a deals perspective, so this year, we have the benefit of $370 million in deals. We are not anticipating at this point in time, based on the portfolio of opportunities we have in front of us, that the deals are going to be of that magnitude next year. And we'll give a little more clarity on that, I mean, when we have our operation plans in place. Tax rate will also be a little more challenging next year. I mean, based on what we are looking at right now. And we also have to balance the benefit of our restructuring actions with inflationary increase, increased commissions based on the success of our Channel model in the U.S. and obviously South America and also incentives. So if you add to that, the impact of India on our cotton business, these are the things we want to clarify, and that's why, as Hugh mentioned, we wanted to be cautious entering into '17, although, as you mentioned, we also see a lot of tailwinds there."

I think, P.J., if you think about our highest premium product that we sell across the U.S., it's our SmartStax products. And as we look at this year, SmartStax is going to make up a similar percentage to our overall business as it did last year. So I do not see farmers trading down. We have farmers on the fringes of rootworm areas that may trade down, but it's not material. We had to make some adjustments in our pricing ladder that we talked about last year to adjust for the significant pullback in the commodity price, of which now we're seeing rebound a little bit. And we had to address some of the competitive issues in the marketplace, which we did, I would argue, very effectively. And that's why I'm confident today to say that actually I think for genetic share, we're up and for brand share, we held our own in the marketplace. So I feel really good about how we ended up in the U.S. corn business. And when I look to South America, boy, farmers are not slowing down, down there at all. We're seeing -- we took a significant price increases in corn last year in Brazil. We're doing it again this year. Now granted, it's a currency offset and it's not offsetting all of it, but farmers are quickly moving to our new Triple PRO in Brazil to get better bug control. So I think even in these challenging times, farmers look for the best seed and the best traits to drive productivity on their farm and they need it more than ever. And I think we see that this year. It's really disappointing that we ended up with ongoing delays with the EU, but I have to tell you farmers were lined up to buy the Xtend technology this year, and I'm really optimistic about that one next year. So tough conditions do not slow down farmers' appetite. As Hugh said, they're looking for ways to drive productivity and profitability."

But let me try and give you a little bit the landscape to the last piece of your point. I think it is complex because we're at the low point of the ag cycle. And I think the tone in some of the comments today, we see some of the early signs of this cycle beginning to turn. As we look at the Bayer proposal and as we examine some of the other strategic alternatives that have emerged, I'm personally engaged in those discussions along with the board, the support of the board and our advisers. And I would say this gets down to 2 things. It gets down to value, and it gets down to certainty. So we're convinced -- the longer this runs, we're convinced in the value of that integrated strategy. We've spent a bit of time talking about it today. And we're convinced that we have a unique position as an integrator because of our seeds, our unique position in seed and the emerging strength of our data science position. So in 2 short years, I think you've seen climate transition from theory to reality, and I think in the next 2 years that becomes even more important. So as we look at the trough, as we look at the Bayer proposal and some of these other strategic alternatives, we're focused -- my team and I, we're focused very, very clearly on creation of shareholder value. And that's where this begins, and it's where it ends. So we're going to take a very rational approach to this, bearing in mind to where the cycle is and the need for value creation, and we're going to really -- we're going to really focus on the uniqueness of Monsanto and its part as a key integrator. So I don't know if that answers your question, but it's probably up to the scope of what I can discuss on a call."

So real briefly, our strategy isn't where it started, but in the early days of working with the climate team in San Francisco, they were very adamant and they were right that this is about driving a grower experience. And in the early days, it's about delighting growers and sharing the insights with them. So as Brett talked about, 95 million acres up on the platform. The first round of this for us, David, was gaining experience and the same way that all apps are developed. So gaining experience and letting growers work with us on their farms and their fields. The Nitrogen Advisor has been additional functionality, and we have priced for that. And in the last 2 short years, we've got all of U.S. retail distribution up on the platform. We then -- we're either in discussion or concluded to all the machinery manufacturers. And I think the next natural step in this is to see some of our competitive companies and some alternative offerings up in that platform as well. So the grower experience -- he doesn't need multiple iPads in the cab. And I think as we move through this progression, then price -- pricing to value and retaining a piece of that value in the same way that we've done with traits becomes a natural next step. And that's, I think, the experience of 15 years of trait development blends beautifully into the next handful of years on data science development and how we broadly license this platform with others."

They took 4 years, did an incredibly detailed review and analysis and concluded that the product is absolutely safe and has no indication of carcinogenicity. So what we've seen play out, unfortunately, over the last 6 months has been the challenge of operating in the EU system between the parliamentarian votes and the commissions' final decision. And we -- effectively, we watch the 2 teams play volleyball for 6 months. And today, it was great to see that the commission moved forward on a science-based decision to extend the product. So we're -- as you said, the delay has been tough. We're delighted to have the approval and the extension and are moving forward. And we think that, that, frankly, this has been a part of the logjam that has delayed our over-the-top Xtend approval and we're -- I think that the real good news from today's announcement is I think it accelerates the timing on the approval for the over-the-top application of Xtend."

So it's purely looking at where we were priced last year, in the first half of the year versus where we're priced right now, and seeing that, that creates a bit of a headwind for us going into next year that we'll have to manage against. I feel good about our position though and our cost position and how we're competing in that industry. We're down a little bit on volumes this year, but I think that we're going to recover those back next year as we see the momentum building across the marketplace. So we're in a good place.

I think as you go around the world, every farmer finds themselves in a different position as do we. If you think about Argentina, for example, we use significant barter for our business down there, so a big chunk of our sales are through the barter system, which minimizes our credit risk with the Argentine former. They basically use the grain to buy their inputs. In the case of Brazil, keep in mind with how currency has impacted our business negatively. It helps put the Brazilian farmer in a pretty good position right now. Buying in local currency and selling in U.S. dollars is not a bad place for them. So we feel reasonably okay. I mean, with all the disruption that's occurred in Brazil in the last year, I'm actually optimistic about Brazil right now with the position of the farmer and their ability to access credit and buy products, farming looks good. And we've got Intacta, and we've got a strong corn business that's growing, and we've priced up in that environment and it seems to be holding. So we look good in South America. When you get to Eastern Europe, it's mixed deck over there. There as you've -- in the Far East, there's some real challenges, call them geopolitical challenges with the Ukraine. We've tended to manage our credit very aggressively. In other words, we don't extend a lot of credit, and we seem to be doing quite okay over there. That has impacted some of the pricing. Some of the farmers have gone to lower-priced seed, which has impacted our global pricing. But overall, we're in a good place, and we continue to be conservative on how we manage the credit."

The Channel brand has really done well in the last couple of years. We've made some substantial improvements moving it to an agency, which created some confusion in our results for a couple of years as we made that transition, but it's going really well. And I have to tell you, some of the other companies out there that are struggling with the performance of their products, the Channel brands are really interesting one for them to consider to become seedsmen for because they get access to the phenomenal pipeline of genetics and traits from Monsanto, and they get to handle a brand that they sell directly to farmers, which in many cases, they've been used to and that's the model they came out of.

Farmers would never farm if they thought about the peaks and troughs. So you have to see through that when you're either buying a farm or if you're developing technology. So I guess the headline in this is, if you're valuing a unique company like Monsanto, I would argue you can't look at 1 quarter. You can't look at a year. You need to take a 10- or a 20-year view, and that's how we develop technologies, and that's when you look at the promise of Climate, or you look at the value of the pipeline that Rob Fraley and his team have developed, I think you have to take that long view. We've been very clear since May that we were open to these discussions, but that the value had to be reflected for the company and the proposition that we have. And the Bayer proposal was financially inadequate. We are looking at that proposal relative to other strategic alternatives. But you have to take the long view in this because the vagaries of the commodity markets are either punishing or they develop elation, but you have to kind of take a line through that. And that's how we've always built our resource models. That's how we've always built these products on a 7- and a 10-year development cycle. And that's how we will look at this. I guess I would finish by saying, we are absolutely committed to optimizing shareowner value, and we will look at the proposal in hand, and we will evaluate these other strategic alternatives against that benchmark. That's what we need to do. Thank you for your question. And with that, I want to thank you for your patience because we were a little bit tardy in our finish today. Let me just make 2 or 3 points at the risk of repetition, and it kind of ties to Jeff's last point on the call. 2016 has been a challenging year for our industry. It's been a challenging year for the company, but our core businesses have done well, but have suffered from some regulatory delays that we're beginning to see, literally on the call today, we're beginning to see turn. Despite this, innovation in this industry is needed, and it's recognized by growers. And I think today, we're uniquely placed as a key player in any integrated platform strategy. So regardless of how that integration strategy plays out, we have a central role in that. So as I mentioned in the last question, I'm personally committed to the optimizing -- optimization of shareholder value. So we're really pleased that you joined us this morning. We are moving forward with preparation for Whistle Stop, and we hope to see you there on August 17 and 18. And if I was you, I'd be booking a slot soon because those are hot tickets and they're selling fast. So with that, thanks very much for the call today and for your continued support."

Also joining me from the IR team are Priyal Patel, Ben Campelman [ph] and Krista Gansler. Our fourth quarter called marks the close of the fiscal year and, importantly, provides our initial outlook into the operational plans and financial guidance for fiscal year '17. 
This call is being webcast and you can access the webcast, supporting slides and the replay at monsanto.com.
We've provided you with EPS and other measures on both a GAAP and ongoing business basis. Where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in the slides and in the press release, both of which are on the website.
This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements.
A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in our most recent 10-Q and in today's press release. The forward-looking statements are current only as of the date of this call and the company disclaims any obligation to update them or the factors that may affect actual results.
First, let me review our year end results as shown on Slide 6 and 7. We delivered as-reported full year earnings per share of $2.99, reflecting $0.56 of expense for Argentine related tax matters, $0.59 for restructuring charges, $0.38 of expense for environmental and litigation matters and $0.04 of income from discontinued operations. On an ongoing basis, earnings per share were $4.48 for fiscal year '16, slightly above our most recent guidance for the year. 
Finally, our free cash flow for the fiscal year was $1.7 billion and exceeded the high end of our guidance range due to a strong start for the South American season. With that brief overview let me hand it to Hugh to provide the strategic outlook."

I'd like to begin this morning with our agreement to combine with Bayer in this new area for agriculture. Our Board of Directors underwent a comprehensive evaluation process and assessed a broad range of strategic options and opportunities. We unanimously determined a combination with Bayer represents the most compelling value for share owners with the most certainty through the all-cash consideration. 
So with this agreement as the backdrop, our 2 priorities going forward are as follows: First, delivering on the 2017 operational plan and key business milestones; and second, executing on the necessary steps to close the deal which is targeted for the end of calendar year 2017. To be clear, our long-term growth plan and our pipeline remain intact and consistent with what we shared at our [indiscernible] investor event in mid-August. However, we recognize that what matters most to our owners now is delivering 2017 and closing the deal. So that will be our focus for the year ahead and in these updates to you. 
This deal was struck because the overarching need to deliver innovation to growers continues as demand continues to climb. I know that that may seem incongruent especially when corn is below $4 a bushel and soybeans are below $10. However, the most recent [indiscernible] report demonstrated that the demand trend remains both intact and robust. In fact, as seen on Slide 8, the trend line is more than 1 billion bushels of growth a year for corn and greater than 500 million bushels of growth a year for soybeans, which is consistent with the historical growth trends. 
Meeting that demand over the next decade would require a twofold increase in the rate of yield growth for corn and a fourfold increase for soybeans. Innovation, quite simply, is the best way to increase productivity to meet this projected demand. And our unique platform advantages provide this innovation, as shown on Slide 9. It all starts with our industry-leading seeds and traits technologies which reach approximately 400 million acres today as a result of strong grower demand and our historical broad licensing approach. 
This footprint serves as the foundation for future upgrades and new technologies which includes the global annual corn germplasm upgrade, Intacta Roundup Ready 2 Pro, the Roundup Ready Xtend crop system, seed treatments through our BioAg Alliance with Novozymes and finally our unique Climate FieldView platform. 
This platform has become the digital ag standard for growers large and small with its reach now on 95 million acres. To reinforce our innovation platform leadership, we recently expanded our capabilities in genome editing. In addition to those with target gene [indiscernible] we now have agreements in place with Dell Agro Sciences and the Broad Institute to further unlock technological capabilities in this rapidly expanding area of signs[ph] . Further, these unique innovation platforms are highly complementary to Bayer's crop protection business. As you know, at Monsanto, we've discussed the value of enhanced agricultural portfolio for a long time. When entering a new area and agriculture, one of which growers are demanding new solutions and technologies to be more profitable and more sustainable. 
By pairing Bayer's exceptional crop protection portfolio with our seeds and traits and Climate FieldView platform, we expect to accelerate the rate and the delivery of advancements that will make a real difference on the farm. 
To get there from here, we need to close the deal and we're confident in our path to do so. This confidence stems from the following points: First, these are 2 different but complementary businesses that we're proposing to combine with limited overlap in products and geographies; second, we have a long history of making our technologies widely accessible through licensing and open infrastructure and Bayer has indicated that we are committed to continuing that practice; and third, Bayer's backed up this confidence with a $2 billion reverse break up fee. 
Our early outreach to various stakeholders in the recent Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, led by Senator Grassley, bolsters this confidence, as an indication of a broader understanding of the factors and the regulatory process.
Moving to Slide 10. We've provided our anticipated time line for the transaction and we look forward to updating you on the status as we move forward. Until then, we're committed to operate as an independent company and we're focused fully on the year ahead. 
With strong demand for new soybean technologies and improved cost of goods, we expect to return to growth in our ongoing earnings per share in fiscal year 2017 and anticipate up to 9% growth year-over-year. 
So with those brief headlines, let me pass it to Brett to discuss the operational plans to support our outlook. Brett?"

Before I outline our operational plans for fiscal year 2017, it's important to put 2016 in context. No doubt it was a challenging year. But despite those challenges, we stayed the course on several key deliverables including: Outstanding penetration of our Intacta Roundup Ready 2 Pro technology; the launch of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans; our continued global corn germplasm upgrade, which resulted in record corn seed volumes in the U.S.; and a disciplined spend management. 
Executing these deliverables provides the base for growth, positioning us well for long-term earnings power. And I'll spend my time today outlining the growth drivers for our fiscal year '17 operational plan.
Let's begin with corn on Slide 11. At a high level, we expect corn gross profit growth from global price-mix gains, share gains and continued momentum in South America. When we take a closer look, we see greater than 25% acre growth in Argentina, strong price increases planned across South America and an expected strong season in South Africa. In the U.S., we have plans in place to grow genetic share yet again and we've priced the majority of our existing hybrids flat to down slightly and our new hybrids at a premium. This maintains our premium pricing, which reflects our higher performing portfolio. And all of this together -- add all of this together, and we expect: First, our global corn germplasm price lift in local currency will be roughly flat to up low single digits in terms of percentages; and second, we plan to grow our global corn germplasm footprint in an environment where global corn acres are expected to be roughly flat. 
In soybeans in 2017, we expect to reach several significant milestones, as shown on Slide 12, and deliver improved margins as well as greater than 20% growth in global soybean gross profit compared to 2016. For Intacta Roundup Ready 2 Pro, we plan to reach an expected 45 million to 55 million acres in South America, as shown on Slide 13. We expect the vast majority of this footprint will be in Brazil. And with continued progress toward maintaining reliable value capture in Argentina, we are optimistic about that country's contribution to the overall total.
Let's move from a product with an opportunity on 100 million acres to the Roundup Ready Xtend crop system opportunity that more than doubles that figure, as shown on Slide 14. 
We now expect supply for more than 15 million U.S. acres of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans. With key import approvals now in hand and the expected approval for the in-crop use of dicamba on the horizon from the EPA, we expect Xtend related COGS to decline significantly year-over-year. In addition, we have priced Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybean varieties at a $5 to $10 premium for the improved genetics and weed control flexibility and demand for the technology is high. 
Also, we recently shared that Syngenta is a new licensee of the Roundup Ready 2 Xtend trait. With this addition, the number of seed partners offering this new option has a footprint on more than 90% of the acres in the U.S. 
Moving to our complementary crops. The Roundup Ready Xtend crop system story continues. We expect the Bollgard II XtendFlex cotton area will exceed 3 million acres in 2017 and we expect those traded acres to generate a premium for the weed control benefit they provide. 
We also see 2017 as the third consecutive year of share growth. Between our branded and licensed to cotton business in the U.S., we have grown by more than 8 share points in the last year and I expect the share growth again for this year.
Moving to Ag Productivity. We plan to maintain our emphasis on cost discipline and focus on the construction of our new dicamba facility while launching some of our new formulations of dicamba. We also plan to remain consistent with our strategy to price just above generics with our high volume glyphosate-based herbicide portfolio and this is expected to create another year of pricing headwinds. Longer-term, our plans are to add new dicamba formulations as well as new molecules like the new PPO weed control technology we are developing with Sumitomo. 
And finally, the platform that serves as the technology integrator, Climate FieldView, as shown on Slide 15, continues to see major advancements as the business and platform continues to evolve. We just released 4 new product enhancements for 2017 that will give growers better insight into their farms to help manage field variability and analyze seed performance in ways they never had before. We expect these upgrades to help drive paid acres. And our goal for the year ahead is to hit 25 million paid acres. 
We have also made progress with partnerships and collaborations in the industry to continue connecting fields and decision points faced by our customers. We have 6 total retail partners and our FieldView Drive now works on most tractors and more than half of the [indiscernible] in the U.S. In fiscal year '16, we exceeded our objective with greater than 14 million paid acres. In fiscal year '17, we're off to a strong start with FieldView Drive sales which ramped up since farm progress and provided an additional 5 million paid acres, accelerating us toward our objective of 25 million paid acres. 
In addition to equipment and retail linkages, we are also attracting new platform partners such as [indiscernible] Technologies, which manufactures and markets the world's first high-resolution soil sensing technology. Climate can now begin to analyze this data in conjunction with other information to help growers and their trusted advisers make more informed decisions on how to optimize productivity on their farm and we expect to add several more partners to the platform in the coming year.
With that, I'll turn it over to Pierre for the financial translation of these operational plans. Pierre?"

In a very challenging environment, financial discipline and balanced capital allocation were key to delivering 2016 and I am proud of what we accomplished. 
First, we successfully delivered on our restructuring and cost saving plan targets of $165 [ph] million. Second, we maintained our premium pricing approach and [indiscernible] several new strategic licensing agreements. Those 2 examples demonstrate our ability to consistently deliver return on innovation. And third, we concluded our capital allocation commitments, returning more than $30 billion in cash to our owners over the past 3 years through the combination of share repurchases and dividends. 
In the fourth quarter, we closed out the year with an as reported loss of $0.44 per share and delivered ongoing earnings per share of $0.07. The primary difference between the as reported loss and the ongoing earnings per share was related to approximately $280 million in litigation settlement costs associated with a group of legacy PCB personnel injury claims. In September, after diligent efforts, we were pleased to reach an agreement to potentially settle all the legacy PCB personnel injury claims, including those on appeal. The settlement and final payment amounts will be contingent upon the level of claim and participation which we anticipate will be met at another high level. 
In addition to the settlement expense, we incurred some additional restructuring costs and trued up our overall restructuring plan cost estimates which we now expect to be lower and in the range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion for the entire plant. 
The ongoing results of $0.07 for the quarter were better than last year, driven by the previously discussed $157 million gain from the formation of the [indiscernible] joint venture with Remington, a strong start in South America reflecting stronger corn acres, as well as lower seed returns in the U.S. in both corn and soybeans. The positive earnings results in the fourth quarter, along with strong prepays for Intacta in Brazil translate into better-than-expected free cash flows. 
Moving to the full year results. On an as-reported basis, we delivered earnings per share of $2.99, reflecting cost associated with our restructuring actions, Argentine-related tax matters, environmental and litigation matters and income from discontinued ops. On an ongoing basis, this translated to EPS of $4.48, slightly above our most recent guidance and stronger than expected free cash flows of $1.7 billion, which was $100 million above the high end of our guidance range. 
Continued focus on innovation and cost discipline set up a strong base for '17 where we are expecting a return to gross profit growth in our Seeds and Genomics segments driven by our soybean blockbusters and improved cost of goods sold. 
On an as-reported basis and as shown in our reconciliations, we expect our EPS to be in the range of $3.83 to $4.35 with proposed Bayer transaction related costs, anticipated restructuring charges and continued Argentine-related tax matters expense as the primary drivers of the difference from our ongoing estimates. 
Our fiscal year '17 ongoing earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $4.50 to $4.90, as shown on Slide 16. This translates into up to 9% growth in our ongoing earnings per share year-over-year and strong free cash flows. Within these estimates, we have assumed that currencies are relatively stable year-over-year. 
Our Seeds and Genomics segment gross profit is expected to increase mid single digits as a percent year-over-year with soybean gross profit alone expected to grow by more than 20%. This is driven primarily by the expected increases in Intacta and Xtend soybean penetration and related trade fees, plus a significant expected reduction in the cost of goods sold. 
In corn, growth is expected to come from global genomic share gains from the annual germplasm refresh and germplasm price-mix lift in local currency. However, we are prepared to respond as necessary to any emerging competitive dynamics in fiscal year '17. 
From a strategic licensing perspective, we are expecting the benefit to decline in this segment, with an expectation of approximately $60 million in gross profit towards the end of the fiscal year. 
Shifting gears, our Ag Productivity gross profit is expected to be in the range of $900 million to $1 billion reflecting year-over-year price declines in our glyphosate-based herbicides primarily affecting the first half comparison. In addition, we expect a contribution of approximately $140 million in strategic deal opportunities in this segment's gross profit in the latter half of the year than in the final deal structures. We also expect to see the early contributions from sales of the dicamba-based herbicides, that Brett referenced, and some expenses associated with the construction of the dicamba facility in this segment as well. 
Our restructuring and cost savings initiatives are on track, as shown on Slide 17, with the opportunity to deliver approximately $380 million in annual savings at the close of '17 in operating expenses and cost of goods as compared to fiscal year '15. However, overall operating expenses in '17 are expected to increase slightly with inflation at the cost associated with a return to growth of the business more than offsetting the savings from restructuring and cost savings initiatives. 
Finally, the tax rate for '17 is expected to be in the range of 25% to 28%. 
Moving to the balance sheet and cash flows. We expect to effectively convert our anticipated earnings into cash with free cash flow expected to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. This consists of operating cash flows in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.8 billion while cash used for investing activities is expected to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion assuming the successful sell of our precision ag equipment business and our first year of meaningful investment in the dicamba production facility.
In closing, these plans, with our focus on return on innovation and financial discipline, build a solid foundation for growth, as shown on Slide 18, and underpin our integrated solution strategy and vision for agriculture.
With that, I will now pass it to Laura for the Q&A."

The unique thing about this transaction is there's very little overlap, so you're bringing together a seed business and a crop protection business and I think we can bring these 2 businesses together with much better than, say, for the grower, by using the old agriculture. So I can't speculate on regulators or opine on how the regulators are going to view this. But I think it's a really unique combination and the focus on this will be driving the innovation curve. So producing better products faster. And as we embark on that conversation with regulators, we will be stressing the innovation curve and that will certainly emphasize and the hearings with Senator Grassley hosted a few weeks ago and Rob had the chance to talk about innovation. I guess the last thing I'll talk about, when we IPO-ed this business 15 plus years ago we were spending about $300 million in innovation. This year, we'll be around northwards [ph] or around $1.5 billion and I think the combination going forward allows us to more efficiently drive R&D and get to those much-needed solutions. So that will be the conversation when we get in front of the regulators spot. But the irony, Don, is, in a tough time in agriculture, there's never been a greater need for innovation and that those seem to be at odds, but that's the reality of the marketplace we're in."

So first of all, the idea that we're pricing most of our portfolio relatively flat to down a little bit is very consistent with our overall pricing strategy that we typically use as we put new products in the marketplace. And just like in other years, our new better performing products that went out this year are priced at a premium. And that premium is based on the value that they bring to the farmer better than the products that are already there. Commodity price, obviously, is part of that equation and we do that calculation. So that premium is a little bit less than it would be in years when we have higher commodity prices but they're still bringing significant value. And I think what that does is it holds in place our portfolio be at priced above others in the marketplace which we fully expect. So we don't anticipate to match up with everybody else's price card, we expect to be at the premium. I would suggest that some of the shenanigans, if you want to call them that, that happened late in the year are ineffective for everybody. It's farmers are making their decisions now as they're running their [indiscernible], they're looking at harvester working with their seed reps, making a decision on what they're going to plant and the biggest driver on that decision as it always is, is going to be performance. How are the products are performing in the field and we'll continue to have that conversation with our farmers. But we'll be ready if something's developed in the market to compete."

That's part of how you drive yield, its increasing your plants in the field, you just have to have genetics that work in that environment. That's starting to happen in South America not to the extent that it has in North America. My anticipation is, as tools like Climate are going to help dramatically in South America to help the farmer better understand the value of increasing seeding populations because it's counterintuitive. Sometimes when there's stress on the commodity price and profitability, they look at seed and they want to back off but that's the worst thing that they can do. Now I will tell you, some of the data we'll show you in soybeans that there may be opportunities. In some varieties, they are being over planted. So again, I think that's the beauty of the analytical tools that we're developing in Climate. It's doesn't always to sell the farmer more, it's to optimize the decisions that they're making to increase the profitability on the farm and I think that sometimes is misunderstood. It's all about helping to make a better decision."

So when we're looking into 2017, I mean, we see definitely a return to growth in our Seeds and Traits business. And actually just stepping back into 2016, and Brett partly covered that, but when you look at 2016, if you just look at corn and soybeans, if you exclude the impact of currency, extremely challenging environments, I mean, we've been able to grow gross profit in both segments in corn and soybeans if you exclude the currency. So there is some really nice momentum that's been building. And I think our core business has shown some very nice resilience there. If you assume entering into 2017 more stable currencies, we are confident this is a business that's going to be growing in 2017 and 2 of the elements you mentioned related to the tailwinds are effectively going to help us continue to grow but it's really the dynamics of our 2 blockbusters in soybeans, Xtend and Intacta, now that the base has been set. And in corn, and this is as Brett was mentioning this ability to continue to have some level of germplasm mix lift and some level of share gains. Now regarding the tailwinds, we see a fairly significant tailwinds in terms of cost of goods when it comes to Xtend, as you mentioned. So we quoted about 150 million of headwinds this year and we said about 2/3 of those we will be able to recover next year and this is still absolutely valid and in terms of corn we will see the tailwind associated with more production and that's, as we mentioned. However in corn, we are also seeing some higher cost in Brazil related to commodity price currency in a couple of our other elements. And we are also upgrading our seed treatments across the board on our corn cost of goods. So we're not going to see us much tailwind as we were expecting definitely in the corn business. But in soybeans, the Xtend-related costs are definitely going to show up."

And that's a coalition made up of seed companies, trade and technology providers both from Argentina and outside of Argentina, grain handlers and interested farm groups to work with the government on the new seed law. So we pushed back substantially on that. I mean, they're looking for investments in agriculture and that just discourages investment in agriculture. So we've given that feedback and we think that's been well understood. But we'll continue to work with them on that draft language. In the interim, there is a resolution in place that we can work with that we did in this year. We will continue to work with the government and the coalition to execute that resolution going into next year while we're in conjunction working on the new seed law and we will continue to look for better and better integrity in the system. As it speaks specifically to Xtend, we will continue to hold back on our Xtend technology until we see a system that has a higher level of integrity than what we currently see today. And it can either be a new seed law that's negotiated to a better place or it can be improvements in the system that we already have operating that are better satisfactory to the coalition.

So a couple of things, one, I think first you mentioned Intacta. We're still finishing out the agreement we had with farmers from a number of years ago when we made the transaction. So we were priced the same as we were last year. And the feedback from farmers is Intacta continues to deliver phenomenal value in the market. Anticipation is strong for increased yields -- or sales, as reflected in the significant prepay that we enjoyed this year based on Intacta. In regards to corn, we took significant double-digit price increases across the corn portfolio. And I look at it as trying to get back some of that loss from currency that we've experienced in the last year or 2 and so far so good. I mean, it's working.

We've provided you with EPS and other measures on both the GAAP and ongoing business basis. Where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in the slides and in the press release, both of which are on the website.
This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements.
A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in our most recent 10-Q and in today's press release. The forward-looking statements are current only as of the date of this call and the company disclaims any obligation to update them or the factors that may affect actual results.
First, let me review our year-end results as shown on Slide 6 and 7. We delivered as-reported full year earnings per share of $2.99, reflecting $0.56 of expense for Argentine-related tax matters, $0.59 for restructuring charges, $0.38 of expense for environmental and litigation matters and $0.04 of income from discontinued operations. On an ongoing basis, earnings per share were $4.48 for fiscal year '16, slightly above our most recent guidance for the year.
Finally, our free cash flow for the fiscal year was $1.7 billion and exceeded the high end of our guidance range due to a strong start for the South American season. With that brief overview, let me hand it to Hugh to provide the strategic outlook."

I'd like to begin this morning with our agreement to combine with Bayer in this new era for agriculture. Our Board of Directors underwent a comprehensive evaluation process and assessed a broad ran",788,"Thanks, Laura, and good morning to everybody on the line. I'd like to begin this morning with our agreement to combine with Bayer in this new era for agriculture. Our Board of Directors underwent a comprehensive evaluation process and assessed a broad range of strategic options and opportunities. We unanimously determined that a combination with Bayer represents the most compelling value for our shareowners with the most certainty through the all-cash consideration.
So with this agreement as the backdrop, our 2 priorities going forward are as follows: First, delivering on the 2017 operational plan and key business milestones; and second, executing on the necessary steps to close the deal which is targeted for the end of calendar year 2017. To be clear, our long-term growth plan and our pipeline remain intact and consistent with what we shared at our Whistle Stop Investor Event in mid-August. However, we recognized that what matters most to our owners now is delivering 2017 and closing the deal. So that will be our focus for the year ahead and these updates to you.
This deal was struck because the overarching needs to deliver innovation to growers continues as demand continues to climb. I know that, that may seem incongruent especially when corn is below $4 a bushel and soybeans are below $10. However, the most recent WASDE report demonstrates that the demand trend remains both intact and robust. In fact, as seen on Slide 8, the trend line is more than 1 billion bushels of growth a year for corn and greater than 500 million bushels of growth a year for soybeans, which is consistent with the historical growth trends.
Meeting that demand over the next decade would require a twofold increase in the rate of yield growth for corn and a fourfold increase for soybeans. Innovation, quite simply, is the best way to increase productivity to meet this projected demand. And our unique platform advantages provide this innovation, as shown on Slide 9. It all starts with our industry-leading seeds and traits technologies which reach approximately 400 million acres today as a result of strong grower demand and our historical broad-licensing approach.
This footprint serves as the foundation for future upgrades and new technologies which includes the global annual corn germplasm upgrade, Intacta Roundup Ready 2 Pro, the Roundup Ready Xtend crop system, seed treatments through our BioAg Alliance with Novozymes and finally our unique Climate FieldView platform. This platform has become the digital ag standard for growers, large and small, with its reach now on 95 million acres. To reinforce our innovation platform leadership, we recently expanded our capabilities in genome editing. In addition to those with TargetGene and Nomad, we now have agreements in place with Dow AgroSciences and the Broad Institute to further unlock technological capabilities in this rapidly expanding area of science. Further, these unique innovation platforms are highly complementary to Bayer's crop protection business. As you know, at Monsanto, we discuss the value of an enhanced agricultural portfolio for a long time. We're entering a new era in agriculture, one in which growers are demanding new solutions and technologies to be more profitable and more sustainable.
By pairing Bayer's exceptional crop protection portfolio with our seeds and traits and Climate FieldView platform, we expect to accelerate the rate and the delivery of advancements that will make a real difference on the farm.
To get there from here, we need to close the deal, and we're confident in our path to do so. This confidence stems from the following points: First, these are 2 different but complementary businesses that we're proposing to combine with limited overlap in products and in geographies; second, we've a long history of making our technologies widely accessible through licensing and open infrastructure and Bayer has indicated that they are committed to continuing that practice; and third, Bayer's backed up this confidence with a $2 billion reverse break-up fee. 
Our early outreach to various stakeholders in the recent Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, led by Senator Grassley, bolsters this confidence, as there's an indication of a broader understanding of the factors and the regulatory process.
Moving to Slide 10. We've provided our anticipated time line for the transaction, and we look forward to updating you on the status as we move forward. Until then, we're committed to operate as an independent company, and we're focused fully on the year ahead.
With strong demand for new soybean technologies and improved cost of goods, we expect to return to growth in our ongoing earnings per share in fiscal year 2017, anticipating up to 9% growth year-over-year.
So with those brief headlines, let me pass it to Brett to discuss the operational plans to support our outlook. Brett?"
528414,318279601,1053280,"Monsanto Company, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 05, 2016",2016-10-05,"Earnings Calls","Monsanto Company","Executives","Thanks, Hugh, and good morning, everyone. Before I outline our operational plans for fiscal year 2017, it's important to put 2016 in context. No doubt it was a challenging year. But despite those challenges, we stayed the course on several key deliverable",985,"Thanks, Hugh, and good morning, everyone. Before I outline our operational plans for fiscal year 2017, it's important to put 2016 in context. No doubt it was a challenging year. But despite those challenges, we stayed the course on several key deliverables including: Outstanding penetration of our Intacta Roundup Ready 2 Pro technology; the launch of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans; our continued global corn germplasm upgrade, which resulted in record corn seed volumes in the U.S.; and a disciplined spend management.
Executing these deliverables provides the base for growth, positioning us well for long-term earnings power. And I'll spend my time today outlining the growth drivers for our fiscal year '17 operational plan.
Let's begin with corn on Slide 11. At a high level, we expect corn gross profit growth from global price-mix gains, share gains and continued momentum in South America. When we take a closer look, we see greater than 25% acre growth in Argentina, strong price increases planned across South America and an expected strong season in South Africa. In the U.S., we have plans in place to grow genetic share yet again, and we've priced the majority of our existing hybrids flat to down slightly and our new hybrids at a premium. This maintains our premium pricing, which reflects our higher performing portfolio. And all of this together -- add all of this together, and we expect: First, our global corn germplasm price-mix lift in local currency will be roughly flat to up low single digits in terms of percentages; and second, we plan to grow our global corn germplasm footprint in an environment where global corn acres are expected to be roughly flat.
In soybeans in 2017, we expect to reach several significant milestones, as shown on Slide 12, and deliver improved margins as well as greater than 20% growth in global soybean gross profit compared to 2016. For Intacta Roundup Ready 2 Pro, we plan to reach an expected 45 million to 55 million acres in South America, as shown on Slide 13. We expect the vast majority of this footprint will be in Brazil. And with continued progress toward maintaining reliable value capture in Argentina, we are optimistic about that country's contribution to that overall total.
Let's move from a product with an opportunity on 100 million acres to the Roundup Ready Xtend crop system opportunity that more than doubles that figure, as shown on Slide 14. We now expect supply for more than 15 million U.S. acres of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans. With key import approvals now in hand and the expected approval for the in-crop use of dicamba on the horizon from the EPA, we expect Xtend-related COGS to decline significantly year-over-year. In addition, we have priced Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybean varieties at a $5 to $10 premium for the improved genetics and weed control flexibility and demand for the technology is high.
Also, we recently shared that Syngenta is a new licensee of the Roundup Ready 2 Xtend trait. With this addition, the number of seed partners offering this new option has a footprint on more than 90% of the acres in the U.S.
Moving to our complementary crops. The Roundup Ready Xtend crop system story continues. We expect the Bollgard II XtendFlex Cotton area will exceed 3 million acres in 2017, and we expect those traded acres to generate a premium for the weed control benefit they provide.
We also see 2017 as the third consecutive year of share growth. Between our branded and licensed cotton business in the U.S., we have grown by more than 8 share points in the last year, and I expect share growth again for this year.
Moving to Ag Productivity. We plan to maintain our emphasis on cost discipline and focus on the construction of our new dicamba facility while launching some of our new formulations of dicamba. We also plan to remain consistent with our strategy to price just above generics with our high volume glyphosate-based herbicide portfolio and this is expected to create another year of pricing headwinds. Longer-term, our plans are to add new dicamba formulations as well as new molecules like the new PPO weed control technology we are developing with Sumitomo.
And finally, the platform that serves as the technology integrator, Climate FieldView, as shown on Slide 15, continues to see major advancements as the business and platform continues to evolve. We just released 4 new product enhancements for 2017 that will give growers better insight into their farms to help manage field variability and analyze seed performance in ways they've never had before. We expect these upgrades to help drive paid acres, and our goal for the year ahead is to hit 25 million paid acres.
We have also made progress with partnerships and collaborations in the industry to continue connecting fields and decision points faced by our customers. We have 6 total retail partners and our FieldView Drive now works on most tractors and more than half of the combines in the U.S. In fiscal year '16, we exceeded our objective with greater than 14 million paid acres. In fiscal year '17, we're off to a strong start with FieldView Drive sales which ramped up since farm progress and provided an additional 5 million paid acres, accelerating us toward our objective of 25 million paid acres.
In addition to equipment and retail linkages, we are also attracting new platform partners, such as Veris Technologies, which manufactures and markets the world's first high-resolution soil-sensing technology. Climate can now begin to analyze this data in conjunction with other information to help growers and their trusted advisers make more informed decisions on how to optimize productivity on their farm, and we expect to add several more partners to the platform in the coming year.
With that, I'll turn it over to Pierre for the financial translation of these operational plans. Pierre?"

In a very challenging environment, financial discipline and balanced capital allocation were key to delivering 2016, and I am proud of what we accomplished.First, we successfully delivered on our restructurin",1012,"Thanks, Brett, and good morning to everyone. In a very challenging environment, financial discipline and balanced capital allocation were key to delivering 2016, and I am proud of what we accomplished.
First, we successfully delivered on our restructuring and cost-saving plan targets of $165 million. Second, we maintained our premium pricing approach and inked several new strategic licensing agreements. Those 2 examples demonstrate our ability to consistently deliver return on innovation. And third, we concluded our capital allocation commitments, returning more than $30 billion in cash to our owners over the past 3 years through the combination of share repurchases and dividends.
In the fourth quarter, we closed out the year with an as-reported loss of $0.44 per share and delivered ongoing earnings per share of $0.07. The primary difference between the as-reported loss and the ongoing earnings per share was related to approximately $280 million in litigation settlement costs associated with a group of legacy PCB personal injury claims. In September, after diligent efforts, we were pleased to reach an agreement to potentially settle all the legacy PCB personal injury claims, including those on appeal. The settlement and final payment amount will be contingent upon the level of claimant participation, which we anticipate will be met at a very high level.
In addition to the settlement expense, we incurred some additional restructuring costs and trued up our overall restructuring plan cost estimates, which we now expect to be lower and in the range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion for the entire plan.
The ongoing results of $0.07 for the quarter were better than last year, driven by the previously discussed $157 million gain from the formation of the sorghum joint venture with Remington, a strong start in South America reflecting stronger corn acres, as well as lower seed returns in the U.S. in both corn and soybeans. The positive earnings results in the fourth quarter, along with strong prepays for Intacta in Brazil translated to better-than-expected free cash flows.
Moving to the full year results. On an as-reported basis, we delivered earnings per share of $2.99, reflecting costs associated with our restructuring actions, Argentine-related tax matters, environmental and litigation matters and income from discontinued ops. On an ongoing basis, this translated to EPS of $4.48, slightly above our most recent guidance and stronger than expected free cash flows of $1.7 billion, which was $100 million above the high end of our guidance range.
Continued focus on innovation and cost discipline set up a strong base for '17 where we are expecting a return to gross profit growth in our Seeds and Genomics segment, driven by our soybean blockbusters and improved cost of goods sold.
On an as-reported basis and as shown in our reconciliations, we expect our EPS to be in the range of $3.83 to $4.35 with proposed Bayer transaction-related costs, anticipated restructuring charges and continued Argentine-related tax matters expense as the primary drivers of the difference from our ongoing estimates.
Our fiscal year '17 ongoing earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $4.50 to $4.90, as shown on Slide 16. This translates into -- up to 9% growth in our ongoing earnings per share year-over-year and strong free cash flows. Within these estimates, we have assumed that currencies are relatively stable year-over-year.
Our Seeds and Genomics segment gross profit is expected to increase mid-single digits as a percent year-over-year with soybean gross profit alone expected to grow by more than 20%. This is driven primarily by the expected increases in Intacta and Xtend soybean penetration and related trade fees, plus a significant expected reduction in the cost of goods sold.
In corn, growth is expected to come from global genetic share gains from the annual germplasm refresh and germplasm price-mix lift in local currency. However, we are prepared to respond as necessary to any emerging competitive dynamics in fiscal year '17.
From a strategic licensing perspective, we are expecting the benefit to decline in this segment, with an expectation of approximately $60 million in gross profit towards the end of the fiscal year.
Shifting gears, our Ag Productivity gross profit is expected to be in the range of $900 million to $1 billion reflecting year-over-year price declines in our glyphosate-based herbicides primarily affecting the first half comparison. In addition, we expect a contribution of approximately $140 million in strategic deal opportunities in this segment's gross profit in the latter half of the year pending the final deal structures. We also expect to see the early contributions from sales of the dicamba-based herbicides, that Brett referenced, and some expenses associated with the construction of the dicamba facility in this segment as well.
Our restructuring and cost savings initiatives are on track, as shown on Slide 17, with the opportunity to deliver approximately $380 million in annual savings at the close of '17 in operating expenses and cost of goods as compared to fiscal year '15. However, overall operating expenses in '17 are expected to increase slightly with inflation and the costs associated with the return to growth of the business more than offsetting the savings from restructuring and cost savings initiatives.
Finally, the tax rate for '17 is expected to be in the range of 25% to 28%. 
Moving to the balance sheet and cash flows. We expect to effectively convert our anticipated earnings into cash with free cash flow expected to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. This consists of operating cash flows in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.8 billion, while cash used for investing activities is expected to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion assuming the successful sell of our precision ag equipment business and our first year of meaningful investment in the dicamba production facility.
In closing, these plans, with our focus on return on innovation and financial discipline, build a solid foundation for growth, as shown on Slide 18, and underpin our integrated solution strategy and vision for agriculture.
With that, I will now pass it to Laura for the Q&A."

The unique thing about this transaction is there's very little overlap, so you're bringing together a seed business and a crop protection business, and I think we can bring these 2 businesses together with much better than, say, for the grower, by using digital agriculture. So I can't speculate on regulators or opine on how regulators are going to view this. But I think it's a really unique combination and the focus on this will be driving the innovation curve. So producing better products faster. And as we embark on that conversation with regulators, we will be stressing the innovation curve and that was certainly emphasized in the hearings with Senator Grassley hosted a few weeks ago when Robb had the chance to talk about innovation. I guess the last thing I'll talk about, when we IPO-ed this business 15 plus years ago, we were spending about $300 million in innovation. This year, it will be around northwards or around $1.5 billion, and I think the combination going forward allows us to more efficiently drive R&D and get to those much-needed solutions. So that will be the conversation when we get in front of the regulators spot. The irony, Don, is, in a tough time in agriculture, there's never been a greater need for innovation and that -- those seem to be at odds, but that's the reality of the marketplace we're in."

So first of all, the idea that we're pricing most of our portfolio relatively flat to down a little bit is very consistent with our overall pricing strategy that we typically use as we put new products in the marketplace. And just like in other years, our new better-performing products that went out this year are priced at a premium. And that premium is based on the value that they bring to the farmer better than the products that are already there. Commodity price, obviously, is part of that equation, and we do that calculation. So that premium is a little bit less than it would be in years where you have higher commodity prices but they're still bringing the significant value. And I think what that does is it holds in place our portfolio being priced above others in the marketplace which we fully expect. So we don't anticipate to match up with everybody else's price card, we expect to be at a premium. I would suggest that some of the shenanigans, if you want to call them that, that happen late in the year are ineffective for everybody. It's -- farmers are making their decisions now as they're running their combines, they're looking at harvest, they're working with their seed reps, making a decision on what they're going to plant. And the biggest driver on that decision as it always is, is going to be performance. How are the products performing in the field, and we'll continue to have that conversation with our farmers. But we'll be on-the-ready if something's developed in the market to compete."

That's part of how you drive yield, is increasing your plants in the field. You just have to have genetics that work in that environment. That's starting to happen in South America, not to the extent that it has in North America. My anticipation is, is tools like Climate are going to help dramatically in South America to help the farmer better understand the value of increasing seeding populations because it's counterintuitive. Sometimes when they're stressed on commodity price and profitability, they look at seed and they want to back off, but that's the worst thing that they can do. Now I will tell you, some of the data we'll show you in soybeans that there may be opportunities. In some varieties, they are being overplanted. So again, I think that's the beauty of the analytical tools that we're developing in Climate. It isn't always to sell the farmer more, it's to optimize the decisions that they're making to increase the profitability on the farm, and I think that sometimes is misunderstood. It's all about helping to make a better decision."

And actually just stepping back into 2016 -- and Brett partly covered that, but when you look at 2016, if you just look at corn and soybeans, if you exclude the impact of currency, extremely challenging environments, I mean, we've been able to grow gross profit in both segments in corn and soybeans, if you exclude the currency. So there is some really nice momentum that's been building. And I think our core business has shown some very nice resilience there. If you assume entering into 2017 more stable currencies, we are confident this is a business that's going to be growing in 2017 and 2 of the elements you mentioned related to the tailwinds are effectively going to help us continue to grow but it's really the dynamics of our 2 blockbusters in soybeans, Xtend and Intacta, now that the bases have been set. And in corn, this is -- as Brett was mentioning, this ability to continue to have some level of germplasm mix lift and some level of share gains. Now regarding the tailwinds, we see a fairly significant tailwind in terms of cost of goods when it comes to Xtend, as you mentioned. So we quoted about 150 million of headwinds this year, and we said about 2/3 of those we will be able to recover next year and this is still absolutely valid. And in terms of corn, we will see the tailwind associated with more production and that's -- as we mentioned. However in corn, we are also seeing some higher cost in Brazil related to commodity price, currency and a couple of other elements. And we are also upgrading our seed treatments across the board on our corn cost of goods. So we're not going to see as much tailwind as we were expecting definitely in the corn business, but in soybeans, the Xtend-related costs are definitely going to show up."

I think you used the operative word, the draft language for the seed law that included the 3 years. We continue to work with the coalition down there. And that's a coalition made up of seed companies, trade and technology providers both from Argentina and outside of Argentina, grain handlers and interested farm groups to work with the government on the new seed law. So we pushed back substantially on that. I mean, they're looking for investment in agriculture and that just discourages investment in agriculture. So we've given that feedback, and we think that's been well understood. But we'll continue to work with them on that draft language. In the interim, there is a resolution in place that we can work with, that we did this year. We will continue to work with the government and the coalition to execute that resolution going into next year while we're in conjunction working on the new seed law. And we will continue to look for better and better integrity in the system. As it speaks specifically to Xtend, we will continue to hold back on our Xtend technology until we see a system that has a higher level of integrity than what we currently see today. And that can either be a new seed law that's negotiated to a better place or it can be improvements in the system that we already have operating that are satisfactory to the coalition. So we'll keep working on them, but we're going to hold back Xtend until we're confident it's in a better place."

So a couple of things, one, I think first you mentioned Intacta, and we're still finishing out the agreement we had with farmers from a number of years ago when we made the transition. So we were priced the same as we were last year. And the feedback from farmers is Intacta continues to deliver phenomenal value in the market. Anticipation is strong for increased yields -- or sales, as reflected in the significant prepay that we enjoyed this year based on Intacta. In regards to corn, we took significant double-digit price increases across the corn portfolio. And I look at it as trying to get back some of that loss from currency that we've experienced in the last year or 2 and so far so good. I mean, it's working. The farmers understand, and we just have to be respectful of their situation and work with them and communicate and so far so good.

But our expectation would be by the end of October. So the merger agreement's already out there.

So we feel very good about also those 15 million acres. And then the third element of the growth is what we discussed earlier which is basically the absence of some of the costs we saw, the launch costs we saw in 2016, and we are talking about $100 million there.

Also joining me from the IR team are Priyal Patel, Ben Kampelman and Christa Chancellor. Our fourth quarter call marks the close of the fiscal year and, importantly, provides our initial outlook into the operational plans and financial guidance for fiscal year '17.
This call is being webcast and you can access the webcast, supporting slides and the replay at monsanto.com.
We've provided you with EPS and other measures on both a GAAP and ongoing business basis. Where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in the slides and in the press release, both of which are on the website.
This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements.
A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in our most recent 10-Q and in today's press release. The forward-looking statements are current only as of the date of this call and the company disclaims any obligation to update them or the factors that may affect actual results.
First, let me review our year-end results as shown on Slides 6 and 7. We delivered as-reported full year earnings per share of $2.99, reflecting $0.56 of expense for Argentine-related tax matters, $0.59 for restructuring charges, $0.38 of expense for environmental and litigation matters and $0.04 of income from discontinued operations. On an ongoing basis, earnings per share were $4.48 for fiscal year '16, slightly above our most recent guidance for the year.
Finally, our free cash flow for the fiscal year was $1.7 billion and exceeded the high end of our guidance range due to a strong start for the South American season. With that brief overview, let me hand it to Hugh to provide the strategic outlook."

I'd like to begin this morning with our agreement to combine with Bayer in this new era for agriculture. Our Board of Directors underwent a comprehensive evaluation process and assessed a broad range of strategic options and opportunities. We unanimously determined that a combination with Bayer represents the most compelling value for our shareowners with the most certainty through the all-cash consideration.
So with this agreement as the backdrop, our 2 priorities going forward are as follows: first, delivering on the 2017 operational plan and key business milestones; and second, executing on the necessary steps to close the deal, which is targeted for the end of calendar year 2017. To be clear, our long-term growth plan and our pipeline remain intact and consistent with what we shared at our Whistle Stop Investor Event in mid-August. However, we recognize that what matters most to our owners now is delivering 2017 and closing the deal. So that will be our focus for the year ahead and in these updates to you.
This deal was struck because the overarching needs to deliver innovation to growers continues as demand continues to climb. I know that, that may seem incongruent, especially when corn is below $4 a bushel and soybeans are below $10. However, the most recent WASDE report demonstrates that the demand trend remains both intact and robust. In fact, as seen on Slide 8, the trend line is more than 1 billion bushels of growth a year for corn and greater than 500 million bushels of growth a year for soybeans, which is consistent with the historical growth trends.
Meeting that demand over the next decade would require a twofold increase in the rate of yield growth for corn and a fourfold increase for soybeans. Innovation, quite simply, is the best way to increase productivity to meet this projected demand. And our unique platform advantages provide this innovation, as shown on Slide 9. It all starts with our industry-leading seeds and traits technologies, which reach approximately 400 million acres today as a result of strong grower demand and our historical broad-licensing approach.
This footprint serves as the foundation for future upgrades and new technologies, which includes the global annual corn germplasm upgrade, Intacta Roundup Ready 2 Pro, the Roundup Ready Xtend crop system, seed treatments through our BioAg Alliance with Novozymes, and finally our unique Climate FieldView platform. This platform has become the digital ag standard for growers, large and small, with its reach now on 95 million acres. To reinforce our innovation platform leadership, we recently expanded our capabilities in genome editing. In addition to those with TargetGene and Nomad, we now have agreements in place with Dow AgroSciences and the Broad Institute to further unlock technological capabilities in this rapidly expanding area of science. Further, these unique innovation platforms are highly complementary to Bayer's crop protection business. As you know, at Monsanto, we've discussed the value of an enhanced agricultural portfolio for a long time. We're entering a new era in agriculture, one in which growers are demanding new solutions and technologies to be more profitable and more sustainable.
By pairing Bayer's exceptional crop protection portfolio with our seeds and traits and Climate FieldView platform, we expect to accelerate the rate and the delivery of advancements that will make a real difference on the farm.
To get there from here, we need to close the deal, and we're confident in our path to do so. This confidence stems from the following points: First, these are 2 different but complementary businesses that we're proposing to combine with limited overlap in products and in geographies; second, we've a long history of making our technologies widely accessible through licensing and open infrastructure, and Bayer has indicated that they are committed to continuing that practice; and third, Bayer's backed up this confidence with a $2 billion reverse break-up fee. 
Our early outreach to various stakeholders in the recent Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, led by Senator Grassley, bolsters this confidence, as there's an indication of a broader understanding of the factors and the regulatory process.
Moving to Slide 10. We've provided our anticipated time line for the transaction, and we look forward to updating you on the status as we move forward. Until then, we're committed to operate as an independent company, and we're focused fully on the year ahead.
With strong demand for new soybean technologies and improved cost of goods, we expect to return to growth in our ongoing earnings per share in fiscal year 2017, anticipating up to 9% growth year-over-year.
So with those brief headlines, let me pass it to Brett to discuss the operational plans that support our outlook. Brett?"

Before I outline our operational plans for fiscal year 2017, it's important to put 2016 in context. No doubt it was a challenging year.

Before I outline our operational plans for fiscal year 2017, it's important to put 2016 in context. No doubt it was a challenging year. But despite those challenges, we stayed the course on several key deliverables including: outstanding penetration of our Intacta Roundup Ready 2 Pro technology; the launch of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans; our continued global corn germplasm upgrade, which resulted in record corn seed volumes in the U.S.; and our disciplined spend management.
Executing these deliverables provides the base for growth, positioning us well for long-term earnings power. And I'll spend my time today outlining the growth drivers for our fiscal year '17 operational plan.
Let's begin with corn on Slide 11. At a high level, we expect corn gross profit growth from global price-mix gains, share gains and continued momentum in South America. When we take a closer look, we see greater than 25% acre growth in Argentina, strong price increases planned across South America and an expected strong season in South Africa. In the U.S., we have plans in place to grow genetic share yet again, and we've priced the majority of our existing hybrids flat to down slightly and our new hybrids at a premium. This maintains our premium pricing, which reflects our higher-performing portfolio. And all of this together -- add all of this together, and we expect: first, our global corn germplasm price-mix lift in local currency will be roughly flat to up low single digits in terms of percentages; and second, we plan to grow our global corn germplasm footprint in an environment where global corn acres are expected to be roughly flat.
In soybeans in 2017, we expect to reach several significant milestones, as shown on Slide 12, and deliver improved margins as well as greater than 20% growth in global soybean gross profit compared to 2016. For Intacta Roundup Ready 2 Pro, we plan to reach an expected 45 million to 55 million acres in South America, as shown on Slide 13. We expect the vast majority of this footprint will be in Brazil. And with continued progress toward maintaining reliable value capture in Argentina, we are optimistic about that country's contribution to that overall total.
Let's move from a product with an opportunity on 100 million acres to the Roundup Ready Xtend crop system opportunity that more than doubles that figure, as shown on Slide 14. We now expect supply for more than 15 million U.S. acres of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans. With key import approvals now in hand and the expected approval for the in-crop use of dicamba on the horizon from the EPA, we expect Xtend-related COGS to decline significantly year-over-year. In addition, we have priced Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybean varieties at a $5 to $10 premium for the improved genetics and weed control flexibility, and demand for the technology is high.
Also, we recently shared that Syngenta is a new licensee of the Roundup Ready 2 Xtend trait. With this addition, the number of seed partners offering this new option has a footprint on more than 90% of the acres in the U.S.
Moving to our complementary crops. The Roundup Ready Xtend crop system story continues. We expect the Bollgard II XtendFlex Cotton area will exceed 3 million acres in 2017, and we expect those traded acres to generate a premium for the weed control benefit they provide.
We also see 2017 as the third consecutive year of share growth. Between our branded and licensed cotton business in the U.S., we have grown by more than 8 share points in the last year, and I expect share growth again for this year.
Moving to Ag Productivity. We plan to maintain our emphasis on cost discipline and focus on the construction of our new dicamba facility while launching some of our new formulations of dicamba. We also plan to remain consistent with our strategy to price just above generics with our high-volume glyphosate-based herbicide portfolio and this is expected to create another year of pricing headwinds. Longer-term, our plans are to add new dicamba formulations as well as new molecules like the new PPO weed control technology we are developing with Sumitomo.
And finally, the platform that serves as the technology integrator, Climate FieldView, as shown on Slide 15, continues to see major advancements as the business and platform continues to evolve. We just released 4 new product enhancements for 2017 that will give growers better insight into their farms to help manage field variability and analyze seed performance in ways they've never had before. We expect these upgrades to help drive paid acres, and our goal for the year ahead is to hit 25 million paid acres.
We have also made progress with partnerships and collaborations in the industry to continue connecting fields and decision points faced by our customers. We have 6 total retail partners and our FieldView Drive now works on most tractors and more than half of the combines in the U.S. In fiscal year '16, we exceeded our objective with greater than 14 million paid acres. In fiscal year '17, we're off to a strong start with FieldView Drive sales, which ramped up since Farm Progress and provided an additional 5 million paid acres, accelerating us toward our objective of 25 million paid acres.
In addition to equipment and retail linkages, we are also attracting new platform partners such as Veris Technologies, which manufactures and markets the world's first high-resolution soil-sensing technology. Climate can now begin to analyze this data in conjunction with other information to help growers and their trusted advisers make more informed decisions on how to optimize productivity on their farm, and we expect to add several more partners to the platform in the coming year.
With that, I'll turn it over to Pierre for the financial translation of these operational plans. Pierre?"

In a very challenging environment, financial discipline and balanced capital allocation were key to delivering 2016, and I am proud of what we accomplished.First, we successfully delivered on our restructurin",1012,"Thanks, Brett, and good morning to everyone. In a very challenging environment, financial discipline and balanced capital allocation were key to delivering 2016, and I am proud of what we accomplished.
First, we successfully delivered on our restructuring and cost-saving plan targets of $165 million. Second, we maintained our premium pricing approach and inked several new strategic licensing agreements. Those 2 examples demonstrate our ability to consistently deliver return on innovation. And third, we concluded our capital allocation commitments, returning more than $30 billion in cash to our owners over the past 3 years through the combination of share repurchases and dividends.
In the fourth quarter, we closed out the year with an as-reported loss of $0.44 per share and delivered ongoing earnings per share of $0.07. The primary difference between the as-reported loss and the ongoing earnings per share was related to approximately $280 million in litigation settlement costs associated with a group of legacy PCB personal injury claims. In September, after diligent efforts, we were pleased to reach an agreement to potentially settle all the legacy PCB personal injury claims, including those on appeal. The settlement and final payment amount will be contingent upon the level of claimant participation, which we anticipate will be met at a very high level.
In addition to the settlement expense, we incurred some additional restructuring costs and trued up our overall restructuring plan cost estimates, which we now expect to be lower and in the range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion for the entire plan.
The ongoing results of $0.07 for the quarter were better than last year, driven by the previously discussed $157 million gain from the formation of the sorghum joint venture with Remington; a strong start in South America, reflecting stronger corn acres; as well as lower seed returns in the U.S. in both corn and soybeans. The positive earnings results in the fourth quarter, along with strong prepays for Intacta in Brazil, translated to better-than-expected free cash flows.
Moving to the full year results. On an as-reported basis, we delivered earnings per share of $2.99, reflecting costs associated with our restructuring actions, Argentine-related tax matters, environmental and litigation matters and income from discontinued ops. On an ongoing basis, this translated to EPS of $4.48, slightly above our most recent guidance, and stronger than expected free cash flows of $1.7 billion, which was $100 million above the high end of our guidance range.
Continued focus on innovation and cost discipline set up a strong base for '17 where we are expecting a return to gross profit growth in our Seeds and Genomics segment, driven by our soybean blockbusters and improved cost of goods sold.
On an as-reported basis and as shown in our reconciliations, we expect our EPS to be in the range of $3.83 to $4.35, with proposed Bayer transaction-related costs, anticipated restructuring charges and continued Argentine-related tax matters expense as the primary drivers of the difference from our ongoing estimates.
Our fiscal year '17 ongoing earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $4.50 to $4.90, as shown on Slide 16. This translates into -- up to 9% growth in our ongoing earnings per share year-over-year and strong free cash flows. Within these estimates, we have assumed that currencies are relatively stable year-over-year.
Our Seeds and Genomics segment gross profit is expected to increase mid-single digits as a percent year-over-year, with soybean gross profit alone expected to grow by more than 20%. This is driven primarily by the expected increases in Intacta and Xtend soybean penetration and related trade fees, plus a significant expected reduction in the cost of goods sold.
In corn, growth is expected to come from global genetic share gains from the annual germplasm refresh and germplasm price-mix lift in local currency. However, we are prepared to respond as necessary to any emerging competitive dynamics in fiscal year '17.
From a strategic licensing perspective, we are expecting the benefit to decline in this segment, with an expectation of approximately $60 million in gross profit towards the end of the fiscal year.
Shifting gears, our Ag Productivity gross profit is expected to be in the range of $900 million to $1 billion, reflecting year-over-year price declines in our glyphosate-based herbicides, primarily affecting the first half comparison. In addition, we expect a contribution of approximately $140 million in strategic deal opportunities in this segment's gross profit in the latter half of the year pending the final deal structures. We also expect to see the early contributions from sales of the dicamba-based herbicides that Brett referenced, and some expenses associated with the construction of the dicamba facility in this segment as well.
Our restructuring and cost savings initiatives are on track, as shown on Slide 17, with the opportunity to deliver approximately $380 million in annual savings at the close of '17 in operating expenses and cost of goods as compared to fiscal year '15. However, overall operating expenses in '17 are expected to increase slightly, with inflation and the costs associated with the return to growth of the business more than offsetting the savings from restructuring and cost savings initiatives.
Finally, the tax rate for '17 is expected to be in the range of 25% to 28%. 
Moving to the balance sheet and cash flows. We expect to effectively convert our anticipated earnings into cash, with free cash flow expected to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. This consists of operating cash flows in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.8 billion, while cash used for investing activities is expected to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion assuming the successful sale of our precision ag equipment business and our first year of meaningful investment in the dicamba production facility.
In closing, these plans, with our focus on return on innovation and financial discipline, build a solid foundation for growth, as shown on Slide 18, and underpin our integrated solution strategy and vision for agriculture.
With that, I will now pass it to Laura for the Q&A."

I'll go back to my opening remarks. The unique thing about this transaction is there's very little overlap, so you're bringing together a seed business and a crop protection business, and I think we can bring these 2 businesses together with much better insight for the grower by using digital agriculture. So I can't speculate on regulators or opine on how regulators are going to view this. But I think it's a really unique combination and the focus on this will be driving the innovation curve. So producing better products faster. And as we embark on that conversation with regulators, we will be stressing the innovation curve. And that was certainly emphasized in the hearings with -- that Senator Grassley hosted a few weeks ago when Robb had the chance to talk about innovation. I guess the last thing I'll talk about, when we IPO-ed this business 15 plus years ago, we were spending about $300 million in innovation. This year, it will be northwards -- or around $1.5 billion, and I think the combination going forward allows us to more efficiently drive R&D and get to those much-needed solutions. So that will be the conversation when we get in front of the regulators. But the irony, Don, is, in a tough time in agriculture, there's never been a greater need for innovation and that -- those seem to be at odds, but that's the reality of the marketplace we're in."

So first of all, the idea that we're pricing most of our portfolio relatively flat to down a little bit is very consistent with our overall pricing strategy that we typically use as we put new products in the marketplace. And just like in other years, our new better-performing products that went out this year are priced at a premium. And that premium is based on the value that they bring to the farmer better than the products that are already there. Commodity price, obviously, is part of that equation, and we do that calculation. So that premium is a little bit less than it would be in years where you have higher commodity prices, but they're still bringing the significant value. And I think what that does is it holds in place our portfolio being priced above others in the marketplace, which we fully expect. So we don't anticipate to match up with everybody else's price card, we expect to be at a premium. I would suggest that some of the shenanigans, if you want to call them that, that happen late in the year are ineffective for everybody. It's -- farmers are making their decisions now as they're running their combines, they're looking at harvest, they're working with their seed reps, making a decision on what they're going to plant. And the biggest driver on that decision, as it always is, is going to be performance, how are the products performing in the field, and we'll continue to have that conversation with our farmers. But we'll be on the ready if something's developed in the market to compete."

That's part of how you drive yield, is increasing your plants in the field. You just have to have genetics that work in that environment. That's starting to happen in South America, not to the extent that it has in North America. My anticipation is, is tools like Climate are going to help dramatically in South America to help the farmer better understand the value of increasing seeding populations because it's counterintuitive. Sometimes when they're stressed on commodity price and profitability, they look at seed and they want to back off, but that's the worst thing that they can do. Now I will tell you, some of the data we'll show you in soybeans that there may be opportunities. In some varieties, they are being overplanted. So again, I think that's the beauty of the analytical tools that we're developing in Climate. It isn't always to sell the farmer more, it's to optimize the decisions that they're making to increase the profitability on the farm, and I think that sometimes is misunderstood. It's all about helping to make a better decision."

And actually, just stepping back into 2016 -- and Brett partly covered that, but when you look at 2016, if you just look at corn and soybeans, if you exclude the impact of currency, extremely challenging environments. I mean, we've been able to grow gross profit in both segments, in corn and soybeans, if you exclude the currency. So there is some really nice momentum that's been building. And I think our corn business has shown some very nice resilience there. If you assume entering into 2017 more stable currencies, we are confident this is a business that's going to be growing in 2017. And 2 of the elements you mentioned related to the tailwinds are effectively going to help us continue to grow, but it's really the dynamics of our 2 blockbusters in soybeans, Xtend and Intacta, now that the bases have been set. And in corn, this is -- as Brett was mentioning, this ability to continue to have some level of germplasm mix lift and some level of share gains. Now regarding the tailwinds, we see a fairly significant tailwind in terms of cost of goods when it comes to Xtend, as you mentioned. So we quoted about $150 million of headwinds this year, and we said about 2/3 of those we will be able to recover next year and this is still absolutely valid. And in terms of corn, we will see the tailwind associated with more production and that's -- as we mentioned. However, in corn, we are also seeing some higher cost in Brazil related to commodity price, currency and a couple of other elements. And we are also upgrading our seed treatments across the board on our corn cost of goods. So we're not going to see as much tailwind as we were expecting definitely in the corn business, but in soybeans, the Xtend-related costs are definitely going to show up."

I think you used the operative word, the draft language for the seed law that included the 3 years. We continue to work with the coalition down there. And that's a coalition made up of seed companies, trade and technology providers both from Argentina and outside of Argentina, grain handlers and interested farm groups to work with the government on the new seed law. So we pushed back substantially on that. I mean, they're looking for investment in agriculture and that just discourages investment in agriculture. So we've given that feedback, and we think that's been well understood. But we'll continue to work with them on that draft language. In the interim, there is a resolution in place that we can work with, that we did this year. We will continue to work with the government and the coalition to execute that resolution going into next year while we're in conjunction working on the new seed law. And we will continue to look for better and better integrity in the system. As it speaks specifically to Xtend, we will continue to hold back on our Xtend technology until we see a system that has a higher level of integrity than what we currently see today. And that can either be a new seed law that's negotiated to a better place or it can be improvements in the system that we already have operating that are satisfactory to the coalition. So we'll keep working on them, but we're going to hold back Xtend until we're confident it's in a better place."

One, I think first you mentioned Intacta, and we're still finishing out the agreement we had with farmers from a number of years ago when we made the transition. So we were priced the same as we were last year. And the feedback from farmers is Intacta continues to deliver phenomenal value in the market. Anticipation is strong for increased yields -- or sales, as reflected in the significant prepay that we enjoyed this year based on Intacta. In regards to corn, we took significant double-digit price increases across the corn portfolio. And I look at it as trying to get back some of that loss from currency that we've experienced in the last year or 2, and so far, so good. I mean, it's working. The farmers understand, and we just have to be respectful of their situation and work with them and communicate, and so far, so good.

Our fourth quarter call marks the close of the fiscal year and, importantly, provides our initial outlook into the operational plans and financial guidance for fiscal year '17.
This call is being webcast and you can access the webcast, supporting slides and the replay at monsanto.com.
We've provided you with EPS and other measures on both a GAAP and ongoing business basis. Where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in the slides and in the press release, both of which are on the website.
This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements.
A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in our most recent 10-Q and in today's press release. The forward-looking statements are current only as of the date of this call and the company disclaims any obligation to update them or the factors that may affect actual results.
First, let me review our year-end results as shown on Slides 6 and 7. We delivered as-reported full year earnings per share of $2.99, reflecting $0.56 of expense for Argentine-related tax matters, $0.59 for restructuring charges, $0.38 of expense for environmental and litigation matters and $0.04 of income from discontinued operations. On an ongoing basis, earnings per share were $4.48 for fiscal year '16, slightly above our most recent guidance for the year.
Finally, our free cash flow for the fiscal year was $1.7 billion and exceeded the high end of our guidance range due to a strong start for the South American season. With that brief overview, let me hand it to Hugh to provide the strategic outlook."

I'd like to begin this morning with our agreement to combine with Bayer in this new era for agriculture. Our Board of Directors underwent a comprehensive evaluation process and assessed a broad range of strategic options and opportunities. We unanimously determined that a combination with Bayer represents the most compelling value for our shareowners with the most certainty through the all-cash consideration.
So with this agreement as the backdrop, our 2 priorities going forward are as follows: first, delivering on the 2017 operational plan and key business milestones; and second, executing on the necessary steps to close the deal, which is targeted for the end of calendar year 2017. To be clear, our long-term growth plan and our pipeline remain intact and consistent with what we shared at our Whistle Stop Investor Event in mid-August. However, we recognize that what matters most to our owners now is delivering 2017 and closing the deal. So that will be our focus for the year ahead and in these updates to you.
This deal was struck because the overarching needs to deliver innovation to growers continues as demand continues to climb. I know that, that may seem incongruent, especially when corn is below $4 a bushel and soybeans are below $10. However, the most recent WASDE report demonstrates that the demand trend remains both intact and robust. In fact, as seen on Slide 8, the trend line is more than 1 billion bushels of growth a year for corn and greater than 500 million bushels of growth a year for soybeans, which is consistent with the historical growth trends.
Meeting that demand over the next decade would require a twofold increase in the rate of yield growth for corn and a fourfold increase for soybeans. Innovation, quite simply, is the best way to increase productivity to meet this projected demand. And our unique platform advantages provide this innovation, as shown on Slide 9. It all starts with our industry-leading seeds and traits technologies, which reach approximately 400 million acres today as a result of strong grower demand and our historical broad-licensing approach.
This footprint serves as the foundation for future upgrades and new technologies, which includes the global annual corn germplasm upgrade, Intacta Roundup Ready 2 Pro, the Roundup Ready Xtend crop system, seed treatments through our BioAg Alliance with Novozymes, and finally our unique Climate FieldView platform. This platform has become the digital ag standard for growers, large and small, with its reach now on 95 million acres. To reinforce our innovation platform leadership, we recently expanded our capabilities in genome editing. In addition to those with TargetGene and Nomad, we now have agreements in place with Dow AgroSciences and the Broad Institute to further unlock technological capabilities in this rapidly expanding area of science. Further, these unique innovation platforms are highly complementary to Bayer's crop protection business. As you know, at Monsanto, we've discussed the value of an enhanced agricultural portfolio for a long time. We're entering a new era in agriculture, one in which growers are demanding new solutions and technologies to be more profitable and more sustainable.
By pairing Bayer's exceptional crop protection portfolio with our seeds and traits and Climate FieldView platform, we expect to accelerate the rate and the delivery of advancements that will make a real difference on the farm.
To get there from here, we need to close the deal, and we're confident in our path to do so. This confidence stems from the following points: First, these are 2 different but complementary businesses that we're proposing to combine with limited overlap in products and in geographies; second, we've a long history of making our technologies widely accessible through licensing and open infrastructure, and Bayer has indicated that they are committed to continuing that practice; and third, Bayer's backed up this confidence with a $2 billion reverse break-up fee. 
Our early outreach to various stakeholders in the recent Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, led by Senator Grassley, bolsters this confidence, as there's an indication of a broader understanding of the factors and the regulatory process.
Moving to Slide 10. We've provided our anticipated time line for the transaction, and we look forward to updating you on the status as we move forward. Until then, we're committed to operate as an independent company, and we're focused fully on the year ahead.
With strong demand for new soybean technologies and improved cost of goods, we expect to return to growth in our ongoing earnings per share in fiscal year 2017, anticipating up to 9% growth year-over-year.
So with those brief headlines, let me pass it to Brett to discuss the operational plans that support our outlook. Brett?"

Before I outline our operational plans for fiscal year 2017, it's important to put 2016 in context. No doubt it was a challenging year. But despite those challenges, we stayed the course on several key deliverable",983,"Thanks, Hugh, and good morning, everyone. Before I outline our operational plans for fiscal year 2017, it's important to put 2016 in context. No doubt it was a challenging year. But despite those challenges, we stayed the course on several key deliverables including: outstanding penetration of our Intacta Roundup Ready 2 Pro technology; the launch of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans; our continued global corn germplasm upgrade, which resulted in record corn seed volumes in the U.S.; and our disciplined spend management.
Executing these deliverables provides the base for growth, positioning us well for long-term earnings power. And I'll spend my time today outlining the growth drivers for our fiscal year '17 operational plan.
Let's begin with corn on Slide 11. At a high level, we expect corn gross profit growth from global price-mix gains, share gains and continued momentum in South America. When we take a closer look, we see greater than 25% acre growth in Argentina, strong price increases planned across South America and an expected strong season in South Africa. In the U.S., we have plans in place to grow genetic share yet again, and we've priced the majority of our existing hybrids flat to down slightly and our new hybrids at a premium. This maintains our premium pricing, which reflects our higher-performing portfolio. And all of this together -- add all of this together, and we expect: first, our global corn germplasm price-mix lift in local currency will be roughly flat to up low single digits in terms of percentages; and second, we plan to grow our global corn germplasm footprint in an environment where global corn acres are expected to be roughly flat.
In soybeans in 2017, we expect to reach several significant milestones, as shown on Slide 12, and deliver improved margins as well as greater than 20% growth in global soybean gross profit compared to 2016. For Intacta Roundup Ready 2 Pro, we plan to reach an expected 45 million to 55 million acres in South America, as shown on Slide 13. We expect the vast majority of this footprint will be in Brazil. And with continued progress toward maintaining reliable value capture in Argentina, we are optimistic about that country's contribution to that overall total.
Let's move from a product with an opportunity on 100 million acres to the Roundup Ready Xtend crop system opportunity that more than doubles that figure, as shown on Slide 14. We now expect supply for more than 15 million U.S. acres of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans. With key import approvals now in hand and the expected approval for the in-crop use of dicamba on the horizon from the EPA, we expect Xtend-related COGS to decline significantly year-over-year. In addition, we have priced Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybean varieties at a $5 to $10 premium for the improved genetics and weed control flexibility, and demand for the technology is high.
Also, we recently shared that Syngenta is a new licensee of the Roundup Ready 2 Xtend trait. With this addition, the number of seed partners offering this new option has a footprint on more than 90% of the acres in the U.S.
Moving to our complementary crops. The Roundup Ready Xtend crop system story continues. We expect the Bollgard II XtendFlex Cotton area will exceed 3 million acres in 2017, and we expect those traded acres to generate a premium for the weed control benefit they provide.
We also see 2017 as the third consecutive year of share growth. Between our branded and licensed cotton business in the U.S., we have grown by more than 8 share points in the last year, and I expect share growth again for this year.
Moving to Ag Productivity. We plan to maintain our emphasis on cost discipline and focus on the construction of our new dicamba facility while launching some of our new formulations of dicamba. We also plan to remain consistent with our strategy to price just above generics with our high-volume glyphosate-based herbicide portfolio and this is expected to create another year of pricing headwinds. Longer-term, our plans are to add new dicamba formulations as well as new molecules like the new PPO weed control technology we are developing with Sumitomo.
And finally, the platform that serves as the technology integrator, Climate FieldView, as shown on Slide 15, continues to see major advancements as the business and platform continues to evolve. We just released 4 new product enhancements for 2017 that will give growers better insight into their farms to help manage field variability and analyze seed performance in ways they've never had before. We expect these upgrades to help drive paid acres, and our goal for the year ahead is to hit 25 million paid acres.
We have also made progress with partnerships and collaborations in the industry to continue connecting fields and decision points faced by our customers. We have 6 total retail partners and our FieldView Drive now works on most tractors and more than half of the combines in the U.S. In fiscal year '16, we exceeded our objective with greater than 14 million paid acres. In fiscal year '17, we're off to a strong start with FieldView Drive sales, which ramped up since Farm Progress and provided an additional 5 million paid acres, accelerating us toward our objective of 25 million paid acres.
In addition to equipment and retail linkages, we are also attracting new platform partners such as Veris Technologies, which manufactures and markets the world's first high-resolution soil-sensing technology. Climate can now begin to analyze this data in conjunction with other information to help growers and their trusted advisers make more informed decisions on how to optimize productivity on their farm, and we expect to add several more partners to the platform in the coming year.
With that, I'll turn it over to Pierre for the financial translation of these operational plans. Pierre?"

In a very challenging environment, financial discipline and balanced capital allocation were key to delivering 2016, and I am proud of what we accomplished.First, we successfully delivered on our restructurin",1012,"Thanks, Brett, and good morning to everyone. In a very challenging environment, financial discipline and balanced capital allocation were key to delivering 2016, and I am proud of what we accomplished.
First, we successfully delivered on our restructuring and cost-saving plan targets of $165 million. Second, we maintained our premium pricing approach and inked several new strategic licensing agreements. Those 2 examples demonstrate our ability to consistently deliver return on innovation. And third, we concluded our capital allocation commitments, returning more than $30 billion in cash to our owners over the past 3 years through the combination of share repurchases and dividends.
In the fourth quarter, we closed out the year with an as-reported loss of $0.44 per share and delivered ongoing earnings per share of $0.07. The primary difference between the as-reported loss and the ongoing earnings per share was related to approximately $280 million in litigation settlement costs associated with a group of legacy PCB personal injury claims. In September, after diligent efforts, we were pleased to reach an agreement to potentially settle all the legacy PCB personal injury claims, including those on appeal. The settlement and final payment amount will be contingent upon the level of claimant participation, which we anticipate will be met at a very high level.
In addition to the settlement expense, we incurred some additional restructuring costs and trued up our overall restructuring plan cost estimates, which we now expect to be lower and in the range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion for the entire plan.
The ongoing results of $0.07 for the quarter were better than last year, driven by the previously discussed $157 million gain from the formation of the sorghum joint venture with Remington; a strong start in South America, reflecting stronger corn acres; as well as lower seed returns in the U.S. in both corn and soybeans. The positive earnings results in the fourth quarter, along with strong prepays for Intacta in Brazil, translated to better-than-expected free cash flows.
Moving to the full year results. On an as-reported basis, we delivered earnings per share of $2.99, reflecting costs associated with our restructuring actions, Argentine-related tax matters, environmental and litigation matters and income from discontinued ops. On an ongoing basis, this translated to EPS of $4.48, slightly above our most recent guidance, and stronger than expected free cash flows of $1.7 billion, which was $100 million above the high end of our guidance range.
Continued focus on innovation and cost discipline set up a strong base for '17 where we are expecting a return to gross profit growth in our Seeds and Genomics segment, driven by our soybean blockbusters and improved cost of goods sold.
On an as-reported basis and as shown in our reconciliations, we expect our EPS to be in the range of $3.83 to $4.35, with proposed Bayer transaction-related costs, anticipated restructuring charges and continued Argentine-related tax matters expense as the primary drivers of the difference from our ongoing estimates.
Our fiscal year '17 ongoing earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $4.50 to $4.90, as shown on Slide 16. This translates into -- up to 9% growth in our ongoing earnings per share year-over-year and strong free cash flows. Within these estimates, we have assumed that currencies are relatively stable year-over-year.
Our Seeds and Genomics segment gross profit is expected to increase mid-single digits as a percent year-over-year, with soybean gross profit alone expected to grow by more than 20%. This is driven primarily by the expected increases in Intacta and Xtend soybean penetration and related trade fees, plus a significant expected reduction in the cost of goods sold.
In corn, growth is expected to come from global genetic share gains from the annual germplasm refresh and germplasm price-mix lift in local currency. However, we are prepared to respond as necessary to any emerging competitive dynamics in fiscal year '17.
From a strategic licensing perspective, we are expecting the benefit to decline in this segment, with an expectation of approximately $60 million in gross profit towards the end of the fiscal year.
Shifting gears, our Ag Productivity gross profit is expected to be in the range of $900 million to $1 billion, reflecting year-over-year price declines in our glyphosate-based herbicides, primarily affecting the first half comparison. In addition, we expect a contribution of approximately $140 million in strategic deal opportunities in this segment's gross profit in the latter half of the year pending the final deal structures. We also expect to see the early contributions from sales of the dicamba-based herbicides that Brett referenced, and some expenses associated with the construction of the dicamba facility in this segment as well.
Our restructuring and cost savings initiatives are on track, as shown on Slide 17, with the opportunity to deliver approximately $380 million in annual savings at the close of '17 in operating expenses and cost of goods as compared to fiscal year '15. However, overall operating expenses in '17 are expected to increase slightly, with inflation and the costs associated with the return to growth of the business more than offsetting the savings from restructuring and cost savings initiatives.
Finally, the tax rate for '17 is expected to be in the range of 25% to 28%. 
Moving to the balance sheet and cash flows. We expect to effectively convert our anticipated earnings into cash, with free cash flow expected to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. This consists of operating cash flows in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.8 billion, while cash used for investing activities is expected to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion assuming the successful sale of our precision ag equipment business and our first year of meaningful investment in the dicamba production facility.
In closing, these plans, with our focus on return on innovation and financial discipline, build a solid foundation for growth, as shown on Slide 18, and underpin our integrated solution strategy and vision for agriculture.
With that, I will now pass it to Laura for the Q&A."

I'll go back to my opening remarks. The unique thing about this transaction is there's very little overlap, so you're bringing together a seed business and a crop protection business, and I think we can bring these 2 businesses together with much better insight for the grower by using digital agriculture. So I can't speculate on regulators or opine on how regulators are going to view this. But I think it's a really unique combination and the focus on this will be driving the innovation curve. So producing better products faster. And as we embark on that conversation with regulators, we will be stressing the innovation curve. And that was certainly emphasized in the hearings with -- that Senator Grassley hosted a few weeks ago when Robb had the chance to talk about innovation. I guess the last thing I'll talk about, when we IPO-ed this business 15 plus years ago, we were spending about $300 million in innovation. This year, it will be northwards -- or around $1.5 billion, and I think the combination going forward allows us to more efficiently drive R&D and get to those much-needed solutions. So that will be the conversation when we get in front of the regulators. But the irony, Don, is, in a tough time in agriculture, there's never been a greater need for innovation and that -- those seem to be at odds, but that's the reality of the marketplace we're in."

So first of all, the idea that we're pricing most of our portfolio relatively flat to down a little bit is very consistent with our overall pricing strategy that we typically use as we put new products in the marketplace. And just like in other years, our new better-performing products that went out this year are priced at a premium. And that premium is based on the value that they bring to the farmer better than the products that are already there. Commodity price, obviously, is part of that equation, and we do that calculation. So that premium is a little bit less than it would be in years where you have higher commodity prices, but they're still bringing the significant value. And I think what that does is it holds in place our portfolio being priced above others in the marketplace, which we fully expect. So we don't anticipate to match up with everybody else's price card, we expect to be at a premium. I would suggest that some of the shenanigans, if you want to call them that, that happen late in the year are ineffective for everybody. It's -- farmers are making their decisions now as they're running their combines, they're looking at harvest, they're working with their seed reps, making a decision on what they're going to plant. And the biggest driver on that decision, as it always is, is going to be performance, how are the products performing in the field, and we'll continue to have that conversation with our farmers. But we'll be on the ready if something's developed in the market to compete."

That's part of how you drive yield, is increasing your plants in the field. You just have to have genetics that work in that environment. That's starting to happen in South America, not to the extent that it has in North America. My anticipation is, is tools like Climate are going to help dramatically in South America to help the farmer better understand the value of increasing seeding populations because it's counterintuitive. Sometimes when they're stressed on commodity price and profitability, they look at seed and they want to back off, but that's the worst thing that they can do. Now I will tell you, some of the data we'll show you in soybeans that there may be opportunities. In some varieties, they are being overplanted. So again, I think that's the beauty of the analytical tools that we're developing in Climate. It isn't always to sell the farmer more, it's to optimize the decisions that they're making to increase the profitability on the farm, and I think that sometimes is misunderstood. It's all about helping to make a better decision."

And actually, just stepping back into 2016 -- and Brett partly covered that, but when you look at 2016, if you just look at corn and soybeans, if you exclude the impact of currency, extremely challenging environments. I mean, we've been able to grow gross profit in both segments, in corn and soybeans, if you exclude the currency. So there is some really nice momentum that's been building. And I think our corn business has shown some very nice resilience there. If you assume entering into 2017 more stable currencies, we are confident this is a business that's going to be growing in 2017. And 2 of the elements you mentioned related to the tailwinds are effectively going to help us continue to grow, but it's really the dynamics of our 2 blockbusters in soybeans, Xtend and Intacta, now that the bases have been set. And in corn, this is -- as Brett was mentioning, this ability to continue to have some level of germplasm mix lift and some level of share gains. Now regarding the tailwinds, we see a fairly significant tailwind in terms of cost of goods when it comes to Xtend, as you mentioned. So we quoted about $150 million of headwinds this year, and we said about 2/3 of those we will be able to recover next year and this is still absolutely valid. And in terms of corn, we will see the tailwind associated with more production and that's -- as we mentioned. However, in corn, we are also seeing some higher cost in Brazil related to commodity price, currency and a couple of other elements. And we are also upgrading our seed treatments across the board on our corn cost of goods. So we're not going to see as much tailwind as we were expecting definitely in the corn business, but in soybeans, the Xtend-related costs are definitely going to show up."

So we pushed back substantially on that. I mean, they're looking for investment in agriculture and that just discourages investment in agriculture. So we've given that feedback, and we think that's been well understood. But we'll continue to work with them on that draft language. In the interim, there is a resolution in place that we can work with, that we did this year. We will continue to work with the government and the coalition to execute that resolution going into next year while we're in conjunction working on the new seed law. And we will continue to look for better and better integrity in the system. As it speaks specifically to Xtend, we will continue to hold back on our Xtend technology until we see a system that has a higher level of integrity than what we currently see today. And that can either be a new seed law that's negotiated to a better place or it can be improvements in the system that we already have operating that are satisfactory to the coalition. So we'll keep working on them, but we're going to hold back Xtend until we're confident it's in a better place."

Anticipation is strong for increased yields -- or sales, as reflected in the significant prepay that we enjoyed this year based on Intacta. In regards to corn, we took significant double-digit price increases across the corn portfolio. And I look at it as trying to get back some of that loss from currency that we've experienced in the last year or 2, and so far, so good. I mean, it's working.

I mean, it's just the balancing between the segments that we tried to represent today in our prepared remarks. And the way we are thinking about those strategic deals is more in terms of important transfers of either IP or, in certain cases, assets, compared to ongoing licensing that we have on our lines and some of our traits. So it's really -- those are more unique in nature and -- compared to what we see in our business, so that's a distinction that we make in terms of the strategic licensing compared to the ongoing licensing that we have commonly."

So as you look innovation, I think, number 1, the need's never been greater. Number 2, I think there's the capacity to accelerate innovation, particularly in the area of digital agriculture and particularly in the area of precision agriculture where we're developing software and where we're using literally harvested data to improve decision quality on farm. So I don't -- there's a piece that I don't think you wait 10 to 20 years. There's a piece that I think you see very quickly, and Brett used some of those examples in his prepared remarks. So I think there'll be evidence of that acceleration as you bring these platforms together. And to Brett's point, I don't think that's increasing costs for the grower. I think it increases efficiency that unlocks that extra bushel. And then it's hard to say on the proxy, but our expectation would be by the end of October. So the merger agreement's already out there. The frequently asked Q&A's are out there already, and then the proxy will contain the next tranche of information around the deal and the history on the lead up to the deal, and I would expect we'll see that around the end of October."

So if you think back that -- between Climate and precision ag, we're in our third season. Brett talked about 95 million acres, so very, very fast growth. But it's the quality of the data you bring in the platform. So the machinery company's now up, all of U.S. distribution now up, and I think when we bring the Bayer crop protection materials up, you just increase the density of the -- and the subsequent quality of decision-making. And we've always said that there will be space in that platform for all of our competitors as well, so I think that this will be a broadly licensed platform. And then the competitive element of this will be who delivers the best insights, and I think Bayer will really help in that."

When you're looking at the 20-plus percent growth we are looking at in terms of the soybeans business, it's really, I mean, 3 different things and all are significant in matter. So the first one is the continuation of Intacta, the growth of Intacta in South America where we are anticipating to be on 45 million to 55 million acres. So this is a fairly large bucket of the growth we are looking into soybeans. The second element is related to our Xtend launch in the U.S. where, based on the launch we had or the limited launch we had in 2015 -- 2016, we feel very confident that we'll be able to reach the 15 million acres and the feedback we get from the field, the demand there is really very strong. So we feel very good about also those 15 million acres. And then the third element of the growth is what we discussed earlier, which is basically the absence of some of the costs we saw, the launch costs we saw in 2016, and we are talking about $100 million there. So these are the 3 key drivers of the growth in soybeans and that's why we are very confident that we're going to see this 20% plus growth in our GP in soybeans."
