Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review our results for calendar year 2015. As you know, we formed WEC Energy Group on June 29 when we closed our acquisition of Integrys. So today's report reflects 2 full quarters as a combined company. I'll update our progress on a number of major initiatives in just a moment, but first, as always, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President of WEC Energy Group and CEO Elect; Pat Keyes, our Chief Financial Officer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Bill Guc, Controller; Scott Lauber, Treasurer; and Beth Strackas, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. 
Turning now to our 2015 performance, I'd like to Marjorie that we are focusing on legacy Wisconsin Energy, so our financial results have been adjusted to remove the impact of the acquisition. And as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported Wisconsin Energy adjusted stand-alone earnings of $2.73 a share for 2015. That compares with adjusted earnings of $2.65 a share for 2014. Looking back over the latest year, it was not only a transformational year for our company, but a year also of significant achievements. WE Energies was named the Most Reliable Utility in the Midwest for the fifth consecutive year, and international studies WE Energies ranked in the top quartile of the Midwest again for customer service and power quality, and in that top quartile nationally for customer service. In addition, Wisconsin Public Service in Green Bay was ranked #2 in the Midwest for overall customer satisfaction among midsized utilities. We also reached a milestone for employee safety at WE Energies, recording the safest year in more than 115 years of operation. We invested nearly $780 million in our legacy core business, with all major projects on time and on budget. And of course, we closed our acquisition of Integrys to form WEC Energy Group, a leading electric and natural gas utilities system in the Midwest, with now 4.4 million customers across the region. From a financial standpoint, we continued to deliver solid earnings growth. Through disciplined cost control and effective planning, we delivered record earnings in 2015 despite a very warm fourth quarter. In fact, Milwaukee experienced the warmest December in its history, surpassing the former record set way back in the day in 1877. 
Taking at look at the state's economy, Wisconsin's unemployment rate end-of-the-year at 4.3%, well below the national average. And the December statistics show that more Wisconites were employed than during any other month in history. The state's labor force participation rate also rose to 68%, which is more than 5 points better than the national rate. In addition, Wisconsin added 4,000 manufacturing jobs from November of '14 to November of 2015 despite some very challenging conditions for manufacturers. In light of these challenges, use of electricity by our large commercial and industrial customers moderated a bit. In 2015, our large customers, excluding the iron ore mines, consumed approximately 4/10 of 1% less electricity than they did in 2014. However, and this is an important point, we did see improvement in several significant sectors of the state's economy, including food processing, printing, paper production and plastics. In addition, we continue to see an uptick in customer growth across our system. WE Energies is serving approximately 6,500 more electric customers and more than 8,500 more customers on the gas side of our business today than we were a year ago. 
I'm also pleased with our post-acquisition work over the past several months as we begun to operationalize the new WEC Energy Group. As I've said before, we see tremendous opportunity in the framework of the new company. WEC Energy Group has the scale, scope, technical depth, geographic reach and financial resources to thrive in our consolidating industry. We're leveraging these strengths to deliver operational and financial benefits to all of our stakeholders, and with our proven leadership team, we're incorporating best practices across the organization to streamline our operations and to reduce costs. WEC Energy Group is now the eighth largest natural gas distribution company in the country, and one of the 15 largest investor-owned utility systems in the United States with real opportunity for growth. Bottom line, we have the same top management team but now with a new platform for growth. Our platform focused on the energy infrastructure needs of 4.4 million customers across the Midwest. And our plan calls for the combined company to grow earnings per share by 6% to 8% in 2016. 
Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the impact of bonus depreciation, a subject I know you're very interested in. As you know, in December, Congress passed a tax law that extends and modifies bonus depreciation for property placed in service from 2015 to 2019. At this point, we estimate that we will receive approximately $1 billion of cash benefits from this extension of bonus depreciation, with most of the benefits coming in 2016 and in 2017. First, let me say though that we do not expect bonus depreciation to have any material impact on earnings this year. And over the longer term, we have significant flexibility to bring forward reliability projects that will clearly benefit customers. The additional cash benefits will allow us to fund a strong backlog of infrastructure investments, but the region needs for reliability and if the Clean Power Plan moves forward on the proposed timetable. Our incremental cash flows could well be needed to support additional investments in renewable energy or new natural gas generation for our fleet. Of course, we also have the option to further deleverage the holding company. So bottom line, for the longer term beyond 2016, we continue to see earnings per share growth of 5% to 7% a year. As a reminder, our current 10-year investment plan is primarily focused on modernizing our delivery networks. We expect that more than half of our capital investments, about $800 million a year roughly, will be dedicated to the gas delivery business, providing safer and more reliable infrastructure and extending our gas distribution lines to customers across the Midwest. We also plan to invest approximately $400 million a year to upgrade and harden our electric delivery networks. Now the primary risks associated with these core distribution projects are naturally more manageable given the smaller scale and scope of the work. But the work is no less important than the megaprojects we've completed over the years. Our focus now on renewing our distribution networks is essential to maintaining our status as one of the nation's most reliable utilities. We also expect the remaining investment, approximately $300 million a year, will be focused on our generating fleet and on what we call corporate infrastructure. To be clear, however, these projections do not include any capital that would be needed for compliance with the Clean Power Plan. 
Turning now to other developments, I'm pleased to report that the conversion of the Valley Power Plant near downtown Milwaukee from coal to natural gas was completed in the fourth quarter on time and on budget. The total investment was approximately $60 million, excluding allowance for funds used during construction. We are also making very good progress on the major construction work at our Twin Falls hydroelectric plant on the border of Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. After more than 100 years of operation, we're building a new powerhouse and adding spillway capacity to meet current federal standards. Overall, the Twin Falls project is on time and on budget, with approximately 82% of the construction now complete. We're targeting commercial operation for the summer of this year and we're forecasting a total investment of $60 million to $65 million, again, excluding allowance for funds used during construction.  Next, you may recall that we're working to add fuel flexibility at our Oak Creek expansion units. These units were initially permitted to burn bituminous coal, but given the current cost differential between bituminous coal and Powder River Basin coal, blending the 2 types of fuel could save customers anywhere between $25 million and $50 million a year depending upon the mix. Work is underway now to expand our coal storage capability at the Oak Creek site, the larger site should be ready by early next year. Also, the first capital investment inside the plant was made on one of the units during the planned outage this past fall. We also plan to upgrade the second unit during the first quarter of this year. Our share of these investments for the new Oak Creek units is targeted at approximately $80 million, again, excluding allowance for funds used during construction. 
We're also moving forward on the accelerated main replacement program at Peoples Gas in Chicago. As you'll recall, this is one of the largest natural gas infrastructure projects in the country. The program calls for the replacement of approximately 2,000 miles of Chicago's aging gas pipelines, and I'm pleased to report that over the past 6 months, we've taken significant steps to improve the management and performance of this project, which is now approximately 18% complete. We engaged a nationally recognize engineering firm to help us conduct an extensive independent review of the work plan and the long-term cost estimates. As part of our fresh start in Chicago, we filed a plan on November 30 that lays out our top priorities for the next 3 years. These components of the 3-year plan include removal and replacement of more than 250 miles of aging cast iron pipes in the neighborhoods most at risk; a projected investment of between $250 million and $280 million a year and regular updates to the Illinois Commerce Commission and other stakeholders to keep them fully informed of our progress. 
In assessing the plan that we filed on November 30, the Illinois Commerce Commission has scheduled a series of 6 workshops to be held by the end of March. Two of the workshops are already complete. While the engineering, field work and cost recovery continue, these workshops are bringing together all of the stakeholders to review the scope, the schedule and the long-term cost of the plan with a focus on safety and reliability. I'm confident that the steps we're taking will provide Chicagonians with the safe, modern natural gas delivery system that they deserve. 
Moving now to our transmission business, our electric transmission business, as you know, WEC is now a 60% owner of American Transmission Company. ATC's capital plan calls for investment of $3.7 billion to $4.5 billion between now and 2024 to bolster the reliability of the grid. As I've said in the past, we welcome the opportunity to increase our commitment to the transmission business. 
Turning now to our dividend policy, on January 21, as you may have read, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.495 [ph] a share, an increase of 8.2% over the previous quarterly dividend. Our annual dividend rate is now $1.98 a share. Going forward, we are targeting a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings, and we expect our dividend growth to be in line with growth in earnings per share. 
On a final note, as I mentioned, on one of our previous calls, we've been seeking a new owner for the Trillium Compressed Natural Gas business. You recall that this business came to us as part of the Integrys transaction. We sold part of the business in late November of last year, and very recently, we reached an agreement to sell substantially all of the remaining Trillium assets. This agreement is subject to Hart-Scott-Rodino review and we're projecting to reach financial flows by the end of the first quarter. In total, we expect at least $130 million of pretax cash proceeds from the combined sales of the Trillium assets. The fair value of Trillium was reflected in our purchase price allocation following the Integrys acquisition, and as you know, the earnings on the Trillium business were not significant to our company. 
So in summary, ladies and gentlemen, these are exciting times filled with opportunity and change for our company. And speaking of change, we recently announced that I'll be retiring as Chief Executive Officer effective May 1. After May 1, I'll continue to serve the company as a nonexecutive Chairman of the Board. And I'm delighted that Allen Leverett will succeed me as Chief Executive. He is also been appointed to our Board of Directors. As most of you know, Allen has been a very key contributor to our success since he joined Wisconsin Energy the same year I did back in 2003, first, as Chief Financial Officer, then as the leader of our Power Generation Group, and most recently as President of the parent firm in our Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan utilities. I've known and worked with Allen for more than 20 years. I have to tell you, he's not quite as fond of financial audits as I am, but the depth of his experience, his management scales and his focus on execution make him the ideal person to lead our company through the time of continuing change in the energy industry. Allen, my congratulations"

As Gale mentioned, in 2015, our adjusted earnings grew to $2.73 a share compared with $2.65 a share for 2014. Our adjusted earnings exclude the Integrys Company's earnings and the impacts of the acquisitions. They are also adjusted for the shares issued in connection with the merger. To facilitate comparisons with last year, my discussion of 2015 results will focus primarily on legacy Wisconsin Energy. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes the results of the Integrys Companies and has a full GAAP to adjusted reconciliation. First, I'll focus on the operating income for Wisconsin Energy and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. Our consolidated operating income for the full year 2015 was $1,137,000,000 as compared with $1,125,000,000 in 2014. That's an increase of $12 million. Starting with the Utility Energy segment, operating income in 2015 totaled $767.7 million, an increase of $3.5 million over 2014. On the positive side, we had a $35 million increase in revenues due to the Wisconsin rate order. We also had $10.4 million of improved fuel recoveries and lower O&M cost in part driven by lower benefits costs and reduced maintenance expense in the fourth quarter, decreased expenses by $10.2 million. On the downside, we estimate that our electric and gas margins decreased by $35.3 million, driven by warmer fourth quarter weather. The fourth quarter of 2015 was the second warmest in the history of WE Energies. In addition, depreciation expense rose by $16.8 million with additional capital expenditures. Combining these and other factors, results in the $3.5 million increase in adjusted utility operating income in 2015 as compared with 2014. Our non-utility energy operating income was $373.4 million, which is $5.4 million higher than the prior year due to additional investment in our Oak Creek expansion units. Our corporate and other segment showed an operating loss of $4.5 billion [ph], essentially flat with the prior year. Taking the changes for these segments together, you would arrive at $12 million increase in adjusted operating income. During 2015, earnings from Wisconsin Energy's investment in American Transmission Company totaled $54.5 million, which was an $11.5 million decline from 2014. As we've previously mentioned, ATC has established reserves in light of recent appeals to the FERC regarding authorized returns from regional transmission organizations. ATC reevaluated those reserves in the fourth quarter and decided to increase them. 
Other income net increased by $24.3 million, driven in large part by second quarter asset sales. Higher AFUDC driven primarily by our gas expansion project in Western Wisconsin, also contributed. 2015 net interest expense increased by $2 million. This was driven by slightly higher long-term debt, offset somewhat by lower interest rates. Wisconsin Energy's standalone income tax expense rose by $2.7 million for 2015. Our higher taxable income was slightly offset by a lower effective tax rate. Looking forward, we expect WEC Energy Group's effective income tax rate to be between 37.5% and 38.5% for 2016. Combining all of these items brings you to adjusted net income of $620.9 million or $2.73 per share for 2015. 
Turning now to operating cash flows, we have provided information in the earnings packet for the consolidated WEC Energy Group on a GAAP basis, which includes 6 months of results from Integrys. We believe this will be a more accurate indicator of the cash position of the company. During 2015, WEC Energy Group's operating cash flows totaled $1,294,000,000, which is a $95 million improvement over 2014. A major driver of the improvement was the inclusion of the legacy Integrys Companies for 6 months which added both to depreciation and deferred income taxes. Legacy Wisconsin Energy's year-to-date operating cash flows in 2015 were about $41 million lower as compared to 2014. As previously discussed, we contributed $100 million to our pension plans in 2015. No such contributions were made during 2014. Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 51.4% at the end of 2015. This ratio reflects the Integrys acquisition and treats half of WEC Energy Group's hybrid securities as common equity which is consistent with past presentations. We continue to use cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. For comparison purposes, the annual sales information I'll discuss next reflect results for WE Energies only. Actual 2014 retail deliveries fell by 1.8%. Excluding the iron ore mines, retail deliveries fell by 8/10 [ph] of a percent. Weather normalized retail deliveries, again, excluding the iron ore mines, also fell by 8/10 [ph] of a percent compared to 2014. 
Looking at the individual customer segments now, we saw weather-normalized residential deliveries fall by 1.8%. Actual residential deliveries fell by 2%. Across our small commercial industrial group, weather normal deliveries rose by 2/10 of a percent. Actual deliveries fell by 1/10 of a percent. In the large commercial industrial segment, deliveries for 2015 fell by 3.1%. Excluding the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial deliveries fell by 4/10 of a percent. Our 2015 weather normalized retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, dropped 1.5% compared to 2014. Our actual gas deliveries, again, excluding gas used for power generation, were down 11% compared to the polar vortex driven gas sales in 2014. For 2016, we will forecast and discuss delivery results for the state of Wisconsin, our largest segment. Our Wisconsin segment includes the results of both WE Energies and Wisconsin Public Service. Note that with decoupling, gas deliveries in Illinois are not as tightly tied to financial results. So in Wisconsin, we're forecasting a modest increase of 3/10 of a percent in weather normalized retail electric deliveries, excluding the iron ore mines. That compares to 1/10 of a percent decline in 2015. We plan to meet our earnings targets without relying on any significant gains in energy usage by our customers. Looking at 2016 by individual customer segments, we expect residential deliveries to declined by 1/10 [ph] of a percent, impacted positively by continued modest growth in housing starts but offset by conservation. In the small commercial industrial segment, we are projecting sales to decline by 3/10 of a percent and in the large industrial -- commercial and industrial group, we are projecting an increase of 1.2%, excluding the mines. We project 2016 Wisconsin weather normalized retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, to increase by 0.5%. 
Turning now to our capital forecast, as Gale mentioned, we expect to invest at least $1.5 billion per year in capital projects or $15 billion in the next decade. Correspondingly, we plan to invest $1.5 billion in 2016 primarily focused on modernizing our delivery networks. We will continue to evaluate both our short and long-term capital investment plans in light of bonus depreciation. 
Next, I'd like to remind you about earnings guidance for 2016. As previously mentioned, we expect earnings per share growth for WEC Energy Group to be in a range of 6% to 8% off a base of $2.72 a share. Therefore, our guidance for 2016 is in a range from $2.88 to $2.94 a share. This projection assumes normal weather and excludes any potential remaining acquisition-related costs. Again, our guidance for 2016 is $2.88 to $2.94 per share. 
Finally, let's look at first quarter guidance. Taking into account January weather and the timing of fuel recoveries, we project first quarter earnings to be in a range of $0.99 to $1.03 per share. That assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter and excludes any remaining acquisition-related costs. Once again, first quarter guidance for the WEC Energy Group is $0.99 to $1.03 per share. 
And with that, I'll turn things back to Gale"

Pat can add any color they would like to add. First of all, let me tackle the frac sand. In essence, given the frac sand operation, there are about 110 of them in the Western part of the state of Wisconsin. We really don't serve electricity to any of the major ones in the Western part of the state. It's really natural gas demand for us. And because we've just completed in November the largest expansion of our natural gas distribution network in Wisconsin Gas history. We haven't, up until now, served a significant amount of the frac sand demand for natural gas. So while the frac sand industry has declined, along with the big drop in oil prices, we still have an opportunity to grow over the longer term and the medium term in terms of our natural gas distribution service to that industry in the Western part of the state. So long story short, because we haven't had a lot of the service in place or a lot of the capability in place up until now, we've not really been hurt to any significant degree by the decline in the frac sand business in light of the oil crash, if I'm making any sense."

Long story short, we serve 17 different sectors of the industrial economy in the state of Wisconsin. And many of those sectors are either flat or slightly down when you look at 2015 performance. But there are 4 sectors where we have significant concentration in Wisconsin that actually have shown a little growth and we think may continue to show some growth in our projections in 2016. So that's food processing, paper production, printing and plastics. So those are fairly large industrial sectors. Among the 17, those 4 are pretty large and we have actually seen some uptick throughout in 2015 in those 4 sectors and that, in part, underlies the percent or so growth that we are projecting for 2016.

The workshops are very granular and technical in nature. So, for example, at one of the workshops, the folks from the federal pipeline safety administration have been invited to come in and discuss the 2011 call to action from the federal government to replace some of these aging cast-iron and bare steel pipes. So this is the way the workshop has gone so far, and you're right, 2 of the 6 have been completed and the subject matters for the remaining 4 are public and the agendas are public. It's really almost stepping back and let's take a complete re-examination for the need, the schedule and the shorter and long-term cost estimates and then, importantly, one of the workshops will be dedicated to this, cooperation and collaboration with the city of Chicago. And I can't tell you how important that is. While we're in the process of trying to replace 2,000 miles of aging underground pipes in Chicago, the city of Chicago is also trying to replace a significant number of aging water mains. So cooperation in terms of trying to get that work done in a schedule collaborative basis is a real issue that we need to continue to work on this. I think we made real progress with the city of Chicago in terms of sharing information and planning for construction. But one of those workshops is really going to be dedicated to, okay, how can the 2 entities that are ripping up streets in Chicago best work together. So very technical in nature, but really going through, again, it's almost a complete new primer, the need for the program and how the program should be structured and scheduled going forward."

How much can efficiently and effectively be spent in any given year, and how much risk would be taken if you extend the program. But right now, while all of that is still being processed and all of that's still being discussed, and I believe the commission will vote on a new plan in June, the best advice I could give you is to stick with the $250 million to $280 million a year investment plan. That's what we're finding right now. It's probably the sweet spot in terms of how much can be done efficiently during the construction in the city of Chicago."

First of all, the 6 workshops that the Illinois Commerce Commission has scheduled, the invitees are really all of the parties that have been involved in this entire program from day 1. So it would be the Citizens Utility Board, it would be the City of Chicago, it would be the State Attorney General's office, it would be the significant representation from the Natural Gas division of the Illinois Commerce Commission. In fact, the workshops are being moderated by the head of the natural gas division of the Illinois Commerce Commission. And all of the folks that have been invited and are participating. from what we have seen so far in the first 2 workshops, I would say that there are more informational type questions. For example, the State Attorney General's office has asked, well, does all the cast-iron pipe at a certain age really need to be replaced. So they are very technical questions. I mean, this is almost, I think a terrific opportunity to get everybody on the same basis in terms of information and knowledge about the program. So I'm actually very encouraged by the approach that the Illinois Commerce Commission has taken. I think it will be in opportunity again to put everybody on the same basis of information. And also, really have a very strong dialogue with the natural gas division of how the company and the city of Chicago need to cooperate on the streets. So that's really kind of the color I would give you so far. Again, very encouraged by the participation, by the kind of questions, and by the understanding that's building that with this kind of aging infrastructure, this is something that should not, cannot be ignored. So that would be my thoughts on the workshops, and again, we filed a 3-year plan that put our top priorities in place for the neighborhoods that we thought were most at risk, and we'll see what the commission decides. But their plan would be to vote on a longer-term future for the events being replacement program by June, and again, I would say to you given everything we've seen around the country, both from a natural gas and water standpoint, it's just not -- I don't think anyone thinks its wise to ignore the urgent need to upgrade that system in Chicago. And then going backward, the the Attorney General's office is asking, as they have, about an $8 billion cost estimate for the long-term investment need of the program. And that need or that cost estimate surfaced, as you know, after -- immediately after we acquired the company. And so the Attorney General's office is wondering who knew in the prior company, the prior year management about the $8 billion estimate and why was the $8 billion estimate, which was a preliminary estimate, why was that not disclosed prior to the closing of the acquisition. So that docket, if you will, is still open before the Illinois Commerce Commission."

But, first of all, many companies in our industry were projecting far stronger growth than we have projected and they haven't seen it develop either. My own view, and this is strictly a personal view, an anecdotal, but just based on years of experience, I think there are 3 things going on. In 2014 and 2015 may be a bit of an aberration from a small commercial and residential standpoint. '14 and '15, the weather was just, mild is probably the best word, mild summers, mild winters, just not, no abnormally higher or abnormally lower temperatures but no persistence of a weather trend. And one of the things that weather normalization techniques does not pick up is the lack of, say, 15 days of 90-degree weather. If you have 2 days of 90-degree weather, you can do the weather normalization, but I don't think it picks up the fact that you didn't have any persistent weather one way or another. And persistent weather drives consumption and drives usage. So I think one thing that has happened is we haven't seen a really good long heatwave and even though last winter was a little bit colder than normal, it was spotty, it wasn't 15 days in a row of 10 degrees. So in my mind, the jury is still out related to longer term growth, if we get back to a year in which we have consistent and persistent weather patterns. That's number one. But number two, if there's any question that we see more residential conservation in the last couple of years, there's any question about that. And when you think about why that may be, it really comes down to technology. You've heard me say before that if you replace a big-screen television that you maybe bought 7 or 8 years ago with a brand-new one, you're probably going to use 60% to 80% less electricity. Your iPad requires less energy to charge than your computer screen standalone. You buy a new washer and dryer, they're far more energy-efficient, same thing with refrigerators. You have the thermostats. There's just a lot more technology available to customers. So essentially, what we're kind of seeing here is our customer growth, which continues to be good being offset by conversation."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review our results for calendar year 2015. As you know, we formed WEC Energy Group on June 29 when we closed our acquisition of Integrys. So today's report reflects 2 full quarters as a combined company. I'll update our progress on a number of major initiatives in just a moment, but first, as always, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President of WEC Energy Group and CEO Elect; Pat Keyes, our Chief Financial Officer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Bill Guc, Controller; Scott Lauber, Treasurer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. 
Turning now to our 2015 performance. I'd like to remind you that we're focusing on legacy Wisconsin Energy, so our financial results have been adjusted to remove the impact of the acquisition. And as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported Wisconsin Energy adjusted stand-alone earnings of $2.73 a share for 2015. That compares with adjusted earnings of $2.65 a share for 2014. Looking back over at the latest year, it was not only a transformational year for our company, but a year also of significant achievements. We Energies was named the most reliable utility in the Midwest for the fifth consecutive year, and in international studies, We Energies ranked in the top quartile in the Midwest again for customer service and power quality and in the top quartile nationally for customer service. In addition, Wisconsin Public Service in Green Bay was ranked #2 in the Midwest for overall customer satisfaction among midsized utilities. We also reached a milestone for employee safety at We Energies, recording the safest year in more than 115 years of operation. We invested nearly $780 million in our legacy core business, with all major projects on time and on budget. And of course, we closed our acquisition of Integrys to form WEC Energy Group, the leading electric and natural gas utilities system in the Midwest, with now 4.4 million customers across the region. From a financial standpoint, we continued to deliver solid earnings growth. Through disciplined cost control and effective planning, we delivered record earnings in 2015 despite a very warm fourth quarter. In fact, Milwaukee experienced the warmest December in its history, surpassing the former record set way back in the day in 1877. 
Taking at look at the state's economy, Wisconsin's unemployment rate ended the year at 4.3%, well below the national average. And the December statistics showed that more Wisconsinites were employed than during any other month in history. The state's labor force participation rate also rose to 68%, which is more than 5 points better than the national rate. In addition, Wisconsin added 4,000 manufacturing jobs from November of '14 to November of 2015 despite some very challenging conditions for manufacturers. In light of these challenges, use of electricity by our large commercial and industrial customers moderated a bit. In 2015, our large customers, excluding the iron ore mines, consumed approximately 0.4% less electricity than they did in 2014. However, and this is an important point, we did see improvement in several significant sectors of the state's economy, including food processing, printing, paper production and plastics. In addition, we continue to see an uptick in customer growth across our system. We Energies is serving approximately 6,500 more electric customers and more than 8,500 more customers on the gas side of our business today than we were a year ago. 
I'm also pleased with our post-acquisition work over the past several months as we begun to operationalize the new WEC Energy Group. As I've said before, we see tremendous opportunity in the framework of the new company. WEC Energy Group has the scale, scope, technical depth, geographic reach and financial resources to thrive in our consolidating industry. We're leveraging these strengths to deliver operational and financial benefits to all of our stakeholders. And with our proven leadership team, we're incorporating best practices across the organization to streamline our operations and to reduce costs. WEC Energy Group is now the eighth largest natural gas distribution company in the country and one of the 15 largest investor-owned utility systems in the United States with real opportunity for growth. Bottom line, we have the same top management team but now with a new platform for growth, a platform focused on the energy infrastructure needs of 4.4 million customers across the Midwest. And our plan calls for the combined company to grow earnings per share by 6% to 8% in 2016. 
Now I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the impact of bonus depreciation, a subject I know you're very interested in. As you know, in December, Congress passed a tax law that extends and modifies bonus depreciation for property placed in service from 2015 to 2019. At this point, we estimate that we'll receive approximately $1 billion of cash benefits from this extension of bonus depreciation, with most of the benefits coming in 2016 and in 2017. First, let me say though that we do not expect bonus depreciation to have any material impact on earnings this year. And over the longer term, we have significant flexibility to bring forward reliability projects that will clearly benefit customers. The additional cash benefits will allow us to fund a strong backlog of infrastructure investments, but the region needs for reliability and if the Clean Power Plan moves forward on the proposed timetable. Our incremental cash flows could well be needed to support additional investments in renewable energy or new natural gas generation for our fleet. Of course, we also have the option to further deleverage the holding company. So bottom line, for the longer term beyond 2016, we continue to see earnings per share growth of 5% to 7% a year. As a reminder, our current 10-year investment plan is primarily focused on modernizing our delivery networks. We expect that more than half of our capital investments, about $800 million a year roughly, will be dedicated to the gas delivery business, providing safer and more reliable infrastructure and extending our gas distribution lines to customers across the Midwest. We also plan to invest approximately $400 million a year to upgrade and harden our electric delivery networks. Now the primary risks associated with these core distribution projects are naturally more manageable, given the smaller scale and scope of the work. But the work is no less important than the megaprojects we've completed over the years. Our focus now on renewing our distribution networks is essential to maintaining our status as one of the nation's most reliable utilities. We also expect the remaining investment, approximately $300 million a year, will be focused on our generating fleet and on what we call corporate infrastructure. To be clear, however, these projections do not include any capital that would be needed for compliance with the Clean Power Plan. 
Turning now to other developments. I'm pleased to report that the conversion of the Valley Power Plant near downtown Milwaukee from coal to natural gas was completed in the fourth quarter on time and on budget. The total investment was approximately $60 million, excluding allowance for funds used during construction. We're also making very good progress on the major construction work at our Twin Falls hydroelectric plant on the border of Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. After more than 100 years of operation, we're building a new powerhouse and adding spillway capacity to meet current federal standards. Overall, the Twin Falls project is on time and on budget, with approximately 82% of the construction now complete. We're targeting commercial operation for the summer of this year, and we're forecasting a total investment of $60 million to $65 million, again, excluding allowance for funds used during construction.
Next, you may recall that we're working to add fuel flexibility at our Oak Creek expansion units. These units were initially permitted to burn bituminous coal, but given the current cost differential between bituminous coal and Powder River Basin coal, blending the 2 types of fuel could save customers anywhere between $25 million and $50 million a year depending upon the mix. Work is underway now to expand our coal storage capability at the Oak Creek site, the larger site should be ready by early next year. Also, the first capital investment inside the plant was made on one of the units during a planned outage this past fall. We also plan to upgrade the second unit during the first quarter of this year. Our share of these investments for the new Oak Creek units is targeted at approximately $80 million, again, excluding allowance for funds used during construction. 
We're also moving forward on the Accelerated Main Replacement Program at Peoples Gas in Chicago. As you'll recall, this is one of the largest natural gas infrastructure projects in the country. The program calls for the replacement of approximately 2,000 miles of Chicago's aging gas pipelines, and I'm pleased to report that over the past 6 months, we've taken significant steps to improve the management and performance of this project, which is now approximately 18% complete. We engaged a nationally recognized engineering firm that helped us conduct an extensive independent review of the work plan and the long-term cost estimates. As part of our fresh start in Chicago, we filed a plan on November 30 that lays out our top priorities for the next 3 years. These components of the 3-year plan include removal and replacement of more than 250 miles of aging cast iron pipes in the neighborhoods most at risk; a projected investment of between $250 million and $280 million a year; and regular updates to the Illinois Commerce Commission and other stakeholders to keep them fully informed of our progress. 
In assessing the plan that we filed on November 30, the Illinois Commerce Commission has scheduled a series of 6 workshops to be held by the end of March. Two of the workshops are already complete. While the engineering, field work and cost recovery continue, these workshops are bringing together all of the stakeholders to review the scope, the schedule and the long-term cost of the plan with a focus on safety and reliability. I'm confident that the steps we're taking will provide Chicagoans with a safe, modern natural gas delivery system that they deserve. 
Moving now to our transmission business, our electric transmission business. As you know, WEC is now a 60% owner of American Transmission Company. ATC's capital plan calls for investment of $3.7 billion to $4.5 billion between now and 2024 to bolster the reliability of the grid. As I've said in the past, we welcome the opportunity to increase our commitment to the transmission business. 
Turning now to our dividend policy. On January 21, as you may have read, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.495 a share, an increase of 8.2% over the previous quarterly dividend. Our annual dividend rate is now $1.98 a share. Going forward, we're targeting a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings, and we expect our dividend growth to be in line with the growth in earnings per share. 
On a final note, as I mentioned on one of our previous calls, we've been seeking a new owner for the Trillium Compressed Natural Gas business. You'll recall that this business came to us as part of the Integrys transaction. We sold part of the business in late November of last year, and very recently, we reached an agreement to sell substantially all of the remaining Trillium assets. This agreement is subject to Hart-Scott-Rodino review and we're projecting to reach financial close by the end of the first quarter. In total, we expect at least $130 million of pretax cash proceeds from the combined sales of the Trillium assets. The fair value of Trillium was reflected in our purchase price allocation following the Integrys acquisition, and as you know, the earnings on the Trillium business were not significant to our company. 
So in summary, ladies and gentlemen, these are exciting times filled with opportunity and change for our company. And speaking of change, we recently announced that I'll be retiring as Chief Executive Officer effective May 1. After May 1, I'll continue to serve the company as the nonexecutive Chairman of the Board. And I'm delighted that Allen Leverett will succeed me as Chief Executive. Allen has also been appointed to our Board of Directors. As most of you know, Allen has been a very key contributor to our success since he joined Wisconsin Energy the same year I did back in 2003, first, as Chief Financial Officer, then as the leader of our Power Generation Group, and most recently as President of the parent firm at our Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan utilities. I've known and worked with Allen for more than 20 years. Now I have to tell you, he's not quite as fond of burritos and enchiladas as I am, but the depth of his experience, his management skills and his focus on execution make him the ideal person to lead our company through a time of continuing change in the energy industry. Allen, my congratulations"

First, I'll focus on the operating income for Wisconsin Energy and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. Our consolidated operating income for the full year 2015 was $1,137,000,000 as compared with $1,125,000,000 in 2014. That's an increase of $12 million. Starting with utility energy segment, operating income in 2015 totaled $767.7 million, an increase of $3.5 million over 2014. On the positive side, we had a $35 million increase in revenues due to the Wisconsin rate order. We also had $10.4 million of improved fuel recoveries and lower O&M cost, in part driven by lower benefits costs and reduced maintenance expense in the fourth quarter, decreased expenses by $10.2 million. On the downside, we estimate that our electric and gas margins decreased by $35.3 million, driven by warmer fourth quarter weather. The fourth quarter of 2015 was the second warmest in the history of We Energies. In addition, depreciation expense rose by $16.8 million with additional capital expenditures. Combining these and other factors, results in a $3.5 million increase in adjusted utility operating income in 2015 as compared with 2014. Our nonutility energy operating income was $373.4 million, which is $5.4 million higher than the prior year due to additional investment in our Oak Creek expansion units. Our corporate and other segment showed an operating loss of $4.5 million, essentially flat with the prior year. Taking the changes for these segments together, you would arrive at a $12 million increase in adjusted operating income. During 2015, earnings from Wisconsin Energy's investment in American Transmission Company totaled $54.5 million, which was an $11.5 million decline from 2014. As we've previously mentioned, ATC has established reserves in light of recent appeals to the FERC regarding authorized returns for regional transmission organizations. ATC reevaluated those reserves in the fourth quarter and decided to increase them. 
Other income net increased by $24.3 million, driven in large part by second quarter asset sales. Higher AFUDC, driven primarily by our gas expansion project in Western Wisconsin, also contributed. 2015 net interest expense increased by $2 million. This was driven by slightly higher long-term debt, offset somewhat by lower interest rates. Wisconsin Energy's standalone income tax expense rose by $2.7 million for 2015. Our higher taxable income was slightly offset by a lower effective tax rate. Looking forward, we expect WEC Energy Group's effective income tax rate to be between 37.5% and 38.5% for 2016. Combining all of these items brings you to adjusted net income of $620.9 million or $2.73 per share for 2015. 
Turning now to operating cash flows. We have provided information in the earnings packet for the consolidated WEC Energy Group on a GAAP basis, which includes 6 months of results from Integrys. We believe this will be a more accurate indicator of the cash position of the company. During 2015, WEC Energy Group's operating cash flows totaled $1,294,000,000, which is a $95 million improvement over 2014. A major driver of the improvement was the inclusion of the legacy Integrys companies for 6 months, which added both to depreciation and deferred income taxes. Legacy Wisconsin Energy's year-to-date operating cash flows in 2015 were about $41 million lower as compared to 2014. As previously discussed, we contributed $100 million to our pension plans in 2015. No such contributions were made during 2014. Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 51.4% at the end of 2015. This ratio reflects the Integrys acquisition and treats half of WEC Energy Group's hybrid securities as common equity, which is consistent with past presentations. We continue to use cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. For comparison purposes, the annual sales information I'll discuss next will reflect results for We Energies only. Actual 2015 retail deliveries fell by 1.8%. Excluding the iron ore mines, retail deliveries fell by 0.8%. Weather-normalized retail deliveries, again, excluding the iron ore mines, also fell by 0.8% compared to 2014. 
Looking at the individual customer segments now, we saw weather-normalized residential deliveries fall by 1.8%. Actual residential deliveries fell by 2%. Across our small commercial industrial group, weather normal deliveries rose by 0.2%. Actual deliveries fell by 0.1%. In the large commercial industrial segment, deliveries for 2015 fell by 3.1%. Excluding the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial deliveries fell by 0.4%. Our 2015 weather-normalized retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, dropped 1.5% compared to 2014. Our actual gas deliveries, again, excluding gas used for power generation, were down 11% compared to the polar vortex-driven gas sales in 2014. For 2016, we will forecast and discuss delivery results for the state of Wisconsin, our largest segment. Our Wisconsin segment includes the results of both We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service. Note that with decoupling, gas deliveries in Illinois are not as tightly tied to financial results. So in Wisconsin, we're forecasting a modest increase of 0.3% in weather-normalized retail electric deliveries, excluding the iron ore mines. That compares to a 0.1% decline in 2015. We plan to meet our earnings targets without relying on any significant gains in energy usage by our customers. Looking at 2016 by individual customer segments, we expect residential deliveries to decline by 0.1%, impacted positively by continued modest growth in housing starts but offset by conservation. In the small commercial and industrial segment, we are projecting sales to decline by 0.3%. And in the large industrial -- commercial and industrial group, we are projecting an increase of 1.2%, excluding the mines. We project 2016 Wisconsin weather-normalized retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, to increase by 0.5%. 
Turning now to our capital forecast. As Gale mentioned, we expect to invest at least $1.5 billion per year in capital projects or $15 billion in the next decade. Correspondingly, we plan to invest $1.5 billion in 2016, primarily focused on modernizing our delivery networks. We will continue to evaluate both our short- and long-term capital investment plans in light of bonus depreciation. 
Next, I'd like to remind you about earnings guidance for 2016. As previously mentioned, we expect earnings per share growth for WEC Energy Group to be in a range of 6% to 8% off a base of $2.72 a share. Therefore, our guidance for 2016 is in a range from $2.88 to $2.94 a share. This projection assumes normal weather and excludes any potential remaining acquisition-related cost. Again, our guidance for 2016 is $2.88 to $2.94 per share. 
Finally, let's look at first quarter guidance. Taking into account January weather and the timing of fuel recoveries, we project first quarter earnings to be in a range of $0.99 to $1.03 per share. That assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter and excludes any remaining acquisition-related cost. Once again, first quarter guidance for the WEC Energy Group is $0.99 to $1.03 per share. 
And with that, I'll turn things back to Gale."

However, in terms of the cash that we'll be receiving, it has allowed us to pull forward several important infrastructure projects. Really, it's not large projects, but it's things like replacement of additional underground lines, substation transformer replacements, et cetera. Virtually all of that is in Wisconsin, and that's worth about an additional $100 million that we've identified so far for 2016, just as an example. So I think most of the projects that we are looking at that will be able to be funded with the bonus depreciation cash are exactly those types of projects on our gas delivery networks and on our electric delivery networks, all related to reliability, all related to upgrading, modernizing and hardening for safety purposes."

Because as you recall, we did not take for granted that there would be an extension of bonus depreciation when we laid out the new 10-year capital plan at the EEI Conference in November. So yes, I think you could expect us to have additional capital investments, again, along the lines of additional upgrading of our natural gas and electricity delivery networks, particularly in Wisconsin. But in light of the fact that this is additional cash coming in, it really would not have any material effect on our rate review."

So those could be some fairly large projects in the back half of this period that we're talking about.

Pat and Scott should add any color they would like to add. But first of all, let me tackle the frac sand. In essence, given the frac sand operations, there are about 110 of them in the western part of the state of Wisconsin. We really don't serve electricity to any of the major ones in the western part of the state. It's really -- that's really natural gas demand for us. And because we've just completed in November the largest expansion of our natural gas distribution network in Wisconsin Gas history, we haven't, up until now, served a significant amount of the frac sand demand for natural gas. So while the frac sand industry has declined along with the big drop in oil prices, we still have an opportunity to grow over the longer term and the medium term in terms of our natural gas distribution service to that industry in the western part of the state. So long story short, because we hadn't had a lot of the service in place or a lot of the capability in place up until now, we've not really been hurt to any significant degree by the decline in the frac sand business in light of the oil crash, if I'm making any sense."

But there are 4 sectors where we have significant concentration in Wisconsin that actually have shown a little growth and we think may continue to show some growth in our projections in 2016. So that's food processing, paper print -- paper production, printing and plastics. So those are fairly large industrial sectors.

The workshops are very granular and technical in nature. So for example, at one of the workshops, folks from the federal pipeline safety administration have been invited to come in and discuss the 2011 call to action from the federal government to replace some of these aging cast iron and bare steel pipes. So this is the way the workshops have gone so far, and you're right, 2 of the 6 have been completed and the subject matters for the remaining 4 are public and the agendas are public. It's really almost stepping back and let's taking -- take a complete reexamination for the need, schedule and the shorter- and long-term cost estimates and then, importantly, one of the workshops will be dedicated to this, cooperation and collaboration with the city of Chicago. And I can't tell you how important that is. I mean, while we're in the process of trying to replace 2,000 miles of aging underground pipes in Chicago, the city of Chicago is also trying to replace a significant number of aging water mains. So cooperation in terms of trying to get that work done in a scheduled collaborative basis is a real issue that need -- we need to continue to work on this. I think we made real progress with the city of Chicago in terms of sharing information and planning for construction. But one of those workshops is really going to be dedicated to, okay, how do the -- how can the 2 entities that are ripping up streets in Chicago best work together? So very technical in nature, but really going through, again, it's almost a complete new primer, the need for the program and how the program should be structured and scheduled going forward."

So it would be the Citizens Utility Board, it would be the city of Chicago, it would be the State Attorney General's office, it would be a significant representation from the natural gas division of the Illinois Commerce Commission. In fact, the workshops are being moderated by the head of the natural gas division of the Illinois Commerce Commission. And all of the folks that have been invited and are participating, from what we've seen so far in the first 2 workshops, I would say that there are more informational-type questions. I mean, for example, the State Attorney General's office has asked, well, does all the cast iron pipe that's a certain age really need to be replaced? So they are very technical questions. I mean, this is almost a, I think, a terrific opportunity to get everybody on the same basis in terms of information and knowledge about the program. So I'm actually very encouraged by the approach that the Illinois Commerce Commission has taken. I think it will be an opportunity again to put everybody on the same basis of information and also really have a very strong dialogue with the natural gas division of how the company and the city of Chicago need to cooperate in the streets. So that's really kind of the color I would give you so far. Again, very encouraged by the participation, by the kind of questions and by the understanding that's building that with this kind of aging infrastructure, this is something that should not, cannot be ignored. So that would be my thoughts on the workshops. And again, we filed a 3-year plan that put our top priorities in place for the neighborhoods that we thought were most at risk, and we'll see what the commission decides. But their plan would be to vote on a longer-term future for the Advanced Main Replacement Program by June. And again, I would say to you, given everything we've seen around the country, both from a natural gas and water standpoint, it's just not -- I don't think anyone thinks it's wise to ignore the urgent need to upgrade that system in Chicago. And then going backward, the Attorney General's office is asking, as they have, about an $8 billion cost estimate for the long-term investment need of the program. And that need or that cost estimate surfaced, as you know, after -- immediately after we acquired the company. And so the Attorney General's office is wondering who knew in the prior company, the prior management, about the $8 billion estimate and why was the $8 billion estimate, which was a preliminary estimate, why was that not disclosed prior to the closing of the acquisition. So that docket, if you will, is still open before the Illinois Commerce Commission."

But first of all, many companies in our industry were projecting far stronger growth than we have projected and they haven't seen it develop either. My own view, and this is strictly a personal view, an anecdotal, but just based on years of experience, I think there are 3 things going on. In 2014 and 2015, may be a bit of an aberration from a small commercial and residential standpoint. '14 and '15, the weather was just, mild is probably the best word, mild summers, mild winters, just not -- no abnormally higher, abnormally lower temperatures, but no persistence of a weather trend. And one of the things that weather normalization techniques does not pick up is the lack of, say, 15 days of 90-degree weather. If you have 2 days of 90-degree weather, you can do the weather normalization, but I don't think it picks up the fact that you didn't have any persistent weather one way or another. And persistent weather drives consumption and drives usage. So I think one thing that has happened is we haven't seen a really good long heatwave. And even though last winter was a little bit colder than normal, it was spotty. It wasn't 15 days in a row of 10 degrees. So in my mind, the jury is still out related to longer-term growth, if we get back to a year in which we have some consistent and persistent weather patterns. That's number one. But number two, if there's any question that we're seeing more residential conservation in the last couple of years, I don't think there's any question about that. And when you think about why that may be, I mean, it really comes down to technology. You've heard me say before that if you replace a big-screen television that you maybe bought 7 or 8 years ago with a brand-new one, you're probably going to use 60% to 80% less electricity. Your iPad requires less energy to charge than your computer screen standalone. You buy a new washer and dryer, they're far more energy efficient, same thing with refrigerators. You have the Nest Thermostats. There's just a lot more technology available to customers. So essentially, what we're kind of seeing here is our customer growth, which continues to be good, being offset by conservation."

So what we've agreed to do and what we're in the process of right now is we have agreed with those homeowners on a testing protocol, and we are having people going to each one of these homes, have samples collected from various places in the homes of these individuals and then we're having a lab analyze the dust samples and indicate to all of the homeowners we're sending them a [indiscernible] explaining what is in their dust samples.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review our results for calendar year 2015. As you know, we formed WEC Energy Group on June 29 when we closed our acquisition of Integrys. So today's report reflects 2 full quarters as a combined company. I'll update our progress on a number of major initiatives in just a moment, but first, as always, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President of WEC Energy Group and CEO Elect; Pat Keyes, our Chief Financial Officer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Bill Guc, Controller; Scott Lauber, Treasurer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. 
Turning now to our 2015 performance. I'd like to remind you that we're focusing on legacy Wisconsin Energy, so our financial results have been adjusted to remove the impact of the acquisition. And as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported Wisconsin Energy adjusted stand-alone earnings of $2.73 a share for 2015. That compares with adjusted earnings of $2.65 a share for 2014. Looking back over at the latest year, it was not only a transformational year for our company, but a year also of significant achievements. We Energies was named the most reliable utility in the Midwest for the fifth consecutive year, and in national studies, We Energies ranked in the top quartile in the Midwest again for customer service and power quality and in the top quartile nationally for customer service. In addition, Wisconsin Public Service in Green Bay was ranked #2 in the Midwest for overall customer satisfaction among midsized utilities. We also reached a milestone for employee safety at We Energies, recording the safest year in more than 115 years of operation. We invested nearly $780 million in our legacy core business, with all major projects on time and on budget. And of course, we closed our acquisition of Integrys to form WEC Energy Group, the leading electric and natural gas utility system in the Midwest, with now 4.4 million customers across the region. From a financial standpoint, we continued to deliver solid earnings growth. Through disciplined cost control and effective planning, we delivered record earnings in 2015 despite a very warm fourth quarter. In fact, Milwaukee experienced the warmest December in its history, surpassing the former record set way back in the day in 1877. 
Taking at look at the state's economy, Wisconsin's unemployment rate ended the year at 4.3%, well below the national average. And the December statistics showed that more Wisconsinites were employed than during any other month in history. The state's labor force participation rate also rose to 68%, which is more than 5 points better than the national rate. In addition, Wisconsin added 4,000 manufacturing jobs from November of '14 to November of 2015 despite some very challenging conditions for manufacturers. In light of these challenges, use of electricity by our large commercial and industrial customers moderated a bit. In 2015, our large customers, excluding the iron ore mines, consumed approximately 0.4% less electricity than they did in 2014. However, and this is an important point, we did see improvement in several significant sectors of the state's economy, including food processing, printing, paper production and plastics. In addition, we continue to see an uptick in customer growth across our system. We Energies is serving approximately 6,500 more electric customers and more than 8,500 more customers on the gas side of our business today than we were a year ago. 
I'm also pleased with our post-acquisition work over the past several months as we've begun to operationalize the new WEC Energy Group. As I've said before, we see tremendous opportunity in the framework of the new company. WEC Energy Group has the scale, scope, technical depth, geographic reach and financial resources to thrive in our consolidating industry. We're leveraging these strengths to deliver operational and financial benefits to all of our stakeholders. And with our proven leadership team, we're incorporating best practices across the organization to streamline our operations and to reduce costs. WEC Energy Group is now the eighth largest natural gas distribution company in the country and one of the 15 largest investor-owned utility systems in the United States, with real opportunity for growth. Bottom line, we have the same top management team but now with a new platform for growth, a platform focused on the energy infrastructure needs of 4.4 million customers across the Midwest. And our plan calls for the combined company to grow earnings per share by 6% to 8% in 2016. 
Now I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the impact of bonus depreciation, a subject I know you're very interested in. As you know, in December, Congress passed a tax law that extends and modifies bonus depreciation for property placed in service from 2015 to 2019. At this point, we estimate that we'll receive approximately $1 billion of cash benefits from this extension of bonus depreciation, with most of the benefits coming in 2016 and in 2017. First, let me say though that we do not expect bonus depreciation to have any material impact on earnings this year. And over the longer term, we have significant flexibility to bring forward reliability projects that will clearly benefit customers. The additional cash benefits will allow us to fund a strong backlog of infrastructure investments that the region needs for reliability. And if the Clean Power Plan moves forward on the proposed timetable, our incremental cash flows could well be needed to support additional investments in renewable energy or new natural gas generation for our fleet. Of course, we also have the option to further deleverage the holding company. So bottom line, for the longer term beyond 2016, we continue to see earnings per share growth of 5% to 7% a year. As a reminder, our current 10-year investment plan is primarily focused on modernizing our delivery networks. We expect that more than half of our capital investments, about $800 million a year roughly, will be dedicated to the gas delivery business, providing safer and more reliable infrastructure and extending our gas distribution lines to customers across the Midwest. We also plan to invest approximately $400 million a year to upgrade and harden our electric delivery networks. Now the primary risks associated with these core distribution projects are naturally more manageable, given the smaller scale and scope of the work. But the work is no less important than the megaprojects we've completed over the years. Our focus now on renewing our distribution networks is essential to maintaining our status as one of the nation's most reliable utilities. We also expect the remaining investment, approximately $300 million a year, will be focused on our generating fleet and on what we call corporate infrastructure. To be clear, however, these projections do not include any capital that would be needed for compliance with the Clean Power Plan. 
Turning now to other developments. I'm pleased to report that the conversion of the Valley Power Plant near downtown Milwaukee from coal to natural gas was completed in the fourth quarter, on time and on budget. The total investment was approximately $60 million, excluding allowance for funds used during construction. We're also making very good progress on the major construction work at our Twin Falls hydroelectric plant on the border of Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. After more than 100 years of operation, we're building a new powerhouse and adding spillway capacity to meet current federal standards. Overall, the Twin Falls project is on time and on budget, with approximately 82% of the construction now complete. We're targeting commercial operation for the summer of this year, and we're forecasting a total investment of $60 million to $65 million, again, excluding allowance for funds used during construction.
Next, you may recall that we're working to add fuel flexibility at our Oak Creek expansion units. These units were initially permitted to burn bituminous coal, but given the current cost differential between bituminous coal and Powder River Basin coal, blending the 2 types of fuel could save customers anywhere between $25 million and $50 million a year depending upon the mix. Work is underway now to expand our coal storage capability at the Oak Creek site. The larger site should be ready by early next year. Also, the first capital investment inside the plant was made on one of the units during a planned outage this past fall. We also plan to upgrade the second unit during the first quarter of this year. Our share of these investments for the new Oak Creek units is targeted at approximately $80 million, again, excluding allowance for funds used during construction. 
We're also moving forward on the Accelerated Main Replacement Program at Peoples Gas in Chicago. As you'll recall, this is one of the largest natural gas infrastructure projects in the country. The program calls for the replacement of approximately 2,000 miles of Chicago's aging gas pipelines, and I'm pleased to report that over the past 6 months, we've taken significant steps to improve the management and performance of this project, which is now approximately 18% complete. We engaged a nationally recognized engineering firm that helped us conduct an extensive independent review of the work plan and the long-term cost estimates. As part of our fresh start in Chicago, we filed a plan on November 30 that lays out our top priorities for the next 3 years. The components of the 3-year plan include removal and replacement of more than 250 miles of aging cast iron pipes in the neighborhoods most at risk, a projected investment of between $250 million and $280 million a year and regular updates to the Illinois Commerce Commission and other stakeholders to keep them fully informed of our progress. 
In assessing the plan that we filed on November 30, the Illinois Commerce Commission has scheduled a series of 6 workshops to be held by the end of March. Two of the workshops are already complete. While the engineering, field work and cost recovery continue, these workshops are bringing together all of the stakeholders to review the scope, the schedule and the long-term cost of the plan with a focus on safety and reliability. I'm confident that the steps we're taking will provide Chicagoans with the safe, modern natural gas delivery system that they deserve. 
Moving now to our transmission business, our electric transmission business. As you know, WEC is now a 60% owner of American Transmission Company. ATC's capital plan calls for investment of $3.7 billion to $4.5 billion between now and 2024 to bolster the reliability of the grid. As I've said in the past, we welcome the opportunity to increase our commitment to the transmission business. 
Turning now to our dividend policy. On January 21, as you may have read, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.495 a share, an increase of 8.2% over the previous quarterly dividend. Our annual dividend rate is now $1.98 a share. Going forward, we're targeting a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings, and we expect our dividend growth to be in line with the growth in earnings per share. 
On a final note, as I mentioned on one of our previous calls, we've been seeking a new owner for the Trillium Compressed Natural Gas business. You'll recall that this business came to us as part of the Integrys transaction. We sold part of the business in late November of last year, and very recently, we reached an agreement to sell substantially all of the remaining Trillium assets. This agreement is subject to Hart-Scott-Rodino review, and we're projecting to reach financial close by the end of the first quarter. In total, we expect at least $130 million of pretax cash proceeds from the combined sales of the Trillium assets. The fair value of Trillium was reflected in our purchase price allocation following the Integrys acquisition, and as you know, the earnings on the Trillium business were not significant to our company. 
So in summary, ladies and gentlemen, these are exciting times filled with opportunity and change for our company. And speaking of change, we recently announced that I'll be retiring as Chief Executive Officer effective May 1. After May 1, I'll continue to serve the company as the nonexecutive Chairman of the Board. And I'm delighted that Allen Leverett will succeed me as Chief Executive. Allen has also been appointed to our Board of Directors. As most of you know, Allen has been a very key contributor to our success since he joined Wisconsin Energy the same year I did back in 2003, first as Chief Financial Officer, then as the leader of our Power Generation Group, and most recently as President of the parent firm at our Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan utilities. I've known and worked with Allen for more than 20 years. Now I have to tell you, he's not quite as fond of burritos and enchiladas as I am, but the depth of his experience, his management skills and his focus on execution make him the ideal person to lead our company through a time of continuing change in the energy industry. Allen, my congratulations."

As Gale mentioned, in 2015, our adjusted earnings grew to $2.73 a share compared with $2.65 a share for 2014. Our adjusted earnings exclude the Integrys company's earnings and the impacts of the acquisition. They are also adjusted for the shares issued in connection with the merger. To facilitate comparisons with last year, my discussion of 2015 results will focus primarily on legacy Wisconsin Energy. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes the results of the Integrys companies and has a full GAAP to adjusted reconciliation. First, I'll focus on operating income for Wisconsin Energy and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. Our consolidated operating income for the full year 2015 was $1,137,000,000 as compared with $1,125,000,000 in 2014. That's an increase of $12 million. Starting with the utility energy segment, operating income in 2015 totaled $767.7 million, an increase of $3.5 million over 2014. On the positive side, we had a $35 million increase in revenues due to the Wisconsin rate order. We also had $10.4 million of improved fuel recoveries and lower O&M cost, in part driven by lower benefits costs and reduced maintenance expense in the fourth quarter, decreased expenses by $10.2 million. On the downside, we estimate that our electric and gas margins decreased by $35.3 million, driven by warmer fourth quarter weather. The fourth quarter of 2015 was the second warmest in the history of We Energies. In addition, depreciation expense rose by $16.8 million with additional capital expenditures. Combining these and other factors results in a $3.5 million increase in adjusted utility operating income in 2015 as compared with 2014. Our nonutility energy operating income was $373.4 million, which is $5.4 million higher than the prior year due to additional investment in our Oak Creek expansion units. Our corporate and other segment showed an operating loss of $4.5 million, essentially flat with the prior year. Taking the changes for these segments together, you would arrive at a $12 million increase in adjusted operating income. During 2015, earnings from Wisconsin Energy's investment in American Transmission Company totaled $54.5 million, which was an $11.5 million decline from 2014. As we've previously mentioned, ATC has established reserves in light of recent appeals to the FERC regarding authorized returns for regional transmission organizations. ATC reevaluated those reserves in the fourth quarter and decided to increase them. 
Other income net increased by $24.3 million, driven in large part by second quarter asset sales. Higher AFUDC, driven primarily by our gas expansion project in western Wisconsin, also contributed. 2015 net interest expense increased by $2 million. This was driven by slightly higher long-term debt, offset somewhat by lower interest rates. Wisconsin Energy's standalone income tax expense rose by $2.7 million for 2015. Our higher taxable income was slightly offset by a lower effective tax rate. Looking forward, we expect WEC Energy Group's effective income tax rate to be between 37.5% and 38.5% for 2016. Combining all of these items brings you to adjusted net income of $620.9 million or $2.73 per share for 2015. 
Turning now to operating cash flows. We have provided information in your earnings packet for the consolidated WEC Energy Group on a GAAP basis, which includes 6 months of results from Integrys. We believe this will be a more accurate indicator of the cash position of the company. During 2015, WEC Energy Group's operating cash flows totaled $1,294,000,000, which is a $95 million improvement over 2014. A major driver of the improvement was the inclusion of the legacy Integrys companies for 6 months, which added both to depreciation and deferred income taxes. Legacy Wisconsin Energy's year-to-date operating cash flows in 2015 were about $41 million lower as compared to 2014. As previously discussed, we contributed $100 million to our pension plans in 2015. No such contributions were made during 2014. Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 51.4% at the end of 2015. This ratio reflects the Integrys acquisition and treats half of WEC Energy Group's hybrid securities as common equity, which is consistent with past presentations. We continue to use cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. For comparison purposes, the annual sales information I'll discuss next will reflect results for We Energies only. Actual 2015 retail deliveries fell by 1.8%. Excluding the iron ore mines, retail deliveries fell by 0.8%. Weather-normalized retail deliveries, again, excluding the iron ore mines, also fell by 0.8% compared to 2014. 
Looking at the individual customer segments now, we saw weather-normalized residential deliveries fall by 1.8%. Actual residential deliveries fell by 2%. Across our small commercial industrial group, weather normal deliveries rose by 0.2%. Actual deliveries fell by 0.1%. In the large commercial industrial segment, deliveries for 2015 fell by 3.1%. Excluding the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial deliveries fell by 0.4%. Our 2015 weather-normalized retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, dropped 1.5% compared to 2014. Our actual gas deliveries, again excluding gas used for power generation, were down 11% compared to the polar vortex-driven gas sales in 2014. For 2016, we will forecast and discuss delivery results for the state of Wisconsin, our largest segment. Our Wisconsin segment includes the results of both We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service. Note that with decoupling, gas deliveries in Illinois are not as tightly tied to financial results. So in Wisconsin, we're forecasting a modest increase of 0.3% in weather-normalized retail electric deliveries, excluding the iron ore mines. That compares to a 0.1% decline in 2015. We plan to meet our earnings targets without relying on any significant gains in energy usage by our customers. Looking at 2016 by individual customer segments, we expect residential deliveries to decline by 0.1%, impacted positively by continued modest growth in housing starts but offset by conservation. In the small commercial and industrial segment, we are projecting sales to decline by 0.3%. And in the large industrial -- commercial and industrial group, we are projecting an increase of 1.2%, excluding the mines. We project 2016 Wisconsin weather-normalized retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, to increase by 0.5%. 
Turning now to our capital forecast. As Gale mentioned, we expect to invest at least $1.5 billion per year in capital projects, or $15 billion in the next decade. Correspondingly, we plan to invest $1.5 billion in 2016, primarily focused on modernizing our delivery networks. We will continue to evaluate both our short- and long-term capital investment plans in light of bonus depreciation. 
Next, I'd like to remind you about earnings guidance for 2016. As previously mentioned, we expect earnings per share growth for WEC Energy Group to be in a range of 6% to 8% off a base of $2.72 a share. Therefore, our guidance for 2016 is in a range from $2.88 to $2.94 a share. This projection assumes normal weather and excludes any potential remaining acquisition-related costs. Again, our guidance for 2016 is $2.88 to $2.94 per share. 
Finally, let's look at first quarter guidance. Taking into account January weather and the timing of fuel recoveries, we project first quarter earnings to be in a range of $0.99 to $1.03 per share. That assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter and excludes any remaining acquisition-related costs. Once again, first quarter guidance for the WEC Energy Group is $0.99 to $1.03 per share. 
And with that, I'll turn things back to Gale."

Really, it's not large projects, but it's things like replacement of additional underground lines, substation transformer replacements, et cetera.

And the honest answer to you is we're going to continue to iterate as we move along. I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we have additional distribution network projects that we can use of additional cash to very beneficial use for customers. As Allen mentioned, there may be some additional transmission investments in the back half of that 5-year period. There may be a generation investment because of Clean Power Plan compliance. But the other option we have is further deleveraging of the holding company. There will be some deleveraging in the plan to begin with, it just will happen, given our -- the way we've laid out our forecast. But we also have the opportunity to deleverage. So what we're going to do as we continue to move forward through this period here is we're going to say, okay, what is the best use of the cash for our customers and shareholders and put that cash to the best use we can. And that -- and what we were trying to do for you is lay out the series of options that we have that we'll balance going forward. So I can't give you a precise answer at this point in time, other than additional beyond the plan deleveraging of the holding company is an option."

Pat and Scott should add any color they would like to add. But first of all, let me tackle the frac sand. In essence, given the frac sand operations, and there are about 110 of them in the western part of the state of Wisconsin. We really don't serve electricity to any of the major ones in the western part of the state. It's really -- that's really natural gas demand for us. And because we've just completed in November the largest expansion of our natural gas distribution network in Wisconsin Gas history, we hadn't, up until now, served a significant amount of the frac sand demand for natural gas. So while the frac sand industry has declined along with the big drop in oil prices, we still have an opportunity to grow over the longer term and the medium term in terms of our natural gas distribution service to that industry in the western part of the state. So long story short, because we hadn't had a lot of the service in place or a lot of the capability in place up until now, we've not really been hurt to any significant degree by the decline in the frac sand business in light of the oil crash, if I'm making any sense."

And many of those sectors are either flat or slightly down when you look at 2015 performance. But there are 4 sectors where we have significant concentration in Wisconsin that actually have shown a little growth and we think may continue to show some growth in our projections in 2016. So that's food processing, paper print -- paper production, printing and plastics. So those are fairly large industrial sectors. Among the 17, those 4 are pretty large and we've actually seen some uptick throughout 2015 in those 4 sectors and that, in part, underlies the percent or so growth that we're projecting for 2016.

The workshops are very granular and technical in nature. So for example, at one of the workshops, folks from the federal pipeline safety administration had been invited to come in and discuss the 2011 call to action from the federal government to replace some of these aging cast iron and bare steel pipes. So this is the way the workshops have gone so far, and you're right, 2 of the 6 have been completed and the subject matters for the remaining 4 are public and the agendas are public. It's really almost stepping back and let's taking -- take a complete reexamination for the need, schedule and the shorter- and long-term cost estimates and then, importantly, and one of the workshops will be dedicated to this, cooperation and collaboration with the city of Chicago. And I can't tell you how important that is. I mean, while we're in the process of trying to replace 2,000 miles of aging underground pipes in Chicago, the city of Chicago is also trying to replace a significant number of aging water mains. So cooperation in terms of trying to get that work done in a scheduled collaborative basis is a real issue that needs -- we need to continue to work on this. I think we've made real progress with the city of Chicago in terms of sharing information and planning for construction. But one of those workshops is really going to be dedicated to, okay, how do the -- how can the 2 entities that are ripping up streets in Chicago best work together? So very technical in nature, but really going through, again, it's almost a complete new primer, the need for the program and how the program should be structured and scheduled going forward."

How much can efficiently and effectively be spent in any given year? And how much risk would be taken if you extended the program? But right now, while all of that is still being processed and all of that's still being discussed, and I believe the commission will vote on a new plan in June, the best advice I could give you is to stick with the $250 million to $280 million a year investment plan. That's what we're finding right now is probably the sweet spot in terms of how much can be done efficiently during the construction in the city of Chicago."

So it would be the Citizens Utility Board, it would be the city of Chicago, it would be the State Attorney General's office, it would be a significant representation from the natural gas division of the Illinois Commerce Commission. In fact, the workshops are being moderated by the head of the natural gas division of the Illinois Commerce Commission. And all of the folks that have been invited to participate are participating. From what we've seen so far in the first 2 workshops, I would say that there are more informational-type questions. I mean, for example, the State Attorney General's office has asked, well, does all of the cast iron pipe that's a certain age really need to be replaced? So they are very technical questions. I mean, this is almost a, I think, a terrific opportunity to get everybody on the same basis in terms of information and knowledge about the program. So I'm actually very encouraged by the approach that the Illinois Commerce Commission has taken. I think it will be an opportunity again to put everybody on the same basis of information and also really have a very strong dialogue with the natural gas division of how the company and the city of Chicago need to cooperate in the streets. So that's really kind of the color I would give you so far. Again, very encouraged by the participation, by the kind of questions and by the understanding that's building that with this kind of aging infrastructure, this is something that should not, cannot be ignored. So that would be my thoughts on the workshops. And again, we filed a 3-year plan that put our top priorities in place for the neighborhoods that we thought were most at risk, and we'll see what the commission decides. But their plan would be to vote on a longer-term future for the Advanced Main Replacement Program by June. And again, I would say to you, given everything we've seen around the country, both from a natural gas and water standpoint, it's just not -- I don't think anyone thinks it's wise to ignore the urgent need to upgrade that system in Chicago. And then going backward, the Attorney General's office is asking, as they have, about an $8 billion cost estimate for the long-term investment need of the program. And that need, or that cost estimate, surfaced, as you know, after -- immediately after we acquired the company. And so the Attorney General's office is wondering who knew in the prior company, the prior management, about the $8 billion estimate and why was the $8 billion estimate, which was a preliminary estimate, why was that not disclosed prior to the closing of the acquisition. So that docket, if you will, is still open before the Illinois Commerce Commission."

But first of all, many companies in our industry were projecting far stronger growth than we have projected and they haven't seen it develop either. My own view, and this is strictly a personal view and anecdotal, but just based on years of experience, I think there are 3 things going on. And 2014 and 2015 may be a bit of an aberration from a small commercial and residential standpoint. '14 and '15, the weather was just, mild is probably the best word, mild summers, mild winters, just not -- no abnormally high or abnormally low temperatures, but no persistence of a weather trend. And one of the things that weather normalization techniques does not pick up is the lack of, say, 15 days of 90-degree weather. If you have 2 days of 90-degree weather, you can do the weather normalization, but I don't think it picks up the fact that you didn't have any persistent weather one way or another. And persistent weather drives consumption and drives usage. So I think one thing that has happened is we haven't seen a really good long heat wave. And even though last winter was a little bit colder than normal, it was spotty. It wasn't 15 days in a row of 10 degrees. So in my mind, the jury is still out related to longer-term growth, if we get back to a year in which we have some consistent and persistent weather patterns. That's number one. But number two, I don't think there's any question that we're seeing more residential conservation in the last couple of years. I don't think there's any question about that. And when you think about why that may be, I mean, it really comes down to technology. You've heard me say before that if you replace a big-screen television that you maybe bought 7 or 8 years ago with a brand new one, you're probably going to use 60% to 80% less electricity. Your iPad requires less energy to charge than your computer screen stand-alone. You buy a new washer and dryer, they're far more energy efficient, same thing with refrigerators. You have the Nest thermostats. There's just a lot more technology available to customers. So essentially, what we're kind of seeing here is our customer growth, which continues to be good, being offset by conservation."

Well, first of all, let me just reiterate that we are -- we have air monitors that continually give us data on emissions from the Oak Creek plant, and we are well within compliance with all the air standards, number one. Number two, there are a number of homes in the general vicinity of the Oak Creek plant where individuals have indicated they are having health problems and they believe it's because of the infiltration of coal dust in their homes. So what we've agreed to do and what we're in the process of right now is we have agreed with those homeowners on a testing protocol, and we are having a firm go into each one of these homes, and have samples collected from various places in the homes of these individuals and then we're having a lab analyze the dust samples and indicate to all of the homeowners -- we're sending them a letter explaining what is in their dust samples. Right now, what we're seeing would indicate that their health problems, at least from our expert's standpoint, nothing that would indicate that their health problems were any prevalence of coal dust."

And as Allen mentioned, there may be in the latter part of that 5-year period for bonus depreciation, there may be the emergence of transmission projects or generation projects for compliance with the Clean Power Plan. So all of those things are kind of preferred options, but if none of those things, or if not all of them, came to pass, we also have an option to further deleverage beyond the plan. So it really wasn't -- we didn't mean to give you the idea that this was going to be an immediate type of a preferred priority. It is something we have in the toolbox if needed."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the first quarter of the year. But before I do that, I want to introduce the members of our team who are here with me today. I'm pleased to welco",1223,"Thank you, Colleen. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the first quarter of the year. But before I do that, I want to introduce the members of our team who are here with me today. I'm pleased to welcome Scott Lauber as our new Chief Financial Officer. Many of you know Scott from his previous role as our Treasurer, but before that, he had a number of other roles in our accounting and finance organization. Now Scott is taking over from Pat Keyes. 
Pat is now responsible for our operations in Michigan and Minnesota as well as Supply Chain, Information Technology and Strategy for WEC Energy Group as a whole. 
I also welcome Jim as our new Treasurer. Like Scott, Jim has held numerous positions in our accounting and finance organization, and he was most recently responsible for our state regulatory area. 
Susan Martin, our General Counsel; Bill Guc, our Controller; and Beth Straka, who as Senior Vice President, leads our Corporate Communications and Investor Relations groups are also here with me.
So with that, let me now turn to our first quarter 2016 results. WEC Energy Group was formed in conjunction with the closing of our acquisition of Integrys in June of last year. Until now, we have focused our discussion on Legacy Wisconsin Energy stand-alone results. Starting today, our focus shifts to the entire company's results. 
We reported first quarter earnings of $1.09 a share. That compares with adjusted earnings of $0.90 a share in the first quarter of 2015. Scott will be reviewing the most significant drivers for the quarter with you in a moment.
Now taking a look at the state of the economy for our largest segment. Wisconsin's unemployment rate stands at 4.5%, which is well below the national average. The state's labor force participation rate also rose to 68.7%, which is more than 5 points above the national rate. 
Also worthy of note, Wisconsin led the nation in adding manufacturing jobs in March. 
Electricity used by a large commercial and industrial customers moderated a bit. Our electric utility's large customers, excluding the iron ore mines, consumed approximately 8/10 of a percent less electricity in the first quarter compared to 2015. However, we continue to see improvement in several important sectors of the state's economy, including plastics, food processing and paper production.
In addition, we are continuing to see customer growth across our system. At the end of March, our Wisconsin utilities were serving approximately 8,000 more electric customers and nearly 11,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year ago. 
Our natural gas utilities in Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota added nearly 16,000 customers in the past year. This increase includes the acquisition of approximately 10,000 natural gas customers in Minnesota from a lion energy in April of 2015.
We are achieving the results we expected from the Integrys acquisition. Our focus on cost controls and the tangible benefits from the acquisition have allowed us to freeze base rates for customers of We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service through 2017. Subject to Public Service Commission of Wisconsin action, which is not expected, we will not file 2017 test year base rate cases this year for our Wisconsin utilities.
As we have discussed on previous calls, our long-term goal is to grow earnings per share at a compound annual growth rate of 5% to 7% off a base of $2.72 per share in 2015. Key, of course, to delivering this growth is executing our capital investment plan and addressing the impact of bonus tax depreciation. I want to give you a brief update on where we stand with our capital plan.
Last December, Congress passed the tax bill that extends and modifies bonus depreciation for property placement service from 2015 to 2019. At this point, we estimate that we will receive approximately $1 billion in cash tax benefits from the bonus depreciation extension. About 2/3 of this benefit will occur this year and in 2017. Although we do not expect bonus depreciation to have any significant impact on earnings in 2016, we are taking steps to modify our capital plan to minimize any impacts in 2017 and following years. 
We have advanced the number of beneficial projects into 2016 and 2017. The estimated investment associated with these projects is $500 million, which includes the $100 million that we previously identified in the February call.
As a result, we now forecast our 2016 and 2017 capital budgets at $1.55 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. I expect that we will continue to identify projects that can be advanced into our current 5-year forecast.
We plan to provide a complete update to our 5-year capital forecast no later than the November EEI Financial Conference. 
Turning now to our operations in Illinois. We're moving forward on the Accelerated Main Replacement Program, or AMRP, at Peoples Gas, one of the largest natural gas infrastructure projects in the country. The program calls for replacement of approximately 2,000 miles of Chicago's aging natural gas infrastructure. 
Over the past 9 months, we've improved management and execution of the project, which is approximately 18% complete. We filed the plan with the Illinois Commerce Commission, or ICC, late last year that describes our top priorities for the next 3 years. The plants' key components include: removal and replacement of more than 250 mile of aging cast iron pipes in the neighborhood's most at risk, projected investment of $250 million to $280 million a year and regular updates to the ICC and other stakeholders to keep them informed of our progress.
While the engineering, fieldwork and cost recovery of AMRP continued, the ICC held 6 workshops to assess our plan. These recently concluded workshops brought together key stakeholders to review the plan, scope, schedule and long-term cost, with a focus on safety and reliability. We expect that the ICC staff will issue its report late in May and that the ICC will reach its conclusions by the end of the year. However, in the interim, the AMRP were -- will continue.
Next, a brief reminder on our dividend. On the 21 of January, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.495 a share, an increase of 8.2% over the previous quarterly dividend. Our annual dividend rate stands at $1.98 a share, and our yield is now at approximately the industry average.
We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings, and we expect our dividend growth to be in line with our earnings per share growth.
Before I ask Scott to review the details of our first quarter earnings, I want to cover one last item. I met with quite a number of investors and analysts and including many of you over the last few months after our management transition was announced. Quite often, I've been asked, ""Allen what will be different when you are CEO?"" Now it's really easier for me to tell a few what will be the same. Our company will continue to focus on the fundamentals, safety, customer satisfaction, reliability and financial discipline. I believe this focus has served us well since I joined the company in 2003 and will continue to do so.
So now for more details in our first quarter results, here's our Chief Financial Officer, Scott Lauber."

First quarter results in 2016 included the positive impact of the Integrys acquisition. Excluding $0.04 of acquisition co",1258,"Thank you, Allen. Our 2016 first quarter GAAP earnings were $1.09 a share compared with $0.86 a share in the first quarter of 2015. 
First quarter results in 2016 included the positive impact of the Integrys acquisition. Excluding $0.04 of acquisition cost in 2015, our adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.19 a share from $0.90 in the first quarter of 2015 to $1.09 a share in the first quarter of 2016.
The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes the results of the Integrys companies and as a full GAAP-to-adjusted reconciliation. 
First, I'll focus on operating income by segment and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes.
Our consolidated operating income for the first quarter was $589.3 million as compared to an adjusted $367.6 million in 2015, an increase of $221.7 million. 
Starting with Wisconsin, operating income in the first quarter totaled $327.5 million for 2016, an increase of $50 million from the adjusted first quarter of 2015.
On the favorable side, we realized $76.9 million contribution from Wisconsin Public Service. This was offset by lower operating income from Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas related to the mild winter temperatures. We estimate that electric and gas margins of these 2 utilities decreased by $29 million because of the warmer weather.
In the first quarter of 2016, our Illinois segment added $137 million of operating income and our other state segment added $31.8 million of operating income. We did not have operation in these segments until our acquisition of Integrys.
Operating income in the WE Power segment was up $800,000 when compared to 2015. This increase reflects additional investments that are part of our future plans. 
Our Corporate and Other segment showed an operating loss of $300,000 this quarter as compared to an adjusted operating loss of $2.4 million in the first quarter of 2015.
Taking the changes for these segments together, we arrived at the $221.7 million increase in operating income on an adjusted basis.
During the first quarter of 2016, earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled $38.5 million, an increase of $22.4 million from the same period last year. This increase is directly related to the increase in our ownership interest from about 26% to just over 60% as a result of the acquisition of Integrys.
Our other net income increased -- our other net increased $29.7 million, largely due to repurchase of a $155 million of Integrys, 6.11% junior subordinate notes at a discount in February 2016 as well as higher AFUDC due to the inclusion of the AFUDC from the Integrys companies.
Our net interest expense increased $41.5 million, driven by $34.8 million of interest expense from Integrys companies in 2016. In addition, we incurred about $8 million of interest expense related to the $1.5 billion of debt issued in June 2015 to complete the Integra's acquisition. 
Earnings from the Integra's company drove an increase in our consolidated income tax expense of $90.2 million. There were no significant changes in our effective income tax rate. We expect our annual effective tax rate for 2016 to be between 37.5% and 38.5%.
Combining all of these items brings us to $346.2 million of net income for the first quarter of 2016 or earnings of $1.09 per share.
Net cash provided by operating activities increased $365.9 million in the first quarter of 2016. This increase was driven by a $307.8 million of net cash flow from the operating activities of Integrys during the first quarter of 2016. The remaining difference was driven by a decrease in contributions to employee benefit plans, partially offset by changes in working capital. You may recall that we contributed $100 million for our qualified pension trust in 2015, and we did not make a contribution in 2016. 
Our capital expenditures totaled $312 million in the first  quarter, a $158.8 million increase compared to 2015. The largest increase was related to the Integrys companies.
Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 50.4% at the end of March. Our calculation to reach half of the hybrid securities as common equity, which is consistent with past presentation. We're using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.
We also paid $156.2 million in common dividends in the first quarter of 2016, an increase of $60.9 million over the first quarter last year. This is driven by the increase in shares with the Integrys acquisition and a 17.2% increase in the dividend rate compared to the first quarter in 2015. 
For comparative purposes, the electric sales information I'll discuss next reflects for both Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Public Service in the first quarter where the normalized sales are adjusted for the effects of weather and factoring out the effective leap year.
On a weather normalized basis, retail sales of electricity, excluding the iron ore mines, were down slightly by 2/10 of a percent compared to the first quarter of 2015. Actual first quarter deliveries fell by 1.6%.
Now looking at the individual customer segments. Weather normalized residential deliveries dropped 3/10 of a percent, while actual residential deliveries fell 4.2%. 
Across our small and commercial industrial group, weather normalized quarterly deliveries increased 1.5%. Actual deliveries decreased 2/10 of a percent. 
In the large Commercial and Industrial segment, deliveries for the first quarter of 2016 decreased 9/10 of a percent. Excluding the iron ore mines, large commercial industrial deliveries decreased 8/10 of a percent. 
Now an update on our natural gas deliveries. As you recall, our Illinois segment has a decoupling mechanism and our margins are less affected by weather. 
Looking at Wisconsin, our largest segment, first quarter weather normalized retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, decreased 1% compared to the same period in 2015. Actual gas deliveries, again excluding gas for power generation, were down 10.7% compared to gas sales in last year's first quarter due to warmer weather.
On a weather normalized basis, our overall results for gas and electric sales in the first quarter were slightly below our expectations.
Turning now to our earnings forecast. We are reaffirming our 2016 earnings guidance of $2.88 a share to $2.94 a share, which represents 6% to 8% growth. This projection assumes normal weather, and it excludes any potential remaining acquisition-related cost. We are off to a strong start, but still have 9 months of weather ahead of us. Again, we are reaffirming our 2016 earnings guidance of $2.88 a share to $2.94 a share.
Finally, let's look at the outlook for quarterly earnings for the remainder of the year. If we take a step back, we see new quarterly pattern to earnings per share. The Integrys acquisition brings a larger gas component to the combined company. This means we expect to see relatively higher earnings per share in the first and fourth quarter due to heating -- gas heating margins and relatively lower earnings per share in the second and third quarter when compared to past years. This brings us to our second quarter earnings per share guidance. 
Taking into account this new quarterly earnings pattern in April being a little than last year, we expect our second quarter 2016 per share -- earnings per share to be in the range of $0.51 to $0.55. That assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter and excludes any remaining acquisition-related cost. 
Again, the second quarter earnings guidance is $0.51 to $0.55 per share. 
With that, I will turn things back to Allen."

I think another significant driver, Scott, was related to fuel recoveries in Wisconsin where we had positive fuel recoveries in the first quarter. But our assumption for the year, Greg, would be that we would just be fully recovered. So I think given those 2 things, I would say that we're sort of more at the middle of our range as I look at it. We're sort of neutral against our financial plan. If you adjust for the items in the first quarter that either expect would reverse, in the case of the fuel recoveries, or iron ore included in the annual plan.

Now regardless of how whole low or how high. There's a benefit of the integrating those utilities because they're certainly not integrated that all at the level, which you would see in the continental United States. So there are big benefits with that regardless of the price of oil. And sort of, I guess, ironically, the low oil prices actually mean that their companies in Alaska might actually look a little more than ATC to provide the capital for the transmission projects. So I would say worst case, the oil price is sort of a neutral. And although it sounds a little strange, the lower prices might actually mean that margin really, ATC might be called on to make a bit more of the investment as required."

I mean, you're looking at programs that are ongoing for 20 to 25 years at least. So we've got some programs that we think will be around a lot longer, even longer than the power of the future. We've got others that are kind of shorter in nature, and we talk some about in the ERP project in Wisconsin. But I would say overall, to do well. I think we easily have our one way of 10 or more years of capital investment that we think will benefit customers. In the case of Chicago, make a huge upgrade in safety, so I would say it's at least 10 years. But now it's really multiple programs in multiple states as opposed to being a single program in one  in only in 1 state. I hope that helps."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the first quarter of the year.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the first quarter of the year. But before I do that, I want to introduce the members of our team who are here with me today. I'm pleased to welcome Scott Lauber as our new Chief Financial Officer. Many of you know Scott from his previous role as our Treasurer. But before that, he had a number of other roles in our accounting and finance organization. 
Now Scott is taking over from Pat Keyes, pat is now responsible for our operations in Michigan and Minnesota, as well as Supply Chain, Information Technology and Strategy for WEC Energy Group as a whole. 
I also welcome Jim Schubilske as our new Treasurer. Like Scott, Jim has held numerous positions in our accounting and finance organization, and he was most recently responsible for our state regulatory area. 
Susan Martin, our General Counsel; Bill Guc, our Controller; and Beth Straka, who as Senior Vice President, leads our Corporate Communications and Investor Relations groups, are also here with me.
So with that, let me now turn to our first quarter 2016 results. 
WEC Energy Group was formed in conjunction with the closing of our acquisition of Integrys in June of last year. Until now, we have focused our discussion on legacy Wisconsin Energy standalone results. Starting today, our focus shifts to the entire company's results. 
We reported first quarter earnings of $1.09 a share. That compares with adjusted earnings of $0.90 a share in the first quarter of 2015. Scott will be reviewing the most significant drivers for the quarter with you in a moment.
Now taking a look at the state of the economy for our largest segment, Wisconsin's unemployment rate stands at 4.5%, which is well below the national average. The state's labor force participation rate also rose to 68.7%, which is more than 5 points above the national rate.  
Also worthy of note, Wisconsin led the nation in adding manufacturing jobs in March. 
Electricity used by our large commercial and industrial customers moderated a bit. Our electric utility's large customers, excluding the iron ore mines, consumed approximately 8/10 of a percent less electricity in the first quarter compared to 2015. However, we continue to see improvement in several important sectors of the state's economy, including plastics, food processing and paper production.
In addition, we are continuing to see customer growth across our system. At the end of March, our Wisconsin utilities were serving approximately 8,000 more electric customers and nearly 11,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year ago.  Our natural gas utilities in Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota added nearly 16,000 customers in the past year. This increase includes the acquisition of approximately 10,000 natural gas customers in Minnesota from Alliant Energy in April of 2015.
We are achieving the results we expected from the Integrys acquisition. Our focus on cost controls and the tangible benefits from the acquisition have allowed us to freeze base rates for customers of We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service through 2017. Subject to Public Service Commission of Wisconsin action, which is not expected, we will not file 2017 test year base rate cases this year for our Wisconsin utilities.
As we have discussed on previous calls, our long-term goal is to grow earnings per share at a compound annual growth rate of 5% to 7% off a base of $2.72 per share in 2015. Key, of course, to delivering this growth is executing our capital investment plan and addressing the impact of bonus tax depreciation. I want to give you a brief update on where we stand with our capital plan.
Last December, Congress passed the tax bill that extends and modifies bonus depreciation for property placed in service from 2015 to 2019. At this point, we estimate that we will receive approximately $1 billion in cash tax benefits from the bonus depreciation extension. About 2/3 of this benefit will occur this year and in 2017. Although we do not expect bonus depreciation to have any significant impact on earnings in 2016, we are taking steps to modify our capital plan to minimize any impacts in 2017 and following years. 
We have advanced a number of beneficial projects into 2016 and 2017. The estimated investment associated with these projects is $500 million, which includes the $100 million that we previously identified in the February call.  As a result, we now forecast our 2016 and 2017 capital budgets at $1.55 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. I expect that we will continue to identify projects that can be advanced into our current 5-year forecast.  We plan to provide a complete update to our 5-year capital forecast no later than the November EEI Financial Conference. 
Turning now to our operations in Illinois. We're moving forward on the Accelerated Main Replacement Program, or AMRP, at Peoples Gas, one of the largest natural gas infrastructure projects in the country. The program calls for a replacement of approximately 2,000 miles of Chicago's aging natural gas infrastructure. 
Over the past 9 months, we've improved management and execution of the project, which is approximately 18% complete. We filed a plan with the Illinois Commerce Commission, or ICC, late last year that describes our top priorities for the next 3 years. The plant's key components include: Removal and replacement of more than 250 miles of aging cast iron pipes in the neighborhoods most at risk, projected investment of $250 million to $280 million a year and regular updates to the ICC and other stakeholders to keep them informed of our progress.
While the engineering, fieldwork and cost recovery of AMRP continued, the ICC held 6 workshops to assess our plan. These recently concluded workshops brought together key stakeholders to review the plan's scope, schedule and long-term cost, with a focus on safety and reliability. We expect that the ICC staff will issue its report late in May and that the ICC will reach its conclusions by the end of the year. However, in the interim, the AMRP will continue.
Next, a brief reminder on our dividend. On the 21st of January, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.495 a share, an increase of 8.2% over the previous quarterly dividend. Our annual dividend rate stands at $1.98 a share, and our yield is now at approximately the industry average.  We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings, and we expect our dividend growth to be in line with our earnings per share growth.
Before I ask Scott to review the details of our first quarter earnings, I want to cover one last item. I met with quite a number of investors and analysts and including many of you over the last few months after our management transition was announced. Quite often, I've been asked, ""Allen, what will be different when you were CEO?"" Now, it's really easier for me to tell all of you what will be the same. Our company will continue to focus on the fundamentals: Safety, customer satisfaction, reliability and financial discipline. I believe this focus has served us well since I joined the company in 2003 and will continue to do so.
So now, for more details on our first quarter results, here's our Chief Financial Officer, Scott Lauber."

Our 2016 first quarter GAAP earnings were $1.09 a share compared with $0.86 a share in the first quarter of 2015. First quarter results in 2016 included the positive impact of the Integrys acquisition. Excluding $0.04 of acquisition",1253,"Thank you, Allen. 
Our 2016 first quarter GAAP earnings were $1.09 a share compared with $0.86 a share in the first quarter of 2015. 
First quarter results in 2016 included the positive impact of the Integrys acquisition. Excluding $0.04 of acquisition cost in 2015, our adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.19 a share, from $0.90 in the first quarter of 2015 to $1.09 a share in the first quarter of 2016.  The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes the results of the Integrys companies and has a full GAAP-to-adjusted reconciliation. 
First, I'll focus on operating income by segment and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes.
Our consolidated operating income for the first quarter was $589.3 million as compared to an adjusted $367.6 million in 2015, an increase of $221.7 million. 
Starting with Wisconsin, operating income in the first quarter totaled $327.5 million for 2016, an increase of $50 million from the adjusted first quarter of 2015.  On the favorable side, we realized $76.9 million contribution from Wisconsin Public Service. This was offset by lower operating income from Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas related to the mild winter temperatures. We estimate that electric and gas margins of these 2 utilities decreased by $29 million because of the warmer weather.
In the first quarter of 2016, our Illinois segment added $137 million of operating income and our other state segment added $31.8 million of operating income. We did not have operation in these segments until our acquisition of Integrys.
Operating income in the We Power segment was up $800,000 when compared to 2015. This increase reflects additional investment at our Power the Future plants. 
Our corporate and other segment showed an operating loss of $300,000 this quarter as compared to an adjusted operating loss of $2.4 million in the first quarter of 2015.  Taking the changes for these segments together, we arrived at the $221.7 million increase in operating income on an adjusted basis.
During the first quarter of 2016, earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled $38.5 million, an increase of $22.4 million from the same period last year. This increase is directly related to the increase in our ownership interest from about 26% to just over 60% as a result of the acquisition of Integrys.
Our other net income increased -- our other net increased $29.7 million, largely due to repurchase of a $155 million of Integrys' 6.11% junior subordinate notes at a discount in February 2016, as well as higher AFUDC due to the inclusion of the AFUDC from the Integrys companies.
Our net interest expense increased $41.5 million, driven by $34.8 million of interest expense from Integrys companies in 2016. In addition, we incurred about $8 million of interest expense related to the $1.5 billion of debt issued in June 2015 to complete the Integrys acquisition. 
Earnings from the Integrys company drove an increase in our consolidated income tax expense of $90.2 million. There were no significant changes in our effective income tax rate. We expect our annual effective tax rate for 2016 to be between 37.5% and 38.5%.
Combining all of these items brings us to $346.2 million of net income for the first quarter of 2016 or earnings of $1.09 per share.
Net cash provided by operating activities increased $365.9 million in the first quarter of 2016. This increase was driven by $307.8 million of net cash flow from the operating activities of Integrys during the first quarter of 2016. The remaining difference was driven by a decrease in contributions to employee benefit plans, partially offset by changes in working capital. You may recall that we contributed $100 million for our qualified pension trust in 2015, and we did not make a contribution in 2016. 
Our capital expenditures totaled $312 million in the first  quarter, a $158.8 million increase compared to 2015. The largest increase was related to the Integrys companies.
Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 50.4% at the end of March, our calculation to reach half of the hybrid securities as common equity, which is consistent with past presentations. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.
We also paid $156.2 million in common dividends in the first quarter of 2016, an increase of $60.9 million over the first quarter last year. This is driven by the increase in shares with the Integrys acquisition and a 17.2% increase in the dividend rate compared to the first quarter in 2015. 
For comparative purposes, the electric sales information I'll discuss next reflects for both Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Public Service in the first quarter where the normalized sales are adjusted for the effects of weather and factoring out the effect of leap year.
On a weather-normalized basis, retail sales of electricity, excluding the iron ore mines, were down slightly by 2/10 of a percent compared to the first quarter of 2015. Actual first quarter deliveries fell by 1.6%.
Now looking at the individual customer segments. Weather normalized residential deliveries dropped 3/10 of a percent, while actual residential deliveries fell 4.2%.  Across our small and commercial industrial group, weather-normalized quarterly deliveries increased 1.5%. Actual deliveries decreased 2/10 of a percent. 
In the large commercial and industrial segment, deliveries for the first quarter of 2016 decreased 9/10 of a percent. Excluding the iron ore mines, large commercial/industrial deliveries decreased 8/10 of a percent. 
Now an update on our natural gas deliveries. As you recall, our Illinois segment has a decoupling mechanism and our margins are less affected by weather. 
Looking at Wisconsin, our largest segment, first quarter weather-normalized retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, decreased 1% compared to the same period in 2015. Actual gas deliveries, again, excluding gas for power generation, were down 10.7% compared to gas sales in last year's first quarter due to warmer weather.
On a weather-normalized basis, our overall results for gas and electric sales in the first quarter were slightly below our expectations.
Turning now to our earnings forecast. We are reaffirming our 2016 earnings guidance of $2.88 a share to $2.94 a share, which represents 6% to 8% growth. This projection assumes normal weather and excludes any potential remaining acquisition-related cost. We are off to a strong start, but still have 9 months of weather ahead of us. Again, we are reaffirming our 2016 earnings guidance of $2.88 a share to $2.94 a share.
Finally, let's look at the outlook for quarterly earnings for the remainder of the year. If we take a step back, we see new quarterly pattern to earnings per share. The Integrys acquisition brings a larger gas component to the combined company. This means we expect to see relatively higher earnings per share in the first and fourth quarter due to heating -- gas heating margins and relatively lower earnings per share in the second and third quarter when compared to past years. This brings us to our second quarter earnings per share guidance. 
Taking into account this new quarterly earnings pattern and April being a little cooler than last year, we expect our second quarter 2016 per share -- earnings per share to be in the range of $0.51 to $0.55. That assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter and excludes any remaining acquisition-related cost. 
Again, the second quarter earnings guidance is $0.51 to $0.55 per share. 
With that, I will turn things back to Allen."

And when Wisconsin Public Service went through their last rate case, so this was the rate case that was decided late last, let's see, late 2015 for '16 rates. So they included in rates, I believe, at a $275 million level the cost of the ReACT project. And so we expect that the final cost of that project will be in the range of $335 million to $345 million. So essentially, what they would allow us to do with this accounting order is to defer, in effect, the impacts of the return of and on for that additional investment above $275 million. So, Scott?"

There's a benefit of integrating those utilities because they're certainly not integrated that all at the level that you would see in the continental United States. So there are big benefits with that regardless of the price of oil. And sort of, I guess, ironically, the low oil prices actually mean that the companies in Alaska might actually look a little more to ATC to provide the capital for the transmission projects. So I would say, worst case, the oil prices are sort of a neutral.

So as you say, that's in the past. As we look at sort of what's coming up, we've got some programs like the AMRP program in Illinois, which we're probably looking at the decades long. I mean, you're looking at programs that are ongoing for 20 to 25 years at least. So we've got some programs that we think will be around a lot longer, even longer than Power the Future. We got others that were kind of shorter in nature. And we talk some about in the ERP project in Wisconsin. But I would say overall, Vedula, I mean, I think we easily have a runway of 10 or more years of capital investment that we think will benefit customers. In the case of Chicago, make a huge upgrade in safety. So I would say it's at least 10 years.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the first quarter of the year. But before I do that, I want to introduce the members of our team who are here with me today. I'm pleased to welcome Scott Lauber as our new Chief Financial Officer. Many of you know Scott from his previous role as our Treasurer. But before that, he had a number of other roles in our accounting and finance organization. 
Now Scott is taking over from Pat Keyes, Pat is now responsible for our operations in Michigan and Minnesota, as well as Supply Chain, Information Technology and Strategy for WEC Energy Group as a whole. 
I also welcome Jim Schubilske as our new Treasurer. Like Scott, Jim has held numerous positions in our accounting and finance organization, and he was most recently responsible for our state regulatory area. 
Susan Martin, our General Counsel; Bill Guc, our Controller; and Beth Straka, who as Senior Vice President, leads our Corporate Communications and Investor Relations groups, are also here with me.
So with that, let me now turn to our first quarter 2016 results. 
WEC Energy Group was formed in conjunction with the closing of our acquisition of Integrys in June of last year. Until now, we have focused our discussion on legacy Wisconsin Energy standalone results. Starting today, our focus shifts to the entire company's results. 
We reported first quarter earnings of $1.09 a share. That compares with adjusted earnings of $0.90 a share in the first quarter of 2015. Scott will be reviewing the most significant drivers for the quarter with you in a moment.
Now taking a look at the state of the economy for our largest segment, Wisconsin's unemployment rate stands at 4.5%, which is well below the national average. The state's labor force participation rate also rose to 68.7%, which is more than 5 points above the national rate.  
Also worthy of note, Wisconsin led the nation in adding manufacturing jobs in March. 
Electricity used by our large commercial and industrial customers moderated a bit. Our electric utility's large customers, excluding the iron ore mines, consumed approximately 8/10 of a percent less electricity in the first quarter compared to 2015. However, we continue to see improvement in several important sectors of the state's economy, including plastics, food processing and paper production.
In addition, we are continuing to see customer growth across our system. At the end of March, our Wisconsin utilities were serving approximately 8,000 more electric customers and nearly 11,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year ago.  Our natural gas utilities in Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota added nearly 16,000 customers in the past year. This increase includes the acquisition of approximately 10,000 natural gas customers in Minnesota from Alliant Energy in April of 2015.
We are achieving the results we expected from the Integrys acquisition. Our focus on cost controls and the tangible benefits from the acquisition have allowed us to freeze base rates for customers of We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service through 2017. Subject to Public Service Commission of Wisconsin action, which is not expected, we will not file 2017 test year base rate cases this year for our Wisconsin utilities.
As we have discussed on previous calls, our long-term goal is to grow earnings per share at a compound annual growth rate of 5% to 7% off a base of $2.72 per share in 2015. Key, of course, to delivering this growth is executing our capital investment plan and addressing the impact of bonus tax depreciation. I want to give you a brief update on where we stand with our capital plan.
Last December, Congress passed the tax bill that extends and modifies bonus depreciation for property placed in service from 2015 to 2019. At this point, we estimate that we will receive approximately $1 billion in cash tax benefits from the bonus depreciation extension. About 2/3 of this benefit will occur this year and in 2017. Although we do not expect bonus depreciation to have any significant impact on earnings in 2016, we are taking steps to modify our capital plan to minimize any impacts in 2017 and following years. 
We have advanced a number of beneficial projects into 2016 and 2017. The estimated investment associated with these projects is $500 million, which includes the $100 million that we previously identified in the February call.  As a result, we now forecast our 2016 and 2017 capital budgets at $1.55 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. I expect that we will continue to identify projects that can be advanced into our current 5-year forecast.  We plan to provide a complete update to our 5-year capital forecast no later than the November EEI Financial Conference. 
Turning now to our operations in Illinois. We're moving forward on the Accelerated Main Replacement Program, or AMRP, at Peoples Gas, one of the largest natural gas infrastructure projects in the country. The program calls for a replacement of approximately 2,000 miles of Chicago's aging natural gas infrastructure. 
Over the past 9 months, we've improved management and execution of the project, which is approximately 18% complete. We filed a plan with the Illinois Commerce Commission, or ICC, late last year that describes our top priorities for the next 3 years. The plan's key components include: Removal and replacement of more than 250 miles of aging cast iron pipes in the neighborhoods most at risk, projected investment of $250 million to $280 million a year and regular updates to the ICC and other stakeholders to keep them informed of our progress.
While the engineering, fieldwork and cost recovery of AMRP continued, the ICC held 6 workshops to assess our plan. These recently concluded workshops brought together key stakeholders to review the plan's scope, schedule and long-term cost, with a focus on safety and reliability. We expect that the ICC staff will issue its report late in May and that the ICC will reach its conclusions by the end of the year. However, in the interim, the AMRP work will continue.
Next, a brief reminder on our dividend. On the 21st of January, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.495 a share, an increase of 8.2% over the previous quarterly dividend. Our annual dividend rate stands at $1.98 a share, and our yield is now at approximately the industry average.  We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings, and we expect our dividend growth to be in line with our earnings per share growth.
Before I ask Scott to review the details of our first quarter earnings, I want to cover one last item. I met with quite a number of investors and analysts, including many of you, over the last few months after our management transition was announced. Quite often, I've been asked, ""Allen, what will be different when you were CEO?"" Now, it's really easier for me to tell all of you what will be the same. Our company will continue to focus on the fundamentals: Safety, customer satisfaction, reliability and financial discipline. I believe this focus has served us well since I joined the company in 2003 and will continue to do so.
So now, for more details on our first quarter results, here's our Chief Financial Officer, Scott Lauber."

Our 2016 first quarter GAAP earnings were $1.09 a share compared with $0.86 a share in the first quarter of 2015. First quarter results in 2016 included the positive impact of the Integrys acquisition. Excluding $0.04 of acquisition",1251,"Thank you, Allen. 
Our 2016 first quarter GAAP earnings were $1.09 a share compared with $0.86 a share in the first quarter of 2015. 
First quarter results in 2016 included the positive impact of the Integrys acquisition. Excluding $0.04 of acquisition cost in 2015, our adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.19 a share, from $0.90 in the first quarter of 2015 to $1.09 a share in the first quarter of 2016.  The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes the results of the Integrys companies and has a full GAAP-to-adjusted reconciliation. 
First, I'll focus on operating income by segment and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes.
Our consolidated operating income for the first quarter was $589.3 million as compared to an adjusted $367.6 million in 2015, an increase of $221.7 million. 
Starting with Wisconsin, operating income in the first quarter totaled $327.5 million for 2016, an increase of $50 million from the adjusted first quarter of 2015.  On the favorable side, we realized $76.9 million contribution from Wisconsin Public Service. This was offset by lower operating income from Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas related to the mild winter temperatures. We estimate that electric and gas margins of these 2 utilities decreased by $29 million because of the warmer weather.
In the first quarter of 2016, our Illinois segment added $137 million of operating income and our other state segment added $31.8 million of operating income. We did not have operation in these segments until our acquisition of Integrys.
Operating income in the We Power segment was up $800,000 when compared to 2015. This increase reflects additional investment at our Power the Future plants. 
Our corporate and other segment showed an operating loss of $300,000 this quarter as compared to an adjusted operating loss of $2.4 million in the first quarter of 2015.  Taking the changes for these segments together, we arrived at the $221.7 million increase in operating income on an adjusted basis.
During the first quarter of 2016, earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled $38.5 million, an increase of $22.4 million from the same period last year. This increase is directly related to the increase in our ownership interest from about 26% to just over 60% as a result of the acquisition of Integrys.
Our other net income increased -- our other net increased $29.7 million, largely due to repurchase of a $155 million of Integrys' 6.11% junior subordinate notes at a discount in February 2016, as well as higher AFUDC due to the inclusion of the AFUDC from the Integrys companies.
Our net interest expense increased $41.5 million, driven by $34.8 million of interest expense from Integrys companies in 2016. In addition, we incurred about $8 million of interest expense related to the $1.5 billion of debt issued in June 2015 to complete the Integrys acquisition. 
Earnings from the Integrys company drove an increase in our consolidated income tax expense of $90.2 million. There were no significant changes in our effective income tax rate. We expect our annual effective tax rate for 2016 to be between 37.5% and 38.5%.
Combining all of these items brings us to $346.2 million of net income for the first quarter of 2016 or earnings of $1.09 per share.
Net cash provided by operating activities increased $365.9 million in the first quarter of 2016. This increase was driven by $307.8 million of net cash flow from the operating activities of Integrys during the first quarter of 2016. The remaining difference was driven by a decrease in contributions to employee benefit plans, partially offset by changes in working capital. You may recall that we contributed $100 million for our qualified pension trust in 2015, and we did not make a contribution in 2016. 
Our capital expenditures totaled $312 million in the first  quarter, a $158.8 million increase compared to 2015. The largest increase was related to the Integrys companies.
Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 50.4% at the end of March, our calculation treats half of the hybrid securities as common equity, which is consistent with past presentations. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.
We also paid $156.2 million in common dividends in the first quarter of 2016, an increase of $60.9 million over the first quarter last year. This is driven by the increase in shares with the Integrys acquisition and a 17.2% increase in the dividend rate compared to the first quarter in 2015. 
For comparative purposes, the electric sales information I'll discuss next reflects for both Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Public Service in the first quarter. Weather normalized sales are adjusted for the effects of weather and factoring out the effect of leap year.
On a weather-normalized basis, retail sales of electricity, excluding the iron ore mines, were down slightly by 2/10 of a percent compared to the first quarter of 2015. Actual first quarter deliveries fell by 1.6%.
Now looking at the individual customer segments. Weather normalized residential deliveries dropped 3/10 of a percent, while actual residential deliveries fell 4.2%.  Across our small and commercial industrial group, weather-normalized quarterly deliveries increased 1.5%. Actual deliveries decreased 2/10 of a percent. 
In the large commercial and industrial segment, deliveries for the first quarter of 2016 decreased 9/10 of a percent. Excluding the iron ore mines, large commercial/industrial deliveries decreased 8/10 of a percent. 
Now an update on our natural gas deliveries. As you recall, our Illinois segment has a decoupling mechanism and our margins are less affected by weather. 
Looking at Wisconsin, our largest segment, first quarter weather-normalized retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, decreased 1% compared to the same period in 2015. Actual gas deliveries, again, excluding gas for power generation, were down 10.7% compared to gas sales in last year's first quarter due to warmer weather.
On a weather-normalized basis, our overall results for gas and electric sales in the first quarter were slightly below our expectations.
Turning now to our earnings forecast. We are reaffirming our 2016 earnings guidance of $2.88 a share to $2.94 a share, which represents 6% to 8% growth. This projection assumes normal weather and excludes any potential remaining acquisition-related cost. We are off to a strong start, but still have 9 months of weather ahead of us. Again, we are reaffirming our 2016 earnings guidance of $2.88 a share to $2.94 a share.
Finally, let's look at the outlook for quarterly earnings for the remainder of the year. If we take a step back, we see new quarterly pattern to earnings per share. The Integrys acquisition brings a larger gas component to the combined company. This means we expect to see relatively higher earnings per share in the first and fourth quarter due to heating -- gas heating margins and relatively lower earnings per share in the second and third quarter when compared to past years. This brings us to our second quarter earnings per share guidance. 
Taking into account this new quarterly earnings pattern and April being a little cooler than last year, we expect our second quarter 2016 per share -- earnings per share to be in the range of $0.51 to $0.55. That assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter and excludes any remaining acquisition-related cost. 
Again, the second quarter earnings guidance is $0.51 to $0.55 per share. 
With that, I will turn things back to Allen."

And then another area where we look at in Illinois, we have a large gas storage facility, underground storage in Illinois, and we're going to spend about $35 million over the next couple of years looking at safety reliability within that storage field. So basically, across the enterprise, found some good projects to bring out and move forward into this period."

I think another significant driver, Scott, was related to fuel recoveries in Wisconsin where we had positive fuel recoveries in the first quarter.

If you adjust for the items in the first quarter that either expect would reverse, in the case of the fuel recoveries, or I had already included in the annual plan, it was just an uncertainty about the timing."

Once again, Allen talked about the fuel, the positive recovery of fuel and some of that was in the Wisconsin Public Service area, too, compared to prior year. We also had rate cases that were implemented at our smaller gas utilities in Michigan and Minnesota. Both of those had rate increases just last year. So basically, getting the rate increases in, getting the cost control in  and getting on a path to get to the full return at all the utilities."

There's a benefit of integrating those utilities because they're certainly not integrated at all at the level that you would see in the continental United States. So there are big benefits with that regardless of the price of oil. And sort of, I guess, ironically, the low oil prices actually mean that the companies in Alaska might actually look a little more to ATC to provide the capital for the transmission projects. So I would say, worst case, the oil prices are sort of a neutral. And although it sounds a little strange, the lower prices might actually mean that marginally, ATC might be called on to make a bit more of the investment that's required."

I mean, you're looking at programs that are ongoing for 20 to 25 years at least. So we've got some programs that we think will be around a lot longer, even longer than Power the Future. We got others that were kind of shorter in nature. And we talk some about in the ERP project in Wisconsin. But I would say overall, Vedula, I mean, I think we easily have a runway of 10 or more years of capital investment that we think will benefit customers. In the case of Chicago, make a huge upgrade in safety. So I would say it's at least 10 years. But now, it's really multiple programs in multiple states as opposed to being a single program in one, in only in one state. I hope that helps."

Thank you all for joining us today as we review our results for the second quarter of the year. Now before I do that, I want to introduce the members of our team who are here with me today. Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim S",1070,"Thanks, Colleen. Thank you all for joining us today as we review our results for the second quarter of the year. Now before I do that, I want to introduce the members of our team who are here with me today. Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, our Treasurer; Susan Martin, our General Counsel; Bill Guc, who's our Controller; and finally, Beth Straka, who's our Senior Vice President our Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Now let's look at our second quarter 2016 results. The end of the second quarter marked the first anniversary of our Integrys acquisition which closed on June 29 last year. Consistent with the first quarter, we are now reporting results of the combined company. We reported second quarter earnings of $0.57 per share, that compares with adjusted earnings of $0.58 per share in the second quarter of 2015. Our adjusted earnings in both 2015 and 2016 included interest on the debt issued to purchase Integrys as well as the shares we issued in the transaction. Scott will review the most significant drivers for the quarter with you in a moment. The results of our integration efforts have exceeded our expectations. As I mentioned, last quarter, our focus on cost controls and other tangible benefits from the acquisition had allowed us to freeze base rates for customers of We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service through 2017. We submitted our standard annual electric fuel filings in Wisconsin on July 1 asking for a modest reduction at We Energies and a slight increase at Wisconsin Public Service. The only active rate case is at our Minnesota gas utility where interim rates are in place. Our long-term goal is to grow earnings per share at a compound annual growth rate of 5% to 7% off a base of $2.72 per share in 2015. Key to delivering this growth is the execution of our capital investment plan and addressing the impact of bonus tax depreciation. Now let me give you a brief update on where we stand with our capital plan. We believe that approximately $1 billion in cash tax benefits will be generated from the bonus depreciation extension. About 2/3 of this benefit will occur this year and in 2017. Although we do not expect bonus depreciation to have any significant impact on earnings this year, we are taking steps to modify our capital plan to minimize any impacts in 2017 as well as the following years. As you may recall from the first quarter call, we have advanced a number of beneficial projects into 2016 and 2017. The estimated investment associated with these projects is $500 million. In addition, we had made progress in the later years of our 5-year forecast. We now expect to extend our electric system modernization and reliability projects at Wisconsin Public Service. This should represent another  $100 million of capital investment in the 2019 and 2020 period. I would add that this is a popular program with customers at Wisconsin Public Service who are seeing significant benefits in the form of greatly reduced outages during storms. I expect that we will continue to identify projects that can be advanced into our current 5-year forecast. We plan to provide a complete update to our 5-year capital forecast no later than the November EEI finance conference. 
Turning now to our operations in Illinois. We're moving forward on the People's Gas system modernization program, formerly known as AMRP. This as one of the largest natural gas system infrastructure projects in the country. The program calls for a replacement of approximately 2,000 miles of Chicago's aging natural gas pipelines. Over the past year, we've improved management and execution of the project, which is approximately 19% complete and we continue to make good progress. We filed a plan with the Illinois Commerce Commission late last year that describes our top priorities in the 3-year period from 2016 to 2018. The plan calls for removing and replacing more than 250 miles of aging [indiscernible] pipes in neighborhoods most at risk. This will require investing a projected $250 million to $280 million a year. After hearing stakeholder recommendations on issues such as the program's emphasis on safety and reliability, scope, schedule, cost for cast and controls and plans for measuring and monitoring progress, the ICC staff conducted a policy section at April summarizing the 6 workshops and then provided a comprehensive report to the commission on May 31. Last week, the ICC issued an order to begin a proceeding to evaluate the matters covered in the ICC staff report. The first step in the preceding is expected to be completed within 30 days when we are required to provide the ICC with an updated plan for the gas system modernization program. We believe that the ICC will reach its conclusions by the end of the first quarter of 2017. In the interim, our work on the gas infrastructure replacement program will continue. Now I would like to briefly update you on 2 matters pending at the FERC. First, at the end of June, an administrative law judge issued its recommended ROEs for the second pending complaint. The recommendation was for 9.7% base ROE and ATC could add a 50 basis points adder for a total of 10.2% ROE. We have updated our reserve to reflect this. The second item pending at FERC is related to the system support resource payments for the Presque Isle power plant. In this case, another administrative law judge issued a recommendation requiring approximate $20 million reduction for the payments received for the period February 2014 through January 2015. We are currently evaluating the ALJ's recommendation. However, if the FERC adopts of the ALJ decision, I do not expect that this will result in a dollar per dollar reduction in income. A decision is not likely until next year. Next I want to give you a brief reminder on our dividend. On the 21st of January, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of of $0.395 per share, an increase of 8.2% over the previous quarterly dividend. Our annual dividend rate stands at $1.98 a share and our yield is approximately at the industry average. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings and we expect our dividend growth to be in line with earnings per share growth. So now for more details on our second quarter results, here's Scott."

Our 2016 second quarter GAAP earnings were $0.57 per share compared with $0.35 per share in the second quarter of 2015. Second quarter results in 2016 include the impact of the Integrys companies. Excluding $0.23 of acquisition cost in 2",1468,"Thank you, Allen. Our 2016 second quarter GAAP earnings were $0.57 per share compared with $0.35 per share in the second quarter of 2015. Second quarter results in 2016 include the impact of the Integrys companies. Excluding $0.23 of acquisition cost in 2015, our adjusted earnings per share decreased by $0.01 from $0.58 in the second quarter of 2015 to $0.57 per share in the second quarter of 2016. You may recall that we're reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.59 in the second quarter of last year. For purposes of comparing 2016 and 2015 second quarter earnings on a consistent basis, a calculation of adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2015 now include all interest related to the acquisition financing and all shares in conjunction with the acquisition -- issued in conjunction with the acquisition. As a result, the comparable adjusted earnings per share a value for 2015 is now $0.58 per share. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes the results of the Integrys Companies and has full GAAP to adjusted reconciliation. First our focus on operating income by segment and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. Referring to Page 11 of the earnings packet, our consolidated operating income for the second quarter was $332.1 million as compared to an adjusted $230.8 million in 2015, an increase of $101.3 million. Starting with the Wisconsin segment, operating income in the second quarter totaled $214.7 million for 2016, an increase of $74.3 million from the adjusted second quarter of 2015. We realized a $51.5 million contribution from Wisconsin Public Service and reported a $22.8 million increase, driven in part by higher quarter-over-quarter electricity demand at Wisconsin Electric as temperatures in the early summer of 2016 were warmer than normal. 
In the second quarter of 2016, our Illinois segment had $22.6 million of operating income and our other state segment added $2.3 million of operating income. We added these segments as part of our Integrys acquisition. Operating income in the We power segment was up $900,000 when compared to 2015. This increase reflects additional investment and are power the future plants. Our corporate and others segment realized operating loss of $1.6 million this quarter as compared to an adjusted operating loss of $2.8 million in the second quarter of 2015 due primarily to lower labor costs. 
Taking the changes for these segments together, we arrive at $101.3 million increase from adjusted operating income. 
Moving to other income. During the second quarter of 2016, earnings from our investment in American transmission company totaled $30.9 million, an increase of $16.6 million from the same period last year. This increase is directly related to the increase in our ownership interest from about 26% to just over 60% as a result of the Integrys acquisition. As Allen mentioned earlier, this was in part offset by an incremental reserve taken to reflect the most recent administrative law judge taken related to the FERC ROE reviews. Our other income net increased by $6.3 million, largely related to higher ASPs with inclusion of AFUDC from the Integrys companies. Our net interest expense increased $38.3 million, driven by $33.7 million of interest expense from the Integrys Companies in 2016. In addition, we incurred about $6 million quarter-over-quarter increase in interest expense on the $1.5 billion of debt issued in June 2015 to complete the Integrys acquisition. Earnings from the Integrys companies were primarily driver of the $38.3 million increase in our adjusted consolidated income tax expense. We anticipate that our annual effective tax rate for 2016 will be between 37.5% to 38.5%. Combining all of these items brings us to an adjusted items of $133.8 million or $0.58 per share for the second quarter of 2015 compared to $181.4 million or $0.57 per share for the second quarter of 2016. 
Now looking to our cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $507.6 million during the first 6 months of 2016. This increase was driven by $466.6 million of net cash flows from the activities of Integrys during the first half of 2016. The remaining increase was driven in part by a decrease in contributions to employee benefit plans. You may recall that we contributed $100 million to our qualified pension trust in 2015 and we did not make a contribution in 2016. This increase was partially offset by changes in working capital. While I'm on the subject of pensions, with the current interest rate environment, the potential exists for an approximate 100 basis point reduction in our discount rate to about 3.5%. On an enterprise-wide basis, we estimate that this would add approximately $35 million to pension expense in 2017. This also could impact the level of pension contributions that would be made next year. We currently are factoring this in our 2017 plan. Our capital expenditures totaled $618.7 million during the first 6 months of 2017, a $250.7 million increase compared to the same period in 2015. The largest increase was driven primarily by capital investors at the Integrys Companies. Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 50.1% at the end of June. Our calculation increased half of the hybrid securities common equity which is consistent with past presentations. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. We also paid $312.4 million in common dividends during the 6 months ended June 30, 2016, an increase of $121.9 million over the same period last year. This is driven by the increase in shares with the Integrys acquisition and a 17.2% increase in the dividend rate compared to the first half of 2015. We also see continued customer growth across our system. At the end of June, our Wisconsin utilities were serving nearly 9,000 more electric customers and nearly 14,000 more natural gas customers compared to 1 year ago. Our natural gas utilities in Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota are now serving nearly 15,000 more customers in the past year. For comparative purposes, the electric sales information I will discuss next reflects results for both Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Public Service. Weather-normalized sales are adjusted for the effects of weather and year-to-date results factor out the effects of leap year. On a weather-normalized basis, retail sales of electricity, excluding the iron ore mines, were up 1% compared to the second quarter of 2015. Actual second quarter deliveries increased 3%. Looking now at the individual customers segments. Weather-normalized residential deliveries increased 2.8% while actual residential deliveries rose 7.7%. Across our small commercial and industrial growth, weather normalized quarterly deliveries increased 7/10 to 1%, actual deliveries increased 2.2% in the large commercial industrial segment, deliveries for the second quarter of 2016 increased 8/10 of 1%. Excluding the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial deliveries increased 3x of 1%. We continue to see improvement in several important sectors instead of Wisconsin including plastics, food processing and chemical processing. Year-to-date normalized retail deliveries, excluding the iron ore minings, increased 4/10 to 1%. Now an update on our natural gas deliveries. As you recall, our Illinois segment has a decoupling mechanism and our margins are less affected by Raymond. Looking at Wisconsin, our largest segment year-to-date retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, decreased 3.9% compared to the same period in 2015 due to warmer weather. On a weather-normalized basis, year-to-date retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, were up 2.8%. Overall, our normalized results for gas and electric sales in 2016 were slightly above our expectations. Turning now to our earnings forecast. We are reaffirming our 2016 earnings guidance of $2.88 per share to $2.94 per share. This projection assumes normal weather and excludes any potential acquisition-related cost that may arise. We are off to a strong start. We still have 6 months of weather ahead of us. Again, we are reaffirming our 2016 earnings guidance of $2.88 per share to $2.94 per share. Finally, let's look at the third quarter guidance. As I mentioned, last quarter, natural gas distribution is now a larger portion of our business. Thus, we expect to see relatively higher earnings per share in the first and fourth quarters due to higher to gas heating margins and relatively lower earnings per share in the second and third quarter when compared to past years. Taking into account this new quarterly earnings pattern and warmer than normal July weather, we expect our third quarter 2016 earnings per share to be in the range of $0.55 to $0.59. That assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter and excludes any potential acquisition-related costs that may arise. Again, the third quarter earnings guidance is $0.55 to $0.59 per share. With that, I'll turn things back to Allen"

And so the bonus depreciation extension, which was really a reach back to 2015 as well as an extension how to, I guess, 2019, we think results in about $1 billion worth of cash tax benefits. So back on the February and the May calls, we gave an update to everybody on where we stood versus offsetting that billion dollars. So as we got to the end of the May call, we had identified $500 million. And those were primarily this year and next. So about $500 million bettween 2016 and 2017. And so now what we've identified is another $100 million in addition to that $500 million. So the $100 million is in the years 2019 and 2020. It's about $50 million a year, Greg. And what this relates to is really the continuation of a program, of a 4 year program that they've had at Wisconsin Public Service. The first phase involve distribution automation as well as underground of electric distribution. The second phase will be strictly devoted we expect to the underground of electric distribution.

Thank you all for joining us today as we review our results for the second quarter of the year.

Now let's look at our second quarter 2016 results. The end of the second quarter marked the first anniversary of our Integrys acquisition, which closed on June 29 last year. Consistent with the first quarter, we are now reporting results of the combined company. We reported second quarter earnings of $0.57 per share. That compares with adjusted earnings of $0.58 per share in the second quarter of 2015.
Our adjusted earnings in both 2015 and 2016 include interest on the debt issued to purchase Integrys as well as the shares we issued in the transaction. Scott will review the most significant drivers for the quarter with you in a moment.
The results of our integration efforts have exceeded our expectations. As I mentioned last quarter, our focus on cost controls and other tangible benefits from the acquisition have allowed us to freeze base rates for customers of We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service through 2017. We submitted our standard annual electric fuel filings in Wisconsin on July 1, asking for a modest reduction at We Energies and a slight increase at Wisconsin Public Service. The only active rate case is at our Minnesota gas utility, where interim rates are in place.
Our long-term goal is to grow earnings per share at a compound annual growth rate of 5% to 7% off a base of $2.72 per share in 2015. Key to delivering this growth is the execution of our capital investment plan and addressing the impact of bonus tax depreciation.
Now let me give you a brief update on where we stand with our capital plan. We believe that approximately $1 billion in cash tax benefits will be generated from the bonus depreciation extension. About 2/3 of this benefit will occur this year and in 2017. Although we do not expect bonus depreciation to have any significant impact on earnings this year, we are taking steps to modify our capital plan to minimize any impacts in 2017 as well as in following years.
As you may recall from the first quarter call, we've advanced a number of beneficial projects into 2016 and 2017. The estimated investment associated with these projects is $500 million. In addition, we have made progress in the later years of our 5-year forecast.
We now expect to extend our electric system modernization and reliability project at Wisconsin Public Service. This should represent another $100 million of capital investment in the 2019 and 2020 period. I would add that this is a popular program with customers at Wisconsin Public Service, who are seeing significant benefits in the form of greatly reduced outages during storms. I expect that we will continue to identify projects that can be advanced into our current 5-year forecast. We plan to provide a complete update to our 5-year capital forecast no later than the November EEI finance conference.
Turning now to our operations in Illinois. We're moving forward on the Peoples Gas system modernization program, formerly known as AMRP. This is one of the largest natural gas system infrastructure projects in the country. The program calls for a replacement of approximately 2,000 miles of Chicago's aging natural gas pipelines. Over the past year, we've improved management and execution of the project, which is approximately 19% complete and we continue to make good progress.
We filed a plan with the Illinois Commerce Commission late last year that describes our top priorities in the 3-year period from 2016 to 2018. The plan calls for removing and replacing more than 250 miles of aging cast iron pipes in neighborhoods most at risk. This will require investing a projected $250 million to $280 million a year.
After hearing stakeholder recommendations on issues such as the program's emphasis on safety and reliability, scope, schedule, cost forecast and controls and plans for measuring and monitoring progress, the ICC staff conducted a policy session in April summarizing the 6 workshops and then provided a comprehensive report to the commission on May 31. Last week, the ICC issued an order to begin a proceeding to evaluate the matters covered in the ICC staff report. The first step in the proceeding is expected to be completed within 30 days, when we are required to provide the ICC with an updated plan for the gas system modernization program. We believe that the ICC will reach its conclusions by the end of the first quarter of 2017. In the interim, our work on the gas infrastructure replacement program will continue.
Now I would like to briefly update you on 2 matters pending at the FERC. First, at the end of June, an administrative law judge issued its recommended ROEs for the second pending complaint. The recommendation was for a 9.7% base ROE and ATC could add a 50 basis point adder for a total of 10.2% ROE. We have updated our reserve to reflect this.
The second item pending at FERC is related to the system support resource payments for the Presque Isle Power Plant. In this case, another administrative law judge issued a recommendation requiring an approximate $20 million reduction to the payments we received for the period February 2014 through January 2015. We are currently evaluating the ALJ's recommendation. However, if the FERC adopts of the ALJ decision, I do not expect that this will result in a dollar for dollar reduction in income. A decision is not likely until next year.
Next, I want to give you a brief reminder on our dividend. On the 21st of January, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.495 per share, an increase of 8.2% over the previous quarterly dividend. Our annual dividend rate stands at $1.98 a share, and our yield is approximately at the industry average. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings, and we expect our dividend growth to be in line with our earnings per share growth.
So now for more details on our second quarter results, here's Scott."

Our 2016 second quarter GAAP earnings were $0.57 per share compared with $0.35 per share in the second quarter of 2015. Second quarter results in 2016 include the impact of the Integrys companies. Excluding $0.23 of acquisition cost in 2",1470,"Thank you, Allen. Our 2016 second quarter GAAP earnings were $0.57 per share compared with $0.35 per share in the second quarter of 2015. Second quarter results in 2016 include the impact of the Integrys companies. Excluding $0.23 of acquisition cost in 2015, our adjusted earnings per share decreased by $0.01 from $0.58 in the second quarter of 2015 to $0.57 per share in the second quarter of 2016. You may recall that we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.59 in the second quarter last year.
For purposes of comparing 2016 and 2015 second quarter earnings on a consistent basis, a calculations of adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2015 now include all interest related to the acquisition financing and all shares in conjunction with the acquisition -- issued in conjunction with the acquisition. As a result, the comparable adjusted earnings per share value for 2015 is now $0.58 per share. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes the results of the Integrys companies and has full GAAP to adjusted reconciliation.
First, I'll focus on operating income by segment and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. Referring to Page 11 of the earnings packet, our consolidated operating income for the second quarter was $332.1 million as compared to an adjusted $230.8 million in 2015, an increase of $101.3 million.
Starting with the Wisconsin segment, operating income in the second quarter totaled $214.7 million for 2016, an increase of $74.3 million from the adjusted second quarter of 2015. We realized a $51.5 million contribution from Wisconsin Public Service and reported a $22.8 million increase, driven in part by higher quarter-over-quarter electricity demand at Wisconsin Electric, as temperatures in the early summer of 2016 were warmer than normal.
In the second quarter of 2016, our Illinois segment had $22.6 million of operating income and our other state segment added $2.3 million of operating income. We added these segments as part of our Integrys acquisition. Operating income in the We Power segment was up $900,000 when compared to 2015. This increase reflects additional investment at our Power the Future plants.
Our corporate and others segment realized an operating loss of $1.6 million this quarter as compared to an adjusted operating loss of $2.8 million in the second quarter of 2015 due primarily to lower labor cost. Taking the changes for these segments together, we arrive at a $101.3 million increase from adjusted operating income.
Moving to other income. During the second quarter of 2016, earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled $30.9 million, an increase of $16.6 million from the same period last year. This increase is directly related to the increase in our ownership interest from about 26% to just over 60% as a result of the Integrys acquisition. As Allen mentioned earlier, this was in part offset by an incremental reserve taken to reflect the most recent administrative law judge recommendation related to the FERC ROE reviews.
Our other income net increased by $6.3 million, largely related to higher AFUDC due to inclusion of AFUDC from the Integrys companies.
Our net interest expense increased $38.3 million, driven by $33.7 million of interest expense from the Integrys companies in 2016. In addition, we incurred about $6 million quarter-over-quarter increase in interest expense on the $1.5 billion of debt issued in June 2015 to complete the Integrys acquisition.
Earnings from the Integrys companies were primarily driver of the $38.3 million increase in our adjusted consolidated income tax expense. We anticipate that our annual effective tax rate for 2016 will be between 37.5% to 38.5%. Combining all these items brings us to an adjusted earnings of $133.8 million or $0.58 per share for the second quarter of 2015 compared to $181.4 million or $0.57 per share for the second quarter of 2016.
Now looking to our cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $507.6 million during the first 6 months of 2016. This increase was driven by $466.6 million of net cash flows from the operating activities of Integrys during the first half of 2016. The remaining increase was driven in part by a decrease in contributions to employee benefit plans.
You may recall that we contributed $100 million to our qualified pension trust in 2015, and we did not make a contribution in 2016. This increase was partially offset by changes in working capital.
While I'm on the subject of pensions, with the current interest rate environment, the potential exists for an approximate 100 basis point reduction in our discount rate to about 3.5%. On an enterprise-wide basis, we estimate that this would add approximately $35 million to pension expense in 2017. This also could impact the level of pension contributions that would be made next year. We currently are factoring this into our 2017 plan.
Our capital expenditures totaled $618.7 million during the first 6 months of 2017, a $250.7 million increase compared to the same period in 2015. The largest increase was driven primarily by capital investors at the Integrys companies.
Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 50.1% at the end of June. Our calculation treats half of the hybrid securities as common equity, which is consistent with past presentations. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.
We also paid $312.4 million in common dividends during the 6 months ended June 30, 2016, an increase of $121.9 million over the same period last year. This is driven by the increase in shares with the Integrys acquisition and a 17.2% increase in the dividend rate compared to the first half of 2015.
We also see continued customer growth across our system. At the end of June, our Wisconsin utilities were serving nearly 9,000 more electric customers and nearly 14,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year ago. Our natural gas utilities in Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota are now serving nearly 15,000 more customers in the past year.
For comparative purposes, the electric sales information, I will discuss next, reflects results for both Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Public Service. Weather-normalized sales are adjusted for the effects of weather and year-to-date results factor out the effects of leap year. On a weather-normalized basis, retail sales of electricity, excluding the iron ore mines, were up 1% compared to the second quarter of 2015. Actual second quarter deliveries increased 3%.
Looking now at the individual customers segments. Weather-normalized residential deliveries increased 2.8%, while actual residential deliveries rose 7.7%. Across our small commercial and industrial group, weather-normalized quarterly deliveries increased 7/10 of 1%, actual deliveries increased 2.2%.
In the large commercial and industrial segment, deliveries for the second quarter of 2016 increased 8/10 of 1%. Excluding the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial deliveries increased 3/10 of 1%. We continue to see improvement in several important sectors of the state's economy, including plastics, food processing and chemical processing. Year-to-date normalized retail deliveries, excluding the iron ore minings, increased 4/10 of 1%.
Now an update on our natural gas deliveries. As you recall, our Illinois segment has a decoupling mechanism and our margins are less affected by weather.
Looking at Wisconsin, our largest segment year-to-date retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, decreased 3.9% compared to the same period in 2015 due to warmer weather. On a weather-normalized basis, year-to-date retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, were up 2.8%. Overall, our normalized results for gas and electric sales in 2016 were slightly above our expectations.
Turning now to our earnings forecast. We are reaffirming our 2016 earnings guidance of $2.88 per share to $2.94 per share. This projection assumes normal weather and excludes any potential acquisition-related cost that may arise. We are off to a strong start. We still have 6 months of weather ahead of us. Again, we are reaffirming our 2016 earnings guidance of $2.88 per share to $2.94 per share.
Finally, let's look at the third quarter guidance. As I mentioned, last quarter, natural gas distribution is now a larger portion of our business. Thus, we expect to see relatively higher earnings per share in the first and fourth quarters due to higher -- to gas heating margins and relatively lower earnings per share in the second and third quarter when compared to past years.
Taking into account this new quarterly earnings pattern and warmer-than-normal July weather, we expect our third quarter 2016 earnings per share to be in the range of $0.55 to $0.59. That assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter and excludes any potential acquisition-related cost that may arise. Again, the third quarter earnings guidance is $0.55 to $0.59 per share.
With that, I'll turn things back to Allen."

And so the bonus depreciation extension, which was really a reach back to 2015 as well as an extension out to, I guess, 2019, we think results in about $1 billion worth of cash tax benefits. So back on the February and the May calls, we gave an update to everybody on where we stood versus offsetting that $1 billion. So as we got to the end of the May call, we had identified $500 million. And those were primarily this year and next. So about $500 million between 2016 and 2017. And so now what we've identified is another $100 million in addition to that $500 million. So the $100 million is in the years 2019 and 2020. It's about $50 million a year, Greg. And what this relates to is really the continuation of a program -- of a 4-year program that they've had at Wisconsin Public Service. The first phase involve distribution automation as well as underground of electric distribution. The second phase will be strictly devoted, we expect, to the undergrounding of electric distribution. So about $50 million in 2019, $50 million in 2020. And we also believe out in 2021 and 2022, there is yet another $50 million a year to do in those 2 years. And this program, it's been very, very popular with customers. It was kind of interesting. This summer we've had quite a bit of storm activity in the Wisconsin Public Service territory. And for those that had their service, distribution lines underground, and they saw much less in terms of outage time. So it's been a very popular program. I hope that helps, Greg."

And I think, well, first off on the storage, we are having conversations with 2 parties who are owners of storage, and we'll see what we can work out with one of those. But we are having active conversations with 2 parties. So let me just sort of put a line under that. And then looking forward, I guess, our view would be on midstream -- at least our view is that we would only be interested in these other natural gas assets. And I'll just call them -- I don't know whether to call them midstream or what to call them, Julien, but it's certainly upstream of the local gas distribution companies. Our only interest at this point would be in gas storage and it would be gas storage that we could, in effect, directly integrate with our local distribution company and place in rate base. So at this point, that's as far upstream as we're thinking. It's something that would be very much of another regulated asset play."

Thank you all for joining us today as we review our results for the second quarter of the year. Now before I do that, I want to introduce the members of our team who are with me here today: Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, our Treasurer; Susan Martin, our General Counsel; Bill Guc, who's our Controller; and finally, Beth Straka, who's our Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.
Now let's look at our second quarter 2016 results. The end of the second quarter marked the first anniversary of our Integrys acquisition, which closed on June 29 last year. Consistent with the first quarter, we are now reporting results of the combined company. We reported second quarter earnings of $0.57 per share. That compares with adjusted earnings of $0.58 per share in the second quarter of 2015.
Our adjusted earnings in both 2015 and 2016 include interest on the debt issued to purchase Integrys as well as the shares we issued in the transaction. Scott will review the most significant drivers for the quarter with you in a moment.
The results of our integration efforts have exceeded our expectations. As I mentioned last quarter, our focus on cost controls and other tangible benefits from the acquisition have allowed us to freeze base rates for customers of We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service through 2017. We submitted our standard annual electric fuel filings in Wisconsin on July 1, asking for a modest reduction at We Energies and a slight increase at Wisconsin Public Service. The only active rate case is at our Minnesota gas utility, where interim rates are in place.
Our long-term goal is to grow earnings per share at a compound annual growth rate of 5% to 7% off a base of $2.72 per share in 2015. Key to delivering this growth is the execution of our capital investment plan and addressing the impact of bonus tax depreciation.
Now let me give you a brief update on where we stand with our capital plan. We believe that approximately $1 billion in cash tax benefits will be generated from the bonus depreciation extension. About 2/3 of this benefit will occur this year and in 2017. Although we do not expect bonus depreciation to have any significant impact on earnings this year, we are taking steps to modify our capital plan to minimize any impacts in 2017 as well as in following years.
As you may recall from the first quarter call, we've advanced a number of beneficial projects into 2016 and 2017. The estimated investment associated with these projects is $500 million. In addition, we have made progress in the later years of our 5-year forecast.
We now expect to extend our electric system modernization and reliability project at Wisconsin Public Service. This should represent another $100 million of capital investment in the 2019 and 2020 period. I would add that this is a popular program with customers at Wisconsin Public Service, who are seeing significant benefits in the form of greatly reduced outages during storms. I expect that we will continue to identify projects that can be advanced into our current 5-year forecast. We plan to provide a complete update to our 5-year capital forecast no later than the November EEI finance conference.
Turning now to our operations in Illinois. We're moving forward on the Peoples Gas system modernization program, formerly known as AMRP. This is one of the largest natural gas system infrastructure projects in the country. The program calls for a replacement of approximately 2,000 miles of Chicago's aging natural gas pipelines. Over the past year, we've improved management and execution of the project, which is approximately 19% complete, and we continue to make good progress.
We filed a plan with the Illinois Commerce Commission late last year that describes our top priorities in the 3-year period from 2016 to 2018. The plan calls for removing and replacing more than 250 miles of aging cast iron pipes in neighborhoods most at risk. This will require investing a projected $250 million to $280 million a year.
After hearing stakeholder recommendations on issues such as the program's emphasis on safety and reliability, scope, schedule, cost forecast and controls and plans for measuring and monitoring progress, the ICC staff conducted a policy session in April summarizing the 6 workshops and then provided a comprehensive report to the commission on May 31. Last week, the ICC issued an order to begin a proceeding to evaluate the matters covered in the ICC staff report. The first step in the proceeding is expected to be completed within 30 days, when we are required to provide the ICC with an updated plan for the gas system modernization program. We believe that the ICC will reach its conclusions by the end of the first quarter of 2017. In the interim, our work on the gas infrastructure replacement program will continue.
Now I would like to briefly update you on 2 matters pending at the FERC. First, at the end of June, an administrative law judge issued its recommended ROEs for the second pending complaint. The recommendation was for a 9.7% base ROE and ATC could add a 50 basis point adder for a total of 10.2% ROE. We have updated our reserve to reflect this.
The second item pending at FERC is related to the system support resource payments for the Presque Isle Power Plant. In this case, another administrative law judge issued a recommendation requiring an approximate $20 million reduction to the payments we received for the period February 2014 through January 2015. We are currently evaluating the ALJ's recommendation. However, if the FERC adopts the ALJ decision, I do not expect that this will result in a dollar for dollar reduction in income. A decision is not likely until next year.
Next, I want to give you a brief reminder on our dividend. On the 21st of January, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.495 per share, an increase of 8.2% over the previous quarterly dividend. Our annual dividend rate stands at $1.98 a share, and our yield is approximately at the industry average. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings, and we expect our dividend growth to be in line with our earnings per share growth.
So now for more details on our second quarter results, here's Scott."

Our 2016 second quarter GAAP earnings were $0.57 per share compared with $0.35 per share in the second quarter of 2015. Second quarter results in 2016 include the impact of the Integrys companies. Excluding $0.23 of acquisition cost in 2",1467,"Thank you, Allen. Our 2016 second quarter GAAP earnings were $0.57 per share compared with $0.35 per share in the second quarter of 2015. Second quarter results in 2016 include the impact of the Integrys companies. Excluding $0.23 of acquisition cost in 2015, our adjusted earnings per share decreased by $0.01 from $0.58 in the second quarter of 2015 to $0.57 per share in the second quarter of 2016. You may recall that we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.59 in the second quarter last year.
For purposes of comparing 2016 and 2015 second quarter earnings on a consistent basis, a calculations of adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2015 now include all interest related to the acquisition financing and all shares in conjunction with the acquisition -- issued in conjunction with the acquisition. As a result, the comparable adjusted earnings per share value for 2015 is now $0.58 per share. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes the results of the Integrys companies and has full GAAP to adjusted reconciliation.
First, I'll focus on operating income by segment and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. Referring to Page 11 of the earnings packet, our consolidated operating income for the second quarter was $332.1 million as compared to an adjusted $230.8 million in 2015, an increase of $101.3 million.
Starting with the Wisconsin segment, operating income in the second quarter totaled $214.7 million for 2016, an increase of $74.3 million from the adjusted second quarter of 2015. We realized a $51.5 million contribution from Wisconsin Public Service and reported a $22.8 million increase, driven in part by higher quarter-over-quarter electricity demand at Wisconsin Electric, as temperatures in the early summer of 2016 were warmer than normal.
In the second quarter of 2016, our Illinois segment had $22.6 million of operating income and our other state segment added $2.3 million of operating income. We added these segments as part of our Integrys acquisition. Operating income in the We Power segment was up $900,000 when compared to 2015. This increase reflects additional investment at our Power the Future plants.
Our corporate and others segment realized an operating loss of $1.6 million this quarter as compared to an adjusted operating loss of $2.8 million in the second quarter of 2015 due primarily to lower labor cost. Taking the changes for these segments together, we arrive at a $101.3 million increase from adjusted operating income.
Moving to other income. During the second quarter of 2016, earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled $30.9 million, an increase of $16.6 million from the same period last year. This increase is directly related to the increase in our ownership interest from about 26% to just over 60% as a result of the Integrys acquisition. As Allen mentioned earlier, this was in part offset by an incremental reserve taken to reflect the most recent administrative law judge recommendation related to the FERC ROE reviews.
Our other income net increased by $6.3 million, largely related to higher AFUDC due to inclusion of AFUDC from the Integrys companies.
Our net interest expense increased $38.3 million, driven by $33.7 million of interest expense from the Integrys companies in 2016. In addition, we incurred about $6 million quarter-over-quarter increase in interest expense on the $1.5 billion of debt issued in June 2015 to complete the Integrys acquisition.
Earnings from the Integrys companies were primarily driver of the $38.3 million increase in our adjusted consolidated income tax expense. We anticipate that our annual effective tax rate for 2016 will be between 37.5% to 38.5%. Combining all these items brings us to an adjusted earnings of $133.8 million or $0.58 per share for the second quarter of 2015 compared to $181.4 million or $0.57 per share for the second quarter of 2016.
Now looking to our cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $507.6 million during the first 6 months of 2016. This increase was driven by $466.6 million of net cash flows from the operating activities of Integrys during the first half of 2016. The remaining increase was driven in part by a decrease in contributions to employee benefit plans.
You may recall that we contributed $100 million to our qualified pension trust in 2015, and we did not make a contribution in 2016. This increase was partially offset by changes in working capital.
While I'm on the subject of pensions, with the current interest rate environment, the potential exists for an approximate 100 basis point reduction in our discount rate to about 3.5%. On an enterprise-wide basis, we estimate that this would add approximately $35 million to pension expense in 2017. This also could impact the level of pension contributions that would be made next year. We currently are factoring this into our 2017 plan.
Our capital expenditures totaled $618.7 million during the first 6 months of 2017 (sic) [ 2016 ], a $250.7 million increase compared to the same period in 2015. The largest increase was driven primarily by capital investors at the Integrys companies.
Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 50.1% at the end of June. Our calculation treats half of the hybrid securities as common equity, which is consistent with past presentations. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.
We also paid $312.4 million in common dividends during the 6 months ended June 30, 2016, an increase of $121.9 million over the same period last year. This is driven by the increase in shares with the Integrys acquisition and a 17.2% increase in the dividend rate compared to the first half of 2015.
We also see continued customer growth across our system. At the end of June, our Wisconsin utilities were serving nearly 9,000 more electric customers and nearly 14,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year ago. Our natural gas utilities in Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota are now serving nearly 15,000 more customers in the past year.
For comparative purposes, the electric sales information I will discuss next reflects results for both Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Public Service. Weather-normalized sales are adjusted for the effects of weather and year-to-date results factor out the effects of leap year. On a weather-normalized basis, retail sales of electricity, excluding the iron ore mines, were up 1% compared to the second quarter of 2015. Actual second quarter deliveries increased 3%.
Looking now at the individual customers segments. Weather-normalized residential deliveries increased 2.8%, while actual residential deliveries rose 7.7%. Across our small commercial and industrial group, weather-normalized quarterly deliveries increased 0.7% and actual deliveries increased 2.2%.
In the large commercial and industrial segment, deliveries for the second quarter of 2016 increased 0.8%. Excluding the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial deliveries increased 0.3%. We continue to see improvement in several important sectors of the state's economy, including plastics, food processing and chemical processing. Year-to-date normalized retail deliveries, excluding the iron ore mines, increased 0.4%.
Now an update on our natural gas deliveries. As you recall, our Illinois segment has a decoupling mechanism and our margins are less affected by weather.
Looking at Wisconsin, our largest segment year-to-date, retail gas deliveries excluding gas used for power generation decreased 3.9% compared to the same period in 2015 due to warmer weather. On a weather-normalized basis, year-to-date retail gas deliveries excluding gas used for power generation were up 2.8%. Overall, our normalized results for gas and electric sales in 2016 were slightly above our expectations.
Turning now to our earnings forecast. We are reaffirming our 2016 earnings guidance of $2.88 per share to $2.94 per share. This projection assumes normal weather and excludes any potential acquisition-related cost that may arise. We are off to a strong start. We still have 6 months of weather ahead of us. Again, we are reaffirming our 2016 earnings guidance of $2.88 per share to $2.94 per share.
Finally, let's look at the third quarter guidance. As I mentioned last quarter, natural gas distribution is now a larger portion of our business. Thus, we expect to see relatively higher earnings per share in the first and fourth quarters due to higher -- to gas heating margins and relatively lower earnings per share in the second and third quarter when compared to past years.
Taking into account this new quarterly earnings pattern and warmer-than-normal July weather, we expect our third quarter 2016 earnings per share to be in the range of $0.55 to $0.59. That assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter and excludes any potential acquisition-related cost that may arise. Again, the third quarter earnings guidance is $0.55 to $0.59 per share.
With that, I'll turn things back to Allen."

And so the bonus depreciation extension, which was really a reach-back to 2015 as well as an extension out to, I guess, 2019, we think results in about $1 billion worth of cash tax benefits. So back on the February and the May calls, we gave an update to everybody on where we stood versus offsetting that $1 billion. So as we got to the end of the May call, we had identified $500 million. And those were primarily this year and next. So about $500 million between 2016 and 2017. And so now what we've identified is another $100 million in addition to that $500 million. So the $100 million is in the years 2019 and 2020. So about $50 million a year, Greg. And what this relates to is really the continuation of a program -- of a 4-year program that they've had at Wisconsin Public Service. The first phase involved distribution automation as well as undergrounding of electric distribution. The second phase will be strictly devoted, we expect, to the undergrounding of electric distribution. So about $50 million in 2019, $50 million in 2020. And we also believe out in 2021 and 2022, there is yet another $50 million a year to do in those 2 years. And this program, it's been very, very popular with customers. It was kind of interesting. This summer we've had quite a bit of storm activity in the Wisconsin Public Service territory. And for those that had their service, distribution lines undergrounded, they saw much less in terms of outage time. So it's been a very popular program. I hope that helps, Greg."

These SSR agreements, they were actually multiple agreements and they covered multiple periods. I think they go back as far as February of '14. And there are actually 2 agreements over that period. And some of these periods, Julien, were covered by escrow accounting. So you're actually required by the regulators in Wisconsin to escrow both revenues as well as costs. So both revenues you received under the contract as well as the costs that might be allocated back to our utility through MISO. So what I was really referring to primarily is that those escrow mechanisms that might cover one or both of the periods."

Thank you all for joining us today as we review our results for the second quarter of the year. Now before I do that, I want to introduce the members of our team who are with me here today: Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim S",1071,"Thanks, Colleen. Thank you all for joining us today as we review our results for the second quarter of the year. Now before I do that, I want to introduce the members of our team who are with me here today: Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, our Treasurer; Susan Martin, our General Counsel; Bill Guc, who's our Controller; and finally, Beth Straka, who's our Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.
Now let's look at our second quarter 2016 results. The end of the second quarter marked the first anniversary of our Integrys acquisition, which closed on June 29 last year. Consistent with the first quarter, we are now reporting results of the combined company. We reported second quarter earnings of $0.57 per share. That compares with adjusted earnings of $0.58 per share in the second quarter of 2015.
Our adjusted earnings in both 2015 and 2016 include interest on the debt issued to purchase Integrys as well as the shares we issued in the transaction. Scott will review the most significant drivers for the quarter with you in a moment.
The results of our integration efforts have exceeded our expectations. As I mentioned last quarter, our focus on cost controls and other tangible benefits from the acquisition have allowed us to freeze base rates for customers of We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service through 2017. We submitted our standard annual electric fuel filings in Wisconsin on July 1, asking for a modest reduction at We Energies and a slight increase at Wisconsin Public Service. The only active rate case is at our Minnesota gas utility, where interim rates are in place.
Our long-term goal is to grow earnings per share at a compound annual growth rate of 5% to 7% off a base of $2.72 per share in 2015. Key to delivering this growth is the execution of our capital investment plan and addressing the impact of bonus tax depreciation.
Now let me give you a brief update on where we stand with our capital plan. We believe that approximately $1 billion in cash tax benefits will be generated from the bonus depreciation extension. About 2/3 of this benefit will occur this year and in 2017. Although we do not expect bonus depreciation to have any significant impact on earnings this year, we are taking steps to modify our capital plan to minimize any impacts in 2017 as well as in following years.
As you may recall from the first quarter call, we've advanced a number of beneficial projects into 2016 and 2017. The estimated investment associated with these projects is $500 million. In addition, we have made progress in the later years of our 5-year forecast.
We now expect to extend our electric system modernization and reliability project at Wisconsin Public Service. This should represent another $100 million of capital investment in the 2019 and 2020 period. I would add that this is a popular program with customers at Wisconsin Public Service, who are seeing significant benefits in the form of greatly reduced outages during storms. I expect that we will continue to identify projects that can be advanced into our current 5-year forecast. We plan to provide a complete update to our 5-year capital forecast no later than the November EEI finance conference.
Turning now to our operations in Illinois. We're moving forward on the Peoples Gas system modernization program, formerly known as AMRP. This is one of the largest natural gas system infrastructure projects in the country. The program calls for a replacement of approximately 2,000 miles of Chicago's aging natural gas pipelines. Over the past year, we've improved management and execution of the project, which is approximately 19% complete, and we continue to make good progress.
We filed a plan with the Illinois Commerce Commission late last year that describes our top priorities in the 3-year period from 2016 to 2018. The plan calls for removing and replacing more than 250 miles of aging cast iron pipes in neighborhoods most at risk. This will require investing a projected $250 million to $280 million a year.
After hearing stakeholder recommendations on issues such as the program's emphasis on safety and reliability, scope, schedule, cost forecast and controls and plans for measuring and monitoring progress, the ICC staff conducted a policy session in April summarizing the 6 workshops and then provided a comprehensive report to the commission on May 31. Last week, the ICC issued an order to begin a proceeding to evaluate the matters covered in the ICC staff report. The first step in the proceeding is expected to be completed within 30 days, when we are required to provide the ICC with an updated plan for the gas system modernization program. We believe that the ICC will reach its conclusions by the end of the first quarter of 2017. In the interim, our work on the gas infrastructure replacement program will continue.
Now I would like to briefly update you on 2 matters pending at the FERC. First, at the end of June, an administrative law judge issued its recommended ROEs for the second pending complaint. The recommendation was for a 9.7% base ROE and ATC could add a 50 basis point adder for a total of 10.2% ROE. We have updated our reserve to reflect this.
The second item pending at FERC is related to the system support resource payments for the Presque Isle Power Plant. In this case, another administrative law judge issued a recommendation requiring an approximate $20 million reduction to the payments we received for the period February 2014 through January 2015. We are currently evaluating the ALJ's recommendation. However, if the FERC adopts the ALJ decision, I do not expect that this will result in a dollar for dollar reduction in income. A decision is not likely until next year.
Next, I want to give you a brief reminder on our dividend. On the 21st of January, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.495 per share, an increase of 8.2% over the previous quarterly dividend. Our annual dividend rate stands at $1.98 a share, and our yield is approximately at the industry average. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings, and we expect our dividend growth to be in line with our earnings per share growth.
So now for more details on our second quarter results, here's Scott."
315117,370761218,1014866,"WEC Energy Group, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Allen. Our 2016 second quarter GAAP earnings were $0.57 per share compared with $0.35 per share in the second quarter of 2015. Second quarter results in 2016 include the impact of the Integrys companies. Excluding $0.23 of acquisition cost in 2",1467,"Thank you, Allen. Our 2016 second quarter GAAP earnings were $0.57 per share compared with $0.35 per share in the second quarter of 2015. Second quarter results in 2016 include the impact of the Integrys companies. Excluding $0.23 of acquisition cost in 2015, our adjusted earnings per share decreased by $0.01 from $0.58 in the second quarter of 2015 to $0.57 per share in the second quarter of 2016. You may recall that we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.59 in the second quarter last year.
For purposes of comparing 2016 and 2015 second quarter earnings on a consistent basis, a calculations of adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2015 now include all interest related to the acquisition financing and all shares in conjunction with the acquisition -- issued in conjunction with the acquisition. As a result, the comparable adjusted earnings per share value for 2015 is now $0.58 per share. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes the results of the Integrys companies and has full GAAP to adjusted reconciliation.
First, I'll focus on operating income by segment and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. Referring to Page 11 of the earnings packet, our consolidated operating income for the second quarter was $332.1 million as compared to an adjusted $230.8 million in 2015, an increase of $101.3 million.
Starting with the Wisconsin segment, operating income in the second quarter totaled $214.7 million for 2016, an increase of $74.3 million from the adjusted second quarter of 2015. We realized a $51.5 million contribution from Wisconsin Public Service and reported a $22.8 million increase, driven in part by higher quarter-over-quarter electricity demand at Wisconsin Electric, as temperatures in the early summer of 2016 were warmer than normal.
In the second quarter of 2016, our Illinois segment had $22.6 million of operating income and our other state segment added $2.3 million of operating income. We added these segments as part of our Integrys acquisition. Operating income in the We Power segment was up $900,000 when compared to 2015. This increase reflects additional investment at our Power the Future plants.
Our corporate and others segment realized an operating loss of $1.6 million this quarter as compared to an adjusted operating loss of $2.8 million in the second quarter of 2015 due primarily to lower labor cost. Taking the changes for these segments together, we arrive at a $101.3 million increase from adjusted operating income.
Moving to other income. During the second quarter of 2016, earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled $30.9 million, an increase of $16.6 million from the same period last year. This increase is directly related to the increase in our ownership interest from about 26% to just over 60% as a result of the Integrys acquisition. As Allen mentioned earlier, this was in part offset by an incremental reserve taken to reflect the most recent administrative law judge recommendation related to the FERC ROE reviews.
Our other income net increased by $6.3 million, largely related to higher AFUDC due to inclusion of AFUDC from the Integrys companies.
Our net interest expense increased $38.3 million, driven by $33.7 million of interest expense from the Integrys companies in 2016. In addition, we incurred about $6 million quarter-over-quarter increase in interest expense on the $1.5 billion of debt issued in June 2015 to complete the Integrys acquisition.
Earnings from the Integrys companies were primarily driver of the $38.3 million increase in our adjusted consolidated income tax expense. We anticipate that our annual effective tax rate for 2016 will be between 37.5% to 38.5%. Combining all these items brings us to an adjusted earnings of $133.8 million or $0.58 per share for the second quarter of 2015 compared to $181.4 million or $0.57 per share for the second quarter of 2016.
Now looking to our cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $507.6 million during the first 6 months of 2016. This increase was driven by $466.6 million of net cash flows from the operating activities of Integrys during the first half of 2016. The remaining increase was driven in part by a decrease in contributions to employee benefit plans.
You may recall that we contributed $100 million to our qualified pension trust in 2015, and we did not make a contribution in 2016. This increase was partially offset by changes in working capital.
While I'm on the subject of pensions, with the current interest rate environment, the potential exists for an approximate 100 basis point reduction in our discount rate to about 3.5%. On an enterprise-wide basis, we estimate that this would add approximately $35 million to pension expense in 2017. This also could impact the level of pension contributions that would be made next year. We currently are factoring this into our 2017 plan.
Our capital expenditures totaled $618.7 million during the first 6 months of 2017 (sic) [ 2016 ], a $250.7 million increase compared to the same period in 2015. The largest increase was driven primarily by capital investors at the Integrys companies.
Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 50.1% at the end of June. Our calculation treats half of the hybrid securities as common equity, which is consistent with past presentations. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.
We also paid $312.4 million in common dividends during the 6 months ended June 30, 2016, an increase of $121.9 million over the same period last year. This is driven by the increase in shares with the Integrys acquisition and a 17.2% increase in the dividend rate compared to the first half of 2015.
We also see continued customer growth across our system. At the end of June, our Wisconsin utilities were serving nearly 9,000 more electric customers and nearly 14,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year ago. Our natural gas utilities in Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota are now serving nearly 15,000 more customers in the past year.
For comparative purposes, the electric sales information I will discuss next reflects results for both Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Public Service. Weather-normalized sales are adjusted for the effects of weather and year-to-date results factor out the effects of leap year. On a weather-normalized basis, retail sales of electricity, excluding the iron ore mines, were up 1% compared to the second quarter of 2015. Actual second quarter deliveries increased 3%.
Looking now at the individual customers segments. Weather-normalized residential deliveries increased 2.8%, while actual residential deliveries rose 7.7%. Across our small commercial and industrial group, weather-normalized quarterly deliveries increased 0.7% and actual deliveries increased 2.2%.
In the large commercial and industrial segment, deliveries for the second quarter of 2016 increased 0.8%. Excluding the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial deliveries increased 0.3%. We continue to see improvement in several important sectors of the state's economy, including plastics, food processing and chemical processing. Year-to-date normalized retail deliveries, excluding the iron ore mines, increased 0.4%.
Now an update on our natural gas deliveries. As you recall, our Illinois segment has a decoupling mechanism and our margins are less affected by weather.
Looking at Wisconsin, our largest segment year-to-date, retail gas deliveries excluding gas used for power generation decreased 3.9% compared to the same period in 2015 due to warmer weather. On a weather-normalized basis, year-to-date retail gas deliveries excluding gas used for power generation were up 2.8%. Overall, our normalized results for gas and electric sales in 2016 were slightly above our expectations.
Turning now to our earnings forecast. We are reaffirming our 2016 earnings guidance of $2.88 per share to $2.94 per share. This projection assumes normal weather and excludes any potential acquisition-related cost that may arise. We are off to a strong start. We still have 6 months of weather ahead of us. Again, we are reaffirming our 2016 earnings guidance of $2.88 per share to $2.94 per share.
Finally, let's look at the third quarter guidance. As I mentioned last quarter, natural gas distribution is now a larger portion of our business. Thus, we expect to see relatively higher earnings per share in the first and fourth quarters due to higher -- to gas heating margins and relatively lower earnings per share in the second and third quarter when compared to past years.
Taking into account this new quarterly earnings pattern and warmer-than-normal July weather, we expect our third quarter 2016 earnings per share to be in the range of $0.55 to $0.59. That assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter and excludes any potential acquisition-related cost that may arise. Again, the third quarter earnings guidance is $0.55 to $0.59 per share.
With that, I'll turn things back to Allen."

And so the bonus depreciation extension, which was really a reach-back to 2015 as well as an extension out to, I guess, 2019, we think results in about $1 billion worth of cash tax benefits. So back on the February and the May calls, we gave an update to everybody on where we stood versus offsetting that $1 billion. So as we got to the end of the May call, we had identified $500 million. And those were primarily this year and next. So about $500 million between 2016 and 2017. And so now what we've identified is another $100 million in addition to that $500 million. So the $100 million is in the years 2019 and 2020. So about $50 million a year, Greg. And what this relates to is really the continuation of a program -- of a 4-year program that they've had at Wisconsin Public Service. The first phase involved distribution automation as well as undergrounding of electric distribution. The second phase will be strictly devoted, we expect, to the undergrounding of electric distribution. So about $50 million in 2019, $50 million in 2020. And we also believe out in 2021 and 2022, there is yet another $50 million a year to do in those 2 years. And this program, it's been very, very popular with customers. It was kind of interesting. This summer we've had quite a bit of storm activity in the Wisconsin Public Service territory. And for those that had their service, distribution lines undergrounded, they saw much less in terms of outage time. So it's been a very popular program. I hope that helps, Greg."

So really what that report did, effectively, the staff did not make any recommendations about the program, effectively. What they did is the staff summarized all of kind of the key input from the stakeholders in that workshop process that they had earlier this year. And then what the staff just essentially said is, ""Well, we believe you guys should have a docket to address the program, and we think you should have reporting mechanisms about the program in the interim before you make a decision and in the long term, once the decision is made."" So there's -- really it's just kind of a summary of what all the stakeholders said. And then in terms of what the commission would decide at a high level, what they said they wanted to do was cover the cost, scope and schedule for the near term and the long term. So they still seem to be of a very strong view that the program needs to continue. They just want to look again at the scope and the schedule. And in the interim, they fully understand that we're going to continue with that 3-year program that I alluded to before. Hopefully, that's helpful, Steve."

Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the third quarter of the year. But first, I want to introduce the members of our team who are with me here today: Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, our T",826,"Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the third quarter of the year. But first, I want to introduce the members of our team who are with me here today: Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, our Treasurer; Susan Martin, our General Counsel; Bill Guc, our Controller; Beth Straka, finally, our Senior Vice President our Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.
So with that, let's start with our third quarter 2016 results. We reported adjusted third quarter earnings of $0.69 per share. That compares with adjusted earnings of $0.58 per share in the third quarter of 2015. Our adjusted earnings exclude merger-related costs. The weather here in Southeastern Wisconsin was the second warmest in 84 years. Scott will review the most significant drivers for the quarter with you in a moment. In addition to our third quarter earnings, we have 2 positive developments to share with you. First, we reached an uncontested settlement with the Michigan Public Service Commission staff, the Michigan Attorney General and other intervenors to form a Michigan only utility. This utility will be named the Upper Michigan Energy Resources Company, or UMERC for short. We expect UMERC will provide electric and natural gas service to current customers in Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Public Service and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. At this point, we believe UMERC will begin operations on January 1 of next year. The formation of UMERC is another step that is required to allow us to begin a certificate of necessity proceeding for our proposed generation solution in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. We are proposing a $255 million investment and 170 megawatts of natural gas-fired generation. UMERC would own and operate the reciprocating internal combustion engines which would provide a long-term generation solution for reliable and low-cost power for customers in the Upper Peninsula including the mines owned by Presque Resources. Now we expect to file our proposal with the Michigan Commission in November and we're targeting commercial operation in 2019. At that time, or soon after, we expect to be in a position to retire our coal-fired Presque Isle Power Plant. The second positive development relates to our earnings outlook. Based on the positive third quarter results, largely driven by weather, we now expect our 2016 earnings to be at the upper end of our guidance range of $2.88 to $2.94.
Now we only had 1 ongoing rate case this year. This was our Minnesota gas utility's rate case. There we recently received the final decision from the Minnesota Commission authorizing a 9.11% return on equity. The revenue increase is approximately 3% or an estimated $6.8 million. And this is in line with our expectations for the case. Early next year, we will evaluate our rate case plans for all of our utilities. Next, I want to mention a recent development at the FERC level which impacts our earnings at ATC. At September 28, FERC voted to affirm fire ALJ recommendation of a 10.32% base ROE in the first MISO ROE complaint. Effective January 2015, we qualified for a 50 basis point adder for being a MISO number increasing our ROE to 10.82%. The resolution of this first complaint for the period of November 2013 through February 11 of 2015, resulted in an increase in pretax earnings of approximately $1.4 million. Looking ahead, we expect an order in the second quarter of 2017 in the second MISO complaint case for the ALJ recommended a base ROE of 9.7%. Again, we qualified for the 50 basis points adder, which would increase the recommended ROE to 10.2%. We believe this is an appropriate assumption going forward. Now a reminder on our dividend. In January of this year, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.495 a share, an increase of 8.2% over the previous quarterly dividend. Our annual dividend rate stands at $1.98 a share and our yield is at approximately the industry average.
We continue the target of payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. Given that we are in this range now, I expect our dividend growth will be in line with our earnings per share growth.
Finally, I want to review our updated 5-year capital forecast. This plan now reflects a range of $9 billion to $9.5 billion, which is $1.6 billion more than the plan we presented at EEI last November. This plan does not include a potential natural gas storage investment that we are continuing to pursue. I would also remind you that these figures do not include ATC's capital spending plan.
In addition to the projects outlined for you earlier, we had continue to identify a need for deeper infrastructure improvements including our gas facilities in Chicago. We have included updated 5-year capital investment forecast charts in the back of the earnings packet.
Now with the details in our third quarter results and the financial outlook, here's our Chief Financial Officer, Scott Lauber."

Our 2016 third quarter debt [ph] earnings were $0.68 per share compared with $0.58 per share in the third quarter of 2015. Third quarter results in both 2016 and 2015 include a full quarter of earnings from the Integrys companies. Excluding 1 set of acquisition cost in 2016, adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.11 from $0.58 per share in the third quarter of 2015 to $0.69 per share in the third quarter of 2016. You may recall that we reported adjusted earnings of $0.61 per share in the third quarter last year. For purposes of comparing 2016 and 2015 third quarter earnings on a consistent basis, the calculation of adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2015 now include Integrys' earnings, all interest expense related to the acquisition financing and all shares issued in conjunction with the acquisition.
As a result, the comparable adjusted earnings per share value for 2015 is now $0.58 per share. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes the result of the Integrys companies and its full GAAP to adjusted reconciliation. First, I'll focus on operating income by segment and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes.
Returning to Page 10 of the earnings packet, our consolidated operating income for the third quarter adjusted for costs related to the acquisition of Integrys, was $402.5 million, as compared to $351.8 million in 2015, an increase of $50.7 million. Starting with the Wisconsin segment, operating income in the third quarter totaled $299.1 million for 2016, an increase of $42.5 million from the third quarter of 2015. The improved quarter-over-quarter results for the Wisconsin segment was driven primarily by significantly warmer-than-normal weather and timing of positive fuel recoveries. In the third quarter of 2016, our Illinois segment had $11.7 million of operating income, an increase of $8.2 million compared to the $3.5 million of operating income recognized during the 20,153rd quarter.
The increase in operating income was driven primarily by continued investment in the gas system modernization program.
Operating income for our other state segment improved $2.7 million, in part due to cost controls. Operating income at the We Power segment was up $500,000 when compared to 2015. This increase reflect additional investment at our Power the Future plants. Our corporate and other segment realized that adjusted operating loss of $1 million this quarter compared to adjusted operating income of $2.2 million in the third quarter of 2015.
Taking the changes of these segments together, we arrived at $50.7 million increase in adjusted operating income. During the third quarter of 2016, earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled $38.3 million, a decrease of $1.7 million from the same quarter last year. The lower equity earnings were driven by the recent FERC order and ALJ recommendations related to the ATC ROE reviews. Our other income net decreased by $3.6 million largely related to lower AFUDC which was caused primarily by timing of capital expenditures. Our net interest expense decreased $4.1 million. Interest expense decreased quarter-over-quarter primarily as a result of the repurchase of a portion of the Integrys 6.11% union notes earlier this year. Those notes replaced with lower interest rate, short-term debt.
Increased quarter-over-quarter operating income was the primary driver for the $15.7 million increase in our adjusted consolidated income tax expense. We anticipate that our annual effective tax rate for 2016 will be between 37.5% and 38.5%.
Combining all of these items brings us to adjusted earnings of $219.1 million or $0.69 per share for the third quarter of 2016 compared to $185 million or $0.58 per share for the third quarter of 2015.
On a year-to-date basis, GAAP earnings were $2.35 per share compared with $1.78 per share the 9 months ended September 30, 2015.
Excluding acquisition costs, adjusted earnings per share increased $0.33 from $2.03 per share in 2015 to $2.36 per share in 2016.
Year-to-date results in 2016 include the impacts of Integrys acquisition. Recall that 2015 year-to-date results include only 1 quarter of Integrys increased $647.5 million during the first 9 months of 2016. This increase was driven primarily by $526 million of net cash flows for the operating activities of Integrys for the 9 months ended September 30, 2016.
The remaining increase was driven by a decrease in contributions to employee benefit plans. As previously discussed, we contribute $100 million to our qualified pension trust in 2015 and we did not make a contribution in 2016.
Our capital expenditures totaled $1 billion during the 9 months ended September 30, 2016, a $208.3 million increase compared to the same period in 2015. The largest increase was related to the capital investments at the Integrys companies.
Our debt-to-capital ratio was 51.4% at the end of September, an increase from the 50.1% adjusted debt-to-capital ratio reported at the end of June. Effective at the end of the third quarter, we no longer are adjusting equity for any portion of the legacy Integrys hybrid instruments.
Our calculations continue to treat half of the WEC Energy Group 2007 series A 2 new subordinate notes of common equity.
We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401-k plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. We also paid $468.6 million in common dividends during the 9 months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $157.7 million over the same period last year.
Higher dividends were driven by the increase in shares outstanding related to the Integrys acquisition and an increase in the dividend rate compared to the first 9 months of 2015.
Since the beginning of 2015, we increased our quarterly dividend 17.2% from $0.4225 per share to the current level of $0.495 per share. Moving to sales. We continue to see customer growth across our system. At the end of September, our Wisconsin utilities were serving about 7,000 loyal electric customers and nearly 13,000 more natural gas customers compared to 1 year ago. Our natural gas utilities in Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota are serving approximately 18,000 more customers compared to a year ago.
Now let's discuss the levered values. For comparative purposes, year-to-date electric volume information reflects results for both Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Public Service. Weather-normalized deliveries are adjusted to factor out the effects of leap year. Actual third quarter retail electric deliveries, excluding the iron ore mines, increased 4.1%. On a weather-normalized basis, retail deliveries of electricity were flat compared to the third quarter of 2015.
Looking at the individual customer segments. Actual residential deliveries rose 8.1% while weather-normalized residential deliveries decreased 5/10 of 1%.
Across our small commercial industrial group, actual deliveries increased 3.6% while weather-normalized quarterly deliveries increased 7/10 of 1%. In the large commercial and industrial segment, deliveries for the third quarter of 2016 increased 2.2%. Excluding the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial deliveries increased 8/10 of 1%.
We see continued improvement in several important sectors of Wisconsin economy, including paper and paper products, food processing and chemical processing.
Year-to-date weather-normalized retail deliveries, excluding the iron ore mines, increased 3/10 of 1%.
Now an update on our natural gas deliveries. As you may recall, our Illinois segment has a decoupling mechanism and its margins are less affected by weather. Looking at Wisconsin, our largest segment, year-to-date retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, decreased 3% compared to the same period in 2015 due primarily to normal weather.
On a weather-normalized basis, year-to-date retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation were up 2.8%. Overall, our normalized results for gas and electric sales in 2016 were slightly above our expectations. Turning now to our earnings forecast. We expect our 2016 earnings to be at the upper end of our guidance of $2.88 per share to $2.94 per share. The guidance excludes a $0.01 per share acquisition-related cost in the third quarter as well any potential acquisition-related cost that may arise during the quarter.
This projection assumes normal weather for the balance of the year and reflects the mild first quarter weather, as well as the very warm third quarter weather conditions.
A couple of key points as we look at rental guidance. First, the very warm weather in the third quarter was mainly in Southeastern Wisconsin and then majority of the weather-related margins and positive fuel recoveries were in the Wisconsin Electric service territory. This was a benefit to Wisconsin Electric and the third quarter of about $0.08. As you recall, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas have an earnings sharing mechanism in place as part of the acquisition order and therefore, limit the overall earnings potential for the year.
In addition, we expect an increase in maintenance expense items in the fourth quarter compared to last year. Again, we expect our 2016 earnings to be at the upper end of our $2.88 per share to $2.94 per share guidance range. With that, I'll turn things back to Allen."

So first, you guys earned $0.63 in the fourth quarter last year. So if I just do the basic math, if you had flat year, you'd be slightly above the high end of the range is the reason you don't expect that to happen is because you'll be in a refund position on the sharing or because you found opportunities to do accelerated expense programs with a benefit customers? Or some combination of both or is there another item that I'm not thinking about?"

So you touched on one of the issues which is the sharing mechanism. At Wisconsin Electric when I say sharing mechanism, the earnings sharing mechanism at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas. And just to keep in mind, that's about 60% of our regulated utilities. So 60% of our earnings would be subject to that earning sharing mechanism. So we certainly expect that mechanism to kick in and there will be some sharing. In fact, we already approved some sharing in the third quarter. So that's in the first factor that will impact, we expect to impact the fourth quarter. You touched on that. The other thing, Greg, that I would just emphasize and Scott talked about this a little bit in his remarks. But remember, the electric fuel recovery mechanisms that we have at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Public Service, they have a dead band. So in dollar terms, it's they have plus or minus $15 million at Wisconsin Electric. It's a plus or minus $6 million at Wisconsin Public Service. And so once you get above those positive recovery levels, all of the dollars go dollar-for-dollar above that level back to refunds for customers. Unlike the third quarter of last year, we actually went all the way to the top of those bands in the third quarter of this year. In the fourth quarter of last year, we have to get well into the fourth quarter before we hit those levels. So that also will introduce another timing indifference or earnings timing difference, if you will, in third quarter as opposed to fourth. and in the last thing is related to the O&M spend. And what really happened, Greg, since like every quarter we talked a lot about the weather but in the fourth quarter of 2015, that was a very mild weather quarter. And as a result, in order to hit the financial commitments we had, we actually had to cut back a bit on O&M spending. So I view the O&M spend run rate that we have in the fourth quarter of 2015 is being a little abnormal, being abnormaly low. What I think we'll see in the fourth quarter of this year is more of a normal run rate for the business the way it's continued now. So I think those 3 factors, the earnings share-ing mechanisms, hitting the top of the positive recovery bands on fuel in the third quarter and finally, that difference in O&M timing, I think all of those will impact the fourth quarter. I don't know, Scott, if you want to spend any time at all on the share-ing mechanisms."

So at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas, the sharing mechanism and remember, there's an authorized or allowed return in Wisconsin Electric of about 10.2% ROE and then we share the first 50 basis points above that. So we can theoretically earn up to the 10.45. And then anything above that or the share-ing part of it will be used to basically amortize some of the transmission assets that we have on our balance sheet. That was part of the acquisition order. So that's part of the sharing mechanism that will happen and as we look at the fourth quarter again and tie it all to the other. As we look at their earnings in the fourth quarter last year, if you factor in the interest expense it's about $0.62 in the comparable basis and the fuel that Allen talked about, that's about $0.03 so you get down to that $0.59 and the O&M getting back to a normal run rate and maintenance is about $0.02 to $0.03. So it gets into that $0.57, $0.59 range."

So can you talk about where you are and in your sort of thought process on updating your CapEx?

So you're exactly right, Greg. It would offset roughly $1 billion cash impact of bonus depreciation plus another, say, $550 million on top of that. So just to give you a sense for the types of things, Greg, that are in the $1.6 billion. So we alluded to one of them in the call, so there's $255 million for the generation in Michigan. I certainly see that as a benefit to the customers and also benefit to the customers in Wisconsin because once we retire Presque Isle, there'll be about a $40 million O&M savings associated with retiring that plan. Also in the generation category, we've made the assumption, we also expect that as soon as we can or allowed to by MISO, we want to proceed to retire the plant which is a coal plant in the Green Bay area and that will lead the generation in Wisconsin Public Service and we'll have an option to invest. We have a generation option to the Riverside Power Plant, and alliance building. That's about $100 million. So exercising that first option. On the electric distribution side, I think we've talked before about the system modernization reliability program in the Wisconsin Public Service territory. So we're going to finish the first phase and do a second phase that will be about $100 million. That's a very popular program. We've seen quite significant reliability benefits for the distribution customers in Wisconsin Public Service. On the gas distribution side, just to give you 1 example, I'm sure you and the other listeners on the call are very familiar with what's going on with and the new rules that are coming on gas storage. We believe we're going to require about a $50 million program at the [indiscernible] Storage Field in Illinois to do well work and to put in the subsurface safety valves. So that's another $50 million. And then just to give you a couple of other examples, a number of software projects that we believe are going to results in [indiscernible] so short cycle work management system in Illinois. We're also going to move to automated meters in our Michigan Gas Utility as well as Minnesota Gas Utility. So as you could tell, from that listening, I mean, there's quite a number of things that are in that list and I believe, our team believes they're be beneficial to customers either from a cost standpoint or reliability or both."

You're right, you're going to see or where we expect to see somewhat a deceleration or a lowering in this spending at ATC. However, if you look at the 10-year numbers, the last cycle when they updated their 10-year plan, there was 3.7 to 4.5. This cycle, it's 3.6 to 4.4. So if you look over a 10-year period, the 10-year numbers aren't that different. But in terms of the annual averages, those are, I would expect, they're going to come down somewhat, Michael, because the very, very large, very, very significant reliability projects inside the footprint, a lot of those are done. Now as perhaps as generation patterns change in the state because of Clean Power Plan, perhaps you could see an uptick again but right now, we expect it to come down somewhat.

So I'm sure you remember, Andy, but for the benefit of others on the call, so back in 2000 -- actually December of 2006, we announced the sale of the plant and some associated PPAs with Xterra. We went through a very protracted, contested case proceeding in Wisconsin leading up to the actual financial closing of the sale in 2007. Now during that protracted or long contested case proceeding, the commission approved not only the sale of the nuclear plant so 2 units, both of the units but they also reviewed and approved the PPAs. And there were refunds of the above booking of the proceeds in the plan does well as of the excess decommissioning funds that were in the trust. So the PPA as well as the sale all were reviewed in that proceeding. And then ever since then, these PPA payments has been consistently recovered in the fuel clause. So I think all that background, or that context is important and I think Scott, maybe you could fill in, I don't know if you have specific numbers in terms of the lease for the next 2 years, what happens, I don't have them handy."

Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the third quarter of the year. But first, I want to introduce the members of our team who are with me here today: Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, our T",823,"Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the third quarter of the year. But first, I want to introduce the members of our team who are with me here today: Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, our Treasurer; Susan Martin, our General Counsel; Bill Guc, our Controller; Beth Straka, finally, our Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.
So with that, let's start with our third quarter 2016 results. We reported adjusted third quarter earnings of $0.69 per share. That compares with adjusted earnings of $0.58 per share in the third quarter of 2015. Our adjusted earnings exclude merger-related costs. The weather here in Southeastern Wisconsin was the second warmest in 84 years. Scott will review the most significant drivers for the quarter with you in a moment. 
In addition to our third quarter earnings, we have 2 positive developments to share with you. First, we reached an uncontested settlement with the Michigan Public Service Commission staff, the Michigan attorney general and other intervenors to form a Michigan-only utility. This utility will be named the Upper Michigan Energy Resources Company or UMERC for short. We expect UMERC will provide electric and natural gas service to current customers in Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Public Service in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. At this point, we believe UMERC will begin operations on January 1 of next year. 
The formation of UMERC is another step that is required to allow us to begin a certificate of necessity proceeding for our proposed generation solution in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. We are proposing a $255 million investment in 170 megawatts of natural gas-fired generation. UMERC would own and operate the reciprocating internal combustion engines, which would provide a long-term generation solution for reliable and low-cost power for customers in the Upper Peninsula, including the mines owned by Cliffs Resources. Now we expect to file our proposal with the Michigan commission in November, and we're targeting commercial operation in 2019. At that time or soon after, we expect to be in a position to retire our coal-fired Presque Isle Power Plant. 
 
The second positive development relates to our earnings outlook. Based on the positive third quarter results, largely driven by weather, we now expect our 2016 earnings to be at the upper end of our guidance range of $2.88 to $2.94. 
Now we only had 1 ongoing rate case this year. This was our Minnesota gas utility's rate case. There, we recently received final decision from the Minnesota commission authorizing a 9.11% return on equity. The revenue increase is approximately 3% or an estimated $6.8 million. And this is in line with our expectations for the case. Early next year, we will evaluate our rate case plans for all of our utilities. 
Next, I want to mention a recent development at the FERC level which impacts our earnings at ATC. On September 28, FERC voted to affirm a prior ALJ recommendation of a 10.32% base ROE in the first MISO ROE complaint. Effective January 2015, we qualified for a 50 basis point adder for being a MISO member, increasing our ROE to 10.82%. The resolution of this first complaint for the period from November 2013 through February 11 of 2015 resulted in an increase in pretax earnings of approximately $1.4 million. 
Looking ahead, we expect an order in the second quarter of 2017 in the second MISO complaint case where the ALJ recommended a base ROE of 9.7%. Again, we qualified for the 50 basis point adder, which would increase the recommended ROE to 10.2%. We believe this is an appropriate assumption going forward. 
Now a reminder on our dividend. In January of this year, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.495 a share, an increase of 8.2% over the previous quarterly dividend. Our annual dividend rate stands at $1.98 a share, and our yield is at approximately the industry average. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. Given that we are in this range now, I expect our dividend growth will be in line with our earnings per share growth.
Finally, I want to review our updated 5-year capital forecast. This plan now reflects a range of $9 billion to $9.5 billion, which is $1.6 billion more than the plan we presented at EEI last November. This plan does not include a potential natural gas storage investment that we are continuing to pursue. I would also remind you that these figures do not include ATC's capital spending plan. In addition to the projects outlined for you earlier, we have continued to identify the need for infrastructure improvements, including our gas facilities in Chicago. We have included updated 5-year capital investment forecast charts in the back of the earnings packet.
Now with details on our third quarter results and a financial outlook, here's our Chief Financial Officer, Scott Lauber."
315117,403276560,1062279,"WEC Energy Group, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Allen. Our 2016 third quarter GAAP earnings were $0.68 per share compared with $0.58 per share in the third quarter of 2015. Third quarter results in both 2016 and 2015 include a full quarter of earnings from the Integrys companies. Excluding",1491,"Thank you, Allen. Our 2016 third quarter GAAP earnings were $0.68 per share compared with $0.58 per share in the third quarter of 2015. Third quarter results in both 2016 and 2015 include a full quarter of earnings from the Integrys companies. 
Excluding 1 set of acquisition costs in 2016, adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.11 from $0.58 per share in the third quarter of 2015 to $0.69 per share in the third quarter of 2016. You may recall that we reported adjusted earnings of $0.61 per share in the third quarter last year. 
For purposes of comparing 2016 and 2015 third quarter earnings on a consistent basis, the calculation of adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2015 now include Integrys' earnings, all interest expense related to the acquisition financing and all shares issued in conjunction with the acquisition. As a result, the comparable adjusted earnings per share value for 2015 is now $0.58 per share. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes the results of the Integrys companies and its full GAAP to adjusted reconciliation. 
First, I'll focus on operating income by segment and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes.
We're turning to Page 10 of the earnings packet. Our consolidated operating income for the third quarter adjusted for costs related to the acquisition of Integrys was $402.5 million as compared to $351.8 million in 2015, an increase of $50.7 million. 
Starting with the Wisconsin segment. Operating income in the third quarter totaled $299.1 million for 2016, an increase of $42.5 million from the third quarter of 2015. The improved quarter-over-quarter results for the Wisconsin segment was driven primarily by significantly warmer-than-normal weather and timing of positive fuel recoveries. 
In the third quarter of 2016, our Illinois segment had $11.7 million of operating income, an increase of $8.2 million compared to the $3.5 million of operating income recognized during the 2015 third quarter. The increase in operating income was driven primarily by continued investment in the gas system modernization program.
Operating income for our other states segment improved $2.7 million, in part due to cost controls. Operating income at the We Power segment was up $500,000 when compared to 2015. This increase reflected additional investment at our Power the Future plants. Our corporate and other segment realized adjusted operating loss of $1 million this quarter compared to adjusted operating income of $2.2 million in the third quarter of 2015.  Taking the changes of these segments together, we arrive at $50.7 million increase in adjusted operating income. 
During the third quarter of 2016, earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled $38.3 million, a decrease of $1.7 million from the same quarter last year. The lower equity earnings were driven by the recent FERC order and ALJ recommendations related to the ATC ROE reviews. Our other income net decreased by $3.6 million, largely related to lower AFUDC, which was caused primarily by timing of capital expenditures. 
Our net interest expense decreased $4.1 million. Interest expense decreased quarter-over-quarter primarily as a result of the repurchase of a portion of the Integrys 6.11% union notes earlier this year. Those notes were replaced with lower-interest-rate, short-term debt.
Increased quarter-over-quarter operating income was the primary driver for the $15.7 million increase in our adjusted consolidated income tax expense. We anticipate that our annual effective tax rate for 2016 will be between 37.5% and 38.5%.
Combining all of these items brings us to adjusted earnings of $219.1 million or $0.69 per share for the third quarter of 2016 compared to $185 million or $0.58 per share for the third quarter of 2015. On a year-to-date basis, GAAP earnings were $2.35 per share compared with $1.78 per share for the 9 months ended September 30, 2015. Excluding acquisition costs, adjusted earnings per share increased $0.33 from $2.03 per share in 2015 to $2.36 per share in 2016. Year-to-date results in 2016 include the impacts of the Integrys acquisition. Recall that 2015 year-to-date results include only 1 quarter of Integrys earnings.    
Net cash provided by operating activities increased $647.5 million during the first 9 months of 2016. This increase was driven primarily by $526 million of net cash flows from the operating activities of Integrys for the 9 months ended September 30, 2016. The remaining increase was driven by a decrease in contributions to employee benefit plans. As previously discussed, we contributed $100 million to our qualified pension trust in 2015, and we did not make a contribution in 2016.
Our capital expenditures totaled $1 billion during the 9 months ended September 30, 2016, a $208.3 million increase compared to the same period in 2015. The largest increase was related to capital investments at the Integrys companies. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 51.4% at the end of September, an increase from the 50.1% adjusted debt-to-capital ratio reported at the end of June. 
Effective at the end of the third quarter, we no longer are adjusting equity for any portion of the legacy Integrys hybrid instruments. Our calculations continue to treat half of the WEC Energy Group 2007 Series A junior subordinate notes as common equity. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. 
We also paid $468.6 million in common dividends during the 9 months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $157.7 million over the same period last year. Higher dividends were driven by the increase in shares outstanding related to the Integrys acquisition and an increase in the dividend rate compared to the first 9 months of 2015. Since the beginning of 2015, we increased our quarterly dividend 17.2% from $0.4225 per share to the current level of $0.495 per share. 
Moving to sales. We continue to see customer growth across our system. At the end of September, our Wisconsin utilities were serving about 7,000 more electric customers and nearly 13,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year ago. Our natural gas utilities in Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota are serving approximately 18,000 more customers compared to a year ago.
Now let's discuss delivered volumes. For comparative purposes, year-to-date electric volume information reflects results for both Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Public Service. Weather-normalized deliveries are adjusted to factor out the effects of leap year. Actual third quarter retail electric deliveries, excluding the iron ore mines, increased 4.1%. On a weather-normalized basis, retail deliveries of electricity were flat compared to the third quarter of 2015.
Looking at the individual customer segments. Actual residential deliveries rose 8.1% while weather-normalized residential deliveries decreased 0.5%. Across our small commercial industrial group, actual deliveries increased 3.6% while weather-normalized quarterly deliveries increased 0.7%. In the large commercial and industrial segment, deliveries for the third quarter of 2016 increased 2.2%. Excluding the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial deliveries increased 0.8%. We see continued improvement in several important sectors of Wisconsin's economy, including paper and paper products, food processing and chemical processing. Year-to-date weather-normalized retail deliveries, excluding the iron ore mines, increased 0.3%. 
Now an update on our natural gas deliveries. As you may recall, our Illinois segment has a decoupling mechanism and its margins are less affected by weather. Looking at Wisconsin, our largest segment, year-to-date retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, decreased 3% compared to the same period in 2015 due primarily to normal weather. On a weather-normalized basis, year-to-date retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, were up 2.8%. Overall, our normalized results for gas and electric sales in 2016 were slightly above our expectations. 
Turning now to our earnings forecast. We expect our 2016 earnings to be at the upper end of our guidance of $2.88 per share to $2.94 per share. The guidance excludes $0.01 per share of acquisition-related costs in the third quarter as well any potential acquisition-related costs that may arise during the fourth quarter. This projection assumes normal weather for the balance of the year and reflects the mild first quarter weather as well as the very warm third quarter weather conditions.
A couple of key points as we look at the annual guidance. First, the very warm weather in the third quarter was mainly in Southeastern Wisconsin, and the majority of the weather-related margins and positive fuel recoveries were in the Wisconsin Electric service territory. This was a benefit to Wisconsin Electric in the third quarter of about $0.08. As you recall, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas have an earnings sharing mechanism in place as part of the acquisition order and, therefore, limit the overall earnings potential for the year.
In addition, we expect an increase in maintenance expense items in the fourth quarter compared to last year. Again, we expect our 2016 earnings to be at the upper end of our $2.88 per share to $2.94 per share guidance range. 
With that, I'll turn things back to Allen."

So first, you guys earned -- I think you've earned $0.63 in the fourth quarter last year. So if I just do the basic math, if you had flat year, you'd be slightly above the high end of the range. Is the reason that you don't expect that to happen because you'll be in a refund position on the sharing or because you've found opportunities to do accelerated expense programs with a benefit to customers or some combination of both? Or is there another item that I'm not thinking about?"

So you touched on one of the issues, which is the sharing mechanism at Wisconsin Electric. When I say sharing mechanism, the earnings sharing mechanism at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas. And just to keep in mind, that's about 60% of our regulated utilities. So 60% of our earnings would be subject to that earnings sharing mechanism. So we certainly expect that mechanism to kick in and there would be some sharing. In fact, we already approved some sharing in the third quarter. So that's the first factor that will impact -- we expect will impact the fourth quarter. You've touched on that. The other thing, Greg, that I would just emphasize, and Scott talked about this a little bit in his remarks, but remember, the electric fuel recovery mechanisms that we have at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Public Service, they have a dead band. So in dollar terms, it's a plus or minus $15 million at Wisconsin Electric, it's a plus or minus $6 million at Wisconsin Public Service. And so once you get above those positive recovery levels, all of the dollars go, dollar for dollar above that level, back to refunds for customers. Unlike the third quarter of last year, we actually went all the way to the top of those bands in the third quarter of this year. In the fourth quarter of last year, we had to get well into the fourth quarter before we hit those levels. So that also will introduce another timing difference or earnings timing difference, if you will, in third quarter as opposed to fourth. And the last thing is related to O&M spend. And what really happened, Greg -- it seems like every quarter we talk a lot about the weather, but in the fourth quarter of 2015, that was a very mild weather quarter. And as a result, in order to hit the financial commitments we had, we actually had to cut back a bit on O&M spending. So I view the O&M spend run rate that we had in the fourth quarter of 2015 as being a little abnormal, meaning abnormally low. What I think we'll see in the fourth quarter of this year is more of a normal run rate for the business the way it's configured now. So I think those 3 factors, the earnings sharing mechanisms, hitting the top of the positive recovery bands on fuel in the third quarter and, finally, that difference on O&M timing, I think all of those will impact the fourth quarter. I don't know, Scott, if you want to spend any time at all on the sharing mechanisms."

So Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas have the sharing mechanism. And remember, there's an authorized or allowed return in Wisconsin Electric of about 10.2% ROE and then we share the first 50 basis points above that. So we can theoretically earn up to the 10.45%. And then anything above that or the sharing part of it will be used to basically amortize some of the transmission assets that we have on our balance sheet. That was part of the acquisition order. So that's part of the sharing mechanism that will happen in -- as we look at the fourth quarter again and tie it altogether. The -- as we look at the earnings in the fourth quarter last year, if you factor in the interest expense, it's about $0.62 on a comparable basis. And the fuel that Allen talked about, that's about $0.03. So you get down to that $0.59. And the O&M getting back to a normal run way --- rate and maintenance is about $0.02 to $0.03. So it gets into that $0.57, $0.59 range."

And I think you've even -- if I count them, 2000 -- increases in the 2019 and 2020 CapEx forecast have now basically gotten back into the sort of positive territory on total rate base additions relative to the impact of bonus. So can you talk about where you are in your -- sort of in your thought process on updating your CapEx? You said there's still -- A, what are the things that you put into the plan that you think are beneficial for customers?

Well, in terms of the way the numbers break down, so overall, if we look at our 5-year capital plan, it's about $1.6 billion more than the plan that was laid out in November of 2015 at EEI. So you're exactly right, Greg. It would offset the $1 billion -- roughly $1 billion cash impact of bonus depreciation plus another, say, $550 million on top of that. So just to give you a sense for the types of things, Greg, that are in the $1.6 billion. So we alluded to one of them in the call, so there's $255 million for the generation in Michigan. I certainly see that as a benefit to the customers in the UP and also a benefit to the customers in Wisconsin because once we retire Presque Isle, there'll be about a $40 million O&M savings associated with retiring that plant. Also, in the generation category, we've made the assumption -- we also expect that as soon as we can or we're allowed to by MISO, we want to proceed to retire the Pulliam plant, which is a coal plant in the Green Bay area. And that will leave a generation need in Wisconsin Public Service, and we'll have an option to invest. We have a generation option to the Riverside power plant that Alliant is building. That's about $100 million. So exercising that first option. On the electric distribution side, I think we've talked before about the system modernization and reliability program in the Wisconsin Public Service territory. So we're going to finish the first phase and do a second phase that will be about $100 million. That's a very popular program. We've seen quite significant reliability benefits for the distribution customers in Wisconsin Public Service. On the gas distribution side, just to give you one example, I'm sure you and the other listeners on the call are very familiar with what's going on with FEMSA and the new rules that are coming on gas storage. We believe we're going to require about a $50 million program at the Manlove storage field in Illinois to do well workovers and to put in the subsurface safety valves. So that's another $50 million. And then just to give you a couple of other examples, a number of software projects that we believe are going to result in O&M savings, so short-cycle work management system in Illinois. We're also going to move to automated meters at our Michigan gas utility as well as Minnesota gas utility. So as you could tell, from that list, I mean, there's quite a number of things that are in that list. And I believe, our team believes that they'll all be beneficial to customers either from a cost standpoint or reliability or both."

So if you look over a 10-year period, the 10-year numbers aren't that different. But in terms of the annual averages, those are -- I would expect they're going to come down somewhat, Michael, because the very, very large, very, very significant reliability projects inside the footprint, a lot of those are done. Now as -- perhaps as generation patterns change in the state because of Clean Power Plan, perhaps you could see an uptick again, but right now, we expect it to come down somewhat.

So just -- and I'm sure you remember, Andy, but for the benefit of others on the call, so back in 2000 -- actually, December of 2006, we announced the sale of the plant and some associated PPAs with NextEra. We went through a very protracted, contested case proceeding in Wisconsin leading up to the actual financial closing of the sale in 2007. Now during that protracted or long contested case proceeding, the commission approved not only the sale of the nuclear plant, the 2 units, so both of the units, but they also reviewed and approved the PPAs. And there were refunds of the above booking -- of the proceeds that we got above booked to the plan as well as the excess nuclear decommissioning funds that were in the trust. So the PPA as well as the sale all were reviewed in that proceeding. And then ever since then, these PPA payments have been consistently recovered in the fuel clause. So I think all of that background, all that context is important. And I think, Scott, maybe you could fill in. I mean I don't know if we have specific numbers in terms of at least the next 2 years, what happens with the PPA rights. I don't have them handy."

Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the third quarter of the year. But first, I want to introduce the members of our team who are with me here today: Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, our T",823,"Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the third quarter of the year. But first, I want to introduce the members of our team who are with me here today: Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, our Treasurer; Susan Martin, our General Counsel; Bill Guc, our Controller; Beth Straka, finally, our Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.
So with that, let's start with our third quarter 2016 results. We reported adjusted third quarter earnings of $0.69 per share. That compares with adjusted earnings of $0.58 per share in the third quarter of 2015. Our adjusted earnings exclude merger-related costs. The weather here in Southeastern Wisconsin was the second warmest in 84 years. Scott will review the most significant drivers for the quarter with you in a moment. 
In addition to our third quarter earnings, we have 2 positive developments to share with you. First, we reached an uncontested settlement with the Michigan Public Service Commission staff, the Michigan attorney general and other intervenors to form a Michigan-only utility. This utility will be named the Upper Michigan Energy Resources Company or UMERC for short. We expect UMERC will provide electric and natural gas service to current customers of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Public Service and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. At this point, we believe UMERC will begin operations on January 1 of next year. 
The formation of UMERC is another step that is required to allow us to begin a certificate of necessity proceeding for our proposed generation solution in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. We are proposing a $255 million investment in 170 megawatts of natural gas-fired generation. UMERC would own and operate the reciprocating internal combustion engines, which would provide a long-term generation solution for reliable and low-cost power for customers in the Upper Peninsula, including the mines owned by Cliffs Resources. Now we expect to file our proposal with the Michigan commission in November, and we're targeting commercial operation in 2019. At that time or soon after, we expect to be in a position to retire our coal-fired Presque Isle Power Plant. 
 
The second positive development relates to our earnings outlook. Based on the positive third quarter results, largely driven by weather, we now expect our 2016 earnings to be at the upper end of our guidance range of $2.88 to $2.94. 
Now we only had 1 ongoing rate case this year. This was our Minnesota gas utility's rate case. There, we recently received final decision from the Minnesota commission authorizing a 9.11% return on equity. The revenue increase is approximately 3% or an estimated $6.8 million. And this is in line with our expectations for the case. Early next year, we will evaluate our rate case plans for all of our utilities. 
Next, I want to mention a recent development at the FERC level which impacts our earnings at ATC. On September 28, FERC voted to affirm a prior ALJ recommendation of a 10.32% base ROE in the first MISO ROE complaint. Effective January 2015, we qualified for a 50 basis point adder for being a MISO member, increasing our ROE to 10.82%. The resolution of this first complaint for the period from November 2013 through February 11 of 2015 resulted in an increase in pretax earnings of approximately $1.4 million. 
Looking ahead, we expect an order in the second quarter of 2017 in the second MISO complaint case where the ALJ recommended a base ROE of 9.7%. Again, we qualified for the 50 basis point adder, which would increase the recommended ROE to 10.2%. We believe this is an appropriate assumption going forward. 
Now a reminder on our dividend. In January of this year, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.495 a share, an increase of 8.2% over the previous quarterly dividend. Our annual dividend rate stands at $1.98 a share, and our yield is at approximately the industry average. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. Given that we are in this range now, I expect our dividend growth will be in line with our earnings per share growth.
Finally, I want to review our updated 5-year capital forecast. This plan now reflects a range of $9 billion to $9.5 billion, which is $1.6 billion more than the plan we presented at EEI last November. This plan does not include a potential natural gas storage investment that we are continuing to pursue. I would also remind you that these figures do not include ATC's capital spending plan. In addition to the projects outlined for you earlier, we have continued to identify the need for infrastructure improvements, including our gas facilities in Chicago. We have included updated 5-year capital investment forecast charts in the back of the earnings packet.
Now with details on our third quarter results and a financial outlook, here's our Chief Financial Officer, Scott Lauber."
315117,403276560,1062439,"WEC Energy Group, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Allen. Our 2016 third quarter GAAP earnings were $0.68 per share compared with $0.58 per share in the third quarter of 2015. Third quarter results in both 2016 and 2015 include a full quarter of earnings from the Integrys companies. Excluding",1492,"Thank you, Allen. Our 2016 third quarter GAAP earnings were $0.68 per share compared with $0.58 per share in the third quarter of 2015. Third quarter results in both 2016 and 2015 include a full quarter of earnings from the Integrys companies. 
Excluding 1 set of acquisition costs in 2016, adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.11 from $0.58 per share in the third quarter of 2015 to $0.69 per share in the third quarter of 2016. You may recall that we reported adjusted earnings of $0.61 per share in the third quarter last year. 
For purposes of comparing 2016 and 2015 third quarter earnings on a consistent basis, the calculation of adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2015 now include Integrys' earnings, all interest expense related to the acquisition financing and all shares issued in conjunction with the acquisition. As a result, the comparable adjusted earnings per share value for 2015 is now $0.58 per share. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes the results of the Integrys companies and has full GAAP to adjusted reconciliation. 
First, I'll focus on operating income by segment and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes.
Returning turning to Page 10 of the earnings packet. Our consolidated operating income for the third quarter adjusted for costs related to the acquisition of Integrys was $402.5 million as compared to $351.8 million in 2015, an increase of $50.7 million. 
Starting with the Wisconsin segment. Operating income in the third quarter totaled $299.1 million for 2016, an increase of $42.5 million from the third quarter of 2015. The improved quarter-over-quarter results for the Wisconsin segment was driven primarily by significantly warmer-than-normal weather and timing of positive fuel recoveries. 
In the third quarter of 2016, our Illinois segment had $11.7 million of operating income, an increase of $8.2 million compared to the $3.5 million of operating income recognized during the 2015 third quarter. The increase in operating income was driven primarily by continued investment in the gas system modernization program.
Operating income for our other states segment improved $2.7 million, in part due to cost controls. Operating income at the We Power segment was up $500,000 when compared to 2015. This increase reflected additional investment at our Power the Future plants. Our corporate and other segment realized adjusted operating loss of $1 million this quarter compared to an adjusted operating income of $2.2 million in the third quarter of 2015. Taking the changes of these segments together, we arrive at $50.7 million increase in adjusted operating income. 
During the third quarter of 2016, earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled $38.3 million, a decrease of $1.7 million from the same quarter last year. The lower equity earnings were driven by the recent FERC order and ALJ recommendations related to the ATC ROE reviews. Our other income net decreased by $3.6 million, largely related to lower AFUDC, which was caused primarily by timing of capital expenditures. 
Our net interest expense decreased $4.1 million. Interest expense decreased quarter-over-quarter primarily as a result of the repurchase of a portion of the Integrys 6.11% union notes earlier this year. Those notes were replaced with lower-interest-rate, short-term debt.
Increased quarter-over-quarter operating income was the primary driver for the $15.7 million increase in our adjusted consolidated income tax expense. We anticipate that our annual effective tax rate for 2016 will be between 37.5% and 38.5%.
Combining all of these items brings us to adjusted earnings of $219.1 million or $0.69 per share for the third quarter of 2016 compared to $185 million or $0.58 per share for the third quarter of 2015. On a year-to-date basis, GAAP earnings were $2.35 per share compared with $1.78 per share for the 9 months ended September 30, 2015. Excluding acquisition costs, adjusted earnings per share increased $0.33 from $2.03 per share in 2015 to $2.36 per share in 2016. Year-to-date results in 2016 include the impacts of the Integrys acquisition. Recall that 2015 year-to-date results include only 1 quarter of Integrys earnings. 
Net cash provided by operating activities increased $647.5 million during the first 9 months of 2016. This increase was driven primarily by $526 million of net cash flows from the operating activities of Integrys for the 9 months ended September 30, 2016. The remaining increase was driven by a decrease in contributions to employee benefit plans. As previously discussed, we contributed $100 million to our qualified pension trust in 2015, and we did not make a contribution in 2016.
Our capital expenditures totaled $1 billion during the 9 months ended September 30, 2016, a $208.3 million increase compared to the same period in 2015. The largest increase was related to capital investments at the Integrys companies. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 51.4% at the end of September, an increase from the 50.1% adjusted debt-to-capital ratio reported at the end of June. 
Effective at the end of the third quarter, we no longer are adjusting equity for any portion of the legacy Integrys hybrid instruments. Our calculations continue to treat half of the WEC Energy Group 2007 Series A junior subordinate notes as common equity. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. 
We also paid $468.6 million in common dividends during the 9 months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $157.7 million over the same period last year. Higher dividends were driven by the increase in shares outstanding related to the Integrys acquisition and an increase in the dividend rate compared to the first 9 months of 2015. Since the beginning of 2015, we increased our quarterly dividend 17.2% from $0.4225 per share to the current level of $0.495 per share. 
Moving to sales. We continue to see customer growth across our system. At the end of September, our Wisconsin utilities were serving about 7,000 more electric customers and nearly 13,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year ago. Our natural gas utilities in Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota are serving approximately 18,000 more customers compared to a year ago.
Now let's discuss delivered volumes. For comparative purposes, year-to-date electric volume information reflects results for both Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Public Service. Weather-normalized deliveries are adjusted to factor out the effects of leap year. Actual third quarter retail electric deliveries, excluding the iron ore mines, increased 4.1%. On a weather-normalized basis, retail deliveries of electricity were flat compared to the third quarter of 2015.
Looking at the individual customer segments. Actual residential deliveries rose 8.1% while weather-normalized residential deliveries decreased 0.5%. Across our small commercial industrial group, actual deliveries increased 3.6% while weather-normalized quarterly deliveries increased 0.7%. In the large commercial and industrial segment, deliveries for the third quarter of 2016 increased 2.2%. Excluding the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial deliveries increased 0.8%. We see continued improvement in several important sectors of Wisconsin's economy, including paper and paper products, food processing and chemical processing. Year-to-date weather-normalized retail deliveries, excluding the iron ore mines, increased 0.3%. 
Now an update on our natural gas deliveries. As you may recall, our Illinois segment has a decoupling mechanism and its margins are less affected by weather. Looking at Wisconsin, our largest segment, year-to-date retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, decreased 3% compared to the same period in 2015 due primarily to normal weather. On a weather-normalized basis, year-to-date retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, were up 2.8%. Overall, our normalized results for gas and electric sales in 2016 were slightly above our expectations. 
Turning now to our earnings forecast. We expect our 2016 earnings to be at the upper end of our guidance of $2.88 per share to $2.94 per share. The guidance excludes $0.01 per share of acquisition-related costs in the third quarter as well any potential acquisition-related costs that may arise during the fourth quarter. This projection assumes normal weather for the balance of the year and reflects the mild first quarter weather as well as the very warm third quarter weather conditions.
A couple of key points as we look at the annual guidance. First, the very warm weather in the third quarter was mainly in Southeastern Wisconsin, and the majority of the weather-related margins and positive fuel recoveries were in the Wisconsin Electric service territory. This was a benefit to Wisconsin Electric in the third quarter of about $0.08. As you recall, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas have an earnings sharing mechanism in place as part of the acquisition order and, therefore, limit the overall earnings potential for the year.
In addition, we expect an increase in maintenance expense items in the fourth quarter compared to last year. Again, we expect our 2016 earnings to be at the upper end of our $2.88 per share to $2.94 per share guidance range. 
With that, I'll turn things back to Allen."

Is the reason that you don't expect that to happen because you'll be in a refund position on the sharing or because you've found opportunities to do accelerated expense programs with a benefit to customers or some combination of both?

315117,403276560,1062439,"WEC Energy Group, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Executives","So let me start, Greg, on the fourth quarter earnings question, and then I'll let Scott expand on a couple of points.

So you touched on one of the issues, which is the sharing mechanism at Wisconsin Electric. When I say sharing mechanism, the earnings sharing mechanism at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas. And just to keep in mind, that's about 60% of our regulated utilities. So 60% of our earnings would be subject to that earnings sharing mechanism. So we certainly expect that mechanism to kick in and there would be some sharing. In fact, we already approved some sharing in the third quarter. So that's the first factor that will impact -- we expect will impact the fourth quarter. You've touched on that. The other thing, Greg, that I would just emphasize, and Scott talked about this a little bit in his remarks, but remember, the electric fuel recovery mechanisms that we have at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Public Service, they have a dead band. So in dollar terms, it's a [ph] plus or minus $15 million at Wisconsin Electric, it's a plus or minus $6 million at Wisconsin Public Service. And so once you get above those positive recovery levels, all of the dollars go, dollar for dollar above that level, back to refunds for customers. Unlike the third quarter of last year, we actually went all the way to the top of those bands in the third quarter of this year. In the fourth quarter of last year, we had to get well into the fourth quarter before we hit those levels. So that also will introduce another timing difference or earnings timing difference, if you will, in third quarter as opposed to fourth. And the last thing is related to O&M spend. And what really happened, Greg -- it seems like every quarter we talk a lot about the weather, but in the fourth quarter of 2015, that was a very mild weather quarter. And as a result, in order to hit the financial commitments we had, we actually had to cut back a bit on O&M spending. So I view the O&M spend run rate that we had in the fourth quarter of 2015 as being a little abnormal, meaning abnormally low. What I think we'll see in the fourth quarter of this year is more of a normal run rate for the business the way it's configured now. So I think those 3 factors, the earnings sharing mechanisms, hitting the top of the positive recovery bands on fuel in the third quarter and, finally, that difference on O&M timing, I think all of those will impact the fourth quarter. I don't know, Scott, if you want to spend any time at all on the sharing mechanisms."
315117,403276560,1062439,"WEC Energy Group, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Executives","Yes.

So Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas have the sharing mechanism. And remember, there's an authorized or allowed return in Wisconsin Electric of about 10.2% ROE and then we share the first 50 basis points above that. So we can theoretically earn up to the 10.45%. And then anything above that or the sharing part of it will be used to basically amortize some of the transmission assets that we have on our balance sheet. That was part of the acquisition order. So that's part of the sharing mechanism that will happen in -- as we look at the fourth quarter again and tie it all together. The -- as we look at the earnings in the fourth quarter last year, if you factor in the interest expense, it's about $0.62 on a comparable basis. And the fuel that Allen talked about, that's about $0.03. So you get down to that $0.59. And the O&M getting back to a normal run way --- rate and maintenance is about $0.02 to $0.03. So it gets into that $0.57, $0.59 range."

So you're exactly right, Greg. It would offset the $1 billion -- roughly $1 billion cash impact of bonus depreciation plus another, say, $550 million on top of that. So just to give you a sense for the types of things, Greg, that are in the $1.6 billion. So we alluded to one of them in the call, so there's $255 million for the generation in Michigan. I certainly see that as a benefit to the customers in the UP and also a benefit to the customers in Wisconsin because once we retire Presque Isle, there'll be about a $40 million O&M savings associated with retiring that plant. Also, in the generation category, we've made the assumption -- we also expect that as soon as we can or we're allowed to by MISO, we want to proceed to retire the Pulliam plant, which is a coal plant in the Green Bay area. And that will leave a generation need in Wisconsin Public Service, and we'll have an option to invest. We have a generation option to the Riverside power plant that Alliant is building. That's about $100 million. So exercising that first option. On the electric distribution side, I think we've talked before about the system modernization and reliability program in the Wisconsin Public Service territory. So we're going to finish the first phase and do a second phase that will be about $100 million. That's a very popular program. We've seen quite significant reliability benefits for the distribution customers in Wisconsin Public Service. On the gas distribution side, just to give you one example, I'm sure you and the other listeners on the call are very familiar with what's going on with FEMSA and the new rules that are coming on gas storage. We believe we're going to require about a $50 million program at the Manlove storage field in Illinois to do well workovers and to put in the subsurface safety valves. So that's another $50 million. And then just to give you a couple of other examples, a number of software projects that we believe are going to result in O&M savings, so short-cycle work management system in Illinois. We're also going to move to automated meters at our Michigan gas utility as well as Minnesota gas utility. So as you could tell, from that litany, I mean, there's quite a number of things that are in that list. And I believe, our team believes that they'll all be beneficial to customers either from a cost standpoint or reliability or both."

However, if you look at the 10-year numbers, the last cycle when they updated their 10-year plan, it was 3.7 to 4.5. This cycle, it's 3.6 to 4.4. So if you look over a 10-year period, the 10-year numbers aren't that different. But in terms of the annual averages, those are -- I would expect they're going to come down somewhat, Michael, because the very, very large, very, very significant reliability projects inside the footprint, a lot of those are done. Now as -- perhaps as generation patterns change in the state because of Clean Power Plan, perhaps you could see an uptick again, but right now, we expect it to come down somewhat.

Certainly, if there's a better, more precise way to factor that into the process, that's certainly something we can consider, but it's already being considered in the current prioritization process."

So just -- and I'm sure you remember, Andy, but for the benefit of others on the call, so back in 2000 -- actually, December of 2006, we announced the sale of the plant and some associated PPAs with NextEra. We went through a very protracted, contested case proceeding in Wisconsin leading up to the actual financial closing of the sale in 2007. Now during that protracted or long contested case proceeding, the commission approved not only the sale of the nuclear plant, the 2 units, so both of the units, but they also reviewed and approved the PPAs. And there were refunds of the above booking -- of the proceeds that we got above booked to the plant [ph] as well as the excess nuclear decommissioning funds that were in the trust. So the PPA as well as the sale all were reviewed in that proceeding. And then ever since then, these PPA payments have been consistently recovered in the fuel clause. So I think all of that background, all that context is important. And I think, Scott, maybe you could fill in. I mean I don't know if we have specific numbers in terms of at least the next 2 years, what happens with the PPA rights. I don't have them handy."

Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the third quarter of the year. But first, I want to introduce the members of our team who are with me here today: Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, our T",823,"Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the third quarter of the year. But first, I want to introduce the members of our team who are with me here today: Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, our Treasurer; Susan Martin, our General Counsel; Bill Guc, our Controller; Beth Straka, finally, our Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.
So with that, let's start with our third quarter 2016 results. We reported adjusted third quarter earnings of $0.69 per share. That compares with adjusted earnings of $0.58 per share in the third quarter of 2015. Our adjusted earnings exclude merger-related costs. The weather here in Southeastern Wisconsin was the second warmest in 84 years. Scott will review the most significant drivers for the quarter with you in a moment. 
In addition to our third quarter earnings, we have 2 positive developments to share with you. First, we reached an uncontested settlement with the Michigan Public Service Commission staff, the Michigan attorney general and other intervenors to form a Michigan-only utility. This utility will be named the Upper Michigan Energy Resources Company or UMERC for short. We expect UMERC will provide electric and natural gas service to current customers of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Public Service and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. At this point, we believe UMERC will begin operations on January 1 of next year. 
The formation of UMERC is another step that is required to allow us to begin a certificate of necessity proceeding for our proposed generation solution in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. We are proposing a $255 million investment in 170 megawatts of natural gas-fired generation. UMERC would own and operate the reciprocating internal combustion engines, which would provide a long-term generation solution for reliable and low-cost power for customers in the Upper Peninsula, including the mines owned by Cliffs Resources. Now we expect to file our proposal with the Michigan commission in November, and we're targeting commercial operation in 2019. At that time or soon after, we expect to be in a position to retire our coal-fired Presque Isle Power Plant. 
 
The second positive development relates to our earnings outlook. Based on the positive third quarter results, largely driven by weather, we now expect our 2016 earnings to be at the upper end of our guidance range of $2.88 to $2.94. 
Now we only had 1 ongoing rate case this year. This was our Minnesota gas utility's rate case. There, we recently received final decision from the Minnesota commission authorizing a 9.11% return on equity. The revenue increase is approximately 3% or an estimated $6.8 million. And this is in line with our expectations for the case. Early next year, we will evaluate our rate case plans for all of our utilities. 
Next, I want to mention a recent development at the FERC level which impacts our earnings at ATC. On September 28, FERC voted to affirm a prior ALJ recommendation of a 10.32% base ROE in the first MISO ROE complaint. Effective January 2015, we qualified for a 50 basis point adder for being a MISO member, increasing our ROE to 10.82%. The resolution of this first complaint for the period from November 2013 through February 11 of 2015 resulted in an increase in pretax earnings of approximately $1.4 million. 
Looking ahead, we expect an order in the second quarter of 2017 in the second MISO complaint case where the ALJ recommended a base ROE of 9.7%. Again, we qualified for the 50 basis point adder, which would increase the recommended ROE to 10.2%. We believe this is an appropriate assumption going forward. 
Now a reminder on our dividend. In January of this year, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.495 a share, an increase of 8.2% over the previous quarterly dividend. Our annual dividend rate stands at $1.98 a share, and our yield is at approximately the industry average. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. Given that we are in this range now, I expect our dividend growth will be in line with our earnings per share growth.
Finally, I want to review our updated 5-year capital forecast. This plan now reflects a range of $9 billion to $9.5 billion, which is $1.6 billion more than the plan we presented at EEI last November. This plan does not include a potential natural gas storage investment that we are continuing to pursue. I would also remind you that these figures do not include ATC's capital spending plan. In addition to the projects outlined for you earlier, we have continued to identify the need for infrastructure improvements, including our gas facilities in Chicago. We have included updated 5-year capital investment forecast charts in the back of the earnings packet.
Now with details on our third quarter results and a financial outlook, here's our Chief Financial Officer, Scott Lauber."
315117,403276560,1063974,"WEC Energy Group, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Allen. Our 2016 third quarter GAAP earnings were $0.68 per share compared with $0.58 per share in the third quarter of 2015. Third quarter results in both 2016 and 2015 include a full quarter of earnings from the Integrys companies. Excluding",1492,"Thank you, Allen. Our 2016 third quarter GAAP earnings were $0.68 per share compared with $0.58 per share in the third quarter of 2015. Third quarter results in both 2016 and 2015 include a full quarter of earnings from the Integrys companies. 
Excluding 1 set of acquisition costs in 2016, adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.11 from $0.58 per share in the third quarter of 2015 to $0.69 per share in the third quarter of 2016. You may recall that we reported adjusted earnings of $0.61 per share in the third quarter last year. 
For purposes of comparing 2016 and 2015 third quarter earnings on a consistent basis, the calculation of adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2015 now include Integrys' earnings, all interest expense related to the acquisition financing and all shares issued in conjunction with the acquisition. As a result, the comparable adjusted earnings per share value for 2015 is now $0.58 per share. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes the results of the Integrys companies and has full GAAP to adjusted reconciliation. 
First, I'll focus on operating income by segment and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes.
Returning turning to Page 10 of the earnings packet. Our consolidated operating income for the third quarter adjusted for costs related to the acquisition of Integrys was $402.5 million as compared to $351.8 million in 2015, an increase of $50.7 million. 
Starting with the Wisconsin segment. Operating income in the third quarter totaled $299.1 million for 2016, an increase of $42.5 million from the third quarter of 2015. The improved quarter-over-quarter results for the Wisconsin segment was driven primarily by significantly warmer-than-normal weather and timing of positive fuel recoveries. 
In the third quarter of 2016, our Illinois segment had $11.7 million of operating income, an increase of $8.2 million compared to the $3.5 million of operating income recognized during the 2015 third quarter. The increase in operating income was driven primarily by continued investment in the gas system modernization program.
Operating income for our other states segment improved $2.7 million, in part due to cost controls. Operating income at the We Power segment was up $500,000 when compared to 2015. This increase reflected additional investment at our Power the Future plants. Our corporate and other segment realized adjusted operating loss of $1 million this quarter compared to an adjusted operating income of $2.2 million in the third quarter of 2015. Taking the changes of these segments together, we arrive at $50.7 million increase in adjusted operating income. 
During the third quarter of 2016, earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled $38.3 million, a decrease of $1.7 million from the same quarter last year. The lower equity earnings were driven by the recent FERC order and ALJ recommendations related to the ATC ROE reviews. Our other income net decreased by $3.6 million, largely related to lower AFUDC, which was caused primarily by timing of capital expenditures. 
Our net interest expense decreased $4.1 million. Interest expense decreased quarter-over-quarter primarily as a result of the repurchase of a portion of the Integrys 6.11% union notes earlier this year. Those notes were replaced with lower-interest-rate, short-term debt.
Increased quarter-over-quarter operating income was the primary driver for the $15.7 million increase in our adjusted consolidated income tax expense. We anticipate that our annual effective tax rate for 2016 will be between 37.5% and 38.5%.
Combining all of these items brings us to adjusted earnings of $219.1 million or $0.69 per share for the third quarter of 2016 compared to $185 million or $0.58 per share for the third quarter of 2015. On a year-to-date basis, GAAP earnings were $2.35 per share compared with $1.78 per share for the 9 months ended September 30, 2015. Excluding acquisition costs, adjusted earnings per share increased $0.33 from $2.03 per share in 2015 to $2.36 per share in 2016. Year-to-date results in 2016 include the impacts of the Integrys acquisition. Recall that 2015 year-to-date results include only 1 quarter of Integrys earnings. 
Net cash provided by operating activities increased $647.5 million during the first 9 months of 2016. This increase was driven primarily by $526 million of net cash flows from the operating activities of Integrys for the 9 months ended September 30, 2016. The remaining increase was driven by a decrease in contributions to employee benefit plans. As previously discussed, we contributed $100 million to our qualified pension trust in 2015, and we did not make a contribution in 2016.
Our capital expenditures totaled $1 billion during the 9 months ended September 30, 2016, a $208.3 million increase compared to the same period in 2015. The largest increase was related to capital investments at the Integrys companies. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 51.4% at the end of September, an increase from the 50.1% adjusted debt-to-capital ratio reported at the end of June. 
Effective at the end of the third quarter, we no longer are adjusting equity for any portion of the legacy Integrys hybrid instruments. Our calculations continue to treat half of the WEC Energy Group 2007 Series A junior subordinate notes as common equity. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. 
We also paid $468.6 million in common dividends during the 9 months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $157.7 million over the same period last year. Higher dividends were driven by the increase in shares outstanding related to the Integrys acquisition and an increase in the dividend rate compared to the first 9 months of 2015. Since the beginning of 2015, we increased our quarterly dividend 17.2% from $0.4225 per share to the current level of $0.495 per share. 
Moving to sales. We continue to see customer growth across our system. At the end of September, our Wisconsin utilities were serving about 7,000 more electric customers and nearly 13,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year ago. Our natural gas utilities in Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota are serving approximately 18,000 more customers compared to a year ago.
Now let's discuss delivered volumes. For comparative purposes, year-to-date electric volume information reflects results for both Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Public Service. Weather-normalized deliveries are adjusted to factor out the effects of leap year. Actual third quarter retail electric deliveries, excluding the iron ore mines, increased 4.1%. On a weather-normalized basis, retail deliveries of electricity were flat compared to the third quarter of 2015.
Looking at the individual customer segments. Actual residential deliveries rose 8.1% while weather-normalized residential deliveries decreased 0.5%. Across our small commercial industrial group, actual deliveries increased 3.6% while weather-normalized quarterly deliveries increased 0.7%. In the large commercial and industrial segment, deliveries for the third quarter of 2016 increased 2.2%. Excluding the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial deliveries increased 0.8%. We see continued improvement in several important sectors of Wisconsin's economy, including paper and paper products, food processing and chemical processing. Year-to-date weather-normalized retail deliveries, excluding the iron ore mines, increased 0.3%. 
Now an update on our natural gas deliveries. As you may recall, our Illinois segment has a decoupling mechanism and its margins are less affected by weather. Looking at Wisconsin, our largest segment, year-to-date retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, decreased 3% compared to the same period in 2015 due primarily to normal weather. On a weather-normalized basis, year-to-date retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, were up 2.8%. Overall, our normalized results for gas and electric sales in 2016 were slightly above our expectations. 
Turning now to our earnings forecast. We expect our 2016 earnings to be at the upper end of our guidance of $2.88 per share to $2.94 per share. The guidance excludes $0.01 per share of acquisition-related costs in the third quarter as well any potential acquisition-related costs that may arise during the fourth quarter. This projection assumes normal weather for the balance of the year and reflects the mild first quarter weather as well as the very warm third quarter weather conditions.
A couple of key points as we look at the annual guidance. First, the very warm weather in the third quarter was mainly in Southeastern Wisconsin, and the majority of the weather-related margins and positive fuel recoveries were in the Wisconsin Electric service territory. This was a benefit to Wisconsin Electric in the third quarter of about $0.08. As you recall, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas have an earnings sharing mechanism in place as part of the acquisition order and, therefore, limit the overall earnings potential for the year.
In addition, we expect an increase in maintenance expense items in the fourth quarter compared to last year. Again, we expect our 2016 earnings to be at the upper end of our $2.88 per share to $2.94 per share guidance range. 
With that, I'll turn things back to Allen."

So you touched on one of the issues, which is the sharing mechanism at Wisconsin Electric. When I say sharing mechanism, the earnings sharing mechanism at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas. And just to keep in mind, that's about 60% of our regulated utilities. So 60% of our earnings would be subject to that earnings sharing mechanism. So we certainly expect that mechanism to kick in and there would be some sharing. In fact, we already approved some sharing in the third quarter. So that's the first factor that will impact -- we expect will impact the fourth quarter. You've touched on that. The other thing, Greg, that I would just emphasize, and Scott talked about this a little bit in his remarks, but remember, the electric fuel recovery mechanisms that we have at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Public Service, they have a dead band. So in dollar terms, it's a [ph] plus or minus $15 million at Wisconsin Electric, it's a plus or minus $6 million at Wisconsin Public Service. And so once you get above those positive recovery levels, all of the dollars go, dollar for dollar above that level, back to refunds for customers. Unlike the third quarter of last year, we actually went all the way to the top of those bands in the third quarter of this year. In the fourth quarter of last year, we had to get well into the fourth quarter before we hit those levels. So that also will introduce another timing difference or earnings timing difference, if you will, in third quarter as opposed to fourth. And the last thing is related to O&M spend. And what really happened, Greg -- it seems like every quarter we talk a lot about the weather, but in the fourth quarter of 2015, that was a very mild weather quarter. And as a result, in order to hit the financial commitments we had, we actually had to cut back a bit on O&M spending. So I view the O&M spend run rate that we had in the fourth quarter of 2015 as being a little abnormal, meaning abnormally low. What I think we'll see in the fourth quarter of this year is more of a normal run rate for the business the way it's configured now. So I think those 3 factors, the earnings sharing mechanisms, hitting the top of the positive recovery bands on fuel in the third quarter and, finally, that difference on O&M timing, I think all of those will impact the fourth quarter. I don't know, Scott, if you want to spend any time at all on the sharing mechanisms."

So Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas have the sharing mechanism. And remember, there's an authorized or allowed return in Wisconsin Electric of about 10.2% ROE and then we share the first 50 basis points above that. So we can theoretically earn up to the 10.45%. And then anything above that or the sharing part of it will be used to basically amortize some of the transmission assets that we have on our balance sheet. That was part of the acquisition order. So that's part of the sharing mechanism that will happen in -- as we look at the fourth quarter again and tie it all together. The -- as we look at the earnings in the fourth quarter last year, if you factor in the interest expense, it's about $0.62 on a comparable basis. And the fuel that Allen talked about, that's about $0.03. So you get down to that $0.59. And the O&M getting back to a normal run way --- rate and maintenance is about $0.02 to $0.03. So it gets into that $0.57, $0.59 range."

Well, in terms of the way the numbers break down, so overall, if we look at our 5-year capital plan, it's about $1.6 billion more than the plan that was laid out in November of 2015 at EEI. So you're exactly right, Greg. It would offset the $1 billion -- roughly $1 billion cash impact of bonus depreciation plus another, say, $550 million on top of that. So just to give you a sense for the types of things, Greg, that are in the $1.6 billion. So we alluded to one of them in the call, so there's $255 million for the generation in Michigan. I certainly see that as a benefit to the customers in the UP and also a benefit to the customers in Wisconsin because once we retire Presque Isle, there'll be about a $40 million O&M savings associated with retiring that plant. Also, in the generation category, we've made the assumption -- we also expect that as soon as we can or we're allowed to by MISO, we want to proceed to retire the Pulliam plant, which is a coal plant in the Green Bay area. And that will leave a generation need in Wisconsin Public Service, and we'll have an option to invest. We have a generation option to the Riverside power plant that Alliant is building. That's about $100 million. So exercising that first option. On the electric distribution side, I think we've talked before about the system modernization and reliability program in the Wisconsin Public Service territory. So we're going to finish the first phase and do a second phase that will be about $100 million. That's a very popular program. We've seen quite significant reliability benefits for the distribution customers in Wisconsin Public Service. On the gas distribution side, just to give you one example, I'm sure you and the other listeners on the call are very familiar with what's going on with FEMSA and the new rules that are coming on gas storage. We believe we're going to require about a $50 million program at the Manlove storage field in Illinois to do well workovers and to put in the subsurface safety valves. So that's another $50 million. And then just to give you a couple of other examples, a number of software projects that we believe are going to result in O&M savings, so short-cycle work management system in Illinois. We're also going to move to automated meters at our Michigan gas utility as well as Minnesota gas utility. So as you could tell, from that litany, I mean, there's quite a number of things that are in that list. And I believe, our team believes that they'll all be beneficial to customers either from a cost standpoint or reliability or both."

If I look at the year-to-date numbers in the earnings packet, one of the things that doesn't really stand out a lot is the impact of O&M, right? So the -- when you give kind of the small verbal -- not verbal, the small written descriptions on Page 11 of what's the contribution at each segment to potentially lower O&M, it's actually not that big of a number, and that strikes me, just at first glance, a little bit surprising given you're not even 1.5 years post-merger. And just curious, is that being embedded somewhere else? Or are you not seeing much in the way of O&M reductions post Integrys? Trying to just think this through a little bit."

I mean, you're right, you're going to see -- or we expect to see somewhat of a deceleration or a lowering in the spending at ATC. However, if you look at the 10-year numbers, the last cycle when they updated their 10-year plan, it was 3.7 to 4.5. This cycle, it's 3.6 to 4.4. So if you look over a 10-year period, the 10-year numbers aren't that different. But in terms of the annual averages, those are -- I would expect they're going to come down somewhat, Michael, because the very, very large, very, very significant reliability projects inside the footprint, a lot of those are done. Now as -- perhaps as generation patterns change in the state because of Clean Power Plan, perhaps you could see an uptick again, but right now, we expect it to come down somewhat. So that's inside the footprint. Outside the footprint, we're certainly pursuing other investments. And we talked about -- on previous calls, we talked about that a little bit.

We went through a very protracted, contested case proceeding in Wisconsin leading up to the actual financial closing of the sale in 2007. Now during that protracted or long contested case proceeding, the commission approved not only the sale of the nuclear plant, the 2 units, so both of the units, but they also reviewed and approved the PPAs. And there were refunds of the above booking -- of the proceeds that we got above booked to the plant [ph] as well as the excess nuclear decommissioning funds that were in the trust. So the PPA as well as the sale all were reviewed in that proceeding. And then ever since then, these PPA payments have been consistently recovered in the fuel clause. So I think all of that background, all that context is important. And I think, Scott, maybe you could fill in.
