Despite sharp declines in product prices, we had a strong year of production growth, particularly in Permian Resources, and we made big strides in lowering our cost structure as well as executing our strategic",1202,"Think you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Despite sharp declines in product prices, we had a strong year of production growth, particularly in Permian Resources, and we made big strides in lowering our cost structure as well as executing our strategic review. I'd like to share highlights of our 2015 achievements. 
First, Permian Resources growth exceeded our expectations as we reached our 2016 growth target of 120,000 BOE per day. This was a year ahead of our original plan. We increased production by 35,000 BOE per day for a year-over-year growth rate of 47%. 
Our reached full production capacity and delivered an average of 35,000 BOE per day of production last year. In total, we grew our production by 81,000 BOE per day, which was approximately 14% higher than 2014. 
We reduced our cash operating cost by 14%, achieved SG&A savings of 16% and cut our average drilling and completion cost in Permian Resources by 33%. 
As a part of our strategic review that we launched at the end of 2013, we sold our Williston Basin properties and made significant progress in our effort to exit non-core areas in the Middle East, including Iraq and Yemen, while also reducing our exposure in Bahrain. This will lead to lower capital spending in the region. 
Construction of the OxyChem ethylene cracker joint venture is on schedule and on budget for startup in early 2017. 
We reached a settlement with the Republic of Ecuador for approximately $1 billion, of which we've collected $300 million and expect to receive the remaining proceeds in the coming months. 
And we exited 2015 with $4.4 billion of cash on our balance sheet. 
Now I'd like to reiterate our strategy and cash flow priorities. I want to emphasize these have not changed. Our overall strategy is to invest in projects that generate long-term value, achieving returns well above our cost of capital while maintaining a conservative balance sheet. Our assets in Colombia, ISND in Qatar, Block 9 in Oman, Permian EOR, and OxyChem provide significant earnings, require relatively low maintenance capital and provide free cash flow in this low price environment. Our most recent addition to this list is our Al Hosn gas project, which is a 30-year joint venture with ADNOC in Abu Dhabi. And the role of our Permian Resources business, the role it will play in our strategy is to provide quick production growth as needed to support our cash flow. 
Our top priority for use of cash flow is and always will be the safety and maintenance of our operations. Our second priority will continue to be funding the dividend. Third is allocating capital to our growth projects. The next priority for any remaining cash would be for potential asset acquisitions and or share repurchases as opportunities arise. 
Commodity businesses are inherently volatile. We maintain a strong balance sheet to not only survive but to take advantage of potential opportunities. We'll invest our capital prudently and maintain a flexible program as we maneuver through this low price cycle. 
As I mentioned earlier, we made great progress last year in lowering our operating and SG&A costs. We plan to further reduce these costs during 2016 and expect that the financial impact of executing on initiatives from our strategic review will be evident through lower cost and capital in the coming months. 
In terms of our capital program for this year, our plan is to carefully reduce our activity levels without harming the strong progress we've made with our growth prospects. We'll fund only those opportunities that exceed our rate of return hurdles. Our 2016 capital program is expected to range from $2.8 billion to $3 billion. This represents a nearly 50% reduction compared to the $5.6 billion spent during 2015. This capital plan should approximate our expected cash from operations at current commodity prices. The majority of this year's spending program will be allocated to the Permian Basin and to completing long-term projects in our chemicals and midstream businesses. Our capital run rate is expected to be higher during the first quarter and falling in subsequent quarters as committed project capital winds down. 
In Permian Resources, our drilling activity will be highly focused on areas in both the Midland and Delaware Basins where we have existing infrastructure, allowing us to achieve higher returns. Our level of activity will help preserve efficiency gains achieved over the past year. 
In Permian EOR, we'll take advantage of reduced cost for labor and materials to modify and expand existing facilities to increase our capacity to handle and inject greater quantities of CO2. This will enable us to implement additional CO2 projects. These projects will have longer duration and a typical production response time of 1 to 2 years. This will result in a modest increase in capital for our EOR business versus last year. Chris will provide greater detail on this year's capital program in a few moments.
Despite the reduction in capital spending, we expect overall company production from our core assets to grow 2% to 4% on average compared to 2015. Our core assets or pro forma for any expected divestment and areas we plan to exit, including the Piceance Basin, Iraq, Yemen and Libya, along with lower exposure in Bahrain. 
The full-year contribution of production from Al Hosn and the startup of Block 62 in Oman should add approximately 35,000 BOE per day of production this year. Overall, domestic production is anticipated to decline slightly through the year, primarily due to declining natural gas and NGL volumes caused by the curtailment of drilling activity in our gas assets in late 2014. We expect a modest increase in production from Permian Resources versus last year and will hold our Permian EOR production flat.
Turning to our oil and gas reserves. The good news is that we managed to get our proved producing reserves essentially flat in 2015 due to our development programs and improved recovery from some of our Permian Resources wells. We continued to see strong performance from our Permian Resources drilling program, which enabled us to replace 214% of our resources production, excluding net sales, in revisions. Our development program sat at 149 million BOE of proved reserves. Our year-end 2015 proved reserves totaled 2.2 billion BOE, consisting of 79% proved developed reserves, up from 71% proved developed reserves at the end of 2014. Our liquids reserves comprised 74% of our total proved reserve base. 
In summary, while the macroenvironment remains challenging for the industry, we delivered strong production growth during 2015. We lowered our cost structure and continued to execute on our strategic review. Although we expect commodity prices to gradually recover, we set our plan to be more aligned with the lower price environment. We're fortunate to have a great set of assets for the relatively low base decline rates that provide us enormous flexibility for our capital. We believe our continued focus on returns, improved cost structure and strong balance sheet provide us with the opportunity to emerge from the current cycle as a stronger company relative to our peers. 
I'll now turn the call to Chris Stavros for a review of our financial results and for the details on this year's capital program."
293286,321694349,926543,"Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Occidental Petroleum Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Vicki, and good morning, everyone. As Vicki indicated, we continue to have 3 main objectives over the long term: generate rates of return on invested capital that are well above our cost of capital, sustainability and growth of our dividend and mo",2286,"Thanks, Vicki, and good morning, everyone. As Vicki indicated, we continue to have 3 main objectives over the long term: generate rates of return on invested capital that are well above our cost of capital, sustainability and growth of our dividend and moderate volume growth of the business. 
With regard to returns, we need to strike a balance between managing our capital within a very low commodity price environment and also ensuring that our business is properly positioned for recovery. We don't believe that a depleting or shrinking business over the long haul can maintain high rates of return, and part of our model is to balance of the need for growth and the safety and sustainability of business while maintaining attractive returns. Our focus is generating attractive returns and making investments through the cycle in long-term assets that provide us with stable cash flow to see us through during weaker periods. 
Despite the low price environment, we've been able to realign our business to focus on our core areas, reduce our overall cost structure through capital efficiencies, lower our total operating cost and SG&A while significantly increasing production in our Permian Resources operations. 
In the Middle East North Africa, the Al Hosn gas project was brought to full capacity by midyear, and we also moved forward with exiting some of our noncore assets in the region and eliminating the capital associated with those businesses. 
In terms of our capital spending, we adjusted our program last year in response to the sharp decline in product prices with our full-year 2015 expenditures coming in at $5.6 billion, a 36% reduction from the prior year. Despite this reduction in our spending, we grew our total oil and gas production volumes by 14% from last year. 
As we look into 2016, we remain focused on allocating our capital where we have the best returns, including winding down our capital commitments for longer-term projects. We estimate our 2016 total capital program to be between $2.8 billion to $3 billion and no higher than $3 billion. This year's capital budget represents a nearly 50% reduction in our overall spending compared to last year and only 1/3 of what we spent in 2014. The oil and gas segment is expected to comprise approximately 2/3 of our overall spending this year compared to nearly 80% last year. We expect the majority of our total 2016 spending will be allocated toward domestic oil and gas business, primarily in the Permian Basin, with roughly 21% to be spent in Permian Resources and about 17% going towards Permian EOR. We expect this year's spending in our international oil and gas operations to be about half the level of outlays seen in 2015. Capital allocated toward our Middle East North Africa oil and gas business is expected to be roughly 21% of total spending, with the majority going towards Oman. The year-over-year decline of about 56% in the Middle East is partly the result of our exit from several countries and our plan to run a more focused business targeting our core areas. The remaining 1/3of this year's overall capital spending is expected to be split nearly equally between our chemical and midstream businesses, of which $500 million of the total is capital committed for projects that we expect to be completed by the end of 2016.
Turning to our results. Our core financial results for the final quarter of 2015 were a loss of $129 million or $0.17 per diluted share, a decrease from both the year-ago quarter and also the third quarter of 2015. The decline in core results is nearly all attributable to weaker commodity prices. 
Reported results for GAAP purposes for the fourth quarter were a loss of $5.2 billion or $6.78 per diluted share. The reported results include $5.4 billion of net after-tax charges, mostly related to asset impairments. 
Oxy follows a successful efforts method of accounting where we review our proved oil and gas properties for indications of impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the oil and gas properties may not be adequately recovered such as when there's a significant drop in the futures curve. During the course of the year, the carrying value of our operations in Middle East North Africa was reduced by $4.5 billion, with $3 billion of this taken in the fourth quarter. This action was due to a combination of our exit from noncore areas and a reduction of our exposure to unprofitable projects in the region in an effort to focus the business on improving profitability. 
Impairments of our domestic properties amounted to $2.2 billion for all of 2015 and approximately $870 million for the fourth quarter. Almost 1/2 of the total year impairments in the U.S. were due to the exit of noncore assets in the Williston and Piceance Basin. The other 1/2 related to the reduction of the futures price curve as well as management's decision not to pursue activity associated with certain nonproducing acreage. 
In addition, we took a charge of $520 million in the fourth quarter associated with our century gas processing plant as a result of Sandridge's inability to provide volumes to the plant and in order to meet their contractual obligations to deliver CO2.
Oil and gas core after-tax results for the fourth quarter of 2015 were a loss of $189 million and down $206 million on a sequential quarterly basis. For the fourth quarter of 2015, total company oil and gas production volumes from ongoing operations averaged 671,000 BOE per day, 75,000 BOE per day higher compared to the prior-year period and essentially flat with third quarter volumes. This excludes production from the Williston assets for all periods. 
Our fourth quarter 2015 worldwide realized oil price of $38.68 per barrel fell by $9.10 a barrel or 19% compared to third quarter realizations of $47.78 a barrel and down 46% compared to the prior year's fourth quarter. 
Domestic oil production was 190,000 barrels per day during the fourth quarter, sequential quarterly increase of 2,000 barrels per day and an increase of 19,000 barrels per day from the year-ago period. 
Production in our Permian Resources business grew to 118,000 BOE per day during the fourth quarter, up 40% from the prior year. Volumes were also able to grow sequentially despite weather-related outages. 
Oil and gas cash operating costs were $9.95 per BOE for the fourth quarter of 2015 and $11.57 per BOE for the total year 2015 compared to $13.50 per BOE for the prior year. The reduction in cost was seen in both our domestic and international operations and reflects decreased activity in downhole maintenance and a lower overall cost structure. 
The DD&A for full year 2015 was under $16 per BOE compared to $17 per BOE seen during 2014. 
Taxes other than an income, which are directly related to product prices, were $1.32 per BOE for the 12 months of 2015 compared to $2.45 per BOE in the prior year. 
Fourth quarter exploration expense was $13 million. 
Chemical's fourth quarter 2015 pretax core earnings were $116 million compared with third quarter earnings of $174 million and $160 million in the year-ago quarter. The sequential quarterly decrease from earlier reflected weaker chlorovinyls demand and lower PVC prices which negatively impacted margins. This was partially offset by higher caustic soda prices and lower energy costs. 
Midstream pretax core results were a loss of $45 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to income of $31 million in the third quarter. The sequential decline in the fourth quarter was mainly attributable to lower oil marketing and power generation margins. The marketing results continue to reflect lower margins due to the narrowing of the Midland and Gulf Coast differentials as the increase in oil supply lowered premiums in the Gulf coast. The power generation business reflected lower seasonal spark spreads and higher maintenance cost in the fourth quarter.
Looking at our 12 months cash flow for 2015, we generated $4.8 billion of cash flow from continuing operations before working capital. Working capital changes was a use of $880 million, the majority of which occurred during the first half of the year. 
Capital expenditures for 2015 were $5.6 billion, a 36% decline from the $8.7 billion we spent in 2014. We received over $700 million of net proceeds from activity associated with asset divestitures and acquisitions, which included fourth quarter proceeds of approximately $600 million for our Williston assets. 
In the second quarter, we completed a bond offering, issuing senior notes for which we received net proceeds of roughly $1.5 billion. We indicated at the time of the offering that the proceeds would be used to partially pre-fund some of our debt maturing in the first half of 2016. Earlier this week, we used cash on hand to retire $700 million of our senior notes that had matured. We returned $2.9 billion of cash to our shareholders by paying $2.3 billion in dividends and repurchasing 7.4 million of our shares for approximately $600 million. Our long-term debt to capitalization was 22% at year-end. The worldwide effective tax rate on our core income was 29% for the fourth quarter of 2015 and 86% for the total year. 
Looking into 2016, and as we show on Slide 23 and the handout, we started the year with $4.4 billion of cash. During the fourth quarter, at $42 WTI, we generated operating cash flow before working capital of approximately $900 million or roughly $3.6 billion on an annualized basis. Every dollar change in the oil price impacts our cash flow by about $100 million annually. We expect to receive an additional $900 million of cash this year from our settlement with Ecuador, of which we have collected $300 million to date, and approximately $300 million of proceeds from asset sales during this quarter. Earlier this week, S&P reaffirmed our single A credit rating along with a stable outlook.
Turning to our oil and gas production. For purposes of year-to-year comparison and in terms of providing guidance for 2016, volumes are pro forma and exclude assets we've either already or planned to divest or exit from this year. These assets would include Williston and Piceance in the U.S. and Iraq, Yemen, Bahrain and Libya in the Middle East, North Africa. 
On this same-store sales basis, we expect our full year 2016 production to grow 2% to 4% when range of 570,000 to 585,000 BOE per day compared to about 560,000 BOE per day last year. In the U.S., we have ceased all gas drilling activity, and we'll focus our capital in the Permian in an effort to grow our oil volumes and is justified by attractive returns. We expect the total domestic oil and gas production to be in the range of 270,000 to 285,000 BOE per day in 2016, which includes oil production growth of about 4% and partly offset by modest declines in gas production. More than 2/3 of our domestic production volumes are expected to be oil. 
Production in Permian Resources is expected to average 123,000 BOE per day during the first half of 2016, an increase of 8% compared to the same period last year. Permian EOR volume should remain relatively flat at about 145,000 BOE per day, while providing stable cash flow. 
In our core international areas in the Middle East and Colombia, we expect production to increase to roughly a 300,000 BOE per day this year compared to 268,000 BOE per day in 2015 as a result of a full year's contribution from Al Hosn as well as a startup of gas production from Block 62 in Oman. 
In terms of production for the first quarter, on a reported basis and unadjusted for pending divestments or exits, we expect our total production to be in the range of 620,000 to 630,000 BOE per day. Permian Resources volume should increase about 3,000 BOE per day sequentially to 121,000 BOE per day.
Production in the Middle East is expected to be negatively impacted in the quarter by about 15,000 BOE per day due to scheduled maintenance turnarounds at both Dolphin and Al Hosn. 
Our DD&A expense for oil and gas is expected to be approximately $15 per BOE during 2016. The combined depreciation for the chemical and midstream segments should be approximately $675 million for the year. 
Cash operating cost for the domestic oil and gas business should be about $13 per BOE during 2016, about $1 per BOE lower than last year's level for our ongoing operations. 
Exploration expense for the year is estimated to be about $75 million pretax, with $25 million of that anticipated in the first quarter. 
The realignment of our business helps us make strong progress in lowering our SG&A costs last year by more than $200 million. In the current environment, we expect to reduce these costs by at least another $100 million into 2016. Price changes at current global prices affect our annual operating cash flow by about $100 million for every dollar per barrel change in WTI. A swing of $0.50 per million BTUs in domestic natural gas prices affects annual operating cash flow by about $40 million. 
We expect our first quarter 2016 pretax chemical earnings to be about $140 million. Our chemical operations are essentially margin business, and so while our cost may decline as a result of lower energy prices, prices for the chemical products we sell continue to be driven by demand. Using current strip prices for oil and gas, we expect our 2016 domestic tax rate to be 36% and our international tax rate to be about 55%. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jody Elliot who will discuss activity around our Permian operations."

Today I'll review 2015 highlights from Permian Resources and Permian EOR and provide guidance on our program for 2016. 2015 was a very successful year. Permian Resources achieved our 2016 growth target ahead of schedule by reaching 120,0",1094,"Thank you, Chris. Today I'll review 2015 highlights from Permian Resources and Permian EOR and provide guidance on our program for 2016. 2015 was a very successful year. Permian Resources achieved our 2016 growth target ahead of schedule by reaching 120,000 BOE per day in November. We achieved this milestone by leveraging our advancements in geoscience, reservoir characterization and integrated planning to deliver better wells in less than half the time in a 2/3 of the cost versus 2014. Throughout 2015, we reduced our OpEx cost by over 20% by improving field reliability, productivity and optimizing our surface and subsurface engineering. Our Permian EOR segment generated free cash flow in a low price environment and had its best safety metrics of all time.
Turning to Permian Resources. In the fourth quarter, we achieved record production of 118,000 BOE per day, a 40% increase versus the prior year. Oil production increased to 76,000 barrels per day, a 2% increase from the previous quarter and a 49% increase from a year ago. Winter storms at the end of December impacted total quarter production by approximately 1,300 BOE per day. For the full year, the business achieved production of 110,000 BOE per day, a 47% increase versus the prior year. 
Permian Resources continues to drive down capital costs through improved execution and drilling and well completions and reduced time-to-market. For each of our core development areas, we continue to monitor both our early time well performance and cumulative production to ensure our development approach is providing maximum value. In addition to improving individual well performance, we optimize fill development value through pace, well sequencing, flowback designs to reduce cleanouts and fluid handling cost, artificial lift designs to maximize long-term production and facility plans to ensure maximum utilization over time. 
Our Delaware Basin well performance continues to be strong. We placed 19 horizontal wells on production in the Wolfcamp A benches in the fourth quarter. We continued to increase well performance by optimizing the density of our completions and profit loads and drilling longer laterals. For example, the priest E1H well achieved a peak rate of 1,659 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,247 BOE per day. The HB Morrison B12H achieved a peak rate of 1,487 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,176 BOE per day. 
In the Mexico, we're delivering more productive wells by increasing our profit concentration and reducing cluster spacing. For example, the second Bone Spring Cedar Canyon 27 #6 produced at a peak rate of 2,498 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,750 BOE per day at an 82% oil cut. 
In the Delaware Basin, our Wolfcamp A 4,500-foot well costs decreased by about 45% from the 2014 costs of $10.9 million to a current cost of $6.2 million. We reduced our drilling time by 26 days from the 2014 average of 43 days to 17 days. 
In our new area of the Midland Basin, we brought the Adams 4231 Wolfcamp A online in the fourth quarter at a peak rate of 2,167 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,841 BOE per day. We also brought online the Merchant 1409 A well at a peak rate of 1,345 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,132 BOE per day. Both wells are producing at over 80% oil cut. 
In the Midland Basin, we made similar improvements in well costs and drilling days in the Wolfcamp A formation. We reduced these costs, the 7,500-foot horizontal wells by 35% from the 2014 cost of $9.2 million to a current cost of $6 million. We reduced our drilling days by 63% from 46 days in 2014 to 17 days in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Across Permian Resources, we're continuing to lower field operating expenses through optimized water handling, lower workover expenses and better downhole performance. Since the fourth quarter of 2014, we've reduced our operating cost per barrel by 26% and expect this trend to continue this year. 
In our Permian EOR segment, we continue to lower our drilling costs and manage the operations to run our gas processing facilities at full capacity. With resilient base production and low capital requirements, the EOR business continues to generate free cash flow at low product prices. We've lowered our cash operating expenses by 21%, driven mainly by lower downhole maintenance and inject in cost. The Phase 1 of CO2 injection at South Hobbs has continued and we have a production response sooner than expected. We expect Phase I production to peak in 2020. We expect Phase I and Phase II to develop 28 million BOE at just over $10 per BOE. Additionally, we started a pilot project in South Hobbs testing the residual oil zone. It has the potential to add about 80 million barrels of reserves. These residual oil zone reserves can be added between $3 and $7 per barrel of development cost.
Given the current oil price, we will focus investment to achieve 4 goals: Accelerate geoscience characterization and modeling programs to enhance recovery, well performance and field economic returns; minimize base decline and set up major growth programs in both resources and EOR; focus on game-changing technologies and applications; and accelerate continued improvement in both execution and cost. One of the key drivers of our gains in well performance has been integrating our technical understanding of the subsurface to optimize well completions. Slide 41 illustrates our inventory at Permian Resources well locations by breakeven prices. By improving both well cost and performance, we continue to make more inventory economically viable in a low-cost environment. For example, we transferred about 700 locations from above the $60.00 per barrel hurdle to under $60 per barrel. Furthermore, we moved 350 locations under the $40 per barrel hurdle. We expect to continue lowering the hurdle point on our inventory as we move forward. 
With current oil prices,  our activity in 2016 will focus on core locations that require minimal infrastructure investments. In addition, we will gather high priority appraisal data to support future development and initiate seed projects for long-term growth in EOR. Over the first half of this year, we will reduce our rig count to between 2 and 4 drilling rigs in the Permian. Our technical staff and engineers will focus on long-term projects, enhancing base production, preparing full field development plans to ramp up activity when oil prices recover. We're taking appropriate steps to preserve the efficiency gains achieved and are well-positioned for growth as prices recover. 
I'll now turn the call back to Chris Degner."

What we've done really is planned our programs over the next few years to -- based on actually the strip prices. Although we actually believe that prices ultimately will be higher than the strip, we don't expect prices to really recover much until very late this year or maybe early next year and recover only slightly above the curve. But based on the cash that we have on hand and what we project our situation will be over the next few years, we do expect to be able to make it through this cycle and get back to reasonable oil prices and secure our dividend throughout this entire process. We are organizing our plans and our activities around that. And the good thing about our portfolio is we have the flexibility to ramp up and down as necessary to ensure that we'll meet our priorities. And as we said, the top priority is just the maintenance and safety of our operations. And then we're going to pay the dividend, and we've got the cash to do that. And generally, the way we'll look at it is we can use our cash flow from operations to cover our capital programs and part of our dividends over some of the years. And then what can't be covered by our cash flow from operations, we'll certainly use the strength of our balance sheet to cover that. So we don't see a threat to our dividend going through this cycle."

Our -- we are very proud of our shale position, and we think that the work we've done over the last few years has certainly proved it up to be an asset that we want to take full advantage of. But currently, our shale production is less than 20% of our total company production, and we don't really want it to ever be much higher than that because we feel like to have the asset base we have, that's part of the reason we'll be able to make it through this cycle with our current low declines.

And I know you've heard all those numbers from me before. But we are really taking that data and taking it to the next level. We have a team that works with our resources team. Our resources team, I just have to say, is incredibly efficient in what they've been able to do to drive the drilling cost down, the completion optimization and all the things that Jody has talked about, they've done a great job. It's just been incredible. But in addition to that, that team supporting them from a downhole side standpoint is our exploitation team, which takes all that data that we get from every well. And we utilize every bit of data we can, not only applying data analytics to it, but taking a lot more data than other people have access to. I think we still have the only horizontal core in the Permian. We're doing much more modeling around geomodeling and learning more about the thermal maturity of the -- and the migration of the hydrocarbons.

Despite sharp declines in product prices, we had a strong year of production growth, particularly in Permian Resources, and we made big strides in lowering our cost structure as well as executing our strategic",1205,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Despite sharp declines in product prices, we had a strong year of production growth, particularly in Permian Resources, and we made big strides in lowering our cost structure as well as executing our strategic review. I'd like to share highlights of our 2015 achievements. 
First, Permian Resources growth exceeded our expectations as we reached our 2016 growth target of 120,000 BOE per day. This was a year ahead of our original plan. We increased production by 35,000 BOE per day for a year-over-year growth rate of 47%. 
Al Hosn reached full production capacity and delivered an average of 35,000 BOE per day of production last year. In total, we grew our production by 81,000 BOE per day, which was approximately 14% higher than 2014. 
We reduced our cash operating cost by 14%, achieved SG&A savings of 16% and cut our average drilling and completion cost in Permian Resources by 33%. 
As a part of our strategic review that we launched at the end of 2013, we sold our Williston Basin properties and made significant progress in our effort to exit non-core areas in the Middle East, including Iraq and Yemen, while also reducing our exposure in Bahrain. This will lead to lower capital spending in the region. 
Construction of the OxyChem ethylene cracker joint venture is on schedule and on budget for startup in early 2017. 
We reached a settlement with the Republic of Ecuador for approximately $1 billion, of which we've collected $300 million and expect to receive the remaining proceeds in the coming months. 
And we exited 2015 with $4.4 billion of cash on our balance sheet. 
Now I'd like to reiterate our strategy and cash flow priorities. I want to emphasize these have not changed. Our overall strategy is to invest in projects that generate long-term value, achieving returns well above our cost of capital while maintaining a conservative balance sheet. Our assets in Colombia, ISND in Qatar, Block 9 in Oman, Permian EOR, Dolphin and OxyChem provide significant earnings, require relatively low maintenance capital and provide free cash flow in this low price environment. Our most recent addition to this list is our Al Hosn gas project, which is a 30-year joint venture with ADNOC in Abu Dhabi. And the role of our Permian Resources business, the role it will play in our strategy, is to provide quick production growth as needed to support our cash flow. 
Our top priority for use of cash flow is, and always will be, the safety and maintenance of our operations. Our second priority will continue to be funding the dividend. Third is allocating capital to our growth projects. The next priority for any remaining cash would be for potential asset acquisitions and or share repurchases as opportunities arise. 
Commodity businesses are inherently volatile. We maintain a strong balance sheet to not only survive but to take advantage of potential opportunities. We'll invest our capital prudently and maintain a flexible program as we maneuver through this low price cycle. 
As I mentioned earlier, we made great progress last year o lowering our operating and SG&A costs. We plan to further reduce these costs during 2016 and expect that the financial impact of executing on initiatives from our strategic review will be evident through lower cost and capital in the coming months. 
In terms of our capital program for this year, our plan is to carefully reduce our activity levels without harming the strong progress we've made with our growth prospects. We'll fund only those opportunities that exceed our rate of return hurdles. Our 2016 capital program is expected to range from $2.8 billion to $3 billion. This represents a nearly 50% reduction compared to the $5.6 billion spent during 2015. This capital plan should approximate our expected cash from operations at current commodity prices. The majority of this year's spending program will be allocated to the Permian Basin and to completing long-term projects in our chemicals and midstream businesses. Our capital run rate is expected to be higher during the first quarter and falling in subsequent quarters as committed project capital winds down. 
In Permian Resources, our drilling activity will be highly focused on areas in both the Midland and Delaware Basins where we have existing infrastructure, allowing us to achieve higher returns. Our level of activity will help preserve efficiency gains achieved over the past year. 
In Permian EOR, we'll take advantage of reduced cost for labor and materials to modify and expand existing facilities to increase our capacity to handle and inject greater quantities of CO2. This will enable us to implement additional CO2 projects. These projects will have longer duration and a typical production response time of 1 to 2 years. This will result in a modest increase in capital for our EOR business versus last year. Chris will provide greater detail on this year's capital program in a few moments.
Despite the reduction in capital spending, we expect overall company production from our core assets to grow 2% to 4% on average compared to 2015. Our core assets or pro forma for any expected divestment in areas we plan to exit, including the Piceance Basin, Iraq, Yemen and Libya, along with lower exposure in Bahrain. 
The full-year contribution of production from Al Hosn and the startup of Block 62 in Oman should add approximately 35,000 BOE per day of production this year. Overall, domestic production is anticipated to decline slightly through the year, primarily due to declining natural gas and NGL volumes caused by the curtailment of drilling activity in our gas assets in late 2014. We expect a modest increase in production from Permian Resources versus last year and will hold our Permian EOR production flat.
Turning to our oil and gas reserves. The good news is that we managed to keep our proved producing reserves essentially flat in 2015 due to our development programs and improved recovery from some of our Permian Resources wells. We continued to see strong performance from our Permian Resources drilling program, which enabled us to replace 214% of our resources production, excluding net sales and revisions. Our development program sat at 149 million BOE of proved reserves. Our year-end 2015 proved reserves totaled 2.2 billion BOE, consisting of 79% proved developed reserves, up from 71% proved developed reserves at the end of 2014. Our liquids reserves comprised 74% of our total proved reserve base. 
In summary, while the macroenvironment remains challenging for the industry, we delivered strong production growth during 2015. We lowered our cost structure and continued to execute on our strategic review. Although we expect commodity prices to gradually recover, we've set our plan to be more aligned with a lower price environment. We're fortunate to have a great set of assets for the relatively low base decline rates that provide us with enormous flexibility for our capital. We believe our continued focus on returns, improved cost structure and strong balance sheet provide us with the opportunity to emerge from the current cycle as a stronger company relative to our peers. 
I'll now turn the call to Chris Stavros for a review of our financial results and for the details on this year's capital program."

As Vicki indicated, we continue to have 3 main objectives over the long term: Generate rates of return on invested capital that are well above our cost of capital; sustainability and growth of our dividend; and moderate volume growth of the business. 
With regard to returns, we need to strike a balance between managing our capital within the very low commodity price environment and also ensuring that our business is properly positioned for a recovery. We don't believe that a depleting or shrinking business over the long haul can maintain high rates of return, and part of our model is to balance the need for growth and the safety and sustainability of business while maintaining attractive returns. Our focus is generating attractive returns and making investments through the cycle in long-term assets that provide us with stable cash flow to see us through during weaker periods. 
Despite the low price environment, we've been able to realign our business to focus on our core areas, reduce our overall cost structure through capital efficiencies, lower our total operating cost and SG&A while significantly increasing production in our Permian Resources operations. 
In the Middle East North Africa, the Al Hosn gas project was brought to full capacity by midyear, and we also moved forward with exiting some of our noncore assets in the region and eliminating the capital associated with those businesses. 
In terms of our capital spending, we adjusted our program last year in response to the sharp decline in product prices, with our full-year 2015 expenditures coming in at $5.6 billion, a 36% reduction from the prior year. Despite this reduction in our spending, we grew our total oil and gas production volumes by 14% from last year. 
As we look into 2016, we remain focused on allocating our capital where we have the best returns, including winding down our capital commitments for longer-term projects. We estimate our 2016 total capital program to be between $2.8 billion to $3 billion and no higher than $3 billion. This year's capital budget represents a nearly 50% reduction in our overall spending compared to last year and only 1/3 of what we spent in 2014. The oil and gas segment is expected to comprise approximately 2/3 of our overall spending this year compared to nearly 80% last year. We expect the majority of our total 2016 spending will be allocated toward domestic oil and gas business, primarily in the Permian Basin, with roughly 21% to be spent in Permian Resources and about 17% going towards Permian EOR. We expect this year's spending in our international oil and gas operations to be about half the level of outlays seen in 2015. Capital allocated toward our Middle East North Africa oil and gas business is expected to be roughly 21% of total spending, with the majority going towards Oman. The year-over-year decline of about 56% in the Middle East is partly the result of our exit from several countries and our plan to run a more focused business targeting our core areas. The remaining 1/3 of this year's overall capital spending is expected to be split nearly equally between our chemical and midstream businesses, of which $500 million of the total is capital committed for projects that we expect to be completed by the end of 2016.
Turning to our results. Our core financial results for the final quarter of 2015 were a loss of $129 million or $0.17 per diluted share, a decrease from both the year-ago quarter and also the third quarter of 2015. The decline in core results is nearly all attributable to weaker commodity prices. 
Reported results for GAAP purposes for the fourth quarter were a loss of $5.2 billion or $6.78 per diluted share. The reported results include $5.4 billion of net after-tax charges, mostly related to asset impairments. 
Oxy follows a successful efforts method of accounting where we review our proved oil and gas properties for indications of impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the oil and gas properties may not be adequately recovered such as when there's a significant drop in the futures curve. During the course of the year, the carrying value of our operations in the Middle East North Africa was reduced by $4.5 billion, with $3 billion of this taken in the fourth quarter. This action was due to a combination of our exit from noncore areas and a reduction of our exposure to unprofitable projects in the region in an effort to focus the business on improving profitability. 
Impairments of our domestic properties amounted to $2.2 billion for all of 2015 and approximately $870 million for the fourth quarter. Almost 1/2 of the total year impairments in the U.S. were due to the exit of noncore assets in the Williston and Piceance Basins. The other 1/2 related to the reduction in the futures price curve as well as management's decision not to pursue activity associated with certain nonproducing acreage. 
In addition, we took a charge of $520 million in the fourth quarter associated with our century gas processing plant as a result of Sandridge's inability to provide volumes to the plant and in order to meet their contractual obligations to deliver CO2.
Oil and gas core after-tax results for the fourth quarter of 2015 were a loss of $189 million and down $206 million on a sequential quarterly basis. For the fourth quarter of 2015, total company oil and gas production volumes from ongoing operations averaged 671,000 BOE per day, 75,000 BOE per day higher compared to the prior-year period and essentially flat with third quarter volumes. This excludes production from the Williston assets for all periods. 
Our fourth quarter 2015 worldwide realized oil price of $38.68 per barrel fell by $9.10 a barrel or 19% compared to third quarter realizations of $47.78 a barrel and down 46% compared to the prior year's fourth quarter. 
Domestic oil production was 190,000 barrels per day during the fourth quarter, sequential quarterly increase of 2,000 barrels per day and an increase of 19,000 barrels per day from the year-ago period. 
Production in our Permian Resources business grew to 118,000 BOE per day during the fourth quarter, up 40% from the prior year. Volumes were also able to grow sequentially despite weather-related outages. 
Oil and gas cash operating costs were $9.95 per BOE for the fourth quarter of 2015 and $11.57 per BOE for the total year 2015 compared to $13.50 per BOE for the prior year. The reduction in cost was seen in both our domestic and international operations and reflects decreased activity in downhome maintenance and a lower overall cost structure. 
The DD&A for full year 2015 was under $16 per BOE compared to $17 per BOE during -- seen during 2014. 
Taxes other than on income, which are directly related to product prices, were $1.32 per BOE for the 12 months of 2015 compared to $2.45 per BOE in the prior year. 
Fourth quarter exploration expense was $13 million. 
Chemical's fourth quarter 2015 pretax core earnings were $116 million compared with third quarter earnings of $174 million and $160 million in the year-ago quarter. The sequential quarterly decrease from earlier reflected weaker chlorovinyls demand and lower PVC prices which negatively impacted margins. This was partially offset by higher caustic soda prices and lower energy costs. 
Midstream pretax core results were a loss of $45 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to income of $31 million in the third quarter. The sequential decline in the fourth quarter was mainly attributable to lower oil marketing and power generation margins. The marketing results continue to reflect lower margins due to the narrowing of the Midland and Gulf Coast differentials as the increase in oil supply lowered premiums in the Gulf coast. The power generation business reflected lower seasonal spark spreads and higher maintenance cost in the fourth quarter.
Looking at our 12 months cash flow for 2015, we generated $4.8 billion of cash flow from continuing operations before working capital. Working capital changes was a use of $880 million, the majority of which occurred during the first half of the year. 
Capital expenditures for 2015 were $5.6 billion, a 36% decline from the $8.7 billion we spent in 2014. We received over $700 million of net proceeds from activity associated with asset divestitures and acquisitions, which included fourth quarter proceeds of approximately $600 million for our Williston assets. 
In the second quarter, we completed a bond offering, issuing senior notes for which we received net proceeds of roughly $1.5 billion. We indicated at the time of the offering that the proceeds would be used to partially pre-fund some of our debt maturing in the first half of 2016. Earlier this week, we used cash on hand to retire $700 million of our senior notes that had matured. We returned $2.9 billion of cash to our shareholders by paying $2.3 billion in dividends and repurchasing 7.4 million of our shares for approximately $600 million. Our long-term debt to capitalization was 22% at year-end. The worldwide effective tax rate on our core income was 29% for the fourth quarter of 2015 and 86% for the total year. 
Looking into 2016, and as we show on Slide 23 and in the handout, we started the year with $4.4 billion of cash. During the fourth quarter, at $42 WTI, we generated operating cash flow before working capital of approximately $900 million or roughly $3.6 billion on an annualized basis. Every dollar change in the oil price impacts our cash flow by about $100 million annually. We expect to receive an additional $900 million of cash this year from our settlement with Ecuador, of which we have collected $300 million to date, and approximately $300 million of proceeds from asset sales during this quarter. Earlier this week, S&P reaffirmed our single A credit rating along with a stable outlook.
Turning to our oil and gas production. For purposes of year-to-year comparison and in terms of providing guidance for 2016, volumes are pro forma and exclude assets we have either already or plan to divest or exit from this year. These assets would include Williston and Piceance in the U.S. and Iraq, Yemen, Bahrain and Libya in the Middle East, North Africa. 
On this same-store sales basis, we expect our full year 2016 production to grow 2% to 4% with a range of 570,000 to 585,000 BOE per day compared to about 560,000 BOE per day last year. In the U.S., we have ceased all gas drilling activity, and we'll focus our capital in the Permian in an effort to grow our oil volumes and is justified by attractive returns. We expect the total domestic oil and gas production to be in the range of 270,000 to 285,000 BOE per day in 2016, which includes oil production growth of about 4% and partly offset by modest declines in gas production. More than 2/3 of our domestic production volumes are expected to be oil. 
Production in Permian Resources is expected to average 123,000 BOE per day during the first half of 2016, an increase of 8% compared to the same period last year. Permian EOR volume should remain relatively flat at about 145,000 BOE per day, while providing stable cash flow. 
In our core international areas in the Middle East and Colombia, we expect production to increase to roughly a 300,000 BOE per day this year compared to 268,000 BOE per day in 2015 as a result of a full year's contribution from Al Hosn as well as a startup of gas production from Block 62 in Oman. 
In terms of production for the first quarter, on a reported basis and unadjusted for pending divestments or exits, we expect our total production to be in the range of 620,000 to 630,000 BOE per day. Permian Resources volume should increase about 3,000 BOE per day sequentially to 121,000 BOE per day.
Production in the Middle East is expected to be negatively impacted in the quarter by about 15,000 BOE per day due to scheduled maintenance turnarounds at both Dolphin and Al Hosn. 
Our DD&A expense for oil and gas is expected to be approximately $15 per BOE during 2016. The combined depreciation for the chemical and midstream segments should be approximately $675 million for the year. 
Cash operating cost for the domestic oil and gas business should be about $13 per BOE during 2016, about $1 per BOE lower than last year's level for our ongoing operations. 
Exploration expense for the year is estimated to be about $75 million pretax, with $25 million of that anticipated in the first quarter. 
The realignment of our business helped us make strong progress in lowering our SG&A costs last year by more than $200 million. In the current environment, we expect to reduce these costs by at least another $100 million into 2016. Price changes at current global prices affect our annual operating cash flow by about $100 million for every dollar per barrel change in WTI. A swing of $0.50 per million BTUs in domestic natural gas prices affects annual operating cash flow by about $40 million. 
We expect our first quarter 2016 pretax chemical earnings to be about $140 million. Our chemical operations are essentially margin business, and so while our cost may decline as a result of lower energy prices, prices for the chemical products we sell continue to be driven by demand. Using current strip prices for oil and gas, we expect our 2016 domestic tax rate to be at 36% and our international tax rate to be about 55%. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jody Elliot who will discuss activity around our Permian operations."

Today I'll review 2015 highlights from Permian Resources and Permian EOR and provide guidance on our program for 2016. 2015 was a very successful year. Permian Resources achieved our 2016 growth target ahead of schedule by reaching 120,0",1097,"Thank you, Chris. Today I'll review 2015 highlights from Permian Resources and Permian EOR and provide guidance on our program for 2016. 2015 was a very successful year. Permian Resources achieved our 2016 growth target ahead of schedule by reaching 120,000 BOE per day in November. We achieved this milestone by leveraging our advancements in geoscience, reservoir characterization and integrated planning to deliver better wells in less than half the time and at 2/3 of the cost versus 2014. Throughout 2015, we reduced our OpEx cost by over 20% by improving field reliability, productivity and optimizing our surface and subsurface engineering. Our Permian EOR segment generated free cash flow in a low price environment and had its best safety metrics of all time.
Turning to Permian Resources. In the fourth quarter, we achieved record production of 118,000 BOE per day, a 40% increase versus the prior year. Oil production increased to 76,000 barrels per day, a 2% increase from the previous quarter and a 49% increase from a year ago. Winter storms at the end of December impacted total quarter production by approximately 1,300 BOE per day. For the full year, the business achieved production of 110,000 BOE per day, a 47% increase versus the prior year. 
Permian Resources continues to drive down capital cost through improved execution and drilling and well completions and reduced time-to-market. For each of our core development areas, we continue to monitor both our early time well performance and cumulative production to ensure our development approach is providing maximum value. In addition to improving individual well performance, we optimize field development value through pace, well sequencing, flowback designs to reduce cleanouts and fluid handling cost, artificial lift designs to maximize long-term production and facility plans to ensure maximum utilization over time. 
Our Delaware Basin well performance continues to be strong. We placed 19 horizontal wells on production in the Wolfcamp A benches in the fourth quarter. We continue to increase well performance by optimizing the density of our completions and proppant loads and drilling longer laterals. For example, the Priest E 1H well achieved a peak rate of 1,659 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,247 BOE per day. The H.B. Morrison B 12H achieved a peak rate of 1,487 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,176 BOE per day. 
In New Mexico, we're delivering more productive wells by increasing our proppant concentration and reducing cluster spacing. For example, the second Bone Spring Cedar Canyon 27 #6 produced at a peak rate of 2,498 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,750 BOE per day at an 82% oil cut. 
In the Delaware Basin, our Wolfcamp A 4,500-foot well cost decreased by about 45% from the 2014 cost of $10.9 million to a current cost of $6.2 million. We reduced our drilling time by 26 days from the 2014 average of 43 days to 17 days. 
In our new area of the Midland Basin, we brought the Adams 4231 Wolfcamp A online in the fourth quarter at a peak rate of 2,167 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,841 BOE per day. We also brought online the Merchant 1409 A well at a peak rate of 1,345 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,132 BOE per day. Both wells are producing at over 80% oil cut. 
In the Midland Basin, we made similar improvements in well cost and drilling days in the Wolfcamp A formation. We reduced these costs, of the 7,500-foot horizontal wells by 35% from the 2014 cost of $9.2 million to a current cost of $6 million. We reduced our drilling days by 63% from 46 days in 2014 to 17 days in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Across Permian Resources, we're continuing to lower field operating expenses through optimized water handling, lower workover expenses and better downhole performance. Since the fourth quarter of 2014, we've reduced our operating cost per barrel by 26% and expect this trend to continue this year. 
In our Permian EOR segment, we continue to lower our drilling cost and manage the operations to run our gas processing facilities at full capacity. With resilient base production and low capital requirements, the EOR business continues to generate free cash flow at low product prices. We've lowered our cash operating expenses by 21%, driven mainly by lower downhole maintenance and injectant costs. The Phase 1 of CO2 injection at South Hobbs has continued and we have a production response sooner than is expected. We expect Phase I production to peak in 2020. We expect Phase I and Phase II to develop 28 million BOE at just over $10 per BOE. Additionally, we started a pilot project in South Hobbs testing the residual oil zone. It has the potential to add about 80 million barrels of reserves. These residual oil zone reserves can be added between $3 and $7 per barrel of development costs.
Given the current oil price, we will focus investment to achieve 4 goals: Accelerate geoscience characterization and modeling programs to enhance recovery, well performance and field economic returns; minimize base decline and set up major growth programs in both resources and EOR; focus on game-changing technologies and applications; and accelerate continued improvement in both execution and cost. One of the key drivers of our gains in well performance has been integrating our technical understanding of the subsurface to optimize well completions. Slide 41 illustrates our inventory of Permian Resources well locations by breakeven prices. By improving both well cost and performance, we continue to make more inventory economically viable in a low-cost environment. For example, we transferred about 700 locations from above the $60.00 per barrel hurdle to under $60 per barrel. Furthermore, we moved 350 locations under the $40 per barrel hurdle. We expect to continue lowering the hurdle point on our inventory as we move forward. 
With current oil prices, our activity in 2016 will focus on core locations that require minimal infrastructure investments. In addition, we will gather high priority appraisal data to support future development and initiate seed projects for long-term growth in EOR. Over the first half of this year, we will reduce our rig count to between 2 and 4 drilling rigs in the Permian. Our technical staff and engineers will focus on long-term projects, enhancing base production, preparing full field development plans to ramp up activity when oil prices recover. We're taking appropriate steps to preserve the efficiency gains achieved and are well-positioned for growth as prices recover. 
I'll now turn the call back to Chris Degner."

But based on the cash that we have on hand and what we project our situation will be over the next few years, we do expect to be able to make it through this cycle and get back to reasonable oil prices and secure our dividend throughout this entire process. We're organizing our plans and our activities around that. And the good thing about our portfolio is we have the flexibility to ramp up and down as necessary to ensure that we meet our priorities. And as we said, the top priority is just the maintenance and safety of our operations. And then we're going to pay the dividend, and we've got the cash to do that. And generally, the way we look at it is, we can use our cash flow from operations to cover our capital programs and part of our dividends over some of the years. And then what can't be covered by our cash flow from operations, we'll certainly use the strength of our balance sheet to cover that. So we don't see a threat to our dividend going through this cycle."

Our -- we're very proud of our shale position, and we think that the work we've done over the last few years has certainly proved it up to be an asset that we want to take full advantage of. But currently, our shale production is less than 20% of our total company production, and we don't really want it to ever be much higher than that, because we feel like, to have the asset base we have, that's part of the reason we'll be able to make it through this cycle with our current low declines.

Some of the ROZ developments that go down to an F&D of $3, those are fairly limited in size. So what we always try to do is blend the bigger projects that maybe have the $8 or $9 or $10 F&D with the smaller projects to get a blend of all of those.

Despite sharp declines in product prices, we had a strong year of production growth, particularly in Permian Resources, and we made big strides in lowering our cost structure as well as executing our strategic",1205,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Despite sharp declines in product prices, we had a strong year of production growth, particularly in Permian Resources, and we made big strides in lowering our cost structure as well as executing our strategic review. I'd like to share highlights of our 2015 achievements. 
First, Permian Resources growth exceeded our expectations as we reached our 2016 growth target of 120,000 BOE per day. This was a year ahead of our original plan. We increased production by 35,000 BOE per day for a year-over-year growth rate of 47%. 
Al Hosn reached full production capacity and delivered an average of 35,000 BOE per day of production last year. In total, we grew our production by 81,000 BOE per day, which was approximately 14% higher than 2014. 
We reduced our cash operating costs by 14%, achieved SG&A savings of 16% and cut our average drilling and completion costs in Permian Resources by 33%. 
As a part of our strategic review that we launched at the end of 2013, we sold our Williston Basin properties and made significant progress in our effort to exit non-core areas in the Middle East, including Iraq and Yemen, while also reducing our exposure in Bahrain. This will lead to lower capital spending in the region. 
Construction of the OxyChem ethylene cracker joint venture is on schedule and on budget for startup in early 2017. 
We reached a settlement with the Republic of Ecuador for approximately $1 billion, of which we've collected $300 million and expect to receive the remaining proceeds in the coming months. 
And we exited 2015 with $4.4 billion of cash on our balance sheet. 
Now I'd like to reiterate our strategy and cash flow priorities. I want to emphasize these have not changed. Our overall strategy is to invest in projects that generate long-term value, achieving returns well above our cost of capital while maintaining a conservative balance sheet. Our assets in Colombia, ISND in Qatar, Block 9 in Oman, Permian EOR, Dolphin and OxyChem provide significant earnings, require relatively low maintenance capital and provide free cash flow in this low price environment. Our most recent addition to this list is our Al Hosn gas project, which is a 30-year joint venture with ADNOC in Abu Dhabi. And the role of our Permian Resources business, the role that it will play in our strategy, is to provide quick production growth as needed to support our cash flow. 
Our top priority for use of cash flow is, and always will be, the safety and maintenance of our operations. Our second priority will continue to be funding the dividend. Third is allocating capital to our growth projects. The next priority for any remaining cash would be for potential asset acquisitions and or share repurchases as opportunities arise. 
Commodity businesses are inherently volatile. We maintain a strong balance sheet to not only survive but to take advantage of potential opportunities. We'll invest our capital prudently and maintain a flexible program as we maneuver through this low price cycle. 
As I mentioned earlier, we made great progress last year on lowering our operating and SG&A costs. We plan to further reduce these costs during 2016 and expect that the financial impact of executing on initiatives from our strategic review will be evident through lower costs and capital in the coming months. 
In terms of our capital program for this year, our plan is to carefully reduce our activity levels without harming the strong progress we've made with our growth prospects. We'll fund only those opportunities that exceed our rate of return hurdles. Our 2016 capital program is expected to range from $2.8 billion to $3 billion. This represents a nearly 50% reduction compared to the $5.6 billion spent during 2015. This capital plan should approximate our expected cash from operations at current commodity prices. The majority of this year's spending program will be allocated to the Permian Basin and to completing long-term projects in our chemicals and midstream businesses. Our capital run rate is expected to be higher during the first quarter and falling in subsequent quarters as committed project capital winds down. 
In Permian Resources, our drilling activity will be highly focused on areas in both the Midland and Delaware Basins where we have existing infrastructure, allowing us to achieve higher returns. Our level of activity will help preserve efficiency gains achieved over the past year. 
In Permian EOR, we'll take advantage of reduced costs for labor and materials to modify and expand existing facilities to increase our capacity to handle and inject greater quantities of CO2. This will enable us to implement additional CO2 projects. These projects will have longer duration and a typical production response time of 1 to 2 years. This will result in a modest increase in capital for our EOR business versus last year. Chris will provide greater detail on this year's capital program in a few moments.
Despite the reduction in capital spending, we expect overall company production from our core assets to grow 2% to 4% on average compared to 2015. Our core assets are pro forma for any expected divestments in areas we plan to exit, including the Piceance Basin, Iraq, Yemen and Libya, along with lower exposure in Bahrain. 
The full-year contribution of production from Al Hosn and the startup of Block 62 in Oman should add approximately 35,000 BOE per day of production this year. Overall, domestic production is anticipated to decline slightly through the year, primarily due to declining natural gas and NGL volumes caused by the curtailment of drilling activity in our gas assets in late 2014. We expect a modest increase in production from Permian Resources versus last year and will hold our Permian EOR production flat.
Turning to our oil and gas reserves. The good news is that we managed to keep our proved producing reserves essentially flat in 2015 due to our development programs and improved recovery from some of our Permian Resources wells. We continued to see strong performance from our Permian Resources drilling program, which enabled us to replace 214% of our resources production, excluding net sales and revisions. Our development program sat at 149 million BOE of proved reserves. Our year-end 2015 proved reserves totaled 2.2 billion BOE, consisting of 79% proved developed reserves, up from 71% proved developed reserves at the end of 2014. Our liquids reserves comprised 74% of our total proved reserve base. 
In summary, while the macroenvironment remains challenging for the industry, we delivered strong production growth during 2015. We lowered our cost structure and continued to execute on our strategic review. Although we expect commodity prices to gradually recover, we've set our plan to be more aligned with a lower price environment. We're fortunate to have a great set of assets with relatively low base decline rates that provide us with enormous flexibility for our capital. We believe our continued focus on returns, improved cost structure and a strong balance sheet provide us with the opportunity to emerge from the current cycle as a stronger company relative to our peers. 
I'll now turn the call to Chris Stavros for a review of our financial results and further details on this year's capital program."
293286,321694349,927042,"Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Occidental Petroleum Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Vicki, and good morning, everyone. As Vicki indicated, we continue to have 3 main objectives over the long term: Generate rates of return on invested capital that are well above our cost of capital; sustainability and growth of our dividend; and m",2291,"Thanks, Vicki, and good morning, everyone. As Vicki indicated, we continue to have 3 main objectives over the long term: Generate rates of return on invested capital that are well above our cost of capital; sustainability and growth of our dividend; and moderate volume growth of the business. 
With regard to returns, we need to strike a balance between managing our capital within the very low commodity price environment and also ensuring that our business is properly positioned for a recovery. We don't believe that a depleting or shrinking business over the long haul can maintain high rates of return, and part of our model is to balance the need for growth and the safety and sustainability of the business while maintaining attractive returns. Our focus is generating attractive returns and making investments through the cycle in long-term assets that provide us with stable cash flow to see us through during weaker periods. 
Despite the low price environment, we've been able to realign our business to focus on our core areas, reduce our overall cost structure through capital efficiencies, lower our total operating costs and SG&A, while significantly increasing production in our Permian Resources operations. 
In the Middle East/North Africa, the Al Hosn gas project was brought to full capacity by midyear, and we also moved forward with exiting some of our noncore assets in the region and eliminating the capital associated with those businesses. 
In terms of our capital spending, we adjusted our program last year in response to the sharp decline in product prices, with our full-year 2015 expenditures coming in at $5.6 billion, a 36% reduction from the prior year. Despite this reduction in our spending, we grew our total oil and gas production volumes by 14% from last year. 
As we look into 2016, we remain focused on allocating our capital where we have the best returns, including winding down our capital commitments for longer-term projects. We estimate our 2016 total capital program to be between $2.8 billion to $3 billion and no higher than $3 billion. This year's capital budget represents a nearly 50% reduction in our overall spending compared to last year and only 1/3 of what we spent in 2014. The oil and gas segment is expected to comprise approximately 2/3 of our overall spending this year compared to nearly 80% last year. We expect the majority of our total 2016 spending will be allocated to our domestic oil and gas business, primarily in the Permian Basin, with roughly 21% to be spent in Permian Resources and about 17% going towards Permian EOR. We expect this year's spending in our international oil and gas operations to be about half the level of outlays seen in 2015. Capital allocated toward our Middle East/North Africa oil and gas business is expected to be roughly 21% of total spending, with the majority going towards Oman. The year-over-year decline of about 56% in the Middle East is partly the result of our exit from several countries and our plan to run a more focused business targeting our core areas. The remaining 1/3 of this year's overall capital spending is expected to be split nearly equally between our chemical and midstream businesses, of which $500 million of the total is capital committed for projects that we expect to be completed by the end of 2016.
Turning to our results. Our core financial results for the final quarter of 2015 were a loss of $129 million or $0.17 per diluted share, a decrease from both the year-ago quarter and also the third quarter of 2015. The decline in core results is nearly all attributable to weaker commodity prices. 
Reported results for GAAP purposes for the fourth quarter were a loss of $5.2 billion or $6.78 per diluted share. The reported results include $5.4 billion of net after-tax charges, mostly related to asset impairments. 
Oxy follows a successful efforts method of accounting where we review our proved oil and gas properties for indications of impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the oil and gas properties may not be adequately recovered, such as when there's a significant drop in the futures curve. During the course of the year, the carrying value of our operations in the Middle East/North Africa was reduced by $4.5 billion, with $3 billion of this taken in the fourth quarter. This action was due to a combination of our exit from noncore areas and the reduction of our exposure to unprofitable projects in the region in an effort to focus the business on improving profitability. 
Impairments of our domestic properties amounted to $2.2 billion for all of 2015 and approximately $870 million for the fourth quarter. Almost 1/2 of the total year impairments in the U.S. were due to the exit of noncore assets in the Williston and Piceance Basins. The other 1/2 related to the reduction in the futures price curve as well as management's decision not to pursue activity associated with certain nonproducing acreage. 
In addition, we took a charge of $520 million in the fourth quarter associated with our Century gas processing plant as a result of Sandridge's inability to provide volumes to the plant and in order to meet their contractual obligations to deliver CO2.
Oil and gas core after-tax results for the fourth quarter of 2015 were a loss of $189 million and down $206 million on a sequential quarterly basis. For the fourth quarter of 2015, total company oil and gas production volumes from ongoing operations averaged 671,000 BOE per day, 75,000 BOE per day higher compared to the prior-year period and essentially flat with third quarter volumes. This excludes production from the Williston assets for all periods. 
Our fourth quarter 2015 worldwide realized oil price of $38.68 per barrel fell by $9.10 a barrel or 19% compared to third quarter realizations of $47.78 a barrel and down 46% compared to the prior year's fourth quarter. 
Domestic oil production was 190,000 barrels per day during the fourth quarter, a sequential quarterly increase of 2,000 barrels per day and an increase of 19,000 barrels per day from the year-ago period. 
Production in our Permian Resources business grew to 118,000 BOE per day during the fourth quarter, up 40% from the prior year. Volumes were also able to grow sequentially despite weather-related outages. 
Oil and gas cash operating costs were $9.95 per BOE for the fourth quarter of 2015 and $11.57 per BOE for the total year 2015 compared to $13.50 per BOE for the prior year. The reduction in costs was seen in both our domestic and international operations and reflects decreased activity in downhole maintenance and a lower overall cost structure. 
The DD&A for full year 2015 was under $16 per BOE compared to $17 per BOE during -- seen during 2014. 
Taxes other than on income, which are directly related to product prices, were $1.32 per BOE for the 12 months of 2015 compared to $2.45 per BOE in the prior year. 
Fourth quarter exploration expense was $13 million. 
Chemical's fourth quarter 2015 pretax core earnings were $116 million compared with third quarter earnings of $174 million and $160 million in the year-ago quarter. The sequential quarterly decrease primarily reflected weaker chlorovinyls demand and lower PVC prices, which negatively impacted margins. This was partially offset by higher caustic soda prices and lower energy costs. 
Midstream pretax core results were a loss of $45 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to income of $31 million in the third quarter. The sequential decline in the fourth quarter was mainly attributable to lower oil marketing and power generation margins. The marketing results continue to reflect lower margins due to the narrowing of the Midland and Gulf Coast differentials as the increase in oil supply lowered premiums in the Gulf coast. The power generation business reflected lower seasonal spark spreads and higher maintenance costs in the fourth quarter.
Looking at our 12 months cash flow for 2015, we generated $4.8 billion of cash flow from continuing operations before working capital. Working capital changes was a use of $880 million, the majority of which occurred during the first half of the year. 
Capital expenditures for 2015 were $5.6 billion, a 36% decline from the $8.7 billion we spent in 2014. We received over $700 million of net proceeds from activity associated with asset divestitures and acquisitions, which included fourth quarter proceeds of approximately $600 million for our Williston assets. 
In the second quarter, we completed a bond offering, issuing senior notes for which we received net proceeds of roughly $1.5 billion. We indicated at the time of the offering that the proceeds would be used to partially pre-fund some of our debt maturing in the first half of 2016. Earlier this week, we used cash on hand to retire $700 million of our senior notes that had matured. We returned $2.9 billion of cash to our shareholders by paying $2.3 billion in dividends and repurchasing 7.4 million of our shares for approximately $600 million. Our long-term debt to capitalization was 22% at year-end. The worldwide effective tax rate on our core income was 29% for the fourth quarter of 2015 and 86% for the total year. 
Looking into 2016, and as we show on Slide 23  in the handout, we started the year with $4.4 billion of cash. During the fourth quarter, at $42 WTI, we generated operating cash flow before working capital of approximately $900 million or roughly $3.6 billion on an annualized basis. Every dollar change in the oil price impacts our cash flow by about $100 million annually. We expect to receive an additional $900 million of cash this year from our settlement with Ecuador, of which we have collected $300 million to date, and approximately $300 million of proceeds from asset sales during this quarter. Earlier this week, S&P reaffirmed our single A credit rating along with a stable outlook.
Turning to our oil and gas production. For purposes of year-to-year comparison and in terms of providing guidance for 2016, volumes are pro forma and exclude assets we have either already or plan to divest or exit from this year. These assets would include Williston and Piceance in the U.S. and Iraq, Yemen, Bahrain and Libya in the Middle East/North Africa. 
On this same-store sales basis, we expect our full year 2016 production to grow 2% to 4% or in the range of 570,000 to 585,000 BOE per day compared to about 560,000 BOE per day last year. In the U.S., we have ceased all gas drilling activity, and we'll focus our capital in the Permian in an effort to grow our oil volumes and as justified by attractive returns. We expect our total domestic oil and gas production to be in the range of 270,000 to 285,000 BOE per day in 2016, which includes oil production growth of about 4% and partly offset by modest declines in gas production. More than 2/3 of our domestic production volumes are expected to be oil. 
Production in Permian Resources is expected to average 123,000 BOE per day during the first half of 2016, an increase of 8% compared to the same period last year. Permian EOR volume should remain relatively flat at about 145,000 BOE per day, while providing stable cash flow. 
In our core international areas in the Middle East and Colombia, we expect production to increase to roughly 300,000 BOE per day this year compared to 268,000 BOE per day in 2015 as a result of a full year's contribution from Al Hosn as well as the startup of gas production from Block 62 in Oman. 
In terms of production for the first quarter, on a reported basis and unadjusted for pending divestments or exits, we expect our total production to be in the range of 620,000 to 630,000 BOE per day. Permian Resources volume should increase about 3,000 BOE per day sequentially to 121,000 BOE per day.
Production in the Middle East is expected to be negatively impacted in the quarter by about 15,000 BOE per day due to scheduled maintenance turnarounds at both Dolphin and Al Hosn. 
Our DD&A expense for oil and gas is expected to be approximately $15 per BOE during 2016. The combined depreciation for the chemical and midstream segments should be approximately $675 million for the year. 
Cash operating costs for the domestic oil and gas business should be about $13 per BOE during 2016, about $1 per BOE lower than last year's level for our ongoing operations. 
Exploration expense for the year is estimated to be about $75 million pretax, with $25 million of that anticipated in the first quarter. 
The realignment of our business helped us make strong progress in lowering our SG&A costs last year by more than $200 million. In the current environment, we expect to reduce these costs by at least another $100 million into 2016. Price changes at current global prices affect our annual operating cash flow by about $100 million for every dollar per barrel change in WTI. A swing of $0.50 per million BTUs in domestic natural gas prices affects annual operating cash flow by about $40 million. 
We expect our first quarter 2016 pretax chemical earnings to be about $140 million. Our chemical operations are essentially margin business, and so while our cost may decline as a result of lower energy prices, prices for the chemical products we sell continue to be driven by demand. Using current strip prices for oil and gas, we expect our 2016 domestic tax rate to be at 36% and our international tax rate to be about 55%. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jody Elliot who will discuss activity around our Permian operations."

Today I'll review 2015 highlights from Permian Resources and Permian EOR and provide guidance on our program for 2016. 2015 was a very successful year. Permian Resources achieved our 2016 growth target ahead of schedule by reaching 120,0",1098,"Thank you, Chris. Today I'll review 2015 highlights from Permian Resources and Permian EOR and provide guidance on our program for 2016. 2015 was a very successful year. Permian Resources achieved our 2016 growth target ahead of schedule by reaching 120,000 BOE per day in November. We achieved this milestone by leveraging our advancements in geoscience, reservoir characterization and integrated planning to deliver better wells in less than half the time and at 2/3 of the cost versus 2014. Throughout 2015, we reduced our OpEx costs by over 20% by improving field reliability, productivity and optimizing our surface and subsurface engineering. Our Permian EOR segment generated free cash flow in a low price environment and had its best safety metrics of all time.
Turning to Permian Resources. In the fourth quarter, we achieved record production of 118,000 BOE per day, a 40% increase versus the prior year. Oil production increased to 76,000 barrels per day, a 2% increase from the previous quarter and a 49% increase from a year ago. Winter storms at the end of December impacted total quarter production by approximately 1,300 BOE per day. For the full year, the business achieved production of 110,000 BOE per day, a 47% increase versus the prior year. 
Permian Resources continues to drive down capital costs through improved execution in drilling and well completions and reduced time to market. For each of our core development areas, we continue to monitor both our early time well performance and cumulative production to ensure our development approach is providing maximum value. In addition to improving individual well performance, we optimize field development value through pace, well sequencing, flowback designs to reduce cleanouts and fluid handling cost, artificial lift designs to maximize long-term production and facility plans to ensure maximum utilization over time. 
Our Delaware Basin well performance continues to be strong. We placed 19 horizontal wells on production in the Wolfcamp A benches in the fourth quarter. We continue to increase well performance by optimizing the density of our completions and proppant loads and drilling longer laterals. For example, the Priest E 1H well achieved a peak rate of 1,659 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,247 BOE per day. The H.B. Morrison B 12H achieved a peak rate of 1,487 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,176 BOE per day. 
In New Mexico, we're delivering more productive wells by increasing our proppant concentration and reducing cluster spacing. For example, the second Bone Spring Cedar Canyon 27 #6 produced at a peak rate of 2,498 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,750 BOE per day at an 82% oil cut. 
In the Delaware Basin, our Wolfcamp A 4,500-foot well costs decreased by about 45% from the 2014 cost of $10.9 million to a current cost of $6.2 million. We reduced our drilling time by 26 days from the 2014 average of 43 days to 17 days. 
In our new area of the Midland Basin, we brought the Adams 4231 Wolfcamp A online in the fourth quarter at a peak rate of 2,167 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,841 BOE per day. We also brought online the Merchant 1409 A well at a peak rate of 1,345 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,132 BOE per day. Both wells are producing at over 80% oil cut. 
In the Midland Basin, we made similar improvements in well cost and drilling days in the Wolfcamp A formation. We reduced these costs at the 7,500-foot horizontal wells by 35% from the 2014 cost of $9.2 million to a current cost of $6 million. We reduced our drilling days by 63% from 46 days in 2014 to 17 days in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Across Permian Resources, we're continuing to lower field operating expenses through optimized water handling, lower workover expenses and better downhole performance. Since the fourth quarter of 2014, we've reduced our operating cost per barrel by 26% and expect this trend to continue this year. 
In our Permian EOR segment, we continue to lower our drilling costs and manage the operations to run our gas processing facilities at full capacity. With resilient base production and low capital requirements, the EOR business continues to generate free cash flow at low product prices. We've lowered our cash operating expenses by 21%, driven mainly by lower downhole maintenance and injectant costs. Phase 1 of CO2 injection at South Hobbs has continued and we have a production response sooner than was expected. We expect Phase I production to peak in 2020. We expect Phase I and Phase II to develop 28 million BOE at just over $10 per BOE. Additionally, we started a pilot project in South Hobbs testing the residual oil zone. It has the potential to add about 80 million barrels of reserves. These residual oil zone reserves can be added between $3 and $7 per barrel of development costs.
Given the current oil price, we will focus investment to achieve 4 goals: accelerate geoscience characterization and modeling programs to enhance recovery, well performance and field economic returns; minimize base decline and set up major growth programs in both resources and EOR; focus on game-changing technologies and applications; and accelerate continued improvement in both execution and cost. One of the key drivers of our gains in well performance has been integrating our technical understanding of the subsurface to optimize well completions. Slide 41 illustrates our inventory of Permian Resources well locations by breakeven prices. By improving both well cost and performance, we continue to make more inventory economically viable in a low-cost environment. For example, we transferred about 700 locations from above the $60.00 per barrel hurdle to under $60 per barrel. Furthermore, we moved 350 locations under the $40 per barrel hurdle. We expect to continue lowering the hurdle point on our inventory as we move forward. 
With current oil prices, our activity in 2016 will focus on core locations that require minimal infrastructure investments. In addition, we will gather high priority appraisal data to support future development and initiate seed projects for long-term growth in EOR. Over the first half of this year, we will reduce our rig count to between 2 and 4 drilling rigs in the Permian. Our technical staff and engineers will focus on long-term projects, enhancing base production, preparing full field development plans to ramp up activity when oil prices recover. We're taking appropriate steps to preserve the efficiency gains achieved and are well-positioned for growth as prices recover. 
I'll now turn the call back to Chris Degner."

Although we actually believe that prices ultimately will be higher than the strip, we don't expect prices to really recover much until very late this year or maybe early next year and recover only to slightly above the curve. But based on the cash that we have on hand and what we project our situation will be over the next few years, we do expect to be able to make it through this cycle and get back to reasonable oil prices and secure our dividend throughout this entire process. We're organizing our plans and our activities around that. And the good thing about our portfolio is we have the flexibility to ramp up and down as necessary to ensure that we meet our priorities. And as we said, the top priority is just the maintenance and safety of our operations. And then we're going to pay the dividend, and we've got the cash to do that. And generally, the way we look at it is, we can use our cash flow from operations to cover our capital programs and part of our dividends over some of the years. And then what can't be covered by our cash flow from operations, we'll certainly use the strength of our balance sheet to cover that. So we don't see a threat to our dividend going through this cycle."

So what we'll be looking at is, are the assets that have the longer life reserves. Our -- we're very proud of our shale position, and we think that the work we've done over the last few years has certainly proved it up to be an asset that we want to take full advantage of. But currently, our shale production is less than 20% of our total company production, and we don't really want it to ever be much higher than that, because we feel like, to have the asset base we have, that, that's part of the reason we'll be able to make it through this cycle with our current load declines.

So combined, I would tell you that it probably amounts to about 50,000 to 60,000 BOE per day on a like-for-like basis that -- to adjust for sort of our ongoing core production for the guidance that I gave for the full year of '16. So that would be the reconciliation."

293286,330034070,973918,"Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Occidental Petroleum Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. This quarter was another extremely difficult one for the industry, but we stayed focused on our game plan, addressing the things that are within our sphere of influence so that we do not only survive through this",994,"Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. This quarter was another extremely difficult one for the industry, but we stayed focused on our game plan, addressing the things that are within our sphere of influence so that we do not only survive through this time but thrive. We'll do this through full cycle cost leadership, optimal capital allocation and maintaining our balance sheet. Superior access to and lower costs of capital positions us to invest in opportunities that will grow our business organically or through acquisitions. We believe the world will continue to need oil, and when markets demand production growth they will first look to the Permian, and we will be ready.
First and foremost, we're focused on operational excellence to drive full cycle costs lower for all of our businesses. This requires subsurface and surface execution excellence. In the first quarter, we demonstrated good operational performance. We grew Permian Resources production by 30,000 BOE per day or 31% year-over-year. We performed above our expectations on new wells brought online, particularly in New Mexico, and we delivered better base production.
Permian production outperformance allowed us to exceed total production expectations for the quarter, despite lower-than-planned production from Al Hosn. Al Hosn was shut down for a successful warranty turnaround, but the shutdown was longer than expected. It is now back on production at full capacity.
We also reduced our overall cash operating costs by 23% and achieved SG&A savings of 14% versus the first quarter of last year. To further improve our overall well performance, we're focusing a portion of our workforce on initiatives that will have a step-change impact on costs in the future, such as artificial lift design improvements, multi-beach development, increased integration of new 3D seismic surveys and the application of data analytics into our reservoir characterization.
To incentivize our management and employees, we developed a target metric called total spend per barrel, which is our cash operating, capital and SG&A costs divided by our total production. Our target for 2016 is almost 30% lower than 2015's actual total spend. This is an aggressive target, especially in view of the fact that we reduced total spend per barrel from over $60 to $40 in 2015.
Our 2016 capital program is $3 billion, a 50% reduction from 2015. We're on track to achieve this with first quarter capital spend of $687 million. Our capital is focused in our core areas.
Taking advantage of reduced costs of labor and materials in this environment, we shifted more capital to Permian EOR to modify and expand existing facilities, increasing our capacity to handle and inject greater quantities of CO2. This will enable us to implement additional CO2 projects and further grow oil production. These projects will have a longer duration with typical production response time of 1 to 2 years. By then, we expect prices to be higher than they are today.
We're also targeting lower costs projects, including residual oil zone CO2 floods where development costs are between $3 and $7 per BOE.
In Permian Resources, our development activities are in the Midland and Delaware basins, in areas where we have existing infrastructure allowing us to achieve higher returns. We are maintaining minimal activity levels sufficient to continue to improved execution efficiencies and well production performance. This allows us to retain our inventory of shorter-cycle unconventional wells for development during improved environment. 
In the chemicals business, the Ingleside cracker remains on budget and on time for startup in the first quarter of 2017. Our balance sheet remains strong on an absolute basis and relative to our peers. In the first quarter, we closed on $285 million of asset sales in the Piceance Basin, the Dallas tower and a small specialty chemical operation. We received $550 million of proceeds from our settlement with Ecuador.
In April, we issued $2.75 billion of bonds that will be used to retire and call about $2 billion of debt maturing in 2016 and 2017.
We ended the first quarter with $3.2 billion, which is ample cash and liquidity to fund our capital program and dividends.
With a strong start to the first quarter, we raised our production guidance on our core assets to a range of 585,000 to 600,000 BOE per day. Overall, domestic production is anticipated to decline slightly through the year, primarily due to the declining natural gas and NGL volumes caused by the curtailment of drilling activity in our gas assets in 2014. We expect to modestly increase in production from Permian Resources versus last year, and Permian EOR production will remain flat.
In our capital programs, we expect slightly higher spending in the second and third quarters due to the timing of major projects in our chemicals and midstream segments. As I mentioned earlier, our full year production will not exceed -- program, our capital program will not exceed $3 billion. This plan should approximate our expected cash from operations at current commodity prices.
In summary, I'd like to thank our employees for their commitment to excellence in both safety and operations during these challenging times. They're continuing to find ways to add value through increased sales and cost reductions across all segments of our company. While the macro environment remains challenging for the industry, we believe our continued focus on returns, improved cost structure and strong balance sheet provide us with the opportunity to merge from the current cycle as a stronger company relative to our peers.
Finally, I'd like to take a moment to recognize Steve Chazen. While he's not here today, I know he will eventually listen to this call. On behalf of investors, the Board of Directors and employees, I would like to thank Steve for his leadership and outstanding service to Occidental over his 22-year career. He shaped our company into what it is today, and we're grateful to him for that.
I'll now turn the call to Chris Stavros for a review of our financial results and detailed guidance."

As Vicki noted, despite the severe weakness in product prices during the quarter, our business benefited from higher-than-expected production volumes from our ongoing domestic operations, lower cash operating cos",2159,"Thanks, Vicki, and good morning, everyone. As Vicki noted, despite the severe weakness in product prices during the quarter, our business benefited from higher-than-expected production volumes from our ongoing domestic operations, lower cash operating costs and improved capital efficiency. These factors helped support our operating cash flow during the quarter. This, in combination with a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity, has allowed us to weather the continued weak product price environment.
Our core financial results for the first quarter of 2016 were a loss of $426 million or $0.56 per diluted share, a decrease from both the year-ago quarter and also the fourth quarter of 2015. The decline in both sequential and year-over-year core results were attributable to much weaker commodity prices, which more than offset the benefit from lower costs.
Reported results for GAAP purposes during the first quarter of 2016 was income of $78 million or $0.10 per diluted share compared to a loss of $218 million or $0.28 per diluted share in the prior period -- prior year period. Reported results included gains on asset sales of $87 million after-tax and $438 million after-tax as a result of proceeds received from the settlement with Ecuador, partially offset by several noncash charges.
Oil and gas core after-tax results for the first quarter of 2016 were a loss of $388 million, a sequential decline of about $200 million mainly due to lower commodity prices, partially offset by improved cash operating costs. Our first quarter 2016 worldwide realized oil price of $29.42 per barrel fell by nearly $10 a barrel or nearly 25% compared to prices during last year's fourth quarter.
Total company oil and gas production volumes from our ongoing operations averaged 590,000 BOE per day in the first quarter of 2016, 59,000 BOE per day higher than the prior period although down 7,000 BOE per day on a sequential quarterly basis. This was well above the higher-end range of 570,000 to 585,000 BOE per day for full year 2016 production guidance that we've provided earlier this year. Total domestic production volumes climbed 3% sequentially to 307,000 BOE per day during the first quarter.
Our domestic oil production was 197,000 barrels per day, up 7,000 barrels per day from last year's fourth quarter and 17,000 barrels per day higher from the same period a year ago.
Production in our Permian Resources business grew to 128,000 [ph] BOE per day during the first quarter of 2016 compared to 118,000 BOE per day during the fourth quarter, far exceeding our earlier guidance of 121,000 BOE per day for the period.
Permian Resources volumes grew by more than 30% compared to the year-ago period. International production from ongoing operations was 283,000 [ph] BOE per day during the first quarter of 2016, down 16,000 BOE per day compared to the first -- fourth quarter of last year, primarily due to the scheduled first quarter warranty shutdown at the Al Hosn gas plant.
Total production from our ongoing operations excludes volumes of 67,000 BOE per day from assets we have either divested or exited or on the process of exiting. Domestically, this includes our Williston operations, which we sold in November 2015; and our Piceance operations, which was sold in March of 2016. Table showing volumes both on a reported basis and also from pro forma ongoing operations are included in the schedules along with our press release.
Domestic oil and gas cash operating cost from ongoing operations declined to $11.86 per BOE in the first quarter compared to $12.28 per BOE during the fourth quarter of 2015 and 13% below full year 2015 cost of $13.58 per BOE. The reduction in cost is mainly a result of improved efficiency around our surface operations and maintenance.
Overall oil and gas DD&A for the first quarter of 2016 was $15.61 per BOE compared to $15.81 per BOE during 2015. Taxes other than on income, which are directly related to product prices, were $1.15 per BOE for the first quarter compared to $1.32 per BOE during 2015. First quarter exploration expense was $9 million.
Chemicals' first quarter 2016 pretax core earnings were $126 million compared with earnings of $116 million during last year's fourth quarter and $139 million in the year-ago period. The sequential improvement in earnings reflected higher sales volumes across most product lines compared with lower natural gas costs, partly offset by weaker PVC, VCM and caustic soda pricing. Weakness was also seen in the calcium quad business as a result of the unseasonably warm winter evidenced in key markets combined with the industry slowdown in fracing activity.
Chemicals also closed on the sales of its corporate headquarters building in Dallas and a small specialty chemical operation, which together resulted in pretax gains of roughly $90 million, and those are included from our core chemical earnings.
Midstream pretax core results were a loss of $95 million for the first quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $45 million in the fourth quarter of last year and a loss of $5 million in the prior year first quarter. The sequential decline was mainly attributable to lower midstream income from Al Hosn due to the warranty shutdown in the quarter and plant maintenance at Dolphin -- at the Dolphin project, which led to lower form and pipeline income.
Looking at our cash flows for the first quarter. We began the year with $4.4 billion of cash on hand. During the first quarter, we generated $825 million of cash from -- cash flow from continuing operations before working capital and other changes. Net working capital changes consumed $320 million of cash during the period. The use was related to the reduction in capital spending associated with deceleration of drilling activity, cyclical payments of property taxes and employee severance-related costs and payment of liabilities accrued at year-end related to the exit or exiting from some international operations.
Capital expenditures for the first quarter was $685 million, a 41% decline from the $1.2 billion spent in the fourth quarter of 2015. While our first quarter capital was lower than expected, this is due to a deferral of some outlays in midstream and chemicals into the second and third quarters. Our 2016 total company capital program remains on track to be between $2.8 billion to $3 billion and ending the year at a rate similar to the first quarter as committed project capital winds down.
We received $285 million from the sale of noncore assets in the Piceance basins and sales from chemical assets, as I noted earlier. We also collected $550 million from our settlement with Ecuador during the first quarter and expect to receive payment of more than $300 million in the coming months. These proceeds have been classified as discontinued operations in the cash flow statement.
During the quarter, we retired $700 million of debt, which matured in February; and paid $575 million in dividends. We ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $3.2 billion.
On April 4 of this year, we completed a $2.75 billion 3-tranche [ph] senior notes offering with attractive coupon rates of 2.6%, 3.4% and 4.4% on a 6-year tenure and 30-note -- 30-year notes respectively. Primary use of the proceeds will go towards refinancing of $750 million of notes that mature on June of this year. And we've also exercised our early redemption option to call $1.25 billion of notes that were scheduled to mature in February 2017. After this redemption, Oxy's total outstanding debt will be approximately $8.3 billion, essentially the same at the end -- as of the end of 2015.
Importantly, this transaction extended the life of our debt maturities by 5 years, with our next maturity not scheduled until February 2018. 
Moody's currently rates Oxy A3 [ph] stable [ph] and S&P rates us at straight A stable. 
Turning to guidance, as Vicki guided, we are raising our full year 2016 production guidance from a range of 2% to 4% previously to 4% to 6% essentially a 2% increase or within a new range of 585,000 to 600,000 BOE per day for the full year. The increase will be accomplished without any change to our original capital program as primarily a result of better-than-expected production in our domestic operations. Specifically, results in the Permian -- Permian Resources continue to outperform our expectations due to improved well productivity and better management around our base volumes.
Turning to guidance. For the second quarter, we expect our total oil and gas production pro forma for ongoing operations to increase sequentially to a range of 600,000 to 610,000 BOE per day, as Al Hosn and Dolphin ramp back up from the first quarter scheduled turnarounds and as gas production from Oman's Block 62 continues to rise towards full production levels. Domestically, we expect production to be flattish with first quarter levels or about 307,000 BOE per day.
Second quarter should also see production in Permian Resources similar to the first quarter despite the slowdown in activity. We expect production in Permian Resources to decline modestly during the second half of 2016. Variability around the outcome will be a function of well performance, capturing further efficiency gains and our ability to continue to manage base production. Permian yield well volume should remain steady at about 145,000 BOE per day while also providing stable cash flow.
Our DD&A expense for oil and gas is still expected to be approximately $15 per BOE during 2016, and depreciation of the oil and gas segment is expected to exceed this year's capital investment by more than $1 billion. The combined depreciation for the chemical and midstream segments should be approximately $670 million for the year.
Exploration expense is estimated to be about $25 million pretax for the second quarter. Price changes at current global prices affect our annual operating cash flow by about $100 million for every dollar per barrel change in WTI. A swing of $0.50 per million BTUs in domestic natural gas prices affects annual operating cash flow by about $50 million.
Our midstream operations has exposure to 2 separate and different lines of businesses. The results of our oil and gas marketing and gas processing businesses are inherently volatile and sensitive to changes in commodity prices and price differentials. Conversely, our pipeline and transportation operations and partial ownership in this is of the All-American GP provide more stable and predictable income and cash flow.
With regard to our marketing business, we have supply commitments and takeaway capacity to handle our Permian and equity production volumes in addition to third-party volumes. The downturn in oil prices has slowed production growth in the Permian creating a situation of overbuilt infrastructure where takeaway capacity exceeds production. Price differentials between the Permian and Gulf Coast have shrunk to levels that do not fully cover our cost of transportation.
A gradual improvement in oil prices should incentivize production growth in the Permian basin, and we expect price differentials to widen as production fill some of the excess takeaway capacity over time.
Our domestic gas processing business supports domestic upstream production. Margins in these businesses has suffered as NGL prices have dropped significantly. The recent quarterly losses incurred in the midstream business are a direct result of these factors.
In chemicals, we anticipate pretax earnings of about $100 million for the second quarter. We expect that sequential decline in income is due to planned maintenance outages at several of our chloro vinyl plants during the quarter. We'll price support for chloro vinyls has been lackluster so far this year, the combination of both scheduled and unscheduled industry outages are expected to tighten market conditions for both vinyls and caustic soda into the second half of this year. The worldwide effective tax rate on our core income was 29% for the first quarter of 2016.
Using current strip prices for oil and gas, we expect 2016 domestic tax rate to be about 36% and our international tax rate to be about 76%.
Turning to our overall costs. Total spend per barrel, as Vicki mentioned, was added as a new internal performance metric last year because of Oxy's increased focus on operational efficiency, especially in consideration of the sharp decline in commodity prices. This metric is defined as total cost per BOE of production and includes capital spending, cash operating costs and G&A costs. A portion of senior management's incentive compensation is directly aligned with this performance metric as it focuses our efforts on efficiency, financial returns and free cash flow generation. This efficiency metric is designed to help manage the reduction in overall spending while rewarding production growth.
During 2015, we were successful in reducing our total spend per BOE by more than 30% compared to the prior year to approximately $40 per BOE. A reduction in our total spend per BOE of similar proportion is also targeted for 2016.
I'll now turn the call over to Jody Elliot, who will discuss activity around our Permian operations."

Today, I'll review the highlights of our Permian Resources and Permian EOR results in the first quarter, provide guidance on our program for the remainder of the year. As Vicki highlighted previously with rega",1246,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review the highlights of our Permian Resources and Permian EOR results in the first quarter, provide guidance on our program for the remainder of the year. As Vicki highlighted previously with regard to capital priorities, due to the current oil price environment, our focus has been to prudently allocate capital to our Permian Basin businesses. With this in mind, our Permian Resources operation is being managed to maximize the value of our workforce and enhance operational capabilities, invest in areas with existing infrastructure and gather critical appraisal information to drive better well productivity.
In Permian EOR, we proportionately increased the capital allocated to this long life business to expand CO2 injection capacity and facilities and to bring forward the resource potential. We continue to invest heavily in the application of geoscience and data analytics into our development strategy to ensure we are competitively positioned to take advantage of a sustained improvement in commodity prices.
Turning to Permian Resources. In the first quarter, we achieved record daily production of 128,000 BOE per day, a 31% increase versus the prior year. Oil production increased to 84,000 barrels per day, an 11% increase from the previous quarter and a 35% increase from a year ago. Additionally, we have leveraged and extended our industry-leading practices from our EOR business to drive improvements in base management in order to minimize decline.
Our Delaware Basin well performance continues to be strong. We placed 15 horizontal wells on production in the Wolfcamp A benches in the first quarter. We continued to increase well productivity by increasing contact with a reservoir near the wellbore, utilizing higher cluster density, higher profit loads and drilling longer laterals. 
For example, the Vanguard 3 number 15H achieved a peak rate of 2,099 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 13 08 BOE per day. The H.B. Morrison B 13H with a 10,000-foot lateral achieved a peak rate of 23 35 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 17 81 BOE per day. Our successful efforts of applying geologic and reservoir parameters into our completion design continues to derive breakthroughs in well productivity and will reduce the economic hurdle point of our inventory.
In the Delaware Basin, our Wolfcamp A 4,500-foot well costs decreased by about 18% from the 2015 costs of $7.7 million to a current cost of $6.3 million. We reduced our drilling time by 6 days from the 2015 average of 25 days to 19 days, measured by rig release to rig release. We expect the cost and productivity improvements in drilling, completions and facilities to continue as we progress our program.
In New Mexico, we are delivering play-leading wells by understanding of geologic and reservoir parameters into our completion design. We're enthusiastic about superior reservoir quality and multi-bench potential in this play. 
During the first quarter, we placed 6 horizontal wells on production in the second bone spring in New Mexico. One of our best well results to date, the second Bone Spring Cedar Canyon 23 Federal 5H produced a peak rate of 28 20 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 18 79 BOE per day at an 82% oil cut. We increased profit from 1,000 to 1,500 pounds per foot and tried [ph] 2 wells with 2,000 pounds per foot. This has resulted in greater contact with a reservoir closer to the wellbore as compared to the prior completion design.
As a result of these advancements in our completion design, the last 4 Cedar Canyon wells put on production have achieved 90-day cumulative production totals approximately double the prior results. We'll continue to leverage our geo-driven analytics to identify advancements in completion design and will test more aggressive cluster spacing, more clusters per stage and slick water fluid systems in the second half of 2016.
Drilling and completion costs continue to improve in New Mexico as well, reducing cost per lateral foot by over 20%, resulting in a current completed well costs, including hookup, of $5.9 million. We expect continued improvement in efficiency gains and have targeted well costs of $5.5 million for our 4,500-foot second Bone Spring wells in the second half of 2016.
In the East Midland Basin, we brought Deshields 31 05 1 WA [ph] well online in the first quarter at a peak rate of 16 06 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 13 95 BOE per day. We also brought online the polo 16 05 A [ph] at a peak rate of 12 65 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 10 18 BOE per day. Both wells are producing with higher oil cuts.
In the Midland Basin, we made similar improvements in well cost and drilling days and drilling the Wolfcamp A formation. We reduced these -- the cost of the 7,500-foot horizontal well by 14% from the 2015 cost of $7.1 million to a current cost of $6.1 million. We've reduced our drilling days, as measured by rig release to rig release by 16% from 19 days in 2015 to 16 days in the first quarter. 
In Permian Resources, we're continuing to lower field operating expenses to optimize water handling, lower workover expenses and better downhole performance. Since the first quarter of 2015, we've reduced our operating cost per barrel by 33% and continue to work additional cost reduction and efficiency improvements.
We'll maintain flexibility to ramp-up our rig activity in the fourth quarter of 2016 and full year 2017 should prices exhibit fundamental stability above the current strip prices.
In Permian EOR, we continue to lower our drilling costs and manage the operations to run our gas processing facilities at full capacity. With resilient base production and low capital requirements, Permian EOR continues to generate free cash flow at low product prices. Drilling costs are running 25% below our benchmark target. We've lowered our cash operating expenses by 21%, driven mainly by lower downhole maintenance and injected costs.
Phase 1 of CO2 injection at South Hobbs continues to perform well. Additionally, the initial implementation of the residual oil zone, or RAS projects, are underway at South Hobbs and West Seminal. The RAS development as a vertical expansion of the CO2 flooded interval. This activity is economic in a low price environment because we typically utilize workover rigs to drill the extra depth into the CO2 floatable sections of the reservoir. The residual oil zone underlies most of our major EOR properties and can be developed between $3 and $7 a barrel.
In summary, we're focusing our resources to achieve 4 core goals: Accelerate geoscience characterization and modeling programs to enhance recovery, productivity and field economic returns; minimize base decline and set up major growth programs in both resources and EOR businesses; focus on game-changing technologies and applications; and accelerate continued improvements in both execution and costs. We expect to run between 4 to 5 rigs in our Permian business over the remainder of the year. If we do see evidence of sustained price recovery with improved fundamentals, we could gradually add rigs at a modest pace to ensure our gains and efficiencies are preserved. Our technical staff and engineers will focus on long-term projects, enhance base production and prepare full field development plans to ramp-up activity when oil prices recover.

So we did -- the remaining area that we are now that's noncore that we will be continuing to reduce our exposure to will be in Bahrain. Libya, where we've stopped all investments there. So now we're down to the core areas of Abu Dhabi, Oman and Qatar in the Middle East. Colombia in South America, the Permian in the U.S. along with South Texas. So we view the Permian Colombia and the 3 areas in the Middle East to still have opportunities for us to continue to grow. Now we're going to try to restrict our activities to just those areas because we -- the one thing that we think will make us better and where we continued -- can continue to get better is to focus. And again, to focus in areas where we have a competitive advantage, and we believe that we do in all of those areas. So our growth opportunities in the future will be focused on just those areas. With the priority being given to the Permian Basin because our size, our exposure there, we feel like that's where we get the most value for the dollars that we invest so we would prioritize the Permian as the growth strategy."

I'll talk first about the 20% that I've mentioned. Really, the 20% that I had mentioned in terms of what we expect ultimately, our resources business unit to contribute to total production, that comment was driven by the fact that we were really excited about our EOR business and the fact that our teams over the past 1.5 years have been working on ways to expand our capacity there, so that we could actually accelerate some of our development. We have about 1.4 million barrels of oil equivalent remaining reserves and potential in EOR, and we want to -- at our current pace of development, that will take about 22 years. So we really wanted to accelerate that. But when we look to cases where we would need to build new massive mega plant to do that, it really didn't and to value that met our hurdles. So what our teams have done now is they've actually found ways to expand our existing infrastructure for much lower costs. So we're really excited about being able to, over the next 3 to 5 years, start to accelerate EOR. And the good thing about that is our EOR business has just a 4% decline. So we think that combining it with the continued growth from our resources should get us to a point where we can manage the overall base decline of the company to a point where we can better weather these down cycles that are always going to occur at points through the -- as we go forward. So right now we -- what we would do in the short term though as we're waiting for our facilities expansion in EOR is any improvements in oil prices to a level that's sufficient to enable us to be able to ramp-up, that activity will go first you resources. So this year -- for example, this year, we have about $500 million committed capital that will come off next year. And so we expect next year that we would shift that $500 million, most of that to Permian Resources to continue the growth that we had started there. In terms of rigs, it's hard to estimate what our rig count would be because our teams are continuing to improve their efficiencies to continuing to reduce the days required to drill per well. So we would look at it more from a targeted production standpoint, and then Jody and his team would have to figure out what number rigs would require. And based on the productivity of the wells and improved efficiencies, I think they want to go through another couple of quarters to get an idea of how much better that's getting before they but any estimates together. But we're really encouraged about what we're seeing."

We're pretty committed to staying at the $3 billion capital range for this year. But Jody and his team in the Permian business are looking at opportunities to ramp-up in those areas where they've already started development. And we're prepared to do it when prices do recover, but we would expect that to be maybe adding a rig toward the end of this year and then ramping up at some point next year again if prices look like they're going to be in a range that's sustainable."

What we've done is we made the commitment to our employees that we were going to keep our staffing level. We did have just a voluntary separation program at the beginning where some of our later career people who had family issues and needs to go and to leave the company, we allowed some people to leave. But we were selective in terms of trying to make sure the we lost no capability internally. And so those people that did leave had, in most cases, done a great job of training and mentoring people to take their place. So what we've ended up with is a very capable workforce that has the skills and experience necessary in the mid-carrier to higher carrier or related career experiences, but also some early career people who've done just a phenomenal job of helping us through this down cycle. Because what we did is to try to ensure that we were reducing costs. We took some of our early career people sent to the field. They replaced contractors in both our production operations, our well servicing and our drilling activities. And so they were replacing contractors who had been doing these jobs for a number of years, had a lot of experience and our early career people went out there, learned quickly. And because of the way they view things and their fresh approach to asking questions and looking at things differently, we expected them to go out there mostly to learn. But they actually went out there to learn, they added value, the improved logistics and improved efficiencies. And not only was it a cost reduction from the elimination of contractors, but it was actually an improvement because they did a fabulous job to improve efficiencies and to think about how to do things differently. Our field staff, on the other hand, what they did is they got really aggressive and proactive with the mentoring these early career people. And so the combination of both our experienced staff and our earlier career staff working together, they have really added value. And that's part of the reason that our efficiencies are improving. We're seeing these cost reductions in the field. They had to attribute that to both the early career and the mentors out in the field. In addition to that, what we're doing is we know that to be successful for the long haul with an industry that's changed now, the industry that we're facing today has reservoirs that are tough to develop, costlier. And really, the world is more complex than it used to be. So what we feel like is we got to get to the absolute lowest possible cost structure to ensure that we can -- we have sufficient margins and a wider price range than what we've worked in, in the past. And so to do that, we feel like you can't do business as usual. You really have to take a different approach to how you're looking at cost structure reductions. And so we've got teams that are working on things that are further out. Some of which I can't talk about right now, but they're looking at how do we change the cost structure of 2018, 2019? What do we have to do now to do that? And so they're working on the longer view. And these are some of the people that were deployed to these project groups from the drilling and completion operations since we had a major reduction in that activity. What we've found is that by giving our staff more time to be, become more strategic and innovative, they're delivering value. So we not only have a commitment from our management to keep our staff. Our staff has more than paid for that decision by their delivery and their performance and they're continuing to exceed our expectations. Every time it seems that we set targets for them, they exceed it because they're not -- they recognize that we've made the commitment, so they've also made the commitment. And they're -- just been phenomenal. And our staff is very, very engaged, and I believe we'll come through this cycle with a much more -- a much -- a committed, loyal and highly skilled workforce that will be well prepared for any kind of ramp-up that we'll see over the next couple of years."

We've just amended that agreement to add a partner with the Australian state oil company who we partner with in many places. So there's a pretty robust team working appraisal and engineering development. One other area of more immediate growth is that we recently, Vicki went through the region to participate in the inauguration of the Al Hosn facilities and it appears we are well underway on getting an agreement to expand the Al Hosn planned. Engineering is underway, and we're having further discussions later this month to determine just on what schedule and how we would do that.

Good morning, everyone. This quarter was another extremely difficult one for the industry, but we stayed focused on our game plan, addressing the things that are within our sphere of influence so that we not only survive through this tim",994,"Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. This quarter was another extremely difficult one for the industry, but we stayed focused on our game plan, addressing the things that are within our sphere of influence so that we not only survive through this time but thrive. We'll do this through full cycle cost leadership, optimal capital allocation and maintaining our balance sheet. Superior access to and lower costs of capital positions us to invest in opportunities that will grow our business organically or through acquisitions. We believe the world will continue to need oil. And when markets demand production grows, it will first look to the Permian, and we will be ready.
First and foremost, we're focused on operational excellence to drive full cycle costs lower for all of our businesses. This requires subsurface and surface execution excellence. In the first quarter, we demonstrated good operational performance. We grew Permian Resources production by 30,000 BOE per day or 31% year-over-year. We performed above our expectations on new wells brought online, particularly in New Mexico, and we delivered better base production.
Permian production outperformance allowed us to exceed total production expectations for the quarter despite lower-than-planned production from Al Hosn. Al Hosn was shut down for a successful warranty turnaround, but the shutdown was longer than expected. It is now back on production at full capacity.
We also reduced our overall cash operating costs by 23% and achieved SG&A savings of 14% versus the first quarter of last year. To further improve our overall well performance, we're focusing a portion of our workforce on initiatives that will have a step-change impact on costs in the future, such as artificial lift design improvements, multi-bench development, increased integration of new 3D seismic surveys and the application of data analytics into our reservoir characterization.
To incentivize our management and employees, we developed a target metric called total spend per barrel, which is our cash operating, capital and SG&A costs divided by our total production. Our target for 2016 is almost 30% lower than 2015's actual total spend. This is an aggressive target, especially in view of the fact that we reduced total spend per barrel from over $60 to $40 in 2015.
Our 2016 capital program is $3 billion, a 50% reduction from 2015. We're on track to achieve this with first quarter capital spend of $687 million. Our capital is focused in our core areas.
Taking advantage of reduced costs of labor and materials in this environment, we shifted more capital to Permian EOR to modify and expand existing facilities, increasing our capacity to handle and inject greater quantities of CO2. This will enable us to implement additional CO2 projects and further grow oil production. These projects will have a longer duration with typical production response time of 1 to 2 years. By then, we expect prices to be higher than they are today.
We're also targeting lower-cost projects, including residual oil zone CO2 floods where development costs are between $3 and $7 per BOE.
In Permian Resources, our development activities are in the Midland and Delaware basins, in areas where we have existing infrastructure, allowing us to achieve higher returns. We are maintaining minimal activity levels sufficient to continue to improve execution efficiencies and well production performance. This allows us to retain our inventory of shorter-cycle unconventional wells for development during an improved environment.
In the chemicals business, the Ingleside cracker remains on budget and on time for start-up in the first quarter of 2017.
Our balance sheet remains strong on an absolute basis and relative to our peers. In the first quarter, we closed on $285 million of asset sales in the Piceance Basin, the Dallas tower and a small specialty chemical operation. We received $550 million of proceeds from our settlement with Ecuador.
In April, we issued $2.75 billion of bonds that will be used to retire and call about $2 billion of debt maturing in 2016 and 2017.
We ended the first quarter with $3.2 billion, which is ample cash and liquidity to fund our capital program and dividends.
With a strong start in the first quarter, we've raised our production guidance on our core assets to a range of 585,000 to 600,000 BOE per day. Overall domestic production is anticipated to decline slightly through the year, primarily due to the declining natural gas and NGL volumes caused by the curtailment of drilling activity in our gas assets in 2014. We expect to modestly increase in production from Permian Resources versus last year, and Permian EOR production will remain flat.
In our capital programs, we expect slightly higher spending in the second and third quarters due to the timing of major projects in our chemicals and midstream segments. As I mentioned earlier, our full year production will not exceed -- program -- our capital program will not exceed $3 billion. This plan should approximate our expected cash from operations at current commodity prices.
In summary, I'd like to thank our employees for their commitment to excellence in both safety and operations during these challenging times. They're continuing to find ways to add value through increased sales and cost reductions across all segments of our company. While the macro environment remains challenging for the industry, we believe our continued focus on returns, improved cost structure and strong balance sheet provide us with the opportunity to emerge from the current cycle as a stronger company relative to our peers.
Finally, I'd like to take a moment to recognize Steve Chazen. While he's not here today, I know he will eventually listen to this call. On behalf of investors, the Board of Directors and employees, I would like to thank Steve for his leadership and outstanding service to Occidental over his 22-year career. He shaped our company into what it is today, and we're grateful to him for that.
I'll now turn the call to Chris Stavros for a review of our financial results and detailed guidance."

As Vicki noted, despite the severe weakness in product prices during the quarter, our business benefited from higher-than-expected production volumes from our ongoing domestic operations, lower cash operating costs and improved capital efficiency. These factors helped support our operating cash flow during the quarter. This, in combination with a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity, has allowed us to weather the continued weak product price environment.
Our core financial results for the first quarter of 2016 were a loss of $426 million or $0.56 per diluted share, a decrease from both the year-ago quarter and also the fourth quarter of 2015. The decline in both sequential and year-over-year core results were attributable to much weaker commodity prices, which more than offset the benefit from lower costs.
Reported results for GAAP purposes during the first quarter of 2016 was income of $78 million or $0.10 per diluted share compared to a loss of $218 million or $0.28 per diluted share in the prior period -- prior year period. Reported results included gains on asset sales of $87 million after-tax and $438 million after-tax as a result of proceeds received from the settlement with Ecuador, partially offset by several noncash charges.
Oil and gas core after-tax results for the first quarter of 2016 were a loss of $388 million, a sequential decline of about $200 million mainly due to lower commodity prices, partially offset by improved cash operating costs. Our first quarter 2016 worldwide realized oil price of $29.42 per barrel fell by nearly $10 a barrel or nearly 25% compared to prices during last year's fourth quarter.
Total company oil and gas production volumes from our ongoing operations averaged 590,000 BOE per day in the first quarter of 2016, 59,000 BOE per day higher than the prior year period although down 7,000 BOE per day on a sequential quarterly basis. This was well above the higher-end range of 570,000 to 585,000 BOE per day for full year 2016 production guidance that we've provided earlier this year. 
Total domestic production volumes climbed 3% sequentially to 307,000 BOE per day during the first quarter. Our domestic oil production was 197,000 barrels per day, up 7,000 barrels per day from last year's fourth quarter and 17,000 barrels per day higher from the same period a year ago.
Production in our Permian Resources business grew to 128,000 BOE per day during the first quarter of 2016 compared to 118,000 BOE per day during the fourth quarter, far exceeding our earlier guidance of 121,000 BOE per day for the period. Permian Resources volumes grew by more than 30% compared to the year-ago period. 
International production from ongoing operations was 283,000 BOE per day during the first quarter of 2016, down 16,000 BOE per day compared to the first -- fourth quarter of last year, primarily due to the scheduled first quarter warranty shutdown at the Al Hosn gas plant.
Total production from our ongoing operations excludes volumes of 67,000 BOE per day from assets we have either divested or exited or are in the process of exiting. Domestically, this includes our Williston operations, which we sold in November 2015; and our Piceance operations, which we sold in March of 2016. Table showing volumes both on a reported basis and also from pro forma ongoing operations are included in the schedules along with our press release.
Domestic oil and gas cash operating costs from ongoing operations declined to $11.86 per BOE in the first quarter compared to $12.28 per BOE during the fourth quarter of 2015 and 13% below full year 2015 cost of $13.58 per BOE. The reduction in costs is mainly a result of improved efficiency around our surface operations and maintenance.
Overall oil and gas DD&A for the first quarter of 2016 was $15.61 per BOE compared to $15.81 per BOE during 2015. Taxes other than on income, which are directly related to product prices, were $1.15 per BOE for the first quarter compared to $1.32 per BOE during 2015. First quarter exploration expense was $9 million.
Chemicals first quarter 2016 pretax core earnings were $126 million compared with earnings of $116 million during last year's fourth quarter and $139 million in the year-ago period. The sequential improvement in earnings reflected higher sales volumes across most product lines compared with lower natural gas costs, partly offset by weaker PVC, VCM and caustic soda pricing. Weakness was also seen in the calcium chloride business as a result of the unseasonably warm winter evidenced in key markets combined with the industry slowdown in fracking activity.
Chemicals also closed on the sales of its corporate headquarters building in Dallas and a small specialty chemical operation, which together resulted in pretax gains of roughly $90 million, and those are excluded from our core chemical earnings.
Midstream pretax core results were a loss of $95 million for the first quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $45 million in the fourth quarter of last year and a loss of $5 million in the prior year first quarter. The sequential decline was mainly attributable to lower midstream income from Al Hosn due to the warranty shutdown in the quarter and plant maintenance at Dolphin -- at the Dolphin project, which led to lower foreign pipeline income.
Looking at our cash flows for the first quarter. We began the year with $4.4 billion of cash on hand. During the first quarter, we generated $825 million of cash from -- cash flow from continuing operations before working capital and other changes. Net working capital changes consumed $320 million of cash during the period. The use was related to the reduction in capital spending associated with deceleration of drilling activity, cyclical payments of property taxes and employee severance-related costs and payment of liabilities accrued at year-end related to the exit or exiting from some international operations.
Capital expenditures for the first quarter was $685 million, a 41% decline from the $1.2 billion spent in the fourth quarter of 2015. While our first quarter capital was lower than expected, this was due to a deferral of some outlays in midstream and chemicals into the second and third quarters. Our 2016 total company capital program remains on track to be between $2.8 billion to $3 billion and ending the year at a rate similar to the first quarter, as committed project capital winds down.
We received $285 million from the sale of noncore assets in the Piceance Basin, sale of some chemical assets, as I noted earlier. We also collected $550 million from our settlement with Ecuador during the first quarter and expect to receive payment of more than $300 million in the coming months. These proceeds have been classified as discontinued operations in the cash flow statement.
During the quarter, we retired $700 million of debt, which matured in February; and paid $575 million in dividends. We ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $3.2 billion.
On April 4 of this year, we completed a $2.75 billion 3-tranche senior notes offering with attractive coupon rates of 2.6%, 3.4% and 4.4% on a 6-year, 10-year and 30-note -- 30-year notes, respectively. The primary use of the proceeds will go towards refinancing of $750 million of notes that mature on June of this year. And we've also exercised our early redemption option to call $1.25 billion of notes that were scheduled to mature in February 2017. After this redemption, Oxy's total outstanding debt will be approximately $8.3 billion, essentially the same at the end -- as at the end of 2015.
Importantly, this transaction extended the life of our debt maturities by 5 years, with our next maturity not scheduled until February 2018.
Moody's currently rates Oxy at A3 stable and S&P rates us at straight A stable. 
Turning to guidance, as Vicki highlighted, we are raising our full year 2016 production guidance from a range of 2% to 4% previously to 4% to 6%, essentially a 2% increase or within a new range of 585,000 to 600,000 BOE per day for the full year. The increase will be accomplished without any change to our original capital program as primarily a result of better-than-expected production in our domestic operations. Specifically, results in the Permian Resources continue to outperform our expectations due to improved well productivity and better management around our base volumes.
Turning to guidance. For the second quarter, we expect our total oil and gas production pro forma for ongoing operations to increase sequentially to a range of 600,000 to 610,000 BOE per day, as Al Hosn and Dolphin ramp back up from the first quarter scheduled turnarounds and as gas production from Oman's Block 62 continues to rise towards full production levels. Domestically, we expect production to be flattish with first quarter levels or about 307,000 BOE per day.
Second quarter should also see production in Permian Resources similar to the first quarter despite the slowdown in activity. We expect production in Permian Resources to decline modestly during the second half of 2016. Variability around the outcome will be a function of well performance, capturing further efficiency gains and our ability to continue to manage base production. Permian EOR volume should remain relatively steady at about 145,000 BOE per day while also providing stable cash flow.
Our DD&A expense for oil and gas is still expected to be approximately $15 per BOE during 2016 and depreciation of the oil and gas segment is expected to exceed this year's capital investment by more than $1 billion. The combined depreciation for the chemical and midstream segments should be approximately $670 million for the year.
Exploration expense is estimated to be about $25 million pretax for the second quarter. Price changes at current global prices affect our annual operating cash flow by about $100 million for every dollar per barrel change in WTI. A swing of $0.50 per million BTUs in domestic natural gas prices affects annual operating cash flow by about $50 million.
Our midstream operations has exposure to 2 separate and different lines of businesses. The results of our oil and gas marketing and gas processing businesses are inherently volatile and sensitive to changes in commodity prices and price differentials. Conversely, our pipeline and transportation operations and partial ownership interest of the Plains All American GP provide a stream of more stable and predictable income and cash flow.
With regard to our marketing business, we have supply commitments and takeaway capacity to handle our Permian equity production volumes in addition to third-party volumes. The downturn in oil prices has slowed production growth in the Permian, creating a situation of overbuilt infrastructure where takeaway capacity exceeds production. Price differentials between the Permian and Gulf Coast have shrunk to levels that do not fully cover our cost of transportation.
A gradual improvement in oil prices should incentivize production growth in the Permian basin, and we expect price differentials to widen as production fills some of the excess takeaway capacity over time.
Our domestic gas processing business supports domestic upstream production. Margins in these businesses has suffered as NGL prices have dropped significantly. The recent quarterly losses incurred in the midstream business are a direct result of these factors.
In chemicals, we anticipate pretax earnings of about $100 million for the second quarter. We expect that sequential decline in income is due to planned maintenance outages at several of our chloro vinyl plants during the quarter. While price support for chloro vinyls has been lackluster so far this year, the combination of both scheduled and unscheduled industry outages are expected to tighten market conditions for both vinyls and caustic soda into the second half of this year.
Worldwide effective tax rate on our core income was 29% for the first quarter of 2016. Using current strip prices for oil and gas, we expect 2016 domestic tax rate to be about 36% and our international tax rate to be about 76%.
Turning to our overall costs. Total spend per barrel, as Vicki mentioned, was added as a new internal performance metric last year because of Oxy's increased focus on operational efficiency, especially in consideration of the sharp decline in commodity prices. This metric is defined as the total cost per BOE of production and includes capital spending, cash operating costs and G&A costs. A portion of senior management's incentive compensation is directly aligned with this performance metric as it focuses our efforts on efficiency, financial returns and free cash flow generation. This efficiency metric is designed to help manage the reduction in overall spending while rewarding production growth.
During 2015, we were successful in reducing our total spend per BOE by more than 30% compared to the prior year to approximately $40 per BOE. A reduction in our total spend per BOE of similar proportion is also targeted for 2016.
I'll now turn the call over to Jody Elliott, who will discuss activity around our Permian operations."
293286,330034070,974229,"Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Occidental Petroleum Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review the highlights of our Permian Resources and Permian EOR results in the first quarter, provide guidance on our program for the remainder of the year. As Vicki highlighted previously with rega",1237,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review the highlights of our Permian Resources and Permian EOR results in the first quarter, provide guidance on our program for the remainder of the year. As Vicki highlighted previously with regard to capital priorities, due to the current oil price environment, our focus has been to prudently allocate capital to our Permian Basin businesses. With this in mind, our Permian Resources operation is being managed to maximize the value of our workforce and enhance operational capabilities, invest in areas with existing infrastructure and gather critical appraisal information to drive better well productivity.
In Permian EOR, we proportionately increased the capital allocated to this long-lived business to expand CO2 injection capacity and facilities and to bring forward the resource potential. We continue to invest heavily in the application of geoscience and data analytics into our development strategy to ensure we are competitively positioned to take advantage of a sustained improvement in commodity prices.
Turning to Permian Resources. In the first quarter, we achieved record daily production of 128,000 BOE per day, a 31% increase versus the prior year. Oil production increased to 84,000 barrels per day, an 11% increase from the previous quarter and a 35% increase from a year ago. Additionally, we have leveraged and extended our industry-leading practices from our EOR business to drive improvements in base management in order to minimize decline.
Our Delaware Basin well performance continues to be strong. We placed 15 horizontal wells on production in the Wolfcamp A benches in the first quarter. We continued to increase well productivity by increasing contact with a reservoir near the wellbore, utilizing higher cluster density, higher proppant loads and drilling longer laterals.
For example, the Vanguard 3 #15H achieved a peak rate of 2,099 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,308 BOE per day. The H.B. Morrison B 13H with a 10,000 foot lateral achieved a peak rate of 2,335 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,781 BOE per day. Our successful efforts of applying geologic and reservoir parameters into our completion design continues to drive breakthroughs in well productivity and will reduce the economic hurdle point of our inventory.
In the Delaware Basin, our Wolfcamp A 4,500 foot well cost decreased by about 18% from the 2015 cost of $7.7 million to a current cost of $6.3 million. We reduced our drilling time by 6 days from the 2015 average of 25 days to 19 days, measured by rig release to rig release. We expect the cost and productivity improvements in drilling, completions and facilities to continue as we progress our program.
In New Mexico, we are delivering play-leading wells by applying our understanding of geologic and reservoir parameters into our completion design. We're enthusiastic about superior reservoir quality and multi-bench potential in this play.
During the first quarter, we placed 6 horizontal wells on production in the second Bone Spring in New Mexico. One of our best well results to date, the second Bone Spring Cedar Canyon 23 Federal 5H produced a peak rate of 2,820 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,879 BOE per day at an 82% oil cut. We increased proppant from 1,000 to 1,500 pounds per foot and trialed 2 wells with 2,000 pounds per foot. This has resulted in greater contact with a reservoir closer to the wellbore as compared to the prior completion design.
As a result of these advancements in our completion design, the last 4 Cedar Canyon wells put on production have achieved 90-day cumulative production totals approximately double the prior results. We'll continue to leverage our geo-driven analytics to identify advancements in completion design and we'll test more aggressive cluster spacing, more clusters per stage and slick water fluid systems in the second half of 2016.
Drilling and completion costs continue to improve in New Mexico as well, reducing cost per lateral foot by over 20%, resulting in a current completed well cost, including hookup, of $5.9 million. We expect continued improvement in efficiency gains and have targeted well costs of $5.5 million for our 4,500 foot second Bone Spring wells in the second half of 2016.
In the East Midland Basin, we brought the Shields 3105 1WA well online in the first quarter at a peak rate of 1,606 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,395 BOE per day. We also brought online the Polo 1605A at a peak rate of 1,265 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,018 BOE per day. Both wells are producing with high oil cuts.
In the Midland Basin, we made similar improvements in well cost and drilling days in drilling the Wolfcamp A formation. We reduced these -- the cost of this 7,500 foot horizontal wells by 14% from the 2015 cost of $7.1 million to a current cost of $6.1 million. We reduced our drilling days, as measured by rig release to rig release, by 16% from 19 days in 2015 to 16 days in the first quarter.
In Permian Resources, we're continuing to lower field operating expenses to optimize water handling, lower workover expenses and better downhole performance. Since the first quarter of 2015, we've reduced our operating cost per barrel by 33% and continue to work additional cost reduction and efficiency improvements.
We'll maintain flexibility to ramp up our rig activity in the fourth quarter of 2016 and full year 2017 should prices exhibit fundamental stability above the current strip prices.
In Permian EOR, we continue to lower our drilling cost and manage the operations to run our gas processing facilities at full capacity. With resilient base production and low capital requirements, Permian EOR continues to generate free cash flow at low product prices. Drilling costs are running 25% below our benchmark target. We've lowered our cash operating expenses by 21%, driven mainly by lower downhole maintenance and injectant costs.
Phase 1 of CO2 injection at South Hobbs continues to perform well. Additionally, the initial implementation of the residual oil zone, or ROZ projects, are underway at South Hobbs and West Seminole. The ROZ development is a vertical expansion of the CO2 flooded interval. This activity is economic in a low price environment because we typically utilize workover rigs to drill the extra depth into the CO2 floodable sections of the reservoir. The residual oil zone underlies most of our major EOR properties and can be developed between $3 and $7 a barrel.
In summary, we're focusing our resources to achieve 4 core goals: accelerate geoscience characterization and modeling programs to enhance recovery, productivity and field economic returns; minimize base decline and set up major growth programs in both resources and EOR businesses; focus on game-changing technologies and applications; and accelerate continued improvements in both execution and cost. We expect to run between 4 to 5 rigs in our Permian business over the remainder of the year. If we do see evidence of sustained price recovery with improved fundamentals, we could gradually add rigs at a modest pace to ensure our gains and efficiencies are preserved. Our technical staff and engineers will focus on long-term projects, enhance base production and prepare full field development plans to ramp up activity when oil prices recover. We're taking appropriate steps to preserve the efficiency gains achieved and are well positioned for growth as prices recover.
Thank you, and I'll now hand it back to Chris Degner."

So we did -- the remaining area that we are now that's noncore that we will be continuing to reduce our exposure to will be in Bahrain. Libya, where -- we've stopped all investments there. So now we're down to the core areas of Abu Dhabi, Oman and Qatar in the Middle East; Colombia in South America; the Permian in the U.S. along with South Texas. So we view the Permian, Colombia and the 3 areas in the Middle East to still have opportunities for us to continue to grow. Now we're going to try to restrict our activities to just those areas because we -- the one thing that we think will make us better and where we continue -- can continue to get better is to focus and, again, to focus in areas where we have a competitive advantage, and we believe that we do in all of those areas. So our growth opportunities in the future will be focused on just those areas, with the priority being given to the Permian Basin because of our size, our exposure there. We feel like that's the -- that's where we get the most value for the dollars that we invest, so we would prioritize the Permian as a growth strategy."

I'll talk first about the 20% that I mentioned. Really, the 20% that I had mentioned in terms of what we expect ultimately our resources business unit to contribute to total production, that comment was driven by the fact that we were really excited about our EOR business and the fact that our teams over the past 1.5 years have been working on ways to expand our capacity there, so that we could actually accelerate some of our development. We have about 1.4 million barrels of oil equivalent remaining reserves and potential in EOR. And we want to -- at our current pace of development, that would take about 22 years. So we really wanted to accelerate that. But when we looked at cases where we would need to build new massive mega-plant to do that, it really didn't add to value that met our hurdles. So what our teams have done now is they've actually found ways to expand our existing infrastructure for much lower cost. So we're really excited about being able to, over the next 3 to 5 years, start to accelerate EOR. And the good thing about that is our EOR business has just a 4% decline. So we think that combining it with the continued growth from our resources should get us to a point where we can manage the overall base decline of the company to a point where we can better weather these down cycles that are always going to occur at points through the -- as we go forward. So right now we -- what we would do in the short term, though, as we're waiting for our facilities expansion in EOR is any improvements in oil prices to a level that's sufficient to enable us to be able to ramp up, that activity would go first to resources. So this  -- for example, this year, we have about $500 million committed capital that will come off next year. And so we expect next year that we would shift that $500 million, most of that, to Permian Resources to continue the growth that we had started there. In terms of rigs, it's hard to estimate what our rig count would be because our teams are continuing to improve their efficiencies to -- continuing to reduce the days required to drill per well. So we would look at it more from a targeted production standpoint, and then Jody and his team would have to figure out what number of rigs that would require. And based on the productivity of the wells and improved efficiencies, I think they want to go through another couple of quarters to get an idea of how much better that's getting before they put any estimates together. But we're really encouraged about what we're seeing."

Today, there's a pretty good excess of capacity in the market. But having said that, a significant portion of our improvements are due to things like design changes, technology improvements, utilizing some proprietary things such as OXY drilling dynamics. We've invented some special stabilizers in drilling, integrated planning, manufacturing mode, all those things are really driving the portion of -- the big portion of our costs improvements. And those are sustainable. We've maintain our workforce. So when we ramp back up, we won't have to access high cost consultants to run rigs and run frac course. And we've recently made an alignment change with our supply chain organization, where they've been integrated into operations as part of our integrated planning teams. And so the result of that is we've got better alignment of our commercial and our technical strategies to the actual value drivers in each one of those programs. And that lets us drive productivity, utilization, logistics improvements. And that takes costs out of the system not only for us but for our suppliers. And so in most cases, price is important, but it's not the needle mover. So -- but we are in conversations with our strategic suppliers to determine ways we can better align our operations, drive out combined system costs and focus on goals where we've got common success. And given our scale in the Permian, we're getting pretty considerable interest. So we continue to make immediate improvements to cash flow and costs. We're proactively taking actions to mitigate against inflation in a higher WTI environment. At the end of the day, we'll be ready."

What we've done is we made the commitment to our employees that we were going to keep our staffing level. We did have just a voluntary separation program at the beginning where some of our later-career people who had family issues and needs to go and to leave the company, we allowed some people to leave. But we were selective in terms of trying to make sure the we lost no capability internally. And so those people that did leave had, in most cases, done a great job of training and mentoring people to take their place. So what we've ended up with is a very capable workforce that has the skills and experience necessary in the mid-career to higher-career -- or later-career experiences, but also some early career people who've done just a phenomenal job of helping us through this down cycle. Because what we did is to try to ensure that we were reducing costs. We took some of our early career people, sent them to the field. They replaced contractors in both our production operations, our well servicing and our drilling activities. And so they were replacing contractors who had been doing these jobs for a number of years, had a lot of experience. And our early career people went out there, learned it quickly. And because of the way they view things and their fresh approach to asking questions and looking at things differently, we expected them to go out there mostly to learn. But they actually went out there to learn, they added value, they improved logistics and improved efficiencies. And not only was it a cost reduction from the elimination of contractors, but it was actually an improvement because they did a fabulous job to improve efficiencies and to think about how to do things differently. Our field staff, on the other hand, what they did is they got really aggressive and proactive with mentoring these early career people. And so the combination of both our experienced staff and our earlier-career staff working together, they have really added value. And that's part of the reason that our efficiencies are improving. We're seeing these cost reductions in the field. We have to attribute that to both the early career and the mentors out in the field. In addition to that, what we're doing is we know that to be successful for the long haul with an industry that's changed now -- the industry that we're facing today has reservoirs that are tougher to develop, costlier. And really, the world is more complex than it used to be. So what we feel like is we've got to get to the absolute lowest possible cost structure to ensure that we can -- we have sufficient margins and a wider price range than what we've worked in, in the past. And so to do that, we feel like you can't do business as usual. You really have to take a different approach to how you're looking at cost structure reductions. And so we've got teams that are working on things that are further out. Some of which I can't talk about right now, but they're looking at how do we change the cost structure of 2018, 2019, what do we have to do now to do that. And so they're working on the longer view. And these are some of the people that were deployed to these project groups from the drilling and completion operations since we had a major reduction in that activity. What we've found is by giving our staff more time to become more strategic and innovative, they're delivering value. So we not only have a commitment from our management to keep our staff. Our staff has more than paid for that decision by their delivery and their performance, and they're continuing to exceed our expectations. Every time it seems that we set targets for them, they exceed it because they're not -- they recognize that we've made the commitment, so they've also made the commitment. And they're -- just they've been phenomenal. And our staff is very, very engaged. And I believe we'll come through this cycle with a much more -- a much -- a committed, loyal and highly skilled workforce that will be well prepared for any kind of ramp-up that we'll see over the next couple of years."

Good morning, everyone. This quarter was another extremely difficult one for the industry, but we stayed focused on our game plan, addressing the things that are within our sphere of influence so that we not only survive through this tim",993,"Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. This quarter was another extremely difficult one for the industry, but we stayed focused on our game plan, addressing the things that are within our sphere of influence so that we not only survive through this time but thrive. We'll do this through full cycle cost leadership, optimal capital allocation and maintaining our balance sheet. Superior access to and lower costs of capital positions us to invest in opportunities that will grow our business organically or through acquisitions. We believe the world will continue to need oil. And when markets demand production growth, they will first look to the Permian, and we will be ready.
First and foremost, we're focused on operational excellence to drive full cycle costs lower for all of our businesses. This requires subsurface and surface execution excellence. In the first quarter, we demonstrated good operational performance. We grew Permian Resources production by 30,000 BOE per day or 31% year-over-year. We performed above our expectations on new wells brought online, particularly in New Mexico, and we delivered better base production. Permian production outperformance allowed us to exceed total production expectations for the quarter despite lower-than-planned production from Al Hosn. Al Hosn was shut down for a successful warranty turnaround, but the shutdown was longer than expected. It is now back on production at full capacity.
We also reduced our overall cash operating costs by 23% and achieved SG&A savings of 14% versus the first quarter of last year. To further improve our overall well performance, we're focusing a portion of our workforce on initiatives that will have a step-change impact on costs in the future, such as artificial lift design improvements, multi-bench development, increased integration of new 3D seismic surveys and the application of data analytics into our reservoir characterization.
To incentivize our management and employees, we developed a target metric called total spend per barrel, which is our cash operating, capital and SG&A costs divided by our total production. Our target for 2016 is almost 30% lower than 2015's actual total spend. This is an aggressive target, especially in view of the fact that we reduced total spend per barrel from over $60 to $40 in 2015. Our 2016 capital program is $3 billion, a 50% reduction from 2015. We're on track to achieve this with first quarter capital spend of $687 million. Our capital is focused in our core areas.
Taking advantage of reduced costs of labor and materials in this environment, we shifted more capital to Permian EOR to modify and expand existing facilities, increasing our capacity to handle and inject greater quantities of CO2. This will enable us to implement additional CO2 projects and further grow oil production. These projects will have a longer duration with typical production response time of 1 to 2 years. By then, we expect prices to be higher than they are today. We're also targeting lower-cost projects, including residual oil zone CO2 floods where development costs are between $3 and $7 per BOE.
In Permian Resources, our development activities are in the Midland and Delaware basins, in areas where we have existing infrastructure, allowing us to achieve higher returns. We are maintaining minimal activity levels sufficient to continue to improve execution efficiencies and well production performance. This allows us to retain our inventory of shorter-cycle unconventional wells for development during an improved environment. In the chemicals business, the Ingleside cracker remains on budget and on time for start-up in the first quarter of 2017.
Our balance sheet remains strong on an absolute basis and relative to our peers. In the first quarter, we closed on $285 million of asset sales in the Piceance Basin, the Dallas tower and a small specialty chemical operation. We received $550 million of proceeds from our settlement with Ecuador. In April, we issued $2.75 billion of bonds that will be used to retire and call about $2 billion of debt maturing in 2016 and 2017. We ended the first quarter with $3.2 billion, which is ample cash and liquidity to fund our capital program and dividends.
With a strong start in the first quarter, we've raised our production guidance on our core assets to a range of 585,000 to 600,000 BOE per day. Overall domestic production is anticipated to decline slightly through the year, primarily due to the declining natural gas and NGL volumes caused by the curtailment of drilling activity in our gas assets in 2014. We expect a modest increase in production from Permian Resources versus last year, and Permian EOR production will remain flat.
In our capital programs, we expect slightly higher spending in the second and third quarters due to the timing of major projects in our chemicals and midstream segments. As I mentioned earlier, our full year production will not exceed -- program, our capital program will not exceed $3 billion. This plan should approximate our expected cash from operations at current commodity prices.
In summary, I'd like to thank our employees for their commitment to excellence in both safety and operations during these challenging times. They're continuing to find ways to add value through increased sales and cost reductions across all segments of our company. While the macro environment remains challenging for the industry, we believe our continued focus on returns, improved cost structure and strong balance sheet provide us with the opportunity to emerge from the current cycle as a stronger company relative to our peers.
Finally, I'd like to take a moment to recognize Steve Chazen. While he's not here today, I know he will eventually listen to this call. On behalf of investors, the Board of Directors and employees, I would like to thank Steve for his leadership and outstanding service to Occidental over his 22-year career. He shaped our company into what it is today, and we're grateful to him for that.
I'll now turn the call to Chris Stavros for a review of our financial results and detailed guidance."

As Vicki noted, despite the severe weakness in product prices during the quarter, our business benefited from higher-than-expected production volumes from our ongoing domestic operations, lower cash operating costs and improved capital efficiency. These factors helped support our operating cash flow during the quarter. This, in combination with a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity, has allowed us to weather the continued weak product price environment.
Our core financial results for the first quarter of 2016 were a loss of $426 million or $0.56 per diluted share, a decrease from both the year-ago quarter and also the fourth quarter of 2015. The decline in both sequential and year-over-year core results were attributable to much weaker commodity prices, which more than offset the benefit from lower costs. Reported results for GAAP purposes during the first quarter of 2016 was income of $78 million or $0.10 per diluted share compared to a loss of $218 million or $0.28 per diluted share in the prior period -- prior year period. Reported results included gains on asset sales of $87 million after-tax and $438 million after-tax as a result of proceeds received from the settlement with Ecuador, partially offset by several noncash charges.
Oil and gas core after-tax results for the first quarter of 2016 were a loss of $388 million, a sequential decline of about $200 million mainly due to lower commodity prices, partially offset by improved cash operating costs. Our first quarter 2016 worldwide realized oil price of $29.42 per barrel fell by nearly $10 a barrel or nearly 25% compared to prices during last year's fourth quarter.
Total company oil and gas production volumes from our ongoing operations averaged 590,000 BOE per day in the first quarter of 2016, 59,000 BOE per day higher than the prior year period although down 7,000 BOE per day on a sequential quarterly basis. This was well above the higher-end range of 570,000 to 585,000 BOE per day for full year 2016 production guidance that we've provided earlier this year. 
Total domestic production volumes climbed 3% sequentially to 307,000 BOE per day during the first quarter. Our domestic oil production was 197,000 barrels per day, up 7,000 barrels per day from last year's fourth quarter and 17,000 barrels per day higher from the same period a year ago. Production in our Permian Resources business grew to 128,000 BOE per day during the first quarter of 2016 compared to 118,000 BOE per day during the fourth quarter, far exceeding our earlier guidance of 121,000 BOE per day for the period. Permian Resources volumes grew by more than 30% compared to the year-ago period. 
International production from ongoing operations was 283,000 BOE per day during the first quarter of 2016, down 16,000 BOE per day compared to the first -- fourth quarter of last year, primarily due to the scheduled first quarter warranty shutdown at the Al Hosn gas plant. Total production from our ongoing operations excludes volumes of 67,000 BOE per day from assets we have either divested or exited or are in the process of exiting. Domestically, this includes our Williston operations, which we sold in November 2015; and our Piceance operations, which we sold in March of 2016. Table showing volumes both on a reported basis and also from pro forma ongoing operations are included in the schedules along with our press release.
Domestic oil and gas cash operating costs from ongoing operations declined to $11.86 per BOE in the first quarter compared to $12.28 per BOE during the fourth quarter of 2015 and 13% below full year 2015 cost of $13.58 per BOE. The reduction in costs is mainly a result of improved efficiency around our surface operations and maintenance. Overall oil and gas DD&A for the first quarter of 2016 was $15.61 per BOE compared to $15.81 per BOE during 2015. Taxes other than on income, which are directly related to product prices, were $1.15 per BOE for the first quarter compared to $1.32 per BOE during 2015. First quarter exploration expense was $9 million.
Chemicals first quarter 2016 pretax core earnings were $126 million compared with earnings of $116 million during last year's fourth quarter and $139 million in the year-ago period. The sequential improvement in earnings reflected higher sales volumes across most product lines compared with lower natural gas costs, partly offset by weaker PVC, VCM and caustic soda pricing. Weakness was also seen in the calcium chloride business as a result of the unseasonably warm winter evidenced in key markets combined with the industry slowdown in fracking activity. Chemicals also closed on the sales of its corporate headquarters building in Dallas and a small specialty chemical operation, which together resulted in pretax gains of roughly $90 million, and those are excluded from our core chemical earnings.
Midstream pretax core results were a loss of $95 million for the first quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $45 million in the fourth quarter of last year and a loss of $5 million in the prior year first quarter. The sequential decline was mainly attributable to lower midstream income from Al Hosn due to the warranty shutdown in the quarter and planned maintenance at Dolphin -- at the Dolphin project, which led to lower foreign pipeline income.
Looking at our cash flows for the first quarter. We began the year with $4.4 billion of cash on hand. During the first quarter, we generated $825 million of cash from -- cash flow from continuing operations before working capital and other changes. Net working capital changes consumed $320 million of cash during the period. The use was related to the reduction in capital spending associated with deceleration of drilling activity, cyclical payments of property taxes and employee severance-related costs and payment of liabilities accrued at year-end related to the exit or exiting from some international operations.
Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $685 million, a 41% decline from the $1.2 billion spent in the fourth quarter of 2015. While our first quarter capital was lower than expected, this was due to a deferral of some outlays in midstream and chemicals into the second and third quarters. Our 2016 total company capital program remains on track to be between $2.8 billion to $3 billion and ending the year at a rate similar to the first quarter, as committed project capital winds down.
We received $285 million from the sale of noncore assets in the Piceance Basin, sale of some chemical assets, as I noted earlier. We also collected $550 million from our settlement with Ecuador during the first quarter and expect to receive payment of more than $300 million in the coming months. These proceeds have been classified as discontinued operations in the cash flow statement. During the quarter, we retired $700 million of debt, which matured in February; and paid $575 million in dividends. We ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $3.2 billion.
On April 4 of this year, we completed a $2.75 billion 3-tranche senior notes offering with attractive coupon rates of 2.6%, 3.4% and 4.4% on a 6-year, 10-year and 30-note -- 30-year notes, respectively. The primary use of the proceeds will go towards refinancing of $750 million of notes that mature on June of this year. And we've also exercised our early redemption option to call $1.25 billion of notes that were scheduled to mature in February 2017. After this redemption, Oxy's total outstanding debt will be approximately $8.3 billion, essentially the same at the end -- as at the end of 2015. Importantly, this transaction extended the life of our debt maturities by 5 years, with our next maturity not scheduled until February 2018. Moody's currently rates Oxy at A3 stable and S&P rates us at straight A stable. 
Turning to guidance, as Vicki highlighted, we are raising our full year 2016 production guidance from a range of 2% to 4% previously to 4% to 6%, essentially a 2% increase or within the new range of 585,000 to 600,000 BOE per day for the full year. The increase will be accomplished without any change to our original capital program as primarily a result of better-than-expected production in our domestic operations. Specifically, results in the Permian Resources continue to outperform our expectations due to improved well productivity and better management around our base volumes.
Turning to guidance for the second quarter, we expect our total oil and gas production pro forma for ongoing operations to increase sequentially to a range of 600,000 to 610,000 BOE per day, as Al Hosn and Dolphin ramp back up from the first quarter scheduled turnarounds and as gas production from Oman's Block 62 continues to rise towards full production levels. Domestically, we expect production to be flattish with first quarter levels or about 307,000 BOE per day.
Second quarter should also see production in Permian Resources similar to the first quarter despite the slowdown in activity. We expect production in Permian Resources to decline modestly during the second half of 2016. Variability around the outcome will be a function of well performance, capturing further efficiency gains and our ability to continue to manage base production. Permian EOR volume should remain relatively steady at about 145,000 BOE per day while also providing stable cash flow.
Our DD&A expense for oil and gas is still expected to be approximately $15 per BOE during 2016 and depreciation of the oil and gas segment is expected to exceed this year's capital investment by more than $1 billion. The combined depreciation for the chemical and midstream segments should be approximately $670 million for the year. Exploration expense is estimated to be about $25 million pretax for the second quarter. Price changes at current global prices affect our annual operating cash flow by about $100 million for every $1 per barrel change in WTI. A swing of $0.50 per million BTUs in domestic natural gas prices affects annual operating cash flow by about $50 million.
Our midstream operations has exposure to 2 separate and different lines of businesses. The results of our oil and gas marketing and gas processing businesses are inherently volatile and sensitive to changes in commodity prices and price differentials. Conversely, our pipeline and transportation operations and partial ownership interest of the Plains All American GP provide a stream of more stable and predictable income and cash flow.
With regard to our marketing business, we have supply commitments and takeaway capacity to handle our Permian equity production volumes in addition to third-party volumes. The downturn in oil prices has slowed production growth in the Permian, creating a situation of overbuilt infrastructure where takeaway capacity exceeds production. Price differentials between the Permian and Gulf Coast have shrunk to levels that do not fully cover our cost of transportation.
A gradual improvement in oil prices should incentivize production growth in the Permian basin, and we expect price differentials to widen as production fills some of the excess takeaway capacity over time. Our domestic gas processing business supports domestic upstream production. Margins in this business have suffered as NGL prices have dropped significantly. The recent quarterly losses incurred in the midstream business are a direct result of these factors.
In chemicals, we anticipate pretax earnings of about $100 million for the second quarter. We expect that sequential decline in income is due to planned maintenance outages at several of our chloro vinyl plants during the quarter. While price support for chloro vinyls has been lackluster so far this year, the combination of both scheduled and unscheduled industry outages are expected to tighten market conditions for both vinyls and caustic soda into the second half of this year.
The worldwide effective tax rate on our core income was 29% for the first quarter of 2016. Using current strip prices for oil and gas, we expect 2016 domestic tax rate to be about 36% and our international tax rate to be about 76%.
Turning to our overall costs. Total spend per barrel, as Vicki mentioned, was added as a new internal performance metric last year because of Oxy's increased focus on operational efficiency, especially in consideration of the sharp decline in commodity prices. This metric is defined as the total cost per BOE of production and includes capital spending, cash operating costs and G&A costs. A portion of senior management's incentive compensation is directly aligned with this performance metric as it focuses our efforts on efficiency, financial returns and free cash flow generation. This efficiency metric is designed to help manage the reduction in overall spending while rewarding production growth. During 2015, we were successful in reducing our total spend per BOE by more than 30% compared to the prior year to approximately $40 per BOE. A reduction in our total spend per BOE of similar proportion is also targeted for 2016.
I'll now turn the call over to Jody Elliott, who will discuss activity around our Permian operations."

As Vicki highlighted previously with rega",1237,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review the highlights of our Permian Resources and Permian EOR results in the first quarter, provide guidance on our program for the remainder of the year. As Vicki highlighted previously with regard to capital priorities, due to the current oil price environment, our focus has been to prudently allocate capital to our Permian Basin businesses. With this in mind, our Permian Resources operation is being managed to maximize the value of our workforce and enhance operational capabilities, invest in areas with existing infrastructure and gather critical appraisal information to drive better well productivity.
In Permian EOR, we proportionately increased the capital allocated to this long-lived business to expand CO2 injection capacity and facilities and to bring forward the resource potential. We continue to invest heavily in the application of geoscience and data analytics into our development strategy to ensure we are competitively positioned to take advantage of a sustained improvement in commodity prices.
Turning to Permian Resources. In the first quarter, we achieved record daily production of 128,000 BOE per day, a 31% increase versus the prior year. Oil production increased to 84,000 barrels per day, an 11% increase from the previous quarter and a 35% increase from a year ago. Additionally, we have leveraged and extended our industry-leading practices from our EOR business to drive improvements in base management in order to minimize decline.
Our Delaware Basin well performance continues to be strong. We placed 15 horizontal wells on production in the Wolfcamp A benches in the first quarter. We continued to increase well productivity by increasing contact with a reservoir near the wellbore, utilizing higher cluster density, higher proppant loads and drilling longer laterals. For example, the Vanguard 3 #15H achieved a peak rate of 2,099 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,308 BOE per day. The H.B. Morrison B 13H with a 10,000 foot lateral achieved a peak rate of 2,335 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,781 BOE per day. Our successful efforts of applying geologic and reservoir parameters into our completion design continues to drive breakthroughs in well productivity and will reduce the economic hurdle point of our inventory.
In the Delaware Basin, our Wolfcamp A 4,500 foot well cost decreased by about 18% from the 2015 cost of $7.7 million to a current cost of $6.3 million. We reduced our drilling time by 6 days from the 2015 average of 25 days to 19 days, measured by rig release to rig release. We expect the cost and productivity improvements in drilling, completions and facilities to continue as we progress our program.
In New Mexico, we are delivering play-leading wells by applying our understanding of geologic and reservoir parameters into our completion design. We're enthusiastic about superior reservoir quality and multi-bench potential in this play. During the first quarter, we placed 6 horizontal wells on production in the second Bone Spring in New Mexico. One of our best well results to date, the second Bone Spring Cedar Canyon 23 Federal 5H produced a peak rate of 2,820 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,879 BOE per day at an 82% oil cut. We increased proppant from 1,000 to 1,500 pounds per foot and trialed 2 wells with 2,000 pounds per foot. This has resulted in greater contact with a reservoir closer to the wellbore as compared to the prior completion design.
As a result of these advancements in our completion design, the last 4 Cedar Canyon wells put on production have achieved 90-day cumulative production totals, approximately double the prior results. We'll continue to leverage our geo-driven analytics to identify advancements in completion design and we'll test more aggressive cluster spacing, more clusters per stage and slick water fluid systems in the second half of 2016. Drilling and completion costs continue to improve in New Mexico as well, reducing cost per lateral foot by over 20%, resulting in a current completed well cost, including hookup, of $5.9 million. We expect continued improvement in efficiency gains and have targeted well costs of $5.5 million for our 4,500 foot second Bone Spring wells in the second half of 2016.
In the East Midland Basin, we brought the Shields 3105 1WA well online in the first quarter at a peak rate of 1,606 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,395 BOE per day. We also brought online the Polo 1605A at a peak rate of 1,265 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,018 BOE per day. Both wells are producing with high oil cuts. In the Midland Basin, we made similar improvements in well cost and drilling days in drilling the Wolfcamp A formation. We reduced these -- the cost of this 7,500 foot horizontal wells by 14% from the 2015 cost of $7.1 million to a current cost of $6.1 million. We reduced our drilling days, as measured by rig release to rig release, by 16% from 19 days in 2015 to 16 days in the first quarter.
In Permian Resources, we're continuing to lower field operating expenses to optimize water handling, lower workover expenses and better downhole performance. Since the first quarter of 2015, we've reduced our operating cost per barrel by 33% and continue to work additional cost reduction and efficiency improvements. We'll maintain flexibility to ramp up our rig activity in the fourth quarter of 2016 and full year 2017 should prices exhibit fundamental stability above the current strip prices.
In Permian EOR, we continue to lower our drilling cost and manage the operations to run our gas processing facilities at full capacity. With resilient base production and low capital requirements, Permian EOR continues to generate free cash flow at low product prices. Drilling costs are running 25% below our benchmark target. We've lowered our cash operating expenses by 21%, driven mainly by lower downhole maintenance and injectant costs.
Phase 1 of CO2 injection at South Hobbs continues to perform well. Additionally, the initial implementation of the residual oil zone, or ROZ projects, are underway at South Hobbs and West Seminole. The ROZ development is a vertical expansion of the CO2 flooded interval. This activity is economic in a low price environment because we typically utilize workover rigs to drill the extra depth into the CO2 floodable sections of the reservoir. The residual oil zone underlies most of our major EOR properties and can be developed between $3 and $7 a barrel.
In summary, we're focusing our resources to achieve 4 core goals: accelerate geoscience characterization and modeling programs to enhance recovery, productivity and field economic returns; minimize base decline and set up major growth programs in both resources and EOR businesses; focus on game-changing technologies and applications; and accelerate continued improvements in both execution and cost. We expect to run between 4 to 5 rigs in our Permian business over the remainder of the year. If we do see evidence of sustained price recovery with improved fundamentals, we could gradually add rigs at a modest pace to ensure our gains and efficiencies are preserved. Our technical staff and engineers will focus on long-term projects, enhance base production and prepare full field development plans to ramp up activity when oil prices recover. We're taking appropriate steps to preserve the efficiency gains achieved and are well positioned for growth as prices recover.
Thank you, and I'll now hand it back to Chris Degner."

So any -- just any thoughts on how that mix changes and your ultimate rig redeployment strategy."

Really, the 20% that I had mentioned in terms of what we expect ultimately our resources business unit to contribute to total production, that comment was driven by the fact that we were really excited",468,"Yes. I'll talk first about the 20% that I mentioned. Really, the 20% that I had mentioned in terms of what we expect ultimately our resources business unit to contribute to total production, that comment was driven by the fact that we were really excited about our EOR business and the fact that our teams over the past 1.5 years have been working on ways to expand our capacity there, so that we could actually accelerate some of our development. We have about 1.4 million barrels of oil equivalent remaining reserves and potential in EOR. And we want to -- at our current pace of development, that would take about 22 years. So we really wanted to accelerate that. But when we looked at cases where we would need to build a new massive mega-plant to do that, it really didn't add to value that met our hurdles. So what our teams have done now is they've actually found ways to expand our existing infrastructure for much lower cost. So we're really excited about being able to, over the next 3 to 5 years, start to accelerate EOR. And the good thing about that is our EOR business has just a 4% decline. So we think that combining it with the continued growth from our resources should get us to a point where we can manage the overall base decline of the company to a point where we can better weather these down cycles that are always going to occur at points through the -- as we go forward. So right now we -- what we would do in the short term, though, as we're waiting for our facilities expansion in EOR is any improvements in oil prices to a level that's sufficient to enable us to be able to ramp up, that activity would go first to resources. So this -- for example, this year, we have about $500 million committed capital that will come off next year. And so we expect next year that we would shift that $500 million, most of that, to Permian Resources to continue the growth that we had started there. In terms of rigs, it's hard to estimate what our rig count would be because our teams are continuing to improve their efficiencies to -- continuing to reduce the days required to drill per well. So we would look at it more from a targeted production standpoint, and then Jody and his team would have to figure out what number of rigs that would require. And based on the productivity of the wells and improved efficiencies, I think they want to go through another couple of quarters to get an idea of how much better that's getting before they put any estimates together. But we're really encouraged about what we're seeing."

Today, there's a pretty good excess of capacity in the market. But having said that, a significant portion of our improvements are due to things like design changes, technology improvements, utilizing some proprietary things such as OXY drilling dynamics. We've invented some special stabilizers in drilling, integrated planning, manufacturing mode, all those things are really driving the portion of -- the big portion of our costs improvements. And those are sustainable. We've maintain our workforce. So when we ramp back up, we won't have to access high cost consultants to run rigs and run frac cores. And we've recently made an alignment change with our supply chain organization, where they've been integrated into operations as part of our integrated planning teams. And so the result of that is we've got better alignment of our commercial and our technical strategies to the actual value drivers in each one of those programs. And that lets us drive productivity, utilization, logistics improvements. And that takes costs out of the system not only for us but for our suppliers. And so in most cases, price is important, but it's not the needle mover. So but we are in conversations with our strategic suppliers to determine ways we can better align our operations, drive out combined system costs and focus on goals where we've got common success. And given our scale in the Permian, we're getting pretty considerable interest. So we continue to make immediate improvements to cash flow and cost.

What we've done is we made the commitment to our employees that we we",760,"I think that what we've done with our staff has definitely differentiated us from our competition, and I think it's a contrarian view to how one should manage through a cycle like this. What we've done is we made the commitment to our employees that we were going to keep our staffing level. We did have just a voluntary separation program at the beginning where some of our later-career people who had family issues and needs to go and to leave the company, we allowed some people to leave. But we were selective in terms of trying to make sure that we lost no capability internally. And so those people that did leave had, in most cases, done a great job of training and mentoring people to take their place. So what we've ended up with is a very capable workforce that has the skills and experience necessary in the mid-career to higher-career -- or later-career experiences, but also some early career people who've done just a phenomenal job of helping us through this down cycle. Because what we did is to try to ensure that we were reducing cost, we took some of our early career people, sent them to the field. They replaced contractors in both our production operations, our well servicing and our drilling activities. And so they were replacing contractors who had been doing these jobs for a number of years, had a lot of experience. And our early career people went out there, learned it quickly, and because of the way they view things and their fresh approach to asking questions and looking at things differently, we expected them to go out there mostly to learn. But they actually went out there to learn, they added value, they improved logistics and improved efficiencies. And not only was it a cost reduction from the elimination of contractors, but it was actually an improvement because they did a fabulous job to improve efficiencies and to think about how to do things differently. Our field staff, on the other hand, what they did is they got really aggressive and proactive with mentoring these early career people. And so the combination of both our experienced staff and our earlier-career staff working together, they have really added value. And that's part of the reason that our efficiencies are improving. We're seeing these cost reductions in the field. We have to attribute that to both the early career and the mentors out in the field. In addition to that, what we're doing is we know that to be successful for the long haul with an industry that's changed now. The industry that we're facing today has reservoirs that are tougher to develop, costlier. And really, the world is more complex than it used to be. So what we feel like is we've got to get to the absolute lowest possible cost structure to ensure that we can -- we have sufficient margins and a wider price range than what we've worked in, in the past. And so to do that, we feel like you can't do business as usual. You really have to take a different approach to how you're looking at cost structure reductions. And so we've got teams that are working on things that are further out. Some of which I can't talk about right now, but they're looking at how do we change the cost structure of 2018, 2019, what do we have to do now to do that. And so they're working on the longer view. And these are some of the people that were deployed to these project groups from the drilling and completion operations since we had a major reduction in that activity. What we've found is by giving our staff more time to become more strategic and innovative, they're delivering value. So we not only have a commitment from our management to keep our staff. Our staff has more than paid for that decision by their delivery and their performance, and they're continuing to exceed our expectations. Every time it seems that we set targets for them, they exceed it because they're not -- they recognize that we've made the commitment, so they've also made the commitment. And they're -- just they've been phenomenal. And our staff is very, very engaged. And I believe we'll come through this cycle with a much more -- a much -- a committed, loyal and highly skilled workforce that will be well prepared for any kind of ramp-up that we'll see over the next couple of years."

We've just amended that agreement to add a partner with the Austrian state oil company who we partner with in many places. So there's a pretty robust team working appraisal and engineering development. One other area of more immediate growth is that we recently -- Vicki went to the region to participate in the inauguration of the Al Hosn facilities. And it appears that we are well along the way to getting to an agreement to expand the Al Hosn plant.

Last quarter, I told you our game plan for this year has been to address the things within our sphere of influence to ultimately not only survive but thrive in the current weak commodity price environment. To",1644,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Last quarter, I told you our game plan for this year has been to address the things within our sphere of influence to ultimately not only survive but thrive in the current weak commodity price environment. To that end, we're on target to achieve the higher end of our production guidance for 2016 while keeping our capital program on budget at $3 billion.
We continue to make progress lowering our cost structure, which we know is critical to both short- and long-term success. Our capital discipline and cost reduction efficiencies, combined with improvement in new well productivity and better base production management, have enabled us to further reduce our total spend per barrel production this year compared to 2015. 
In addition, our strategy around capital is to be prudent and remain focused on returns as we expect the commodity price environment to stay challenging through the rest of this year and into 2017. At the same time, we'll maintain the flexibility necessary to maneuver through a range of price scenarios. Finally, due to the strength of our balance sheet and the quality of our portfolio, we have raised our dividend for the 14th consecutive year.
Total company production for our ongoing productions increased to 609,000 BOE per day from 590,000 BOE per day in the first quarter. The increase was driven by Al Hosn Gas in Abu Dhabi and the new gas project in Oman. The increase in average daily production of 26,000 BOE per day from Al Hosn versus the first quarter of 2016 is due mainly to lower production volumes in the first quarter caused by a scheduled warranty shutdown. However, 10% of the increase is due to improved plan efficiencies gained by the Al Hosn operations team. As you know, Al Hosn Gas is a joint venture between Oxy and Abu Dhabi. The Al Hosn team has done an excellent job of optimizing deliverability through the plant.
An additional 7,000 BOE per day came from Block 62 in Oman, where a recently constructed gas plant was put online to process production from 2 newly developed gas fields. The plant was completed on time and on budget. This enabled us to achieve record production in Oman this quarter. 
In addition, our cutter team has worked to get production in the field or ISSD to its highest level in over 16 years. Completion design improvement in complex horizontal wells and enhanced base production management contributed to this production milestone. Permian Resources production this quarter was 126,000 BOE per day, representing year-over-year growth of 16%. As Jody will show, we're continuing to see improvements in well productivity in all areas.
The increases in production from Al Hosn, Block 62 and ISSD, along with strong year-over-year production growth from Permian Resources, will help us reach the higher end of our 4% to 6% production growth guidance for 2016.
Our capital spending in the second quarter declined modestly as we shifted timing on spending for certain chemicals and Midstream projects and slowed our drilling program in the Permian. This drilling program is consistent with the plans we put in place at the beginning of this year and with our strategy to remain conservative this price environment. 
Continued improvements in project designs and capital execution has helped us to do more than expected with our $3 billion capital budget. This, along with improved production performance in many areas of our operations, are the reasons we expect to achieve the upper end of our production guidance for the year. 
It's important to note that most of our cost reductions are due to our own efficiency gains, not service company unit cost reductions. In fact, approximately 80% of our drilling cost reductions are due to faster penetration rates achieved by the application of Oxy drilling dynamics, along with improved well construction design, lower cost of materials and enhanced logistics.
In Permian Resources, the cost savings we have achieved due to improved efficiencies will be redeployed in the drilling incremental wells in the latter part of the year, which will positively impact 2017 production.
Additional capital will also be shifted to Colombia, where our teams have generated opportunities that deliver attractive returns at current prices. This activity will also support 2017 production. The construction's a joint venture Ingleside box on budget and on schedule to be completed in the first quarter of 2017
In addition, the crude oil export terminal at Ingleside being constructed by Midstream is also on budget and on time to be complete by year-end. The terminal will have a total oil storage capacity of 2 million barrels and throughput capacity of approximately 300,000 barrels of oil per day.
Although these activities will slightly increase our capital spending during the third and fourth quarters, we don't expect to exceed our $3 billion budgeted spending for the full year. With the completion of the long-term projects in both our chemical and Midstream segments, we expect to have increased flexibility with our capital program in 2017.
Our efforts to focus on efficiency are paying off we continued to lower our total spend per barrel of production. This metric includes our overhead, operating and capital costs per barrel of production. Our organization is focused on this metric and we have linked incentive compensation to it. The metric is designed to drive cost reductions, increased productivity, optimize base production. 
In 2014, our total spend per barrel averaged close to $62. We lowered this to about $40 in 2015 and have targeted $28.50 per barrel in 2016. In the first half of this year, we've beaten our target with average total spend of about $27 per barrel. We expect similar results during the second half of this year
Despite the increase in oil prices and energy costs during the second quarter, we held our production cost flat on a sequential quarterly basis while achieving year-over-year decline in production cost of approximately 19%.
Maintaining a conservative balance sheet continues to be a focus and top priority. We ended the second quarter with $3.8 billion of cash on hand, an increase of $600 million from the first quarter. Our cash flow from operations exceeded our capital spending in the second quarter, and we collected the remaining $300 million of proceeds from our settlement with Ecuador.
Throughout this year, we have consistently said that we will prudently manage our activity levels to stay positioned for profitable growth in 2017 while maintaining the flexibility necessary to maneuver through the uncertainty and volatility of this price environment. The capital redeployed under Permian Resources will be used to add 2 rigs by the fourth quarter to support production growth in 2017. 
The incremental capital for Colombia will be around $20 million. It will be directed to activities in where we have successful partnership with Ecopatrol to develop low decline The incremental production from this activity is also intended to support growth in 2017. Given the short cycle nature of our Permian Resources business and the flexibility we have in our Colombia operations, we can adjust our capital spending up or down relatively quickly depending on the price environment.
On the M&A front, we also continue to look for ways to expand and further strengthen our position in the Permian through asset acquisitions as we rarely purchase whole public companies. Our objective is to pursue opportunities in both enhanced oil recovery and our resources business that provide meaningful synergies to enhance the value of our existing assets. Our goal in acquiring additional EOR assets is to blend development of long-life, low decline production with our faster growth unconventional development. While we continue to evaluate potential opportunities, we are staying return focused and note that asset prices appear excessive when one considers the current product price environment.
At our board meeting in July, we announced a modest increase in our annual dividend rate from $3 to $3.04 per share. We have now increased our dividend every year for 14 consecutive years and a total of 15x during that period. The dividend increase reflects our commitment to shareholders to grow the dividend annually as is consistent with our long-standing capital priorities. As a reminder, our top priority for use of cash flow is the safety and maintenance of our operations. Our second priority is to fund the dividend. 
With improved capital efficiency in our Permian Resources business, the start-up of the ethylene cracker chemicals combined with long-life base production and a portfolio of high-quality opportunities, we expect continued future dividend growth.
I'm pleased to note that our Board of Directors has elected a new director, Jack Moore. Jack most recently served as the Chairman and CEO for Cameron International. Prior to joining Cameron, he held various management positions at Baker Hughes and has nearly 4 decades of experience in the energy sector. His industry knowledge and management experience will be a great addition to our board.
Before I hand off to Chris, I'd like to summarize it by pointing out that across all our Midstream oil and gas operations and in OxyChem and in our Midstream business, our teams are executing efficiently and innovatively to achieve technical operational excellence in all of our areas. 
3 things are driving this: first, the ability to focus on our core areas without the distraction from activities that are not core to us, thanks to the initiatives Jason started in 2013; second, we have excellent leadership at all levels throughout our organization; third, our employees are performing at a very high level. They're engaged, motivated and delivering exceptional results. While I'm happy about that and the direction we're headed, none of us are satisfied with where we are today. So we'll continue to aggressively and innovatively improve our performance.
I'll now turn the call over to Chris Stavros for a review of our financial results and detailed guidance."

Today, I plan to talk about the following: some of the key changes that have occurred since the first quarter, our second quarter segment and financial results and our third quarter and total year guidance for production and capital.
Index prices for WTI and Brent improved progressively each month and ended the second quarter with about a $12 per barrel increase compared to first quarter prices. Our income and cash flows benefited from a 35% increase in realized prices for both oil and NGLs. During the second quarter, we received a tax refund of $300 million for the NOL tax receivable booked at year-end 2015, and we collected the remaining payments of $330 million related to the Ecuador settlement.
Our core financial results for the second quarter 2016 were a loss of $136 million or $0.18 per diluted share. This represents a sequential improvement from the loss of $426 million or $0.56 per diluted share during the first quarter. Although commodity prices improved significantly from first quarter levels, they remained well below the prior year's second quarter. Second quarter 2016 reported results for GAAP purposes were also a loss of $0.18 per diluted share as there were no material noncore items during the period.
Oil and gas core pretax results for the second quarter 2016 were a loss of $117 million compared to a loss of $508 million in the first quarter of 2016 and income of $324 million from the same period last year. The sequential improvement of $390 million was nearly all a result of higher commodity prices. 
Our second quarter 2016 worldwide realized oil price of $39.66 per barrel increased by over $10 a barrel or 35% compared to the first quarter. Total company oil and gas production volumes from our ongoing operations averaged 609,000 BOE per day in the second quarter, an increase of 19,000 BOE per day on a sequential quarterly basis and 57,000 BOE per day higher than last year's second quarter.
Quarterly production volumes were at the high end of our guidance range of 600,000 to 610,000 BOE per day. International production from ongoing operations was 307,000 BOE per day during the second quarter of 2016 and up 24,000 BOE per day compared to the first quarter as the Al Hosn gas plant completed its scheduled first quarter warranty shutdown and Block 62 gas project continued to ramp up production. 
Second quarter domestic production from ongoing operations of 302,000 BOE per day came in nearly 2% lower than the first quarter. The sequential decline was partially due to the drop in production from the absence of gas-directed drilling activity at our South Texas assets and unplanned plant outages of our non-operated Permian EOR operations. Compared to the prior year second quarter, our domestic production was up about 4,000 BOE per day, with Permian Resources growing by 17,000 BOE per day or 16%, partly offset by decline in natural gas production at our South Texas properties.
Domestic oil and gas cash operating costs from ongoing operations of $11.80 per BOE in the second quarter of 2016 were roughly flat on a sequential basis. However, they declined by 13% compared to the full year 2015 cost of $13.58 per BOE. The reduction in cost compared to last year is mainly the result of improved efficiency around our service operations, including water handling as well as our downhole maintenance and energy-related costs.
Overall oil and gas DD&A for the second quarter of 2016 was $15 per BOE compared to $15.81 per BOE during 2015. Taxes other than income, which are directly related to product prices, were $1.12 per BOE for the second quarter 2016 compared to $1.32 per BOE for the full year of 2015. Second quarter exploration expense was $27 million. 
Chemical second quarter 2016 pretax core earnings were $88 million compared with first quarter earnings of $126 million. The sequential quarterly decline in core earnings reflected lower chloro-vinyl production volumes due primarily to scheduled plant outages, partially offset by more favorable vinyl margins.
Midstream pretax core results were a loss of $58 million for the second quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $95 million in the first quarter. The sequential improvement reflected better oil and gas marketing margins and stronger domestic gas processing results due to higher NGL prices. Midstream also realized higher income from its domestic pipeline business as well as sequentially higher third-party pipeline revenues as the Dolphin gas plant was down from planned maintenance in the first quarter
Looking at our cash flows for the second quarter, we ended the quarter with $3.8 billion of cash. During the second quarter, we generated $935 million of cash flow from continuing operations before working capital and other changes. Networking capital changes consumed $195 million of cash during the period, and we expect working capital changes to be much less burdensome to our cash flow during the second half of the year. 
Capital expenditures for the second quarter were about $660 million, bringing our year-to-date capital spending to $1.3 billion. As Vicky mentioned, our capital spending in the second half of the year will increase modestly as certain project-related expenditures in both chemicals and Midstream had been deferred into the latter part of the year. 
In addition, we plan to recycle some of the capital efficiency savings back into our Permian Resources drilling programs and also take advantage of some project opportunities in Colombia. Despite the higher expected capital spending during the second half of the year, our 2016 total company capital program remains on track to be within our original budget of $3 billion.
During the second quarter, we also completed the $2.75 billion 3-tranche  [ph] senior notes offering with attractive coupon rates of 2.6%, 3.4% and 4.4% on a 6-year, 10-year and 30-year notes, respectively, and extending the average life of our debt by about 5 years. The primary use of proceeds once we've refinanced the $750 million of notes that matured on June 1, 2016, and the early redemption of $1.25 billion of notes that were scheduled to mature in February 2017. In addition, we also paid $575 million in dividends and collected $330 million in payments completing the settlement with Ecuador.
With respect to guidance and as Vicky mentioned, we now expect  our full year 2016 production growth from ongoing operations to come in at the high end of the 4% to 6% range. Better-than-expected production volumes achieved during the second quarter, as well as improved confidence around Permian Resources and performance in the Middle East during the second half of the year, allow us to narrow the estimated range of full year 2016 production from 585,000 to 600,000 BOE per day to a new range of 590,000 to 600,000 BOE per day. 
Turning to guidance for the third quarter, we expect that our total oil and gas production pro forma for ongoing operations to be between 600,000 and 605,000 BOE per day. As I had mentioned during the first quarter call, we expect production in Permian Resources to decline during the second half of 2016. We anticipate production in Permian Resources to be approximately 116,000 BOE per day in the third quarter. Variability around the outcome will be a function of well performance, the capture for efficiency gains and our ability to manage the base production. Despite the anticipated decline this quarter, we expect our full year 2016 production in Permian Resources to be approximately 121,000 BOE per day, representing year-over-year growth of 10%.
Our plan is to remain disciplined with capital within the current product price environment and to recycle some of the efficiency and productivity gains realized this year into greater activity during the second half of the year. We expect this additional activity to help support our Permian Resources production as we exit this year and provide a platform for growth into 2017. Jody will share some specifics on this during his prepared remarks. We expect our total domestic production to decline about 10,000 BOE per day sequentially in the third quarter, largely due to lower volumes in Permian Resources and partially due to declining natural gas production.
Internationally, third quarter production should increase by about 6,000 to 8,000 BOE per day, mainly driven by the continued ramp-up of Block 62 production. Our DD&A expense for oil and gas is expected to be approximately $15 per BOE during 2016, and depreciation of the oil and gas segment is expected to exceed this year's capital investment by more than $1 billion. 
The combined depreciation for chemical and Midstream segments should be approximately $655 million. Exploration expense is estimated to be about $25 million pretax for the third quarter. Price changes at current global prices affect our annual operating cash flow by about $100 million for every $1 per barrel change in WTI. A swing of $0.50 per 1 million BTUs in domestic gas prices affects annual operating cash flow by about $45 million.
In chemicals, we anticipate pretax earnings of about $130 million for the third quarter as the business ramps back up from the second quarter's planned maintenance outages at several of our core combined with improved caustic soda prices. 
In Midstream, we expect the third quarter to generate a pretax loss of between $20 million and $40 million. While quarter-to-quarter changes can be volatile in this segment, the sequential improvement is anticipated due to higher form pipeline income and higher income from power generation as well as improvements in our crude oil supply commitments. These factors, combined with better results for domestic gas processing, should provide a noticeable improvement in our overall Midstream results during the second half of the year compared to the first 6 months' results.
The worldwide effective tax rate on a reported and core income was 41% for the second quarter of 2016. Using current strip prices for oil and gas, we expect our 2016 domestic tax rate to be about 40%. Our international tax rate should be about 60%.
I'll now turn the call over to Jody Elliott, who will discuss activity around our Permian operations."

Today, I'll provide a review of our domestic operations during the second quarter and guidance on our program until the end of 2016. 
As Vicky discussed earlier, we slowed our Permian Resources drilling program as planned due to the severely depressed product prices in the beginning of 2016. We strategically increased capital spending in the EOR business, which will drive increased production in future quarters and years. 
In order to prepare for growth in 2017, we plan to add 2 drilling rigs in our resources business later this year. We will increase our operated rig count over the second half of the year to 7 to 8 drilling rigs in the Permian, 5 of these in Permian Resources. This is an increase from our previous guidance of 4 to 5 rigs. This incremental activity is a direct result of program savings from improved capital and operating efficiencies as well as improvements in base production management. Our team has performed extraordinarily well to capture these savings, which will be reinvested back into the business
As stated last quarter, our Permian Resources operation is being managed to maximize the value of our workforce, enhance our operational capabilities, invest in areas with existing infrastructure and gather critical appraisal information to drive better well productivity. Our focus for the remainder of the year is to prepare the business for profitable growth in 2017.
Turning to the performance of Permian Resources. In the second quarter, we achieved daily production of 126,000 BOE per day, a 16% increase versus the prior year. Oil production decreased quarter-over-quarter by 5,000 barrels a day to 79,000 barrels per day. However, this was a 10% increase from a year ago. The decline was due to lower capital spending with 14 wells put online versus 37 wells in the first quarter.
In addition to better performance of our wells, emphasis on production optimization has been central to reducing declines in the business, and we've exceeded our expectations versus our goals. As previously stated, we expect to increase our activity in the second half of 2016 and bring approximately 30 wells online.
Due to the slowdown in activity in first half of the year due to depressed oil prices and a disciplined development strategy, we expect to see declines in the third and fourth quarter. Third quarter production should average 116,000 BOE per day. For the full year of 2016, we expect to produce 121,000 BOE per day, a 10% growth rate year-over-year. As our activity increases, we expect production decline to stabilize, and with higher oil prices, we will deliver production growth in 2017.
As we continue to increase our lateral lengths, we now compare and benchmark our well cost on a cost per 1,000 feet of lateral length basis. Slide 31 illustrates our demonstrated improvement in well cost, which have declined by roughly 30% from 2015. Similarly, our 1,000 foot of lateral per rig per quarter has also improved from 25.2 [ph] per rig in 2015 to 36.3 [ph] per rig in the second quarter. These metrics will be a primary focus as we continue our development plans. I would emphasize that we estimate 80% of these improvements in efficiency are not at risk of service price increases in a cyclical recovery. 
Our Delaware Basin well performance continues to be a strong despite reduced activity. We placed 7 horizontal wells on production in the Wolfcamp A benches in the second quarter. We continue to increase well productivity by increasing contact with the reservoir near the wellbore, utilizing high cluster density, higher proppant drilling and drilling longer laterals. For example, we placed 3 Buzzard State unit wells online with an average peak rate of 1,993 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,733 BOE per day. The H.B. Morrison B 15H well with a 5,000-foot lateral achieved a peak rate of 2,265 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,717 BOE per day.
As can be seen in the chart on Slide 32, well productivity continues to improve across all production metrics year-over-year due to our successful efforts applying geologic and reservoir parameters into our landing zones and completion designs.
In the Delaware Basin, our Wolfcamp A 4,500-foot well cost decreased by about 19% from the 2015 cost of $7.7 million to a first half 2016 cost of $6.2 million. We reduced our drilling time by 6 days from the average of 25 days in 2015 to 19 days measured by rig release to rig release. We expect the cost and productivity improvements in drilling, completions and facilities to continue as we progress our program. In addition, we drilled a second Bone Spring appraisal well in the Texas Delaware region with encouraging results, which we believe will add additional bench potential to the long-term development plan in this area.
We did not put any additional wells online during the second quarter in New Mexico but we are actively drilling in the region. However, our second Bone Spring 180-day cumulative production rates are among the best in the play. During the second half of the year, we plan to increase drilling and completion activity in the southern county area due to these improved results. We're targeting an average well cost of $5.5 million, and we continue to appraise and delineate multiple benches in the core areas of this region, and our initial results have indicated high return multi-bench return potential.
In the East Midland Basin, we brought on 1306 WA well in the second quarter to peak rate of 1,407 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,286 BOE per day. We also brought online the Merchant 1404A [ph] well at a peak rate of 1,222 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,061 BOE per day. Both wells are producing with high In the West Midland Basin, 8 new lower Spraberry wells are producing results among the best in the play. Improved wells results are due to an optimized landing zone targets and stimulation redesign.
In the Midland Basin, we made similar improvement well costs and drilling days and drilling the Wolfcamp A formation. We reduced the cost of these 7,500-foot horizontal wells by 10% from the 2015 cost of $7.1 million to a first half cost of $6.4 million, including the additional cost of increased frac sites. We reduced our drilling time by 3 days from the 2015 average of 19 days to 16 days, measured by rig release to rig release.
In the Permian Resources as a whole, we achieved another quarter of lower quarter-over-quarter field operating expenses, mainly -- due mainly to improved service operations with optimized water handling, lower workover expenses and better downhole performance. Since the second quarter of 2015, we've reduced our operating cost per barrel by 27%, continue to work additional cost reduction and efficiency improvements. 
As stated earlier, our focus on maximizing production from existing wells has been central to reducing declines in the business. We expect that our annual average uplift from our investment will be over 6,000 net BOE per day. This is another example of leveraging our decades of base management expertise in the EOR business to our resources business.
In addition to the Midland Basin and Delaware Basin results, we drilled and completed 2 horizontal Albany appraisal wells on existing acreage in the Central Basin Platform. We are encouraged by the early results of these lower decline rates wells and we would anticipate drilling 6 to 8 follow-up wells in the play in the next 12 to 18 months.
In Permian EOR, we continue to take advantage of lower drilling costs and manage the operations to our gas processing facility at full capacity. Permian EOR had another quarter of free cash flow generation, driven by resilient base production and low capital requirements. 
Drilling costs are running 23% below our benchmark target, and we've lowered our cash operating expenses by 20% since the fourth quarter of 2014 and 7% year-over-year, driven mainly by lower downhole maintenance and ejectment costs. In similar fashion to our resources business, capital savings achieved by the EOR team will be reinvested into additional wells and CO2 flood expansions.
As I've mentioned in previous calls, the Residual Oil Zone development or ROZ is a vertical expansion of the CO2 flooded interval. The ROZ underlies most of our major EOR properties and can be developed between $3 and $7 a barrel. Year-to-date, we've completed 74 well deepenings and recompletions along with 28 new wells in ROZ developments. We anticipate an additional 30 deepenings and recompletions and 22 new wells in ROZ developments in the second half of 2016. In addition, one of our horizontal rigs from Permian Resources drilled 2 deep CO2 source wells, which will help provide long-term supplies of CO2 and support our vast inventory of EOR development projects.
In summary, we're achieving better-than-expected results in both Permian businesses that will allow us to invest the savings into additional wells for each respective business. In the current environment, we believe this is a prudent investment and philosophy that motivates our employees and works well with our total spend per barrel incentive metric. 
We're pleased with strides the teams has made in execution, performance and safety thus far in 2016, which will afford us the ability to ramp up our activity should oil prices exhibit fundamental stability.
Thank you, and I'll hand it now back to Chris Degner"

But what our teams have done during this downturn and this slower [ph] period, is they've enabled us to have a lot more visibility next year to be able to ramp up should we need to you have the opportunity to do so. And the ramp up could be not just in the Permian Resources, as I mentioned earlier, the ramp up could be in Colombia as well. And in addition to that, we expect -- because of the situation we had Al Hosn, overall, Al Hosn have a higher production rate in 2017 because it'll have full year production versus the warranty turnaround that we had in Q1 of this year. In addition to that, we have Block 62 gas on for the full year, and that will be helpful. So you take those things, combine it with the flexibility that we have in both Permian Resources and Colombia, will start the year probably conservatively until we see fundamental start to support prices, but we will have the ability to ramp up in multiple areas.

Last quarter, I told you our game plan for this year has been to address the things within our sphere of influence to ultimately not only survive but thrive in the current weak commodity price environment. To",1669,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Last quarter, I told you our game plan for this year has been to address the things within our sphere of influence to ultimately not only survive but thrive in the current weak commodity price environment. To that end, we're on target to achieve the higher end of our production guidance for 2016 while keeping our capital program on budget at $3 billion.
We continue to make progress lowering our cost structure, which we know is critical to both short- and long-term success. Our capital discipline and cost reduction efficiencies, combined with improvement in new well productivity and better base production management, have enabled us to further reduce our total spend per barrel of production this year compared to 2015. 
In addition, our strategy around capital is to be prudent and remain focused on returns as we expect the commodity price environment to stay challenging through the rest of this year and into 2017. At the same time, we'll maintain the flexibility necessary to maneuver through a range of price scenarios. 
Finally, due to the strength of our balance sheet and the quality of our portfolio, we have raised our dividend for the 14th consecutive year.
Total company production for our ongoing operations increased to 609,000 BOE per day from 590,000 BOE per day in the first quarter. The increase was driven by Al Hosn Gas in Abu Dhabi and a  new gas project in Oman. The increase in average daily production of 26,000 BOE per day from Al Hosn versus the first quarter of 2016 is due mainly to lower production volumes in the first quarter caused by a scheduled warranty shutdown. However, 10% of the increase is due to improved plant efficiencies gained by the Al Hosn operations team. As you know, Al Hosn Gas is a joint venture between ADNOC and Oxy and Abu Dhabi. The Al Hosn team has done an excellent job of optimizing deliverability through the plant.
An additional 7,000 BOE per day came from Block 62 in Oman, where a recently constructed gas plant was put online to process production from 2 newly developed gas fields. The plant was completed on time and on budget. This enabled us to achieve record production in Oman this quarter. 
In addition, our cutter team has worked to get production in the Idd El Shargi South Dome field, or ISSD, to its highest level in over 16 years. Completion and design improvement in complex horizontal wells and enhanced base production management contributed to this production milestone. 
Permian Resources' production this quarter was 126,000 BOE per day, representing year-over-year growth of 16%. As Jody will show, we're continuing to see improvements in well productivity in all areas.
The increases in production from Al Hosn, Block 62 and ISSD, along with strong year-over-year production growth from Permian Resources, will help us reach the higher end of our 4% to 6% production growth guidance for 2016.
Our capital spending in the second quarter declined modestly as we shifted timing on spending for certain chemicals and midstream projects and slowed our drilling program in the Permian. This drilling program is consistent with the plans we've put in place at the beginning of this year and with our strategy to remain conservative in this price environment. 
Continued improvements in project designs and capital execution has helped us to do more than expected with our $3 billion capital budget. This along with improved production performance in many areas of our operations are the reasons we expect to achieve the upper end of our production guidance for the year. 
It's important to note that most of our cost reductions are due to our own efficiency gains, not service company unit cost reductions. In fact, approximately 80% of our drilling cost reductions are due to faster penetration rates achieved by the application of Oxy Drilling Dynamics along with improved well construction, design, lower cost of materials and enhanced logistics.
In Permian Resources, the cost savings we have achieved due to improved efficiencies will be redeployed into drilling incremental wells in the latter part of the year, which will positively impact 2017 production.
Additional capital will also be shifted to Colombia, where our teams have generated opportunities that deliver attractive returns at current prices. This activity will also support 2017 production. The construction of the joint venture ethylene cracker at Ingleside by OxyChem is on budget and on schedule to be completed in the first quarter of 2017.
In addition, the crude oil export terminal at Ingleside being constructed by midstream is also on budget and on time to be complete by year-end. The terminal will have a total oil storage capacity of 2 million barrels and throughput capacity of approximately 300,000 barrels of oil per day.
Although these activities will slightly increase our capital spending during the third and fourth quarters, we don't expect to exceed our $3 billion budgeted spending for the full year. With the completion of the long-term projects in both our chemical and midstream segments, we expect to have increased flexibility with our capital program in 2017.
Our efforts to focus on efficiency are paying off. It was -- we continued to lower our total spend per barrel of production. This metric includes our overhead, operating and capital cost per barrel of production. Our organization is focused on this metric, and we have linked incentive compensation to it. The metric is designed to drive cost reductions, increased well productivity, optimize base production. 
In 2014, our total spend per barrel averaged close to $62. We lowered this to about $40 in 2015 and have targeted $28.50 per barrel in 2016. In the first half of this year, we've beaten our target with average total spend of about $27 per barrel. We expect similar results during the second half of this year.
Despite the increase in oil prices and energy costs during the second quarter, we held our production cost flat on a sequential quarterly basis while achieving a year-over-year decline in production cost of approximately 19%.
Maintaining a conservative balance sheet continues to be a focus and top priority. We ended the second quarter with $3.8 billion of cash on hand, an increase of $600 million from the first quarter. Our cash flow from operations exceeded our capital spending in the second quarter, and we collected the remaining $300 million of proceeds from our settlement with Ecuador.
Throughout this year, we have consistently said that we will prudently manage our activity levels to stay positioned for profitable growth in 2017 while maintaining the flexibility necessary to maneuver through the uncertainty and volatility of this price environment. The capital redeployed under Permian Resources will be used to add 2 rigs by the fourth quarter to support production growth in 2017. 
The incremental capital for Colombia will be around $20 million. It will be directed to activities in La Cira-Infantas, where we have successful partnership with EcoPetrol to develop low decline waterfloods. The incremental production from this activity is also intended to support growth in 2017. 
Given the short-cycle nature of our Permian Resources business and the flexibility we have in our Colombia operations, we can adjust our capital spending up or down relatively quickly depending on the price environment.
On the M&A front, we also continued to look for ways to expand and further strengthen our position in the Permian through asset acquisitions as we rarely purchase whole public companies. Our objective is to pursue opportunities in both enhanced oil recovery and our resources business that provide meaningful synergies to enhance the value of our existing assets. Our goal in acquiring additional EOR assets is to blend development of long-lived, low decline production with our faster-growth unconventional development. While we continue to evaluate potential opportunities, we are staying return focused and note that asset prices appear excessive when one considers the current product price environment.
At our board meeting in July, we announced a modest increase in our annual dividend rate from $3 to $3.04 per share. We have now increased our dividend every year for 14 consecutive years and a total of 15 times during that period. The dividend increase reflects our commitment to shareholders to grow the dividend annually, as is consistent with our long-standing capital priorities. As a reminder, our top priority for use of cash flow is the safety and maintenance of our operations. Our second priority is to fund the dividend. 
With improved capital efficiency in our Permian Resources business, the start-up of the ethylene cracker in chemicals, combined with long-lived base production and our portfolio of high-quality opportunities, we expect continued future dividend growth.
I'm pleased to note that our Board of Directors has elected a new director, Jack Moore. Jack most recently served as the Chairman and CEO for Cameron International. Prior to joining Cameron, he held various management positions at Baker Hughes and has nearly 4 decades of experience in the energy sector. His industry knowledge and management experience will be a great addition to our board.
Before I hand off to Chris, I'd like to summarize it by pointing out that across all our upstream oil and gas operations and in OxyChem and in our midstream business, our teams are executing efficiently and innovatively to achieve technical and operational excellence in all of our areas. 
Three things are driving this: first, the ability to focus on our core areas without the distraction from activities that are not core to us, thanks to the initiatives Steve Chazen started in 2013; second, we have excellent leadership at all levels throughout our organization; third, our employees are performing at a very high level. They're engaged, motivated and delivering exceptional results. While I'm happy about that and the direction we're headed, none of us are satisfied with where we are today. So we'll continue to aggressively and innovatively improve our performance.
I'll now turn the call over to Chris Stavros for a review of our financial results and detailed guidance."

Today, I plan to talk about the following: some of the key changes that have occurred since the first quarter, our second quarter segment and financial results and our third quarter and total year guidance for production and capital.
Index prices for WTI and Brent improved progressively each month and ended the second quarter with about a $12 per barrel increase compared to first quarter prices. Our income and cash flows benefited from a 35% increase in realized prices for both oil and NGLs. 
During the second quarter, we received a tax refund of $300 million for the NOL tax receivable booked at year-end 2015, and we collected the remaining payments of $330 million related to the Ecuador settlement.
Our core financial results for the second quarter 2016 were a loss of $136 million or $0.18 per diluted share. This represents a sequential improvement from the loss of $426 million or $0.56 per diluted share during the first quarter. Although commodity prices improved significantly from first quarter levels, they remained well below the prior year's second quarter. 
Second quarter 2016 reported results for GAAP purposes were also a loss of $0.18 per diluted share as there were no material noncore items during the period.
Oil and gas core pretax results for the second quarter 2016 were a loss of $117 million compared to a loss of $508 million in the first quarter   of 2016 and income of $324 million from the same period last year. The sequential improvement of $390 million was nearly all a result of higher commodity prices. 
Our second quarter 2016 worldwide realized oil price of $39.66 per barrel increased by over $10 a barrel or 35% compared to the first quarter. Total company oil and gas production volumes from our ongoing operations averaged 609,000 BOE per day in the second quarter, an increase of 19,000 BOE per day on a sequential quarterly basis and 57,000 BOE per day higher than last year's second quarter. Quarterly production volumes were at the high end of our guidance range of 600,000 to 610,000 BOE per day. 
International production from ongoing operations was 307,000 BOE per day during the second quarter of 2016 and up 24,000 BOE per day compared to the first quarter as the Al Hosn gas plant completed its scheduled first quarter warranty shutdown and Oman's Block 62 gas project continued to ramp up production. 
Second quarter domestic production from ongoing operations of 302,000 BOE per day came in nearly 2% lower than the first quarter. The sequential decline was partially due to the drop in production from the absence of gas-directed drilling activity at our South Texas assets and unplanned plant outages at our non-operated Permian EOR operations. Compared to the prior year's second quarter, our domestic production was up about 4,000 BOE per day with Permian Resources growing by 17,000 BOE per day or 16%, partly offset by a decline in natural gas production in our South Texas properties.
Domestic oil and gas cash operating costs from ongoing operations of $11.80 per BOE in the second quarter of 2016 were roughly flat on a sequential basis. However, they declined by 13% compared to the full year 2015 cost of $13.58 per BOE. The reduction in cost compared to last year is mainly the result of improved efficiency around our surface operations, including water handling, as well as lower downhole maintenance and energy-related costs.
Overall oil and gas DD&A for the second quarter of 2016 was $15 per BOE compared to $15.81 per BOE during 2015. 
Taxes other than on income, which are directly related to product prices, were $1.12 per BOE for the second quarter of 2016 compared to $1.32 per BOE for the full year of 2015.
 Second quarter exploration expense was $27 million. 
Chemical's second quarter 2016 pretax core earnings were $88 million compared with first quarter earnings of $126 million. The sequential quarterly decline in core earnings reflected lower chloro-vinyl production volumes due primarily to scheduled plant outages, partially offset by more favorable vinyl margins.
Midstream pretax core results were a loss of $58 million for the second quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $95 million in the first quarter. The sequential improvement reflected better oil and gas marketing margins and stronger domestic gas processing results due to higher NGL prices. Midstream also realized higher income from its domestic pipeline business as well as sequentially higher third-party farmed pipeline revenues as the Dolphin gas plant was down for planned maintenance in the first quarter
Looking at our cash flows for the second quarter, we ended the quarter with $3.8 billion of cash. During the second quarter, we generated $935 million of cash flow from continuing operations before working capital and other changes. Net working capital changes consumed $195 million of cash during the period, and we expect working capital changes to be much less burdensome to our cash flow during the second half of the year. 
Capital expenditures for the second quarter were about $660 million, bringing our year-to-date capital spending to $1.3 billion. As Vicki mentioned, our capital spending in the second half of the year will increase modestly as certain project-related expenditures in both chemicals and midstream had been deferred into the latter part of the year. In addition, we plan to recycle some of the capital efficiency savings back into our Permian Resources drilling program and also take advantage of some project opportunities in Colombia. 
Despite the higher expected capital spending during the second half of the year, our 2016 total company capital program remains on track to be within our original budget of $3 billion.
During the second quarter, we also completed a $2.75 billion, 3-tranche  senior notes offering with attractive coupon rates of 2.6%, 3.4% and 4.4% on the 6-year, 10-year and 30-year notes, respectively, and extending the average life of our debt by about 5 years. The primary use of proceeds went to refinance the $750 million of notes that matured on June 1, 2016, and the early redemption of $1.25 billion of notes that were scheduled to mature in February 2017. In addition, we also paid $575 million in dividends and collected $330 million in payments, completing the settlement with Ecuador.
With respect to guidance and as Vicki mentioned, we now expect  our full year 2016 production growth from ongoing operations to come in at the high end of the 4% to 6% range. Better-than-expected production volumes achieved during the second quarter as well as improved confidence around Permian Resources and performance in the Middle East during the second half of the year allow us to narrow the estimated range of full year 2016 production from 585,000 to 600,000 BOE per day to a new range of 590,000 to 600,000 BOE per day. 
Turning to guidance for the third quarter, we expect the total oil and gas production pro forma for ongoing operations to be between 600,000 and 605,000 BOE per day. As I had mentioned during the first quarter call, we expect production in Permian Resources to decline during the second half of 2016. We anticipate production in Permian Resources to be approximately 116,000 BOE per day in the third quarter. Variability around the outcome will be a function of well performance, the capture of further efficiency gains and our ability to manage the base production. Despite the anticipated decline this quarter, we expect our full year 2016 production in Permian Resources to be approximately 121,000 BOE per day, representing year-over-year growth of 10%.
Our plan is to remain disciplined with our capital within the current product price environment and to recycle some of the efficiency and productivity gains realized this year into greater activity during the second half of the year. We expect this additional activity to help support our Permian Resources production as we exit this year and provide a platform for growth into 2017. Jody will share some specifics on this during his prepared remarks. 
We expect our total domestic production to decline about 10,000 BOE per day sequentially in the third quarter largely due to lower volumes in Permian Resources and partially due to declining natural gas production. Internationally, third quarter production should increase by about 6,000 to 8,000 BOE per day, mainly driven by the continued ramp-up of Oman's Block 62 production. 
Our DD&A expense for oil and gas is expected to be approximately $15 per BOE during 2016, and depreciation of the oil and gas segment is expected to exceed this year's capital investment by more than $1 billion. The combined depreciation for chemical and midstream segments should be approximately $655 million. 
Exploration expense is estimated to be about $25 million pretax for the third quarter. 
Price changes at current global prices affect our annual operating cash flow by about $100 million for every $1 per barrel change in WTI. A swing of $0.50 per 1 million BTUs in domestic natural gas prices affects annual operating cash flow by about $45 million.
In chemicals, we anticipate pretax earnings of about $130 million for the third quarter as the business ramps back up from second quarter's planned maintenance outages at several of our chloro-vinyl plants combined with improved caustic soda prices. 
In midstream, we expect the third quarter to generate a pretax loss of between $20 million and $40 million. While quarter-to-quarter changes can be volatile in this segment, the sequential improvement is anticipated due to higher farmed pipeline income and higher income from power generation as well as improvements in our crude oil supply commitments. These factors, combined with better results for domestic gas processing, should provide a noticeable improvement in our overall midstream results during the second half of the year compared to the first 6 months' results.
The worldwide effective tax rate on a reported and core income was 41% for the second quarter of 2016. Using current strip prices for oil and gas, we expect our 2016 domestic tax rate to be about 40%. Our international tax rate should be about 60%.
I'll now turn the call over to Jody Elliott, who will discuss activity around our Permian operations."

Today, I'll provide a review of our domestic operations during the second quarter and guidance on our program to the end of 2016. 
As Vicki discussed earlier, we slowed our Permian Resources drilling program as planned due to the severely depressed product prices in the beginning of 2016. We strategically increased capital spending in the EOR business, which will drive increased production in future quarters and years. 
In order to prepare for growth in 2017, we plan to add 2 drilling rigs in our resources business later this year. We will increase our operated rig count over the second half of the year to 7 to 8 drilling rigs in the Permian, 5 of these in Permian Resources. This is an increase from our previous guidance of 4 to 5 rigs. This incremental activity is a direct result of program savings from improved capital and operating efficiencies as well as improvements in base production management. Our team has performed extraordinarily well to capture these savings, which will be reinvested back into the business
As stated last quarter, our Permian Resources operation is being managed to maximize the value of our workforce, enhance our operational capabilities, invest in areas with existing infrastructure and gather critical appraisal information to drive better well productivity. Our focus for the remainder of the year is to prepare the business for profitable growth in 2017.
Turning to the performance of Permian Resources. In the second quarter, we achieved daily production of 126,000 BOE per day, a 16% increase versus the prior year. Oil production decreased quarter-over-quarter by 5,000 barrels a day to 79,000 barrels per day. However, this was a 10% increase from a year ago. The decline was due to lower capital spending with 14 wells put online versus 37 wells in the first quarter.
In addition to better performance of our wells, emphasis on production optimization has been central to reducing declines in the business, and we've exceeded our expectations versus our goals. As previously stated, we expect to increase our activity in the second half of 2016 and bring approximately 30 wells online.
Due to the slowdown in activity in the first half of the year due to depressed oil prices and a disciplined development strategy, we expect to see declines in the third and fourth quarter. Third quarter production should average 116,000 BOE per day. For the full year of 2016, we expect to produce 121,000 BOE per day, a 10% growth rate year-over-year. As our activity increases, we expect production decline to stabilize, and with higher oil prices, we will deliver production growth in 2017.
As we continue to increase our lateral lengths, we now compare and benchmark our well cost on a cost per 1,000 feet of lateral length basis. Slide 31 illustrates our demonstrated improvement in well cost, which had declined by roughly 30% from 2015. Similarly, our 1,000 foot of lateral per rig per quarter has also improved from 25.2 per rig in 2015 to 36.3 per rig in the second quarter. These metrics will be a primary focus as we continue our development plans. I would emphasize that we estimate 80% of these improvements in efficiency are not at risk of service price increases in a cyclical recovery. 
Our Delaware Basin well performance continues to be strong despite reduced activity. We placed 7 horizontal wells on production in the Wolfcamp A benches in the second quarter. We continue to increase well productivity by increasing contact with the reservoir near the wellbore, utilizing higher cluster density, higher proppant loading and drilling longer laterals. For example, we placed 3 Buzzard State unit wells online with an average peak rate of 1,993 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,733 BOE per day. The HB Morrison B 15H well with a 5,000-foot lateral achieved a peak rate of 2,265 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,717 BOE per day.
As can be seen in the chart on Slide 32, well productivity continues to improve across all production metrics year-over-year due to our successful efforts applying geologic and reservoir parameters into our landing zones and completion designs.
In the Delaware Basin, our Wolfcamp A 4,500-foot well cost decreased by about 19% from the 2015 cost of $7.7 million to a first half 2016 cost of $6.2 million. We reduced our drilling time by 6 days from the average of 25 days in 2015 to 19 days measured by rig release to rig release. We expect the cost and productivity improvements in drilling, completions and facilities to continue as we progress our program. In addition, we drilled a second Bone Spring appraisal well in the Texas Delaware region with encouraging results, which we believe will add additional bench potential to the long-term development planned in this area.
We did not put any additional wells online during the second quarter in New Mexico, but we are actively drilling in the region. However, our second Bone Spring 180-day cumulative production rates are among the best in the play. During the second half of the year, we plan to increase drilling and completion activity in the southern Eddy County area due to these improved results. We're targeting an average well cost of $5.5 million, and we continue to appraise and delineate multiple benches in the core areas of this region. And our initial results have indicated high-return, multi-bench development potential.
In the East Midland Basin, we brought on the Waldron Eunice 1306WA well in the second quarter to peak rate of 1,407 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,286 BOE per day. We also brought online the Merchant 1404A well at a peak rate of 1,222 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,061 BOE per day. Both wells are producing with high oil cuts. In the West Midland Basin, 8 new Lower Spraberry wells at South Curtis Ranch are producing results among the best in the play. Improved wells results are due to an optimized landing zone target and stimulation redesign.
In the Midland Basin, we made similar improvements in well cost and drilling days in drilling the Wolfcamp A formation. We reduced the cost of these 7,500-foot horizontal wells by 10% from the 2015 cost of $7.1 million to a first half cost of $6.4 million, including the additional cost of increased frac size. We reduced our drilling time by 3 days from the 2015 average of 19 days to 16 days measured by rig release to rig release.
In the Permian Resources as a whole, we achieved another quarter of lower quarter-over-quarter field operating expenses mainly -- due mainly to improved service operations with optimized water handling, lower workover expenses and better downhole performance. Since the second quarter of 2015, we reduced our operating cost per barrel by 27%, continue to work additional cost reduction and efficiency improvements. 
As stated earlier, our focus on maximizing production from existing wells has been central to reducing declines in the business. We expect that our annual average uplift from our investment will be over 6,000 net BOE per day. This is another example of leveraging our decades of base management expertise in the EOR business to our resources business.
In addition to the Midland Basin and Delaware Basin results, we drilled and completed 2 horizontal Wichita Albany appraisal wells on existing HBP acreage in the Central Basin Platform. We are encouraged by the early results of these lower decline rate wells and would anticipate drilling 6 to 8 follow-up wells in the play in the next 12 to 18 months.
In Permian EOR, we continue to take advantage of lower drilling cost and manage the operations to run our gas processing facilities at full capacity. Permian EOR had another quarter of free cash flow generation, driven by resilient base production and low capital requirements. 
Drilling costs are running 23% below our benchmark target, and we've lowered our cash operating expenses by 20% since the fourth quarter of 2014 and 7% year-over-year, driven mainly by lower downhole maintenance and ejectment costs. In similar fashion to our resources business, the capital savings achieved by the EOR team will be reinvested into additional wells and CO2 flood expansions.
As I've mentioned in previous calls, the Residual Oil Zone development, or ROZ, is a vertical expansion of the CO2 flooded interval. The ROZ underlies most of our major EOR properties and can be developed between $3 and $7 a barrel. Year-to-date, we've completed 74 well deepenings and recompletions along with 28 new wells in ROZ developments. We anticipate an additional 30 deepenings and recompletions and 22 new wells in ROZ developments in the second half of 2016. In addition, one of our horizontal rigs from Permian Resources drilled 2 deep CO2 source wells, which will help provide long-term supplies of CO2 and support our vast inventory of EOR development projects.
In summary, we are achieving better-than-expected results in both Permian businesses that will allow us to invest the savings into additional wells in each respective business. In the current environment, we believe this is a prudent investment philosophy that motivates our employees and works well with our total spend per barrel incentive metric. 
We're pleased with the strides that our teams have made in execution, performance and safety thus far in 2016, which will afford us the ability to ramp up our activity should oil prices exhibit fundamental stability.
Thank you, and I'll now hand it back to Chris Degner"

One time, we were running over 25 rigs, and we could -- if prices were in the range that would warrant it, that we could get back to that. But bearing in mind now that back when we were running 25 rigs, we were not as efficient as we are today where we're significantly improved with our efficiencies. So we could get actually the same amount of productivity with half the number of rigs that we were at, at that time. So I don't see us going back to a 25-rig count in the Permian unless we expand our operations and our footprint. But we could easily go back to somewhere in the neighborhood of up to 15 rigs reasonably and still have the capacity to do it. I think we could get ahead of it with our infrastructure as well.

I can tell you that what we'll do is that we'll put the program together. We always do that at the end of this year. And we'll firm it up by first of next year. But what our teams have done over -- during this downturn and this lower period, is they've enabled us to have a lot more flexibility next year to be able to ramp up should we need to or should we have the opportunity to do so. And the ramp-up could be not just in the Permian Resources. As I mentioned earlier, the ramp-up could be in Colombia as well. And in addition to that, we expect that because of the situation with Al Hosn, overall Al Hosn will have a higher production rate in 2017 because it'll have a full year of production versus the warranty turnaround that we had in Q1 of this year. In addition to that, we'll have Block 62 gas on for the full year, and that'll be helpful. So you take those things, combine it with the flexibility that we have in both Permian Resources and Colombia, we'll start the year probably conservatively until we see fundamentals start to support prices, but we will have the ability to ramp up in multiple areas.

So we think that out of this will come, if you'd like, a new baseline, which could be 110%, 112%. And then from that -- or even a bit higher.

Last quarter, I told you our game plan for this year has been to address the things within our sphere of influence to ultimately not only survive but thrive in the current weak commodity price environment. To",1669,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Last quarter, I told you our game plan for this year has been to address the things within our sphere of influence to ultimately not only survive but thrive in the current weak commodity price environment. To that end, we're on target to achieve the higher end of our production guidance for 2016 while keeping our capital program on budget at $3 billion.
We continue to make progress lowering our cost structure, which we know is critical to both short- and long-term success. Our capital discipline and cost reduction efficiencies, combined with improvement in new well productivity and better base production management, have enabled us to further reduce our total spend per barrel of production this year compared to 2015. 
In addition, our strategy around capital is to be prudent and remain focused on returns as we expect the commodity price environment to stay challenging through the rest of this year and into 2017. At the same time, we'll maintain the flexibility necessary to maneuver through a range of price scenarios. 
Finally, due to the strength of our balance sheet and the quality of our portfolio, we have raised our dividend for the 14th consecutive year.
Total company production for our ongoing operations increased to 609,000 BOE per day from 590,000 BOE per day in the first quarter. The increase was driven by Al Hosn Gas in Abu Dhabi and a  new gas project in Oman. The increase in average daily production of 26,000 BOE per day from Al Hosn versus the first quarter of 2016 is due mainly to lower production volumes in the first quarter caused by a scheduled warranty shutdown. However, 10% of the increase is due to improved plant efficiencies gained by the Al Hosn operations team. As you know, Al Hosn Gas is a joint venture between ADNOC and Oxy and Abu Dhabi. The Al Hosn team has done an excellent job of optimizing deliverability through the plant.
An additional 7,000 BOE per day came from Block 62 in Oman, where a recently constructed gas plant was put online to process production from 2 newly developed gas fields. The plant was completed on time and on budget. This enabled us to achieve record production in Oman this quarter. 
In addition, our Qatar team has worked to get production in the Idd El Shargi South Dome field, or ISSD, to its highest level in over 16 years. Completion and design improvement in complex horizontal wells and enhanced base production management contributed to this production milestone. 
Permian Resources' production this quarter was 126,000 BOE per day, representing year-over-year growth of 16%. As Jody will show, we're continuing to see improvements in well productivity in all areas.
The increases in production from Al Hosn, Block 62 and ISSD, along with strong year-over-year production growth from Permian Resources, will help us reach the higher end of our 4% to 6% production growth guidance for 2016.
Our capital spending in the second quarter declined modestly as we shifted timing on spending for certain chemicals and midstream projects and slowed our drilling program in the Permian. This drilling program is consistent with the plans we've put in place at the beginning of this year and with our strategy to remain conservative in this price environment. 
Continued improvements in project designs and capital execution has helped us to do more than expected with our $3 billion capital budget. These along with improved production performance in many areas of our operations are the reasons we expect to achieve the upper end of our production guidance for the year. 
It's important to note that most of our cost reductions are due to our own efficiency gains, not service company unit cost reductions. In fact, approximately 80% of our drilling cost reductions are due to faster penetration rates achieved by the application of Oxy Drilling Dynamics along with improved well construction, design, lower cost of materials and enhanced logistics.
In Permian Resources, the cost savings we have achieved due to improved efficiencies will be redeployed into drilling incremental wells in the latter part of the year, which will positively impact 2017 production.
Additional capital will also be shifted to Colombia, where our teams have generated opportunities that deliver attractive returns at current prices. This activity will also support 2017 production. The construction of the joint venture ethylene cracker at Ingleside by OxyChem is on budget and on schedule to be completed in the first quarter of 2017.
In addition, the crude oil export terminal at Ingleside being constructed by midstream is also on budget and on time to be complete by year-end. The terminal will have a total oil storage capacity of 2 million barrels and throughput capacity of approximately 300,000 barrels of oil per day.
Although these activities will slightly increase our capital spending during the third and fourth quarters, we don't expect to exceed our $3 billion budgeted spending for the full year. With the completion of the long-term projects in both our chemical and midstream segments, we expect to have increased flexibility with our capital program in 2017.
Our efforts to focus on efficiency are paying off. It was -- we continued to lower our total spend per barrel of production. This metric includes our overhead, operating and capital cost per barrel of production. Our organization is focused on this metric, and we have linked incentive compensation to it. The metric is designed to drive cost reductions, increased well productivity, optimize base production. 
In 2014, our total spend per barrel averaged close to $62. We lowered this to about $40 in 2015 and have targeted $28.50 per barrel in 2016. In the first half of this year, we've beaten our target with average total spend of about $27 per barrel. We expect similar results during the second half of this year.
Despite the increase in oil prices and energy costs during the second quarter, we held our production cost flat on a sequential quarterly basis while achieving a year-over-year decline in production cost of approximately 19%.
Maintaining a conservative balance sheet continues to be a focus and top priority. We ended the second quarter with $3.8 billion of cash on hand, an increase of $600 million from the first quarter. Our cash flow from operations exceeded our capital spending in the second quarter, and we collected the remaining $300 million of proceeds from our settlement with Ecuador.
Throughout this year, we have consistently said that we will prudently manage our activity levels to stay positioned for profitable growth in 2017 while maintaining the flexibility necessary to maneuver through the uncertainty and volatility of this price environment. The capital redeployed under Permian Resources will be used to add 2 rigs by the fourth quarter to support production growth in 2017. 
The incremental capital for Colombia will be around $20 million. It will be directed to activities in La Cira-Infantas, where we have successful partnership with EcoPetrol to develop low decline waterfloods. The incremental production from this activity is also intended to support growth in 2017. 
Given the short-cycle nature of our Permian Resources business and the flexibility we have in our Colombia operations, we can adjust our capital spending up or down relatively quickly depending on the price environment.
On the M&A front, we also continued to look for ways to expand and further strengthen our position in the Permian through asset acquisitions as we rarely purchase whole public companies. Our objective is to pursue opportunities in both enhanced oil recovery and our resources business that provide meaningful synergies to enhance the value of our existing assets. Our goal in acquiring additional EOR assets is to blend development of long-life, low decline production with our faster-growth unconventional development. While we continue to evaluate potential opportunities, we are staying return focused and note that asset prices appear excessive when one considers the current product price environment.
At our board meeting in July, we announced a modest increase in our annual dividend rate from $3 to $3.04 per share. We have now increased our dividend every year for 14 consecutive years and a total of 15 times during that period. The dividend increase reflects our commitment to shareholders to grow the dividend annually, as is consistent with our long-standing capital priorities. As a reminder, our top priority for use of cash flow is the safety and maintenance of our operations. Our second priority is to fund the dividend. 
With improved capital efficiency in our Permian Resources business, the start-up of the ethylene cracker in chemicals, combined with long-lived base production and our portfolio of high-quality opportunities, we expect continued future dividend growth.
I'm pleased to note that our Board of Directors has elected a new director, Jack Moore. Jack most recently served as the Chairman and CEO for Cameron International. Prior to joining Cameron, he held various management positions at Baker Hughes and has nearly 4 decades of experience in the energy sector. His industry knowledge and management experience will be a great addition to our board.
Before I hand off to Chris, I'd like to summarize it by pointing out that across all our upstream oil and gas operations and in OxyChem and in our midstream business, our teams are executing efficiently and innovatively to achieve technical and operational excellence in all of our areas. 
Three things are driving this: first, the ability to focus on our core areas without the distraction from activities that are not core to us, thanks to the initiatives Steve Chazen started in 2013; second, we have excellent leadership at all levels throughout our organization; third, our employees are performing at a very high level. They're engaged, motivated and delivering exceptional results. While I'm happy about that and the direction we're headed, none of us are satisfied with where we are today. So we'll continue to aggressively and innovatively improve our performance.
I'll now turn the call over to Chris Stavros for a review of our financial results and detailed guidance."

Today, I plan to talk about the following: some of the key changes that have occurred since the first quarter, our second quarter segment and financial results and our third quarter and total year guidance for production and capital.
Index prices for WTI and Brent improved progressively each month and ended the second quarter with about a $12 per barrel increase compared to first quarter prices. Our income and cash flows benefited from a 35% increase in realized prices for both oil and NGLs. 
During the second quarter, we received a tax refund of $300 million for the NOL tax receivable booked at year-end 2015, and we collected the remaining payments of $330 million related to the Ecuador settlement.
Our core financial results for the second quarter 2016 were a loss of $136 million or $0.18 per diluted share. This represents a sequential improvement from the loss of $426 million or $0.56 per diluted share during the first quarter. Although commodity prices improved significantly from first quarter levels, they remained well below the prior year's second quarter. 
Second quarter 2016 reported results for GAAP purposes were also a loss of $0.18 per diluted share as there were no material noncore items during the period.
Oil and gas core pretax results for the second quarter 2016 were a loss of $117 million compared to a loss of $508 million in the first quarter   of 2016 and income of $324 million from the same period last year. The sequential improvement of $390 million was nearly all a result of higher commodity prices. 
Our second quarter 2016 worldwide realized oil price of $39.66 per barrel increased by over $10 a barrel or 35% compared to the first quarter. Total company oil and gas production volumes from our ongoing operations averaged 609,000 BOE per day in the second quarter, an increase of 19,000 BOE per day on a sequential quarterly basis and 57,000 BOE per day higher than last year's second quarter. Quarterly production volumes were at the high end of our guidance range of 600,000 to 610,000 BOE per day. 
International production from ongoing operations was 307,000 BOE per day during the second quarter of 2016 and up 24,000 BOE per day compared to the first quarter as the Al Hosn gas plant completed its scheduled first quarter warranty shutdown and Oman's Block 62 gas project continued to ramp up production. 
Second quarter domestic production from ongoing operations of 302,000 BOE per day came in nearly 2% lower than the first quarter. The sequential decline was partially due to the drop in production from the absence of gas-directed drilling activity at our South Texas assets and unplanned plant outages at our non-operated Permian EOR operations. Compared to the prior year's second quarter, our domestic production was up about 4,000 BOE per day with Permian Resources growing by 17,000 BOE per day or 16%, partly offset by a decline in natural gas production in our South Texas properties.
Domestic oil and gas cash operating costs from ongoing operations of $11.80 per BOE in the second quarter of 2016 were roughly flat on a sequential basis. However, they declined by 13% compared to the full year 2015 cost of $13.58 per BOE. The reduction in cost compared to last year is mainly the result of improved efficiency around our surface operations, including water handling, as well as lower downhole maintenance and energy-related costs.
Overall oil and gas DD&A for the second quarter of 2016 was $15 per BOE compared to $15.81 per BOE during 2015. 
Taxes other than on income, which are directly related to product prices, were $1.12 per BOE for the second quarter of 2016 compared to $1.32 per BOE for the full year of 2015.
 Second quarter exploration expense was $27 million. 
Chemical's second quarter 2016 pretax core earnings were $88 million compared with first quarter earnings of $126 million. The sequential quarterly decline in core earnings reflected lower chloro-vinyl production volumes due primarily to scheduled plant outages, partially offset by more favorable vinyl margins.
Midstream pretax core results were a loss of $58 million for the second quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $95 million in the first quarter. The sequential improvement reflected better oil and gas marketing margins and stronger domestic gas processing results due to higher NGL prices. Midstream also realized higher income from its domestic pipeline business as well as sequentially higher third-party farmed pipeline revenues as the Dolphin gas plant was down for planned maintenance in the first quarter
Looking at our cash flows for the second quarter, we ended the quarter with $3.8 billion of cash. During the second quarter, we generated $935 million of cash flow from continuing operations before working capital and other changes. Net working capital changes consumed $195 million of cash during the period, and we expect working capital changes to be much less burdensome to our cash flow during the second half of the year. 
Capital expenditures for the second quarter were about $660 million, bringing our year-to-date capital spending to $1.3 billion. As Vicki mentioned, our capital spending in the second half of the year will increase modestly as certain project-related expenditures in both chemicals and midstream had been deferred into the latter part of the year. In addition, we plan to recycle some of the capital efficiency savings back into our Permian Resources drilling program and also take advantage of some project opportunities in Colombia. 
Despite the higher expected capital spending during the second half of the year, our 2016 total company capital program remains on track to be within our original budget of $3 billion.
During the second quarter, we also completed a $2.75 billion, 3-tranche  senior notes offering with attractive coupon rates of 2.6%, 3.4% and 4.4% on the 6-year, 10-year and 30-year notes, respectively, and extending the average life of our debt by about 5 years. The primary use of proceeds went to refinance the $750 million of notes that matured on June 1, 2016, and the early redemption of $1.25 billion of notes that were scheduled to mature in February 2017. In addition, we also paid $575 million in dividends and collected $330 million in payments, completing the settlement with Ecuador.
With respect to guidance and as Vicki mentioned, we now expect  our full year 2016 production growth from ongoing operations to come in at the high end of the 4% to 6% range. Better-than-expected production volumes achieved during the second quarter as well as improved confidence around Permian Resources and performance in the Middle East during the second half of the year allow us to narrow the estimated range of full year 2016 production from 585,000 to 600,000 BOE per day to a new range of 590,000 to 600,000 BOE per day. 
Turning to guidance for the third quarter, we expect the total oil and gas production pro forma for ongoing operations to be between 600,000 and 605,000 BOE per day. As I had mentioned during the first quarter call, we expect production in Permian Resources to decline during the second half of 2016. We anticipate production in Permian Resources to be approximately 116,000 BOE per day in the third quarter. Variability around the outcome will be a function of well performance, the capture of further efficiency gains and our ability to manage the base production. Despite the anticipated decline this quarter, we expect our full year 2016 production in Permian Resources to be approximately 121,000 BOE per day, representing year-over-year growth of 10%.
Our plan is to remain disciplined with our capital within the current product price environment and to recycle some of the efficiency and productivity gains realized this year into greater activity during the second half of the year. We expect this additional activity to help support our Permian Resources production as we exit this year and provide a platform for growth into 2017. Jody will share some specifics on this during his prepared remarks. 
We expect our total domestic production to decline about 10,000 BOE per day sequentially in the third quarter largely due to lower volumes in Permian Resources and partially due to declining natural gas production. Internationally, third quarter production should increase by about 6,000 to 8,000 BOE per day, mainly driven by the continued ramp-up of Oman's Block 62 production. 
Our DD&A expense for oil and gas is expected to be approximately $15 per BOE during 2016, and depreciation of the oil and gas segment is expected to exceed this year's capital investment by more than $1 billion. The combined depreciation for chemical and midstream segments should be approximately $655 million. 
Exploration expense is estimated to be about $25 million pretax for the third quarter. 
Price changes at current global prices affect our annual operating cash flow by about $100 million for every $1 per barrel change in WTI. A swing of $0.50 per 1 million BTUs in domestic natural gas prices affects annual operating cash flow by about $45 million.
In chemicals, we anticipate pretax earnings of about $130 million for the third quarter as the business ramps back up from second quarter's planned maintenance outages at several of our chloro-vinyl plants combined with improved caustic soda prices. 
In midstream, we expect the third quarter to generate a pretax loss of between $20 million and $40 million. While quarter-to-quarter changes can be volatile in this segment, the sequential improvement is anticipated due to higher foreign pipeline income and higher income from power generation as well as improvements in our crude oil supply commitments. These factors, combined with better results for domestic gas processing, should provide a noticeable improvement in our overall midstream results during the second half of the year compared to the first 6 months' results.
The worldwide effective tax rate on a reported and core income was 41% for the second quarter of 2016. Using current strip prices for oil and gas, we expect our 2016 domestic tax rate to be about 40%. Our international tax rate should be about 60%.
I'll now turn the call over to Jody Elliott, who will discuss activity around our Permian operations."

Today, I'll provide a review of our domestic operations during the second quarter and guidance on our program to the end of 2016. 
As Vicki discussed earlier, we slowed our Permian Resources drilling program as planned due to the severely depressed product prices in the beginning of 2016. We strategically increased capital spending in the EOR business, which will drive increased production in future quarters and years. 
In order to prepare for growth in 2017, we plan to add 2 drilling rigs in our resources business later this year. We will increase our operated rig count over the second half of the year to 7 to 8 drilling rigs in the Permian, 5 of these in Permian Resources. This is an increase from our previous guidance of 4 to 5 rigs. This incremental activity is a direct result of program savings from improved capital and operating efficiencies as well as improvements in base production management. Our team has performed extraordinarily well to capture these savings, which will be reinvested back into the business
As stated last quarter, our Permian Resources operation is being managed to maximize the value of our workforce, enhance our operational capabilities, invest in areas with existing infrastructure and gather critical appraisal information to drive better well productivity. Our focus for the remainder of the year is to prepare the business for profitable growth in 2017.
Turning to the performance of Permian Resources. In the second quarter, we achieved daily production of 126,000 BOE per day, a 16% increase versus the prior year. Oil production decreased quarter-over-quarter by 5,000 barrels a day to 79,000 barrels per day. However, this was a 10% increase from a year ago. The decline was due to lower capital spending with 14 wells put online versus 37 wells in the first quarter.
In addition to better performance of our wells, emphasis on production optimization has been central to reducing declines in the business, and we've exceeded our expectations versus our goals. As previously stated, we expect to increase our activity in the second half of 2016 and bring approximately 30 wells online.
Due to the slowdown in activity in the first half of the year due to depressed oil prices and a disciplined development strategy, we expect to see declines in the third and fourth quarter. Third quarter production should average 116,000 BOE per day. For the full year of 2016, we expect to produce 121,000 BOE per day, a 10% growth rate year-over-year. As our activity increases, we expect production decline to stabilize, and with higher oil prices, we will deliver production growth in 2017.
As we continue to increase our lateral lengths, we now compare and benchmark our well cost on a cost per 1,000 feet of lateral length basis. Slide 31 illustrates our demonstrated improvement in well cost, which had declined by roughly 30% from 2015. Similarly, our 1,000 foot of lateral per rig per quarter has also improved from 25.2 per rig in 2015 to 36.3 per rig in the second quarter. These metrics will be a primary focus as we continue our development plans. I would emphasize that we estimate 80% of these improvements in efficiency are not at risk of service price increases in a cyclical recovery. 
Our Delaware Basin well performance continues to be strong despite reduced activity. We placed 7 horizontal wells on production in the Wolfcamp A benches in the second quarter. We continue to increase well productivity by increasing contact with the reservoir near the wellbore, utilizing higher cluster density, higher proppant loading and drilling longer laterals. For example, we placed 3 Buzzard State unit wells online with an average peak rate of 1,993 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,733 BOE per day. The HB Morrison B 15H well with a 5,000-foot lateral achieved a peak rate of 2,265 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,717 BOE per day.
As can be seen in the chart on Slide 32, well productivity continues to improve across all production metrics year-over-year due to our successful efforts applying geologic and reservoir parameters into our landing zones and completion designs.
In the Delaware Basin, our Wolfcamp A 4,500-foot well cost decreased by about 19% from the 2015 cost of $7.7 million to a first half 2016 cost of $6.2 million. We reduced our drilling time by 6 days from the average of 25 days in 2015 to 19 days measured by rig release to rig release. We expect the cost and productivity improvements in drilling, completions and facilities to continue as we progress our program. In addition, we drilled a second Bone Spring appraisal well in the Texas Delaware region with encouraging results, which we believe will add additional bench potential to the long-term development planned in this area.
We did not put any additional wells online during the second quarter in New Mexico that we are actively drilling in the region. However, our second Bone Spring 180-day cumulative production rates are among the best in the play. During the second half of the year, we plan to increase drilling and completion activity in the southern Eddy County area due to these improved results. We're targeting an average well cost of $5.5 million, and we continue to appraise and delineate multiple benches in the core areas of this region. And our initial results have indicated high-return, multi-bench development potential.
In the East Midland Basin, we brought on the Waldron Eunice 1306WA well in the second quarter to peak rate of 1,407 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,286 BOE per day. We also brought online the Merchant 1404A well at a peak rate of 1,222 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,061 BOE per day. Both wells are producing with high oil cuts. In the West Midland Basin, 8 new Lower Spraberry wells at South Curtis Ranch are producing results among the best in the play. Improved wells results are due to an optimized landing zone target and stimulation redesign.
In the Midland Basin, we made similar improvements in well cost and drilling days in drilling the Wolfcamp A formation. We reduced the cost of these 7,500-foot horizontal wells by 10% from the 2015 cost of $7.1 million to a first half cost of $6.4 million, including the additional cost of increased frac size. We reduced our drilling time by 3 days from the 2015 average of 19 days to 16 days measured by rig release to rig release.
In the Permian Resources as a whole, we achieved another quarter of lower quarter-over-quarter field operating expenses mainly -- due mainly to improved service operations with optimized water handling, lower workover expenses and better downhole performance. Since the second quarter of 2015, we reduced our operating cost per barrel by 27%, continue to work additional cost reduction and efficiency improvements. 
As stated earlier, our focus on maximizing production from existing wells has been central to reducing declines in the business. We expect that our annual average uplift from our investment will be over 6,000 net BOE per day. This is another example of leveraging our decades of base management expertise in the EOR business to our resources business.
In addition to the Midland Basin and Delaware Basin results, we drilled and completed 2 horizontal Wichita Albany appraisal wells on existing HBP acreage in the Central Basin Platform. We are encouraged by the early results of these lower decline rate wells and would anticipate drilling 6 to 8 follow-up wells in the play in the next 12 to 18 months.
In Permian EOR, we continue to take advantage of lower drilling cost and manage the operations to run our gas processing facilities at full capacity. Permian EOR had another quarter of free cash flow generation, driven by resilient base production and low capital requirements. 
Drilling costs are running 23% below our benchmark target, and we've lowered our cash operating expenses by 20% since the fourth quarter of 2014 and 7% year-over-year, driven mainly by lower downhole maintenance and ejectment costs. In similar fashion to our resources business, the capital savings achieved by the EOR team will be reinvested into additional wells and CO2 flood expansions.
As I've mentioned in previous calls, the Residual Oil Zone development, or ROZ, is a vertical expansion of the CO2 flooded interval. The ROZ underlies most of our major EOR properties and can be developed between $3 and $7 a barrel. Year-to-date, we've completed 74 well deepenings and recompletions along with 28 new wells in ROZ developments. We anticipate an additional 30 deepenings and recompletions and 22 new wells in ROZ developments in the second half of 2016. In addition, one of our horizontal rigs from Permian Resources drilled 2 deep CO2 source wells, which will help provide long-term supplies of CO2 and support our vast inventory of EOR development projects.
In summary, we are achieving better-than-expected results in both Permian businesses that will allow us to invest the savings into additional wells in each respective business. In the current environment, we believe this is a prudent investment philosophy that motivates our employees and works well with our total spend per barrel incentive metric. 
We're pleased with the strides that our teams have made in execution, performance and safety thus far in 2016, which will afford us the ability to ramp up our activity should oil prices exhibit fundamental stability.
Thank you, and I'll now hand it back to Chris Degner"

We have the ability to put the infrastructure in, in the Permian. So we have, I would say, a significant ability. One time, we were running over 25 rigs, and we could -- if prices were in the range that would warrant it, that we could get back to that. But bearing in mind now that back when we were running 25 rigs, we were not as efficient as we are today where we're significantly improved with our efficiencies. So we could get actually the same amount of productivity with half the number of rigs that we were at, at that time. So I don't see us going back to a 25-rig count in the Permian unless we expand our operations and our footprint. But we could easily go back to somewhere in the neighborhood of up to 15 rigs reasonably and still have the capacity to do it. I think we could get ahead of it with our infrastructure as well. And you'll -- actually, Jody could talk a little bit more, if you'd like, about the infrastructure development and how we're trying to stay ahead of it.

I can tell you that what we'll do is that we'll put the program together. We always do that at the end of this year. And we'll firm it up by first of next year. But what our teams have done over -- during this downturn and this lower period, is they've enabled us to have a lot more flexibility next year to be able to ramp up should we need to or should we have the opportunity to do so. And the ramp-up could be not just in the Permian Resources. As I mentioned earlier, the ramp-up could be in Colombia as well. And in addition to that, we expect that because of the situation with Al Hosn, overall Al Hosn will have a higher production rate in 2017 because it'll have a full year of production versus the warranty turnaround that we had in Q1 of this year. In addition to that, we'll have Block 62 gas on for the full year, and that'll be helpful. So you take those things, combine it with the flexibility that we have in both Permian Resources and Colombia, we'll start the year probably conservatively until we see fundamentals start to support prices, but we will have the ability to ramp up in multiple areas.

As what we do with other large facilities like this, we tend to -- when everything is a stable, we tend to test individual components and processes within the plant.

And we've been able to show our guidance of 60,000 barrels a day equivalent for Oxy share, and we've been up in the high 60s with a promise to get into the 70s just by pushing individual processes pretty hard. The main reason for this is to assess what the expansion would look like and which components would need a total addition or enhancement or some that just might be able to take higher load. So we think that out of this will come, if you'd like, a new baseline, which could be 110%, 112%. And then from that -- or even a bit higher. And from there, we would design an expansion to get up to a good number of kind of the sweet spot for the investment profile and the production profile, of course working with our bigger partner, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company.

Last quarter, I told you our game plan for this year has been to address the things within our sphere of influence to ultimately not only survive but thrive in the current weak commodity price environment. To",1669,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Last quarter, I told you our game plan for this year has been to address the things within our sphere of influence to ultimately not only survive but thrive in the current weak commodity price environment. To that end, we're on target to achieve the higher end of our production guidance for 2016 while keeping our capital program on budget at $3 billion.
We continue to make progress lowering our cost structure, which we know is critical to both short- and long-term success. Our capital discipline and cost reduction efficiencies, combined with improvement in new well productivity and better base production management, have enabled us to further reduce our total spend per barrel of production this year compared to 2015. 
In addition, our strategy around capital is to be prudent and remain focused on returns as we expect the commodity price environment to stay challenging through the rest of this year and into 2017. At the same time, we'll maintain the flexibility necessary to maneuver through a range of price scenarios. 
Finally, due to the strength of our balance sheet and the quality of our portfolio, we have raised our dividend for the 14th consecutive year.
Total company production for our ongoing operations increased to 609,000 BOE per day from 590,000 BOE per day in the first quarter. The increase was driven by Al Hosn Gas in Abu Dhabi and a  new gas project in Oman. The increase in average daily production of 26,000 BOE per day from Al Hosn versus the first quarter of 2016 is due mainly to lower production volumes in the first quarter caused by a scheduled warranty shutdown. However, 10% of the increase is due to improved plant efficiencies gained by the Al Hosn operations team. As you know, Al Hosn Gas is a joint venture between ADNOC and Oxy and Abu Dhabi. The Al Hosn team has done an excellent job of optimizing deliverability through the plant.
An additional 7,000 BOE per day came from Block 62 in Oman, where a recently constructed gas plant was put online to process production from 2 newly developed gas fields. The plant was completed on time and on budget. This enabled us to achieve record production in Oman this quarter. 
In addition, our Qatar team has worked to get production in the Idd El Shargi South Dome field, or ISSD, to its highest level in over 16 years. Completion and design improvement in complex horizontal wells and enhanced base production management contributed to this production milestone. 
Permian Resources' production this quarter was 126,000 BOE per day, representing year-over-year growth of 16%. As Jody will show, we're continuing to see improvements in well productivity in all areas.
The increases in production from Al Hosn, Block 62 and ISSD, along with strong year-over-year production growth from Permian Resources, will help us reach the higher end of our 4% to 6% production growth guidance for 2016.
Our capital spending in the second quarter declined modestly as we shifted timing on spending for certain chemicals and midstream projects and slowed our drilling program in the Permian. This drilling program is consistent with the plans we've put in place at the beginning of this year and with our strategy to remain conservative in this price environment. 
Continued improvements in project designs and capital execution has helped us to do more than expected with our $3 billion capital budget. These along with improved production performance in many areas of our operations are the reasons we expect to achieve the upper end of our production guidance for the year. 
It's important to note that most of our cost reductions are due to our own efficiency gains, not service company unit cost reductions. In fact, approximately 80% of our drilling cost reductions are due to faster penetration rates achieved by the application of Oxy Drilling Dynamics along with improved well construction, design, lower cost of materials and enhanced logistics.
In Permian Resources, the cost savings we have achieved due to improved efficiencies will be redeployed into drilling incremental wells in the latter part of the year, which will positively impact 2017 production.
Additional capital will also be shifted to Colombia, where our teams have generated opportunities that deliver attractive returns at current prices. This activity will also support 2017 production. The construction of the joint venture ethylene cracker at Ingleside by OxyChem is on budget and on schedule to be completed in the first quarter of 2017.
In addition, the crude oil export terminal at Ingleside being constructed by midstream is also on budget and on time to be complete by year-end. The terminal will have a total oil storage capacity of 2 million barrels and throughput capacity of approximately 300,000 barrels of oil per day.
Although these activities will slightly increase our capital spending during the third and fourth quarters, we don't expect to exceed our $3 billion budgeted spending for the full year. With the completion of the long-term projects in both our chemical and midstream segments, we expect to have increased flexibility with our capital program in 2017.
Our efforts to focus on efficiency are paying off. It was -- we continued to lower our total spend per barrel of production. This metric includes our overhead, operating and capital cost per barrel of production. Our organization is focused on this metric, and we have linked incentive compensation to it. The metric is designed to drive cost reductions, increased well productivity, optimize base production. 
In 2014, our total spend per barrel averaged close to $62. We lowered this to about $40 in 2015 and have targeted $28.50 per barrel in 2016. In the first half of this year, we've beaten our target with average total spend of about $27 per barrel. We expect similar results during the second half of this year.
Despite the increase in oil prices and energy costs during the second quarter, we held our production cost flat on a sequential quarterly basis while achieving a year-over-year decline in production cost of approximately 19%.
Maintaining a conservative balance sheet continues to be a focus and top priority. We ended the second quarter with $3.8 billion of cash on hand, an increase of $600 million from the first quarter. Our cash flow from operations exceeded our capital spending in the second quarter, and we collected the remaining $300 million of proceeds from our settlement with Ecuador.
Throughout this year, we have consistently said that we will prudently manage our activity levels to stay positioned for profitable growth in 2017 while maintaining the flexibility necessary to maneuver through the uncertainty and volatility of this price environment. The capital redeployed under Permian Resources will be used to add 2 rigs by the fourth quarter to support production growth in 2017. 
The incremental capital for Colombia will be around $20 million. It will be directed to activities in La Cira-Infantas, where we have successful partnership with EcoPetrol to develop low decline waterfloods. The incremental production from this activity is also intended to support growth in 2017. 
Given the short-cycle nature of our Permian Resources business and the flexibility we have in our Colombia operations, we can adjust our capital spending up or down relatively quickly depending on the price environment.
On the M&A front, we also continued to look for ways to expand and further strengthen our position in the Permian through asset acquisitions as we rarely purchase whole public companies. Our objective is to pursue opportunities in both enhanced oil recovery and our resources business that provide meaningful synergies to enhance the value of our existing assets. Our goal in acquiring additional EOR assets is to blend development of long-life, low decline production with our faster-growth unconventional development. While we continue to evaluate potential opportunities, we are staying return focused and note that asset prices appear excessive when one considers the current product price environment.
At our board meeting in July, we announced a modest increase in our annual dividend rate from $3 to $3.04 per share. We have now increased our dividend every year for 14 consecutive years and a total of 15 times during that period. The dividend increase reflects our commitment to shareholders to grow the dividend annually, as is consistent with our long-standing capital priorities. As a reminder, our top priority for use of cash flow is the safety and maintenance of our operations. Our second priority is to fund the dividend. 
With improved capital efficiency in our Permian Resources business, the start-up of the ethylene cracker in chemicals, combined with long-lived base production and our portfolio of high-quality opportunities, we expect continued future dividend growth.
I'm pleased to note that our Board of Directors has elected a new director, Jack Moore. Jack most recently served as the Chairman and CEO for Cameron International. Prior to joining Cameron, he held various management positions at Baker Hughes and has nearly 4 decades of experience in the energy sector. His industry knowledge and management experience will be a great addition to our board.
Before I hand off to Chris, I'd like to summarize it by pointing out that across all our upstream oil and gas operations and in OxyChem and in our midstream business, our teams are executing efficiently and innovatively to achieve technical and operational excellence in all of our areas. 
Three things are driving this: first, the ability to focus on our core areas without the distraction from activities that are not core to us, thanks to the initiatives Steve Chazen started in 2013; second, we have excellent leadership at all levels throughout our organization; third, our employees are performing at a very high level. They're engaged, motivated and delivering exceptional results. While I'm happy about that and the direction we're headed, none of us are satisfied with where we are today. So we'll continue to aggressively and innovatively improve our performance.
I'll now turn the call over to Chris Stavros for a review of our financial results and detailed guidance."

Today, I plan to talk about the following: some of the key changes that have occurred since the first quarter, our second quarter segment and financial results and our third quarter and total year guidance for production and capital.
Index prices for WTI and Brent improved progressively each month and ended the second quarter with about a $12 per barrel increase compared to first quarter prices. Our income and cash flows benefited from a 35% increase in realized prices for both oil and NGLs. 
During the second quarter, we received a tax refund of $300 million for the NOL tax receivable booked at year-end 2015, and we collected the remaining payments of $330 million related to the Ecuador settlement.
Our core financial results for the second quarter 2016 were a loss of $136 million or $0.18 per diluted share. This represents a sequential improvement from the loss of $426 million or $0.56 per diluted share during the first quarter. Although commodity prices improved significantly from first quarter levels, they remained well below the prior year's second quarter. 
Second quarter 2016 reported results for GAAP purposes were also a loss of $0.18 per diluted share as there were no material noncore items during the period.
Oil and gas core pretax results for the second quarter 2016 were a loss of $117 million compared to a loss of $508 million in the first quarter   of 2016 and income of $324 million from the same period last year. The sequential improvement of $390 million was nearly all a result of higher commodity prices. 
Our second quarter 2016 worldwide realized oil price of $39.66 per barrel increased by over $10 a barrel or 35% compared to the first quarter. Total company oil and gas production volumes from our ongoing operations averaged 609,000 BOE per day in the second quarter, an increase of 19,000 BOE per day on a sequential quarterly basis and 57,000 BOE per day higher than last year's second quarter. Quarterly production volumes were at the high end of our guidance range of 600,000 to 610,000 BOE per day. 
International production from ongoing operations was 307,000 BOE per day during the second quarter of 2016 and up 24,000 BOE per day compared to the first quarter as the Al Hosn gas plant completed its scheduled first quarter warranty shutdown and Oman's Block 62 gas project continued to ramp up production. 
Second quarter domestic production from ongoing operations of 302,000 BOE per day came in nearly 2% lower than the first quarter. The sequential decline was partially due to the drop in production from the absence of gas-directed drilling activity at our South Texas assets and unplanned plant outages at our non-operated Permian EOR operations. Compared to the prior year's second quarter, our domestic production was up about 4,000 BOE per day with Permian Resources growing by 17,000 BOE per day or 16%, partly offset by a decline in natural gas production in our South Texas properties.
Domestic oil and gas cash operating costs from ongoing operations of $11.80 per BOE in the second quarter of 2016 were roughly flat on a sequential basis. However, they declined by 13% compared to the full year 2015 cost of $13.58 per BOE. The reduction in cost compared to last year is mainly the result of improved efficiency around our surface operations, including water handling, as well as lower downhole maintenance and energy-related costs.
Overall oil and gas DD&A for the second quarter of 2016 was $15 per BOE compared to $15.81 per BOE during 2015. 
Taxes other than on income, which are directly related to product prices, were $1.12 per BOE for the second quarter of 2016 compared to $1.32 per BOE for the full year of 2015.
 Second quarter exploration expense was $27 million. 
Chemical's second quarter 2016 pretax core earnings were $88 million compared with first quarter earnings of $126 million. The sequential quarterly decline in core earnings reflected lower chloro-vinyl production volumes due primarily to scheduled plant outages, partially offset by more favorable vinyl margins.
Midstream pretax core results were a loss of $58 million for the second quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $95 million in the first quarter. The sequential improvement reflected better oil and gas marketing margins and stronger domestic gas processing results due to higher NGL prices. Midstream also realized higher income from its domestic pipeline business as well as sequentially higher third-party farmed pipeline revenues as the Dolphin gas plant was down for planned maintenance in the first quarter
Looking at our cash flows for the second quarter, we ended the quarter with $3.8 billion of cash. During the second quarter, we generated $935 million of cash flow from continuing operations before working capital and other changes. Net working capital changes consumed $195 million of cash during the period, and we expect working capital changes to be much less burdensome to our cash flow during the second half of the year. 
Capital expenditures for the second quarter were about $660 million, bringing our year-to-date capital spending to $1.3 billion. As Vicki mentioned, our capital spending in the second half of the year will increase modestly as certain project-related expenditures in both chemicals and midstream had been deferred into the latter part of the year. In addition, we plan to recycle some of the capital efficiency savings back into our Permian Resources drilling program and also take advantage of some project opportunities in Colombia. 
Despite the higher expected capital spending during the second half of the year, our 2016 total company capital program remains on track to be within our original budget of $3 billion.
During the second quarter, we also completed a $2.75 billion, 3-tranche  senior notes offering with attractive coupon rates of 2.6%, 3.4% and 4.4% on the 6-year, 10-year and 30-year notes, respectively, and extending the average life of our debt by about 5 years. The primary use of proceeds went to refinance the $750 million of notes that matured on June 1, 2016, and the early redemption of $1.25 billion of notes that were scheduled to mature in February 2017. In addition, we also paid $575 million in dividends and collected $330 million in payments, completing the settlement with Ecuador.
With respect to guidance and as Vicki mentioned, we now expect  our full year 2016 production growth from ongoing operations to come in at the high end of the 4% to 6% range. Better-than-expected production volumes achieved during the second quarter as well as improved confidence around Permian Resources and performance in the Middle East during the second half of the year allow us to narrow the estimated range of full year 2016 production from 585,000 to 600,000 BOE per day to a new range of 590,000 to 600,000 BOE per day. 
Turning to guidance for the third quarter, we expect the total oil and gas production pro forma for ongoing operations to be between 600,000 and 605,000 BOE per day. As I had mentioned during the first quarter call, we expect production in Permian Resources to decline during the second half of 2016. We anticipate production in Permian Resources to be approximately 116,000 BOE per day in the third quarter. Variability around the outcome will be a function of well performance, the capture of further efficiency gains and our ability to manage the base production. Despite the anticipated decline this quarter, we expect our full year 2016 production in Permian Resources to be approximately 121,000 BOE per day, representing year-over-year growth of 10%.
Our plan is to remain disciplined with our capital within the current product price environment and to recycle some of the efficiency and productivity gains realized this year into greater activity during the second half of the year. We expect this additional activity to help support our Permian Resources production as we exit this year and provide a platform for growth into 2017. Jody will share some specifics on this during his prepared remarks. 
We expect our total domestic production to decline about 10,000 BOE per day sequentially in the third quarter largely due to lower volumes in Permian Resources and partially due to declining natural gas production. Internationally, third quarter production should increase by about 6,000 to 8,000 BOE per day, mainly driven by the continued ramp-up of Oman's Block 62 production. 
Our DD&A expense for oil and gas is expected to be approximately $15 per BOE during 2016, and depreciation of the oil and gas segment is expected to exceed this year's capital investment by more than $1 billion. The combined depreciation for chemical and midstream segments should be approximately $655 million. 
Exploration expense is estimated to be about $25 million pretax for the third quarter. 
Price changes at current global prices affect our annual operating cash flow by about $100 million for every $1 per barrel change in WTI. A swing of $0.50 per 1 million BTUs in domestic natural gas prices affects annual operating cash flow by about $45 million.
In chemicals, we anticipate pretax earnings of about $130 million for the third quarter as the business ramps back up from second quarter's planned maintenance outages at several of our chloro-vinyl plants combined with improved caustic soda prices. 
In midstream, we expect the third quarter to generate a pretax loss of between $20 million and $40 million. While quarter-to-quarter changes can be volatile in this segment, the sequential improvement is anticipated due to higher foreign pipeline income and higher income from power generation as well as improvements in our crude oil supply commitments. These factors, combined with better results for domestic gas processing, should provide a noticeable improvement in our overall midstream results during the second half of the year compared to the first 6 months' results.
The worldwide effective tax rate on a reported and core income was 41% for the second quarter of 2016. Using current strip prices for oil and gas, we expect our 2016 domestic tax rate to be about 40%. Our international tax rate should be about 60%.
I'll now turn the call over to Jody Elliott, who will discuss activity around our Permian operations."

Today, I'll provide a review of our domestic operations during the second quarter and guidance on our program to the end of 2016. 
As Vicki discussed earlier, we slowed our Permian Resources drilling program as planned due to the severely depressed product prices in the beginning of 2016. We strategically increased capital spending in the EOR business, which will drive increased production in future quarters and years. 
In order to prepare for growth in 2017, we plan to add 2 drilling rigs in our resources business later this year. We will increase our operated rig count over the second half of the year to 7 to 8 drilling rigs in the Permian, 5 of these in Permian Resources. This is an increase from our previous guidance of 4 to 5 rigs. This incremental activity is a direct result of program savings from improved capital and operating efficiencies as well as improvements in base production management. Our team has performed extraordinarily well to capture these savings, which will be reinvested back into the business
As stated last quarter, our Permian Resources operation is being managed to maximize the value of our workforce, enhance our operational capabilities, invest in areas with existing infrastructure and gather critical appraisal information to drive better well productivity. Our focus for the remainder of the year is to prepare the business for profitable growth in 2017.
Turning to the performance of Permian Resources. In the second quarter, we achieved daily production of 126,000 BOE per day, a 16% increase versus the prior year. Oil production decreased quarter-over-quarter by 5,000 barrels a day to 79,000 barrels per day. However, this was a 10% increase from a year ago. The decline was due to lower capital spending with 14 wells put online versus 37 wells in the first quarter.
In addition to better performance of our wells, emphasis on production optimization has been central to reducing declines in the business, and we've exceeded our expectations versus our goals. As previously stated, we expect to increase our activity in the second half of 2016 and bring approximately 30 wells online.
Due to the slowdown in activity in the first half of the year due to depressed oil prices and a disciplined development strategy, we expect to see declines in the third and fourth quarter. Third quarter production should average 116,000 BOE per day. For the full year of 2016, we expect to produce 121,000 BOE per day, a 10% growth rate year-over-year. As our activity increases, we expect production decline to stabilize, and with higher oil prices, we will deliver production growth in 2017.
As we continue to increase our lateral lengths, we now compare and benchmark our well cost on a cost per 1,000 feet of lateral length basis. Slide 31 illustrates our demonstrated improvement in well cost, which had declined by roughly 30% from 2015. Similarly, our 1,000 foot of lateral per rig per quarter has also improved from 25.2 per rig in 2015 to 36.3 per rig in the second quarter. These metrics will be a primary focus as we continue our development plans. I would emphasize that we estimate 80% of these improvements in efficiency are not at risk of service price increases in a cyclical recovery. 
Our Delaware Basin well performance continues to be strong despite reduced activity. We placed 7 horizontal wells on production in the Wolfcamp A benches in the second quarter. We continue to increase well productivity by increasing contact with the reservoir near the wellbore, utilizing higher cluster density, higher proppant loading and drilling longer laterals. For example, we placed 3 Buzzard State unit wells online with an average peak rate of 1,993 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,733 BOE per day. The HB Morrison B 15H well with a 5,000-foot lateral achieved a peak rate of 2,265 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,717 BOE per day.
As can be seen in the chart on Slide 32, well productivity continues to improve across all production metrics year-over-year due to our successful efforts applying geologic and reservoir parameters into our landing zones and completion designs.
In the Delaware Basin, our Wolfcamp A 4,500-foot well cost decreased by about 19% from the 2015 cost of $7.7 million to a first half 2016 cost of $6.2 million. We reduced our drilling time by 6 days from the average of 25 days in 2015 to 19 days measured by rig release to rig release. We expect the cost and productivity improvements in drilling, completions and facilities to continue as we progress our program. In addition, we drilled a second Bone Spring appraisal well in the Texas Delaware region with encouraging results, which we believe will add additional bench potential to the long-term development planned in this area.
We did not put any additional wells online during the second quarter in New Mexico that we are actively drilling in the region. However, our second Bone Spring 180-day cumulative production rates are among the best in the play. During the second half of the year, we plan to increase drilling and completion activity in the southern Eddy County area due to these improved results. We're targeting an average well cost of $5.5 million, and we continue to appraise and delineate multiple benches in the core areas of this region. And our initial results have indicated high-return, multi-bench development potential.
In the East Midland Basin, we brought on the Waldron Eunice 1306WA well in the second quarter to peak rate of 1,407 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,286 BOE per day. We also brought online the Merchant 1404A well at a peak rate of 1,222 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,061 BOE per day. Both wells are producing with high oil cuts. In the West Midland Basin, 8 new Lower Spraberry wells at South Curtis Ranch are producing results among the best in the play. Improved wells results are due to an optimized landing zone target and stimulation redesign.
In the Midland Basin, we made similar improvements in well cost and drilling days in drilling the Wolfcamp A formation. We reduced the cost of these 7,500-foot horizontal wells by 10% from the 2015 cost of $7.1 million to a first half cost of $6.4 million, including the additional cost of increased frac size. We reduced our drilling time by 3 days from the 2015 average of 19 days to 16 days measured by rig release to rig release.
In the Permian Resources as a whole, we achieved another quarter of lower quarter-over-quarter field operating expenses mainly -- due mainly to improved service operations with optimized water handling, lower workover expenses and better downhole performance. Since the second quarter of 2015, we reduced our operating cost per barrel by 27%, continue to work additional cost reduction and efficiency improvements. 
As stated earlier, our focus on maximizing production from existing wells has been central to reducing declines in the business. We expect that our annual average uplift from our investment will be over 6,000 net BOE per day. This is another example of leveraging our decades of base management expertise in the EOR business to our resources business.
In addition to the Midland Basin and Delaware Basin results, we drilled and completed 2 horizontal Wichita Albany appraisal wells on existing HBP acreage in the Central Basin Platform. We are encouraged by the early results of these lower decline rate wells and would anticipate drilling 6 to 8 follow-up wells in the play in the next 12 to 18 months.
In Permian EOR, we continue to take advantage of lower drilling cost and manage the operations to run our gas processing facilities at full capacity. Permian EOR had another quarter of free cash flow generation, driven by resilient base production and low capital requirements. 
Drilling costs are running 23% below our benchmark target, and we've lowered our cash operating expenses by 20% since the fourth quarter of 2014 and 7% year-over-year, driven mainly by lower downhole maintenance and ejectment costs. In similar fashion to our resources business, the capital savings achieved by the EOR team will be reinvested into additional wells and CO2 flood expansions.
As I've mentioned in previous calls, the Residual Oil Zone development, or ROZ, is a vertical expansion of the CO2 flooded interval. The ROZ underlies most of our major EOR properties and can be developed between $3 and $7 a barrel. Year-to-date, we've completed 74 well deepenings and recompletions along with 28 new wells in ROZ developments. We anticipate an additional 30 deepenings and recompletions and 22 new wells in ROZ developments in the second half of 2016. In addition, one of our horizontal rigs from Permian Resources drilled 2 deep CO2 source wells, which will help provide long-term supplies of CO2 and support our vast inventory of EOR development projects.
In summary, we are achieving better-than-expected results in both Permian businesses that will allow us to invest the savings into additional wells in each respective business. In the current environment, we believe this is a prudent investment philosophy that motivates our employees and works well with our total spend per barrel incentive metric. 
We're pleased with the strides that our teams have made in execution, performance and safety thus far in 2016, which will afford us the ability to ramp up our activity should oil prices exhibit fundamental stability.
Thank you, and I'll now hand it back to Chris Degner"

We have the ability to put the infrastructure in, in the Permian. So we have, I would say, a significant ability. One time, we were running over 25 rigs, and we could -- if prices were in the range that would warrant it, that we could get back to that. But bearing in mind now that back when we were running 25 rigs, we were not as efficient as we are today where we're significantly improved with our efficiencies. So we could get actually the same amount of productivity with half the number of rigs that we were at, at that time. So I don't see us going back to a 25-rig count in the Permian unless we expand our operations and our footprint. But we could easily go back to somewhere in the neighborhood of up to 15 rigs reasonably and still have the capacity to do it. I think we could get ahead of it with our infrastructure as well. And you'll -- actually, Jody could talk a little bit more, if you'd like, about the infrastructure development and how we're trying to stay ahead of it.

I can tell you that what we'll do is that we'll put the program together. We always do that at the end of this year. And we'll firm it up by first of next year. But what our teams have done over -- during this downturn and this lower period, is they've enabled us to have a lot more flexibility next year to be able to ramp up should we need to or should we have the opportunity to do so. And the ramp-up could be not just in the Permian Resources. As I mentioned earlier, the ramp-up could be in Colombia as well. And in addition to that, we expect that because of the situation with Al Hosn, overall Al Hosn will have a higher production rate in 2017 because it'll have a full year of production versus the warranty turnaround that we had in Q1 of this year. In addition to that, we'll have Block 62 gas on for the full year, and that'll be helpful. So you take those things, combine it with the flexibility that we have in both Permian Resources and Colombia, we'll start the year probably conservatively until we see fundamentals start to support prices, but we will have the ability to ramp up in multiple areas.

As what we do with other large facilities like this, we tend to -- when everything is a stable, we tend to test individual components and processes within the plant.

And we've been able to show our guidance of 60,000 barrels a day equivalent for Oxy share, and we've been up in the high 60s with a promise to get into the 70s just by pushing individual processes pretty hard. The main reason for this is to assess what the expansion would look like and which components would need a total addition or enhancement or some that just might be able to take higher load. So we think that out of this will come, if you'd like, a new baseline, which could be 110%, 112%. And then from that -- or even a bit higher. And from there, we would design an expansion to get up to a good number of kind of the sweet spot for the investment profile and the production profile, of course working with our bigger partner, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company.

I'll begin by summarizing our key accomplishments in the third quarter. First, cost reduction efficiencies, combined with improvement in new well productivity and better base management, have enabled us to further reduce our total spend per barrel of production this year compared to 2015.
Second, we again increased year-over-year production in our core areas, and we're on target to exceed the higher end of our guidance for 2016.
Third, we remain prudent with our capital allocation as we focused on returns and maintained discipline to stay within our $3 billion capital budget. 
Fourth, to further increase our low-decline production and improve efficiencies, we have acquired additional working interests and enhanced oil recovery projects in [ph] unconventional acreage in the Permian. 
Last, our aggressive appraisal and development efforts in our Permian Resources business have resulted in an improvement in the number and quality of wells in our inventory.
As I've previously mentioned, our total spend per barrel of production metric includes our overhead, operating and capital cost per barrel of production. This metric is designed to drive cost reductions, increase well productivity and optimize base production. To align employees with this metric, we have linked this to incentive compensation.
Our efforts to focus on efficiency and capital discipline are paying off as we continue to lower our total spend per barrel of production. We averaged close to 62 barrels [ph] in 2014, about $40 per barrel in 2015 and have targeted $28.50 per barrel in 2016. Year-to-date, we have beaten our target with average total spend of about $27.50 per barrel.
In the third quarter, total company production from our ongoing operations was about 605,000 BOE per day, an increase of 5% year-over-year, driven by Al Hosn Gas in Abu Dhabi, a new gas project in Oman and resilient base production in Permian Resources.
The performance of the Al Hosn team continues to exceed our expectations as they optimize deliverability. They have again achieved a record production of 74,000 BOE per day for the quarter. It's even more impressive that the plant operated well during the summer months where temperatures can reach 120 degrees. We're optimistic that the plant can continue to deliver from 65,000 BOE per day to 75,000 BOE per day depending on seasonal maintenance. We have commenced engineering studies for a potential expansion of the plant and expect to reach an investment decision in the second half of 2017.
Permian Resources production this quarter was 121,000 BOE per day, representing year-over-year growth of 4%. As per our original development plan, Permian Resources production will decline slightly in the fourth quarter. We are adding rigs now to stabilize production and reach our growth in early 2017. We continue to see improvements in well productivity in all of our areas.
The increases in production from Al Hosn, Oman's Block 62, along with strong year-over-year production growth from Permian Resources, will help us exceed the higher end of our production growth guidance for 2016. As we look forward to 2017, we expect to deliver 5% to 8% production growth with a variance subject to our activity levels in the Permian. Longer term, we have a deep inventory of well locations in the Permian with the capabilities to drive production growth above this range. 
Additionally, we have focused our international business on the core 4 areas: Abu Dhabi, Qatar, Oman and Colombia, where we have a track record of operational success, free cash flow generation and strong financial returns as well as growth opportunities that could drive the capabilities to drive production growth higher than our long-term 5% to 8% target. [ph] I have emphasized to our partners in those areas that the returns on any new projects or capital investments must compete with the Permian Basin.
I'm pleased to announce that we have formally completed the exit of our contracts in Bahrain and Iraq. We have no meaningful liabilities related to those contracts nor will we incur any material spending on capital or overhead to manage those terminated contracts. We've also made solid progress toward a formal exit from our contracts in Libya.
Our capital spending in the third quarter declined slightly as we maintained our drilling program in the Permian and shifted timing on spending for certain midstream and chemicals projects. The Permian drilling program is consistent with plans we put in place at the beginning of this year and with our strategy to remain relatively conservative in this price environment. Continued improvements in project design and capital executions have helped us do more than expected with our $3 billion capital budget. These, along with improved production performance in many of our areas, are the reasons we will achieve the upper end of our production guidance for the year.
The construction of the OxyChem joint venture ethylene cracker at Ingleside [ph] is on budget and on schedule. We have targeted to finish the commissioning of the plant by mid-January and expect ethylene production in the first quarter of 2017. 
In addition, the crude oil export terminal at Ingleside has started operations and successfully loaded and dispatched 3 ships. The terminal has oil storage capacity of 2 million barrels and throughput capacity of approximately 300,000 barrels of oil per day. The export facility will have the flexibility to take various gravities of crude oil to both domestic and foreign markets.
As the production from the Permian Basin grows in coming years, we would expect to increase demand for access to multiple markets. The ship channel in Corpus Christi has clear advantages to Houston and should allow for shorter transportation times to market.
With the completion of long-term projects in both our chemical and midstream segments, we expect to have increased flexibility with our capital program in 2017. As we enter the fourth quarter, we have increased our activity in the Permian to prepare the business for growth in 2017. While we plan to release a more detailed budget early next year, at this point, it's our expectation that capital will increase modestly from a little under $3 billion in 2016 to a range of $3.3 billion to $3.8 billion in 2017. The progress this year of multiyear committed capital will allow for more of our 2017 capital to be devoted to upstream oil and gas development.
Our program in the Permian Resources business will receive the largest increase in capital. And due to the shorter cycle nature of the asset base, it can be adjusted depending on the extent of commodity price recovery.
As we announced yesterday, we have made several strategic acquisitions of producing properties and nonproducing leasehold in the Permian. As we have said previously, we already have a very large inventory in our resources business. The main reason to acquire additional acreage is to improve the value of the inventory we currently have. The selection criteria we used to evaluate our acquisition opportunities are: the proximity of the acreage to our existing infrastructure; the quality of the subsurface reservoirs, and in most cases, we need to have multi-bench development [ph] potential; and the ability to optimize recovery per well by drilling longer laterals.
The acquisition we just made met all of these objectives, with the added bonus that we already had a working interest in the properties, making the overall acreage investment lower than current market. In fact, all of the assets we just purchased in both resources and EOR are in fields where we currently operate or own a working interest.
The resources acquisition is in the Texas-Delaware Basin. Increasing our working interest enabled us to become operator of this area, which we believe to be among the most prospective areas in the Permian. Current production is 7,000 BOE per day. The acreage is mostly contiguous, which will enable us to drill longer laterals. It has high oil content and at least 5 prospective benches, 3 of which have a high level of certainty [ph] and 2 that are currently being appraised. The properties also have infrastructure that fits well with the infrastructure and takeaway capacity that we already have built in the area.
Including our previous acquisitions, our aggregate investment in this area totals $2 billion and increases our working interest in 59,000 acres. The $2 billion includes a cost of $100 million for the infrastructure on the acquired acreage. From an operating standpoint, this area will become part of what we will call the Greater Barilla Draw Development. [ph] This enables us to utilize and control shared infrastructure to reduce development capital and operating costs, thus increasing our margins as we grow our production.
We will leverage this infrastructure, along with our knowledge of the subsurface, to drive improved financial returns and production growth. We expect to add a rig or 2 to the acreage early next year to accelerate the development of the resource.
As with the resources acquisition, we also acquired additional working interest in enhanced oil recovery projects in Permian, mostly in areas that we operate. This acquisition provides low-decline net production of 4,000 BOE per day and has additional development upside. [ph] 
Going forward, we will continue to actively evaluate our acquisition opportunities. Due to the nature of its ownership base and long history of production, ownership throughout the Permian is fragmented. We will target bolt-on opportunities with the clear strategic synergies I previously listed to leverage both our understanding of the subsurface geology and our existing midstream and infrastructure investments. Our approach will be disciplined. We'll also continue to actively swap and trade small blocks of acreage. Year-to-date, we have swapped approximately 10,000 acres through many small negotiated transactions. These trades will enable longer lateral development and improve returns without material capital outlay.
As we have continued to appraise and develop our own acreage in the Permian Resources business, we have seen steady improvement in well productivity and a reduction in our drilling and completion costs. Improved logistical capabilities and integrated planning will ensure the majority of these cost savings are sustainable. Through efforts to core [ph] up our acreage to drill longer laterals, we have lowered the breakeven cost on our inventory. Simply put, we can deliver more production with fewer wells.
We expect to provide updated disclosure of our inventory and breakeven prices in early 2017 once we have fully integrated Reeves [ph] appraisal efforts and the acquisitions.
I'm pleased with our progress to date. We had exceeded our production targets for the year with less capital than we have planned to spend, and we have positioned the company for continued profitable production and cash flow growth as we enter 2017. Directionally, we are planning for modestly higher oil prices in 2017, and we'll set our budget accordingly.
I'll now turn the call over to Chris Stavros."
293286,404979780,1068366,"Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Occidental Petroleum Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Vicki, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll focus on the following items: our third quarter segment and overall financial results; Oxy's balance sheet strength, liquidity and cash flow in the context of the Permian acquisitions we just announce",1773,"Thanks, Vicki, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll focus on the following items: our third quarter segment and overall financial results; Oxy's balance sheet strength, liquidity and cash flow in the context of the Permian acquisitions we just announced; and oil and gas production and segment guidance for the fourth quarter.
Third quarter 2016 reported financial results for GAAP purposes were a loss of $0.32 per diluted share compared to a loss of $0.18 a share in this year's second quarter. Our third quarter reported results included a net after-tax charge of $129 million related to nonrecurring items in both the oil and gas and midstream segments. Our core financial results for the third quarter of 2016 were a loss of $112 million or $0.15 per diluted share, a slight improvement from a loss of $136 million or $0.18 a share during the second quarter. Importantly, each of our operating segments generated improved quarter-to-quarter core financial results despite the continued challenging conditions for product prices.
Oil and gas pretax core results for the third quarter of 2016 were a loss of $49 million compared to a loss of $117 million in the second quarter, an income [ph] of $162 million in the same year-ago period. The sequential improvement of $68 million was primarily a result of higher product price realizations.
During the third quarter, the oil and gas segment recorded a noncore net charges related to the exit from both Libya and Iraq of $61 million and a $38 million after-tax gain on the sale of some noncore, non-operated [ph] oil and gas properties in South Texas.
Third quarter total company production volumes of 605,000 BOE per day were at the high end of our previous guidance range, with better-than-expected production results coming from Permian Resources, improved performance at Al Hosn in the UAE and production growth in Oman from Block 62.
Total domestic production was 294,000 BOE per day during the third quarter, down sequentially from 302,000 BOE per day in the second quarter. Despite the overall decline in domestic volumes, production in Permian Resources of 121,000 BOE per day exceeded our earlier guidance by 5,000 BOE per day, largely due to better management around our base production. The sequential decline in third quarter domestic volumes is also partially due to a drop in production from the absence of gas-directed drilling activity in South Texas.
Our domestic oil and gas operations generated $67 million of free cash flow after capital during the third quarter. In a moment, Jody Elliott will discuss our plans for increased drilling activity in Permian Resources for the fourth quarter and as we exit the year.
International production from our ongoing operations was 311,000 BOE per day during the third quarter of 2016, an increase of 4,000 BOE per day compared to the second quarter. Higher volumes from Al Hosn and Oman contributed to the overall sequential increase, partially offset by a decline in Colombia as a result of pipeline disruptions. The international oil and gas operations comprised of our core 4 areas generated nearly $300 million of free cash flow after capital during the third quarter.
Domestic oil and gas cash operating cost of $12.26 per BOE in the third quarter of 2016 was slightly higher on a sequential basis; however, [ph] declined by 7% compared to the full year 2015 cost of $13.13 per BOE.
9-month year-to-date costs are down nearly 10% compared with full year 2015, with the decline mainly the result of improved efficiencies and logistics management around our surface operations, including water handling, as well as lower downhole maintenance and energy-related costs. 
Cash operating costs in Permian Resources saw a further sequential decline in the third quarter and, for the year-to-date, have fallen to $8.43 per BOE, an improvement of 25% compared to 2015 full year costs. 
Overall, oil and gas DD&A for the third quarter of 2016 was $15.58 per BOE compared to $15.81 per BOE during 2015.
Taxes other than on income were $0.97 per BOE for the third quarter of 2016 compared to $1.32 per BOE during 2015. The third quarter exploration expense was $9 million.
Chemical's third quarter 2016 pretax core earnings were $117 million compared with second quarter earnings of $88 million. The sequential quarterly increase in core earnings resulted from higher chloro-vinyls production volumes and higher realized caustic soda prices. These improvements were partially offset by higher energy costs, combined with lower vinyls margins. Vinyl prices remained largely unchanged despite significantly higher ethylene prices, resulting from both meaningful planned and unplanned industry ethylene cracker outages. Our chemicals business generated $100 million of free cash flow before working capital during the third quarter.
Midstream pretax core results were a loss of $20 million for the third quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $58 million in the second quarter. Despite the loss, the results came in at the positive range of our previous guidance, with the sequential improvement resulting from better oil and gas marketing margins.
During the third quarter, we renegotiated some of our crude oil supply contracts, which resulted in an after-tax charge of $103 million. The new agreement should mitigate some of the transportation costs and improve overall profitability going forward.
Turning to our cash flows for the third quarter. We generated $860 million of cash flow from continuing operations before working capital and other changes and adjusted for a onetime payment for the renegotiation of a crude oil supply contract as well as some tax-related items.
Net working capital changes provided $50 million of cash during the period. We expect that this trend on working capital will continue as we exit the year at a slightly higher run rate for capital expenditures compared to the current pace of spending and activity.
Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $642 million, bringing our total year-to-date capital spending to approximately $2 billion. As Vicki mentioned, our capital spending in the fourth quarter is expected to increase modestly as certain project-related expenditures in both chemicals and midstream had been deferred into the latter part of the year. In addition, we plan to recycle some of the efficiencies and savings generated around drilling and completions back into our Permian Resources drilling program, in addition to pursuing some project opportunities in Colombia.
Despite the higher planned capital spending during the fourth quarter, our total 6 [ph] -- 2016 total capital program is expected to come in slightly under our original budget of $3 billion. We paid $575 million in dividends during the third quarter and ended the period with $3.2 billion of cash.
As Vicki mentioned, yesterday, we announced several acquisitions of producing properties and nonproducing leasehold acreage in the Permian as well as interests in several enhanced oil recovery and CO2 properties and related infrastructure. These acquisitions were funded with existing cash on hand and without the use of any equity. The transactions are immediately accretive to cash flow and at current commodity prices.
Although our view on product prices remains relatively conservative into next year, we believe we have the balance sheet flexibility to allow us to cover a modest increase in our capital program, which we expect to deliver production growth of 5% to 8% in 2017.
Assuming oil prices of approximately $50 per barrel, we expect to generate cash flow from operations of at least $4.5 billion in 2017. Incremental cash flow contributions would include $150 million from the start-up of a joint venture ethylene cracker; approximately $200 million from improving results with the midstream segment, which would include the Ingleside crude oil terminal; and at least $100 million from the announced Permian acquisitions. In addition, every $1 per barrel improvement in oil prices would provide a further $100 million of operating cash flow.
With respect to guidance and as Vicki mentioned, we now expect our full year 2016 production growth from ongoing operations to be approximately 7% and exceeding the high end of our previous 4% to 6% range. We expect our company-wide production volumes to be in the range of 600,000 to 610,000 BOE per day during the fourth quarter. We anticipate our overall domestic production to be in the range of 290,000 to 295,000 BOE per day, which includes a partial contribution from the Permian acquisitions during the quarter. Permian Resources production is expected to be roughly flat with volumes seen during the third quarter, with full year 2016 growth estimated to be about 12%. International production is estimated to be in the range of 310,000 to 315,000 BOE per day during the fourth quarter. This incorporates the impact of a planned maintenance turnaround at Al Hosn and assumes normal operations in Colombia.
Our plan is to remain disciplined with our capital within the current price environment and to recycle some of the efficiency and productivity gains realized this year into greater activity during the fourth quarter and early next year. We expect this additional activity to help support our Permian Resources production as we exit this year and provide a platform for growth into 2017. Jody will share some of those specifics during his prepared remarks.
In the midstream segment, we expect the fourth quarter to generate a pretax loss of between $20 million and $40 million. While quarter-to-quarter changes are inherently volatile in this segment, we anticipate favorable spreads for our West Texas to Gulf [ph] shipments to continue, higher domestic pipeline earnings as well as increased flow of crude to our Ingleside crude terminal, in anticipation of full operations beginning early in 2017.
In chemicals, we anticipate pretax earnings of about $100 million for the fourth quarter or roughly flat with the third quarter. Our DD&A expense for oil and gas is expected to be approximately $15.50 per BOE during 2016, and depreciation for the oil and gas segment is expected to exceed this year's capital investment by more than $1.4 billion.
The combined depreciation for the chemical and midstream segments should be approximately $655 million. Exploration expense is estimated to be about $25 million pretax during the fourth quarter. Price changes at current global prices affect our annual operating cash flow by about $100 million for every dollar [ph] per barrel per change in WTI. And a swing of $0.50 per million BTUs in domestic natural gas prices affects our annual operating cash flow by about $45 million. [ph] 
Using current strip prices for oil and gas, we expect our full year 2016 domestic tax rate to be about 36%. Our international tax rate should be about 55%.
I'll now turn the call over to Jody Elliott, who'll provide an update on activity around our Permian operations."
293286,404979780,1068366,"Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Occidental Petroleum Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Chris. Today, I will provide a review of our domestic operations during the third quarter, guidance on our program in the fourth quarter and an outlook for the start of 2017. For this year, our Permian Resources business achieved significant",1774,"Thank you, Chris. Today, I will provide a review of our domestic operations during the third quarter, guidance on our program in the fourth quarter and an outlook for the start of 2017. 
For this year, our Permian Resources business achieved significant improvement in well economics across our Permian-leading acreage position through step-change [ph] advancements and well productivity and field development design. We believe this improvement in value starts with our subsurface characterization where we are leveraging our geology, petrophysics [ph] and geochemistry expertise to achieve breakthroughs in our multi-bench appraisal, [ph] stimulation and other key subsurface design factors. We expect to quickly deliver a new series of breakthroughs in 2017 as we advance our seismic-based characterization and second phase of geoscience analytics.
On the cost structure front, we continue to lower our capital and operating cost structure through [ph] faster drilling, leveraging engineering innovation and integrated planning to optimize execution and logistics. We expect these efforts, when combined in our field development plans, will ensure Oxy as a leader in realizing maximum value per acre by optimizing recovery and capitalization.
Our unconventional business is well positioned to provide a competitive return in a low-cost environment and achieve significant growth in an improved price environment. As a result, during the third quarter, we added a drilling rig in Permian Resources plus another at the beginning of the fourth quarter and have capacity and locations on standby to respond to improved pricing in 2017.
Turning to the performance of Permian Resources. In the third quarter, we achieved daily production of 121,000 BOE per day, a 4% increase versus the prior year. Oil production declined modestly due to lower capital spending with 9 wells put online versus 54 wells in the third quarter of 2015. Improved well productivity and our emphasis on base management mitigated some of the base decline on the horizontal wells.
In the second and third quarters, we completed gas processing and compression facilities allowing for the capture and sales of more gas and NGLs.
As we announced yesterday, we acquired producing properties and nonproducing leasehold acreage in the Permian. In Permian Resources, we acquired 35,000 net acres in Southern Reeves [ph] and Pecos counties, where we currently operate and have working interest. The properties will include approximately 7,000 BOE per day of net production with 72% oil from 68 horizontal wells. On key portions of the acreage, we gained operatorship, where we had existing non-operated [ph] interest, and most of the acreage is already held by production. 
Development will initially target the Wolfcamp A, Wolfcamp B and Bone Spring. Simply put, we know the acreage very well. It's very competitive with our accessing inventory. 
We expect to drill longer laterals, execute multi-bench development [ph] and leverage our existing infrastructure in the area, notably the joint venture gas processing plant completed this summer. 
This transaction brings our overall position in the leasehold area to 59,000 net acres with an aggregate acquisition cost under $2 billion. We plan on allocating approximately $200 million in capital in 2017 to the acquired acreage, utilizing 1 to 2 drilling rigs.
Turning to our activities in our core development areas. Much of the focus of the drilling program in the second and third quarters was to appraise a potential for multi-bench development [ph] in Southern Reeves, Eddy, Howard, Glasscock and Northern Reagan County. In Southeast New Mexico, we drilled and completed 2 Cedar Canyon third Bone Spring wells and 1 Cedar Canyon Wolfcamp A well in Eddy County. All of the wells had 30-day peak IPs over 1,000 BOE per day -- excuse me, 1,000 BOE per -- 1,000 BO per day.
In Southern Reeves County, we brought the Roan State 24 51H second Bone Spring well online at a peak rate of 944 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 702 BOE per day at a 90% oil cut. The well had a 4,500-foot lateral and increases our confidence in the potential for multi-bench development for our acreage in the area. We're on the learning curve in developing this bench and expect well productivity to improve as we apply our experience in drilling and completion technology and further integrate our subsurface analysis.
In Glasscock County, we brought the appraisal well, Powell 1720 1H online with a 7,500-foot lateral, which targeted the Spraberry formation with a 30-day rate of 931 BOE per day.
As cited last quarter, we now compare and benchmark our well costs on a cost per thousand feet of lateral basis as we continue to increase our lateral lengths.
Slide 23 illustrates our demonstrated improvement in well cost, which has declined roughly 38% from 2015. Similarly, our 1,000-foot of lateral per rig per quarter has also improved from 25.2 per rig in 2015 to 35.4 per rig in the third quarter. We believe that a significant percentage of these improvements and efficiency are driven by structural changes in how we drill and complete wells and expect to continue to improve these efficiencies as we add drilling rigs.
In the Delaware Basin, we're aggressively appraising new benches while maintaining focus on improving well recoveries in our development benches.
In Southeast New Mexico, we tested a new second Bone Spring slickwater frac design on the Cedar Canyon 27 Fed 5H with 2,000 pounds per foot and 50-foot cluster spacing. The cumulative production results from the new design have exceeded the first half 2016 design, and we expect to see continued improvement in future results.
We're targeting an average well cost of $7.1 million for the second Bone Spring and 3 -- [ph] $8.3 million for the third Bone Spring with 7,500-foot laterals on [ph] the increased completion size. 
Overall, we're very encouraged by the development and appraisal results in Southeast New Mexico, and we expect to increase activity in Q4 and throughout 2017.
In the Texas-Delaware, we drilled 1 well and turned 1 appraisal well to production. The reduction in activity in the area is consistent with the overall balance of activity shift between Texas and New Mexico, and we plan to increase activity in this area in the fourth quarter. Our upcoming wells in the fourth quarter will test new completion designs and drilling technology that we believe will drive step change [ph] value addition across all of our development areas. We expect to increase our average lateral length from approximately 5,200 feet in 2016 to over 9,000 feet in 2017.
Shifting our results to the East Midland Basin. In the third quarter, we drilled 8 wells, brought 4 wells online, 3 of which have not reached peak production rates. We had multiple record drilling and completion achievements during the quarter. For example, we drilled a Wolfcamp B 7,500-foot lateral in 12.5 days rig release to rig release. We completed 10 frac stages in 1 day, and we drilled and completed 2 Wolfcamp A horizontals for $4.6 million and $4.9 million. Well productivity, measured by the initial production rates per 1,000 foot [ph] of lateral, continues to improve.
In the Permian Resources as a whole, we achieved another quarter of lower quarter-over-quarter field operating expenses, due mainly to improved surface operations with optimized water handling, lower workover expenses and better downhole performance. Since the second quarter of 2015, we reduced our operating cost per barrel by 28%, [ph] continue to work additional cost reduction and efficiency improvements.
As stated earlier, our focus on maximizing production from existing wells has been central to reducing declines in the business. We expect that our annual average uplift for investment will be approximately 6,000 net BOE per day. This is another example of leveraging our decades of base management expertise in the EOR business to our resources business.
As previously stated, we expect to increase our drilling activity in the fourth quarter of 2016 and bring on approximately 20 wells. We expect production to be about 120,000 BOE per day in the fourth quarter and be growing as we exit the year. With over 115 wells planned for 2017, we expect to achieve double-digit production growth in Permian Resources. 
In addition to the recent acreage acquisition, we've been actively trading and swapping acreage in order to core up our position. We've traded approximately 10,000 acres, which will enable longer lateral development. So for 2017, we expect to drill more wells with more than double the total lateral lengths drilled in 2016.
Now I'd like to shift to our Permian EOR business. We continue to take advantage of lower drilling costs and manage the operations to run our gas processing facilities at full capacity. Permian EOR had another quarter of free cash flow generation. Drilling costs are running 22% below our benchmark target, and we've lowered our cash operating expenses by 20% since the fourth quarter of 2014 and 7% year-over-year, driven mainly by lower downhole maintenance and inject in costs.
In similar fashion to our resources business, the capital savings achieved by the EOR team will be reinvested into additional wells and CO2 flood expansions. As we've mentioned in previous calls, the residual oil zone development, or ROS, is a vertical interaction of the CO2 flooded interval. The ROS lies -- underlines most of our major EOR for properties and can developed between $3 and $7 per barrel. Year-to-date, we've completed 94 well deepenings and recompletions along with 36 wells -- new wells in the ROS developments. We anticipate an additional 50 deepenings and recompletions and 10 new wells in ROS developments in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Yesterday, we announced acquisitions of working interest in 11 producing oil and gas properties and related infrastructure. The acquisition increases our ownership in several properties where we currently operate or an existing working interest partner. These properties have production of approximately 4,000 barrels of equivalent per day at 80% oil with estimated net proved developed producing reserves of approximately 25 million BOE and total proved reserves of approximately 41 million BOE.
To summarize, our domestic business will provide competitive returns in a low-cost environment and achieve significant growth in an improved price environment. We believe our Permian business is uniquely positioned to leverage our subsurface innovation in unconventional and leadership in enhanced oil recovery to maximize the value per acre across our entire 2.4 million acre portfolio.
We plan to exit this year running 8 drilling rigs on our operated acreage, plus another 1.5 to 2 net rigs on our nonoperative development acreage. We're pleased with the strides our teams have made in subservice characterization, execution and performance thus far in 2016 and look forward to continuing breakthroughs in 2017.
Thank you, and I'll now hand it back to Chris Degner."

So what we view this to have done is in the greater Barilla Draw area, what it's done for us is just -- in addition to the 59,000 associated with the acquisition, we have in that general area around 100,000 acres. So that gives us a really sizable the session that's bigger than most positions. That's why this was an important to us. It was a special case because as you've noticed, we haven't really acquired anything in the last couple of years and this is the reason. We're looking for those things that provide us the unique opportunity to do something that's -- what we consider to be really a step change in a given area. Looking at the rest of our acreage, we're spending quite a bit of time and effort to appraise the rest of what we have and to rank it in terms of development. So now we feel very comfortable with the greater Barilla Draw area. Southeast New Mexico is in prime position for aggressive development. And we have some areas in the Midland Basin as well.

But in general, it is tighter cluster spacing and higher sand concentrations and then doing trials to understand where you kind of hit diminishing returns. But in general, more sand tighter cluster spacing is generating better results. But combining that with longer laterals has really been the key for us. And as you look at the numbers I talked about on extending lateral length, that's another real benefit for us. In New Mexico, this year, we'll average around 5,000-foot laterals. We'll go almost to 7,000 next year. In the Texas Delaware, a little over 5,000-foot laterals. Next year, it'll be closer -- and this is effective lateral length, over 9,000 feet. And in East Midland Basin, we probably average around 7,800-foot laterals in '16 and then '17, that will be over 9,000 feet. So the combination of extended lateral giving us really better EURs, better declined profiles, combined with this continued integration of our geoscience with the stimulation design. The drilling technology piece is something that we'll talk a little bit more about in future quarters, but it's really an innovative way to access multiple benches.

I'll begin by summarizing our key accomplishments in the third quarter. First, cost reduction efficiencies, combined with improvement in new well productivity and better base management, have enabled us to further reduce our total spend per barrel of production this year compared to 2015.
Second, we again increased year-over-year production in our core areas, and we're on target to exceed the higher end of our guidance for 2016.
Third, we remain prudent with our capital allocation as we focused on returns and maintained discipline to stay within our $3 billion capital budget. 
Fourth, to further increase our low-decline production and improve efficiencies, we have acquired additional working interests in enhanced oil recovery projects and unconventional acreage in the Permian. 
Last, our aggressive appraisal and development efforts in our Permian Resources business have resulted in an improvement in the number and quality of wells in our inventory.
As I've previously mentioned, our total spend per barrel of production metric includes our overhead, operating and capital cost per barrel of production. This metric is designed to drive cost reductions, increase well productivity and optimize base production. To align employees with this metric, we have linked this to incentive compensation.
Our efforts to focus on efficiency and capital discipline are paying off as we continue to lower our total spend per barrel of production. We averaged close to 62 barrels (sic) [ $62 per barrel ] in 2014, about $40 per barrel in 2015 and have targeted $28.50 per barrel in 2016. Year-to-date, we have beaten our target with average total spend of about $27.50 per barrel.
In the third quarter, total company production from our ongoing operations was about 605,000 BOE per day, an increase of 5% year-over-year, driven by Al Hosn Gas in Abu Dhabi, a new gas project in Oman and resilient base production in Permian Resources.
The performance of the Al Hosn team continues to exceed our expectations as they optimize deliverability. They have again achieved a record production of 74,000 BOE per day for the quarter. It's even more impressive that the plant operated well during the summer months where temperatures can reach 120 degrees. We're optimistic that the plant can continue to deliver from 65,000 BOE per day to 75,000 BOE per day depending on seasonal maintenance. We have commenced engineering studies for a potential expansion of the plant and expect to reach an investment decision in the second half of 2017.
Permian Resources production this quarter was 121,000 BOE per day, representing year-over-year growth of 4%. As per our original development plan, Permian Resources production will decline slightly in the fourth quarter. We are adding rigs now to stabilize production and reach our growth in early 2017. We continue to see improvements in well productivity in all of our areas.
The increases in production from Al Hosn, Oman's Block 62, along with strong year-over-year production growth from Permian Resources, will help us exceed the higher end of our production growth guidance for 2016. As we look forward to 2017, we expect to deliver 5% to 8% production growth with a variance subject to our activity levels in the Permian. Longer term, we have a deep inventory of well locations in the Permian with the capabilities to drive production growth above this range. 
Additionally, we have focused our international business on the core 4 areas: Abu Dhabi, Qatar, Oman and Colombia, where we have a track record of operational success, free cash flow generation and strong financial returns as well as growth opportunities that could drive the capabilities to drive production growth higher than our long-term 5% to 8% target. I have emphasized to our partners in those areas that the returns on any new projects or capital investments must compete with the Permian Basin.
I'm pleased to announce that we have formally completed the exit of our contracts in Bahrain and Iraq. We have no meaningful liabilities related to those contracts nor will we incur any material spending on capital or overhead to manage those terminated contracts. We've also made solid progress toward a formal exit from our contracts in Libya.
Our capital spending in the third quarter declined slightly as we maintained our drilling program in the Permian and shifted timing on spending for certain midstream and chemicals projects. The Permian drilling program is consistent with plans we put in place at the beginning of this year and with our strategy to remain relatively conservative in this price environment. Continued improvements in project design and capital executions have helped us do more than expected with our $3 billion capital budget. These, along with improved production performance in many of our areas, are the reasons we will achieve the upper end of our production guidance for the year.
The construction of the OxyChem joint venture ethylene cracker at Ingleside is on budget and on schedule. We have targeted to finish the commissioning of the plant by mid-January and expect ethylene production in the first quarter of 2017. 
In addition, the crude oil export terminal at Ingleside has started operations and successfully loaded and dispatched 3 ships. The terminal has oil storage capacity of 2 million barrels and throughput capacity of approximately 300,000 barrels of oil per day. The export facility will have the flexibility to take various gravities of crude oil to both domestic and foreign markets.
As the production from the Permian Basin grows in coming years, we would expect to increase demand for access to multiple markets. The ship channel in Corpus Christi has clear advantages to Houston and should allow for shorter transportation times to market.
With the completion of long-term projects in both our chemical and midstream segments, we expect to have increased flexibility with our capital program in 2017. As we enter the fourth quarter, we have increased our activity in the Permian to prepare the business for growth in 2017. While we plan to release a more detailed budget early next year, at this point, it's our expectation that capital will increase modestly from a little under $3 billion in 2016 to a range of $3.3 billion to $3.8 billion in 2017. The progress this year of multiyear committed capital will allow for more of our 2017 capital to be devoted to upstream oil and gas development.
Our program in the Permian Resources business will receive the largest increase in capital. And due to the shorter cycle nature of the asset base, it can be adjusted depending on the extent of commodity price recovery.
As we announced yesterday, we have made several strategic acquisitions of producing properties and nonproducing leasehold in the Permian. As we have said previously, we already have a very large inventory in our resources business. The main reason to acquire additional acreage is to improve the value of the inventory we currently have. The selection criteria we used to evaluate our acquisition opportunities are: the proximity of the acreage to our existing infrastructure; the quality of the subsurface reservoirs, and in most cases, we need to have multi-bench development potential; and the ability to optimize recovery per well by drilling longer laterals.
The acquisition we just made met all of these objectives, with the added bonus that we already had a working interest in the properties, making the overall acreage investment lower than current market. In fact, all of the assets we just purchased in both resources and EOR are in fields where we currently operate or own a working interest.
The resources acquisition is in the Texas-Delaware Basin. Increasing our working interest enabled us to become operator of this area, which we believe to be among the most prospective areas in the Permian. Current production is 7,000 BOE per day. The acreage is mostly contiguous, which will enable us to drill longer laterals. It has high oil content and at least 5 prospective benches, 3 of which have a high level of certainty and 2 that are currently being appraised. The properties also have infrastructure that fits well with the infrastructure and takeaway capacity that we already have built in the area.
Including our previous acquisitions, our aggregate investment in this area totals $2 billion and increases our working interest in 59,000 acres. The $2 billion includes a cost of $100 million for the infrastructure on the acquired acreage. From an operating standpoint, this area will become part of what we will call the greater Barilla Draw development. This enables us to utilize and control shared infrastructure to reduce development capital and operating costs, thus increasing our margins as we grow our production.
We will leverage this infrastructure, along with our knowledge of the subsurface, to drive improved financial returns and production growth. We expect to add a rig or 2 to the acreage early next year to accelerate the development of the resource.
As with the resources acquisition, we also acquired additional working interest in enhanced oil recovery projects in Permian, mostly in areas that we operate. This acquisition provides low-decline net production of 4,000 BOE per day and has additional development upside.
Going forward, we will continue to actively evaluate our acquisition opportunities. Due to the nature of its ownership base and long history of production, ownership throughout the Permian is fragmented. We will target bolt-on opportunities with the clear strategic synergies I previously listed to leverage both our understanding of the subsurface geology and our existing midstream and infrastructure investments. Our approach will be disciplined. We'll also continue to actively swap and trade small blocks of acreage. Year-to-date, we have swapped approximately 10,000 acres through many small negotiated transactions. These trades will enable longer lateral development and improve returns without material capital outlay.
As we have continued to appraise and develop our own acreage in the Permian Resources business, we have seen steady improvement in well productivity and a reduction in our drilling and completion costs. Improved logistical capabilities and integrated planning will ensure the majority of these cost savings are sustainable. Through efforts to core up our acreage to drill longer laterals, we have lowered the breakeven cost on our inventory. Simply put, we can deliver more production with fewer wells.
We expect to provide updated disclosure of our inventory and breakeven prices in early 2017 once we have fully integrated recent appraisal efforts and the acquisitions.
I'm pleased with our progress to date. We had exceeded our production targets for the year with less capital than we have planned to spend, and we have positioned the company for continued profitable production and cash flow growth as we enter 2017. Directionally, we are planning for modestly higher oil prices in 2017, and we'll set our budget accordingly.
I'll now turn the call over to Chris Stavros."

Today, I'll focus on the following items: our third quarter segment and overall financial results; Oxy's balance sheet strength, liquidity and cash flow in the context of the Permian acquisitions we just announce",1765,"Thanks, Vicki, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll focus on the following items: our third quarter segment and overall financial results; Oxy's balance sheet strength, liquidity and cash flow in the context of the Permian acquisitions we just announced; and oil and gas production and segment guidance for the fourth quarter.
Third quarter 2016 reported financial results for GAAP purposes were a loss of $0.32 per diluted share compared to a loss of $0.18 a share in this year's second quarter. Our third quarter reported results included a net after-tax charge of $129 million related to nonrecurring items in both the oil and gas and midstream segments. Our core financial results for the third quarter of 2016 were a loss of $112 million or $0.15 per diluted share, a slight improvement from a loss of $136 million or $0.18 a share during the second quarter. Importantly, each of our operating segments generated improved quarter-to-quarter core financial results despite the continued challenging conditions for product prices.
Oil and gas pretax core results for the third quarter of 2016 were a loss of $49 million compared to a loss of $117 million in the second quarter, an income of $162 million in the same year-ago period. The sequential improvement of $68 million was primarily a result of higher product price realizations.
During the third quarter, the oil and gas segment recorded a noncore net charges related to the exit from both Libya and Iraq of $61 million and a $38 million after-tax gain on the sale of some noncore, non-operated oil and gas properties in South Texas.
Third quarter total company production volumes of 605,000 BOE per day were at the high end of our previous guidance range, with better-than-expected production results coming from Permian Resources, improved performance at Al Hosn in the UAE and production growth in Oman from Block 62.
Total domestic production was 294,000 BOE per day during the third quarter, down sequentially from 302,000 BOE per day in the second quarter. Despite the overall decline in domestic volumes, production in Permian Resources of 121,000 BOE per day exceeded our earlier guidance by 5,000 BOE per day, largely due to better management around our base production. The sequential decline in third quarter domestic volumes is also partially due to a drop in production from the absence of gas-directed drilling activity in South Texas.
Our domestic oil and gas operations generated $67 million of free cash flow after capital during the third quarter. In a moment, Jody Elliott will discuss our plans for increased drilling activity in Permian Resources for the fourth quarter and as we exit the year.
International production from our ongoing operations was 311,000 BOE per day during the third quarter of 2016, an increase of 4,000 BOE per day compared to the second quarter. Higher volumes from Al Hosn and Oman contributed to the overall sequential increase, partially offset by a decline in Colombia as a result of pipeline disruptions. The international oil and gas operations comprised of our core 4 areas generated nearly $300 million of free cash flow after capital during the third quarter.
Domestic oil and gas cash operating costs of $12.26 per BOE in the third quarter of 2016 were slightly higher on a sequential basis; however, declined by 7% compared to the full year 2015 cost of $13.13 per BOE.
9-month year-to-date costs are down nearly 10% compared with full year 2015, with the decline mainly the result of improved efficiencies and logistics management around our surface operations, including water handling, as well as lower downhole maintenance and energy-related costs. 
Cash operating costs in Permian Resources saw a further sequential decline in the third quarter and, for the year-to-date, have fallen to $8.43 per BOE, an improvement of 25% compared to 2015 full year costs. 
Overall, oil and gas DD&A for the third quarter of 2016 was $15.58 per BOE compared to $15.81 per BOE during 2015.
Taxes other than on income were $0.97 per BOE for the third quarter of 2016 compared to $1.32 per BOE during 2015. The third quarter exploration expense was $9 million.
Chemical's third quarter 2016 pretax core earnings were $117 million compared with second quarter earnings of $88 million. The sequential quarterly increase in core earnings resulted from higher chloro-vinyls production volumes and higher realized caustic soda prices. These improvements were partially offset by higher energy costs, combined with lower vinyls margins. Vinyl prices remained largely unchanged despite significantly higher ethylene prices, resulting from both meaningful planned and unplanned industry ethylene cracker outages. Our chemicals business generated $100 million of free cash flow before working capital during the third quarter.
Midstream pretax core results were a loss of $20 million for the third quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $58 million in the second quarter. Despite the loss, the results came in at the positive range of our previous guidance, with the sequential improvement resulting from better oil and gas marketing margins.
During the third quarter, we renegotiated some of our crude oil supply contracts, which resulted in an after-tax charge of $103 million. The new agreement should mitigate some of the transportation costs and improve overall profitability going forward.
Turning to our cash flows for the third quarter. We generated $860 million of cash flow from continuing operations before working capital and other changes and adjusted for a onetime payment for the renegotiation of a crude oil supply contract as well as some tax-related items.
Net working capital changes provided $50 million of cash during the period. We expect that this trend on working capital will continue as we exit the year at a slightly higher run rate for capital expenditures compared to the current pace of spending and activity.
Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $642 million, bringing our total year-to-date capital spending to approximately $2 billion. As Vicki mentioned, our capital spending in the fourth quarter is expected to increase modestly as certain project-related expenditures in both chemicals and midstream had been deferred into the latter part of the year. In addition, we plan to recycle some of the efficiencies and savings generated around drilling and completions back into our Permian Resources drilling program, in addition to pursuing some project opportunities in Colombia.
Despite the higher planned capital spending during the fourth quarter, our total -- 2016 total capital program is expected to come in slightly under our original budget of $3 billion. We paid $575 million in dividends during the third quarter and ended the period with $3.2 billion of cash.
As Vicki mentioned, yesterday, we announced several acquisitions of producing properties and nonproducing leasehold acreage in the Permian as well as interests in several enhanced oil recovery and CO2 properties and related infrastructure. These acquisitions were funded with existing cash on hand and without the use of any equity. The transactions are immediately accretive to cash flow and at current commodity prices.
Although our view on product prices remains relatively conservative into next year, we believe we have the balance sheet flexibility to allow us to cover a modest increase in our capital program, which we expect to deliver production growth of 5% to 8% in 2017.
Assuming oil prices of approximately $50 per barrel, we expect to generate cash flow from operations of at least $4.5 billion in 2017. Incremental cash flow contributions would include $150 million from the start-up of a joint venture ethylene cracker; approximately $200 million from improving results with the midstream segment, which would include the Ingleside crude oil terminal; and at least $100 million from the announced Permian acquisitions. In addition, every $1 per barrel improvement in oil prices would provide a further $100 million of operating cash flow.
With respect to guidance and as Vicki mentioned, we now expect our full year 2016 production growth from ongoing operations to be approximately 7% and exceeding the high end of our previous 4% to 6% range. We expect our company-wide production volumes to be in the range of 600,000 to 610,000 BOE per day during the fourth quarter. We anticipate our overall domestic production to be in the range of 290,000 to 295,000 BOE per day, which includes a partial contribution from the Permian acquisitions during the quarter. Permian Resources production is expected to be roughly flat with volumes seen during the third quarter, with full year 2016 growth estimated to be about 12%. International production is estimated to be in the range of 310,000 to 315,000 BOE per day during the fourth quarter. This incorporates the impact of a planned maintenance turnaround at Al Hosn and assumes normal operations in Colombia.
Our plan is to remain disciplined with our capital within the current price environment and to recycle some of the efficiency and productivity gains realized this year into greater activity during the fourth quarter and early next year. We expect this additional activity to help support our Permian Resources production as we exit this year and provide a platform for growth into 2017. Jody will share some of those specifics during his prepared remarks.
In the midstream segment, we expect the fourth quarter to generate a pretax loss of between $20 million and $40 million. While quarter-to-quarter changes are inherently volatile in this segment, we anticipate favorable spreads for our West Texas to Gulf shipments to continue, higher domestic pipeline earnings as well as increased flow of crude to our Ingleside crude terminal, in anticipation of full operations beginning early in 2017.
In chemicals, we anticipate pretax earnings of about $100 million for the fourth quarter or roughly flat with the third quarter. Our DD&A expense for oil and gas is expected to be approximately $15.50 per BOE during 2016, and depreciation for the oil and gas segment is expected to exceed this year's capital investment by more than $1.4 billion.
The combined depreciation for the chemical and midstream segments should be approximately $655 million. Exploration expense is estimated to be about $25 million pretax during the fourth quarter. Price changes at current global prices affect our annual operating cash flow by about $100 million for every dollar per barrel per change in WTI, and a swing of $0.50 per million BTUs in domestic natural gas prices affects our annual operating cash flow by about $45 million.
Using current strip prices for oil and gas, we expect our full year 2016 domestic tax rate to be about 36%. Our international tax rate should be about 55%.
I'll now turn the call over to Jody Elliott, who'll provide an update on activity around our Permian operations."
293286,404979780,1068528,"Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Occidental Petroleum Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Chris. Today, I will provide a review of our domestic operations during the third quarter, guidance on our program in the fourth quarter and an outlook for the start of 2017. For this year, our Permian Resources business achieved significant",1759,"Thank you, Chris. Today, I will provide a review of our domestic operations during the third quarter, guidance on our program in the fourth quarter and an outlook for the start of 2017. 
For this year, our Permian Resources business achieved significant improvement in well economics across our Permian-leading acreage position through step-change advancements and well productivity and field development design. We believe this improvement in value starts with our subsurface characterization where we are leveraging our geology, petrophysics and geochemistry expertise to achieve breakthroughs in our multi-bench appraisal, stimulation and other key subsurface design factors. We expect to quickly deliver a new series of breakthroughs in 2017 as we advance our seismic-based characterization and second phase of geoscience analytics.
On the cost structure front, we continue to lower our capital and operating cost structure through faster drilling, leveraging engineering innovation and integrated planning to optimize execution and logistics. We expect these efforts, when combined in our field development plans, will ensure Oxy as a leader in realizing maximum value per acre by optimizing recovery and capitalization.
Our unconventional business is well positioned to provide a competitive return in a low-cost environment and achieve significant growth in an improved price environment. As a result, during the third quarter, we added a drilling rig in Permian Resources plus another at the beginning of the fourth quarter and have capacity and locations on standby to respond to improved pricing in 2017.
Turning to the performance of Permian Resources. In the third quarter, we achieved daily production of 121,000 BOE per day, a 4% increase versus the prior year. Oil production declined modestly due to lower capital spending with 9 wells put online versus 54 wells in the third quarter of 2015. Improved well productivity and our emphasis on base management mitigated some of the base decline on the horizontal wells.
In the second and third quarters, we completed gas processing and compression facilities allowing for the capture and sales of more gas and NGLs.
As we announced yesterday, we acquired producing properties and nonproducing leasehold acreage in the Permian. In Permian Resources, we acquired 35,000 net acres in Southern Reeves and Pecos counties, where we currently operate and have working interest. The properties will include approximately 7,000 BOE per day of net production with 72% oil from 68 horizontal wells. On key portions of the acreage, we gained operatorship, where we had existing non-operated interest, and most of the acreage is already held by production. 
Development will initially target the Wolfcamp A, Wolfcamp B and Bone Spring. Simply put, we know the acreage very well. It's very competitive with our accessing inventory. 
We expect to drill longer laterals, execute multi-bench development and leverage our existing infrastructure in the area, notably the joint venture gas processing plant completed this summer. 
This transaction brings our overall position in the leasehold area to 59,000 net acres with an aggregate acquisition cost under $2 billion. We plan on allocating approximately $200 million in capital in 2017 to the acquired acreage, utilizing 1 to 2 drilling rigs.
Turning to our activities in our core development areas. Much of the focus of the drilling program in the second and third quarters was to appraise a potential for multi-bench development in Southern Reeves, Eddy, Howard, Glasscock and Northern Reagan County. In Southeast New Mexico, we drilled and completed 2 Cedar Canyon third Bone Spring wells and 1 Cedar Canyon Wolfcamp A well in Eddy County. All of the wells had 30-day peak IPs over 1,000 BOE per day -- excuse me, 1,000 BOE per -- 1,000 BO per day.
In Southern Reeves County, we brought the Roan State 24 51H second Bone Spring well online at a peak rate of 944 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 702 BOE per day at a 90% oil cut. The well had a 4,500-foot lateral and increases our confidence in the potential for multi-bench development for our acreage in the area. We're on the learning curve in developing this bench and expect well productivity to improve as we apply our experience in drilling and completion technology and further integrate our subsurface analysis.
In Glasscock County, we brought the appraisal well, Powell 1720 1H online with a 7,500-foot lateral, which targeted the Spraberry formation with a 30-day rate of 931 BOE per day.
As cited last quarter, we now compare and benchmark our well costs on a cost per thousand feet of lateral basis as we continue to increase our lateral lengths.
Slide 23 illustrates our demonstrated improvement in well cost, which has declined roughly 38% from 2015. Similarly, our 1,000-foot of lateral per rig per quarter has also improved from 25.2 per rig in 2015 to 35.4 per rig in the third quarter. We believe that a significant percentage of these improvements and efficiency are driven by structural changes in how we drill and complete wells and expect to continue to improve these efficiencies as we add drilling rigs.
In the Delaware Basin, we're aggressively appraising new benches while maintaining focus on improving well recoveries in our development benches.
In Southeast New Mexico, we tested a new second Bone Spring slickwater frac design on the Cedar Canyon 27 Fed 5H with 2,000 pounds per foot and 50-foot cluster spacing. The cumulative production results from the new design have exceeded the first half 2016 design, and we expect to see continued improvement in future results.
We're targeting an average well cost of $7.1 million for the second Bone Spring and 3 -- $8.3 million for the third Bone Spring with 7,500-foot laterals on the increased completion size. 
Overall, we're very encouraged by the development and appraisal results in Southeast New Mexico, and we expect to increase activity in Q4 and throughout 2017.
In the Texas-Delaware, we drilled 1 well and turned 1 appraisal well to production. The reduction in activity in the area is consistent with the overall balance of activity shift between Texas and New Mexico, and we plan to increase activity in this area in the fourth quarter. Our upcoming wells in the fourth quarter will test new completion designs and drilling technology that we believe will drive step-change value addition across all of our development areas. We expect to increase our average lateral length from approximately 5,200 feet in 2016 to over 9,000 feet in 2017.
Shifting our results to the East Midland Basin. In the third quarter, we drilled 8 wells, brought 4 wells online, 3 of which have not reached peak production rates. We had multiple record drilling and completion achievements during the quarter. For example, we drilled a Wolfcamp B 7,500-foot lateral in 12.5 days rig release to rig release. We completed 10 frac stages in 1 day, and we drilled and completed 2 Wolfcamp A horizontals for $4.6 million and $4.9 million. Well productivity, measured by the initial production rates per 1,000 foot of lateral, continues to improve.
In the Permian Resources as a whole, we achieved another quarter of lower quarter-over-quarter field operating expenses, due mainly to improved surface operations with optimized water handling, lower workover expenses and better downhole performance. Since the second quarter of 2015, we reduced our operating cost per barrel by 28%, continue to work additional cost reduction and efficiency improvements.
As stated earlier, our focus on maximizing production from existing wells has been central to reducing declines in the business. We expect that our annual average uplift for investment will be approximately 6,000 net BOE per day. This is another example of leveraging our decades of base management expertise in the EOR business to our resources business.
As previously stated, we expect to increase our drilling activity in the fourth quarter of 2016 and bring on approximately 20 wells. We expect production to be about 120,000 BOE per day in the fourth quarter and be growing as we exit the year. With over 115 wells planned for 2017, we expect to achieve double-digit production growth in Permian Resources. 
In addition to the recent acreage acquisition, we've been actively trading and swapping acreage in order to core up our position. We've traded approximately 10,000 acres which will enable longer lateral development. So for 2017, we expect to drill more wells with more than double the total lateral lengths drilled in 2016.
Now I'd like to shift to our Permian EOR business. We continue to take advantage of lower drilling costs and manage the operations to run our gas processing facilities at full capacity. Permian EOR had another quarter of free cash flow generation. Drilling costs are running 22% below our benchmark target, and we've lowered our cash operating expenses by 20% since the fourth quarter of 2014 and 7% year-over-year, driven mainly by lower downhole maintenance and injector [ph] costs.
In similar fashion to our resources business, the capital savings achieved by the EOR team will be reinvested into additional wells and CO2 flood expansions. As we've mentioned in previous calls, the Residual Oil Zone development, or ROZ, is a vertical expansion of the CO2 flooded integral. The ROZ lies -- underlines most of our major EOR properties and can developed between $3 and $7 per barrel. Year-to-date, we have completed 94 well deepenings and recompletions, along with 36 wells -- new wells in the ROZ developments. We anticipate an additional 50 deepenings and recompletions and 10 new wells in ROZ developments in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Yesterday, we announced acquisitions of working interest in 11 producing oil and gas properties and related infrastructure. The acquisition increases our ownership in several properties where we currently operate or in existing working interest partner. These properties have production of approximately 4,000 barrels of equivalent per day at 80% oil with estimated net proved developed producing reserves of approximately 25 million BOE and total proved reserves of approximately 41 million BOE.
To summarize, our domestic business will provide competitive returns in a low cost environment and achieve significant growth in an improved price environment. We believe our Permian business is uniquely positioned to leverage our subsurface innovation in unconventional and leadership in enhanced oil recovery to maximize the value per acre across our entire 2.4-million-acre portfolio.
We plan to exit this year running 8 drilling rigs on our operated acreage plus another 1.5 to 2 net rigs on our non-operated development acreage. We're pleased with the strides our teams have made in subsurface characterization, execution and performance thus far in 2016 and look forward to continuing breakthroughs in 2017.
Thank you, and I'll now hand it back to Chris Degner."

The 5 benches, the shared infrastructure and the operational efficiencies that we'll gain by combining these 2 areas and becoming operator of it where we can manage the development to maximize the net present value, we believe, was the best use of our cash at this point.

But should the need arise, we would expect to monetize some noncore, nonstrategic assets that would more than, we believe, cover our needs, and when including our expectations for next year's cash from operations. So I don't anticipate or expect us to fall short or have any issue with that. We've got multiple levers that we can pull on in terms of filling any gap, certainly to the extent that you just did, the arithmetic around and more, should need be.

But in general, it is tighter cluster spacing and higher sand concentrations and then doing trials to understand where you've kind of hit diminishing returns. But in general, more sand, tighter cluster spacing is generating better results. But combining that with longer laterals has really been the key for us. And as you look at the numbers I talked about on extending lateral length, that's another real benefit for us. In New Mexico, this year, we'll average around 5,000-foot laterals. We'll go almost to 7,000 next year. In the Texas-Delaware, a little over 5,000-foot laterals. Next year, it'll be closer -- and this is effective lateral length -- over 9,000 feet. And in East Midland Basin, we probably average -- we'll average around 7,800-foot laterals in '16. And then in '17, that will be over 9,000 feet. So the combination of extended lateral giving us really better EURs, better declined profiles, combined with this continued integration of our geoscience with stimulation design. The drilling technology piece is something that we'll talk a little bit more about in future quarters, but it's really an innovative way to access multiple benches and again, leveraging your infrastructure across -- again, multiple benches with minimizing your facility cost."

I'll begin by summarizing our key accomplishments in the third quarter. First, cost reduction efficiencies, combined with improvement in new well productivity and better base management, have enabled us to further reduce our total spend per barrel of production this year compared to 2015.
Second, we again increased year-over-year production in our core areas, and we're on target to exceed the higher end of our guidance for 2016.
Third, we remain prudent with our capital allocation as we focused on returns and maintained discipline to stay within our $3 billion capital budget. 
Fourth, to further increase our low-decline production and improve efficiencies, we have acquired additional working interests in enhanced oil recovery projects and unconventional acreage in the Permian. 
Last, our aggressive appraisal and development efforts in our Permian Resources business have resulted in an improvement in the number and quality of wells in our inventory.
As I've previously mentioned, our total spend per barrel of production metric includes our overhead, operating and capital cost per barrel of production. This metric is designed to drive cost reductions, increase well productivity and optimize base production. To align employees with this metric, we have linked this to incentive compensation.
Our efforts to focus on efficiency and capital discipline are paying off as we continue to lower our total spend per barrel of production. We averaged close to 62 barrels (sic) [ $62 per barrel ] in 2014, about $40 per barrel in 2015 and have targeted $28.50 per barrel in 2016. Year-to-date, we have beaten our target with average total spend of about $27.50 per barrel.
In the third quarter, total company production from our ongoing operations was about 605,000 BOE per day, an increase of 5% year-over-year, driven by Al Hosn Gas in Abu Dhabi, a new gas project in Oman and resilient base production in Permian Resources.
The performance of the Al Hosn team continues to exceed our expectations as they optimize deliverability. They have again achieved a record production of 74,000 BOE per day for the quarter. It's even more impressive that the plant operated well during the summer months where temperatures can reach 120 degrees. We're optimistic that the plant can continue to deliver from 65,000 BOE per day to 75,000 BOE per day depending on seasonal maintenance. We have commenced engineering studies for a potential expansion of the plant and expect to reach an investment decision in the second half of 2017.
Permian Resources production this quarter was 121,000 BOE per day, representing year-over-year growth of 4%. As per our original development plan, Permian Resources production will decline slightly in the fourth quarter. We are adding rigs now to stabilize production and reach our growth in early 2017. We continue to see improvements in well productivity in all of our areas.
The increases in production from Al Hosn, Oman's Block 62, along with strong year-over-year production growth from Permian Resources, will help us exceed the higher end of our production growth guidance for 2016. As we look forward to 2017, we expect to deliver 5% to 8% production growth with a variance subject to our activity levels in the Permian. Longer term, we have a deep inventory of well locations in the Permian with the capabilities to drive production growth above this range. 
Additionally, we have focused our international business on the core 4 areas: Abu Dhabi, Qatar, Oman and Colombia, where we have a track record of operational success, free cash flow generation and strong financial returns as well as growth opportunities that could drive the capabilities to drive production growth higher than our long-term 5% to 8% target. I have emphasized to our partners in those areas that the returns on any new projects or capital investments must compete with the Permian Basin.
I'm pleased to announce that we have formally completed the exit of our contracts in Bahrain and Iraq. We have no meaningful liabilities related to those contracts nor will we incur any material spending on capital or overhead to manage those terminated contracts. We've also made solid progress toward a formal exit from our contracts in Libya.
Our capital spending in the third quarter declined slightly as we maintained our drilling program in the Permian and shifted timing on spending for certain midstream and chemicals projects. The Permian drilling program is consistent with plans we put in place at the beginning of this year and with our strategy to remain relatively conservative in this price environment. Continued improvements in project design and capital executions have helped us do more than expected with our $3 billion capital budget. These, along with improved production performance in many of our areas, are the reasons we will achieve the upper end of our production guidance for the year.
The construction of the OxyChem joint venture ethylene cracker at Ingleside is on budget and on schedule. We have targeted to finish the commissioning of the plant by mid-January and expect ethylene production in the first quarter of 2017. 
In addition, the crude oil export terminal at Ingleside has started operations and successfully loaded and dispatched 3 ships. The terminal has oil storage capacity of 2 million barrels and throughput capacity of approximately 300,000 barrels of oil per day. The export facility will have the flexibility to take various gravities of crude oil to both domestic and foreign markets.
As the production from the Permian Basin grows in coming years, we would expect to increase demand for access to multiple markets. The ship channel in Corpus Christi has clear advantages to Houston and should allow for shorter transportation times to market.
With the completion of long-term projects in both our chemical and midstream segments, we expect to have increased flexibility with our capital program in 2017. As we enter the fourth quarter, we have increased our activity in the Permian to prepare the business for growth in 2017. While we plan to release a more detailed budget early next year, at this point it's our expectation that capital will increase modestly from a little under $3 billion in 2016 to a range of $3.3 billion to $3.8 billion in 2017. The progress this year of multiyear committed capital will allow for more of our 2017 capital to be devoted to upstream oil and gas development.
Our program in the Permian Resources business will receive the largest increase in capital. And due to the shorter cycle nature of the asset base, it can be adjusted depending on the extent of commodity price recovery.
As we announced yesterday, we have made several strategic acquisitions of producing properties and nonproducing leasehold in the Permian. As we have said previously, we already have a very large inventory in our resources business. The main reason to acquire additional acreage is to improve the value of the inventory we currently have. The selection criteria we use to evaluate our acquisition opportunities are: the proximity of the acreage to our existing infrastructure; the quality of the subsurface reservoirs, and in most cases, we need to have multi-bench development potential; and the ability to optimize recovery per well by drilling longer laterals.
The acquisition we just made met all of these objectives, with the added bonus that we already had a working interest in the properties, making the overall acreage investment lower than current market. In fact, all of the assets we just purchased in both resources and EOR are in fields where we currently operate or own a working interest.
The resources acquisition is in the Texas-Delaware Basin. Increasing our working interest enabled us to become operator of this area, which we believe to be among the most prospective areas in the Permian. Current production is 7,000 BOE per day. The acreage is mostly contiguous, which will enable us to drill longer laterals. It has high oil content and at least 5 prospective benches, 3 of which have a high level of certainty and 2 that are currently being appraised. The properties also have infrastructure that fits well with the infrastructure and takeaway capacity that we already have built in the area.
Including our previous acquisitions, our aggregate investment in this area totals $2 billion and increases our working interest in 59,000 acres. The $2 billion includes a cost of $100 million for the infrastructure on the acquired acreage. From an operating standpoint, this area will become part of what we will call the greater Barilla Draw development. This enables us to utilize and control shared infrastructure to reduce development capital and operating costs, thus increasing our margins as we grow our production.
We will leverage this infrastructure, along with our knowledge of the subsurface, to drive improved financial returns and production growth. We expect to add a rig or 2 to the acreage early next year to accelerate the development of the resource.
As with the resources acquisition, we also acquired additional working interest in enhanced oil recovery projects in Permian, mostly in areas that we operate. This acquisition provides low-decline net production of 4,000 BOE per day and has additional development upside.
Going forward, we will continue to actively evaluate our acquisition opportunities. Due to the nature of its ownership base and long history of production, ownership throughout the Permian is fragmented. We will target bolt-on opportunities with the clear strategic synergies I previously listed to leverage both our understanding of the subsurface geology and our existing midstream and infrastructure investments. Our approach will be disciplined. We'll also continue to actively swap and trade small blocks of acreage. Year-to-date, we have swapped approximately 10,000 acres through many small negotiated transactions. These trades will enable longer lateral development and improved returns without material capital outlay.
As we have continued to appraise and develop our own acreage in the Permian Resources business, we have seen steady improvement in well productivity and a reduction in our drilling and completion costs. Improved logistical capabilities and integrated planning will ensure the majority of these cost savings are sustainable. Through efforts to core up our acreage to drill longer laterals, we have lowered the breakeven cost on our inventory. Simply put, we can deliver more production with fewer wells.
We expect to provide updated disclosure of our inventory and breakeven prices in early 2017 once we have fully integrated recent appraisal efforts and acquisitions.
I'm pleased with our progress to date. We have exceeded our production targets for the year with less capital than we had planned to spend, and we have positioned the company for continued profitable production and cash flow growth as we enter 2017. Directionally, we are planning for modestly higher oil prices in 2017, and we'll set our budget accordingly.
I'll now turn the call over to Chris Stavros."

Today, I'll focus on the following items: our third quarter segment and overall financial results; Oxy's balance sheet strength, liquidity and cash flow in the context of the Permian acquisitions we just announce",1765,"Thanks, Vicki, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll focus on the following items: our third quarter segment and overall financial results; Oxy's balance sheet strength, liquidity and cash flow in the context of the Permian acquisitions we just announced; and oil and gas production and segment guidance for the fourth quarter.
Third quarter 2016 reported financial results for GAAP purposes were a loss of $0.32 per diluted share compared to a loss of $0.18 a share in this year's second quarter. Our third quarter reported results included a net after-tax charge of $129 million related to nonrecurring items in both the oil and gas and midstream segments. Our core financial results for the third quarter of 2016 were a loss of $112 million or $0.15 per diluted share, a slight improvement from a loss of $136 million or $0.18 a share during the second quarter. Importantly, each of our operating segments generated improved quarter-to-quarter core financial results despite the continued challenging conditions for product prices.
Oil and gas pretax core results for the third quarter of 2016 were a loss of $49 million compared to a loss of $117 million in the second quarter, an income of $162 million in the same year-ago period. The sequential improvement of $68 million was primarily a result of higher product price realizations.
During the third quarter, the oil and gas segment recorded a noncore net charges related to the exit from both Libya and Iraq of $61 million and a $38 million after-tax gain on the sale of some noncore, non-operated oil and gas properties in South Texas.
Third quarter total company production volumes of 605,000 BOE per day were at the high end of our previous guidance range, with better-than-expected production results coming from Permian Resources, improved performance at Al Hosn in the UAE and production growth in Oman from Block 62.
Total domestic production was 294,000 BOE per day during the third quarter, down sequentially from 302,000 BOE per day in the second quarter. Despite the overall decline in domestic volumes, production in Permian Resources of 121,000 BOE per day exceeded our earlier guidance by 5,000 BOE per day, largely due to better management around our base production. The sequential decline in third quarter domestic volumes is also partially due to a drop in production from the absence of gas-directed drilling activity in South Texas.
Our domestic oil and gas operations generated $67 million of free cash flow after capital during the third quarter. In a moment, Jody Elliott will discuss our plans for increased drilling activity in Permian Resources for the fourth quarter and as we exit the year.
International production from our ongoing operations was 311,000 BOE per day during the third quarter of 2016, an increase of 4,000 BOE per day compared to the second quarter. Higher volumes from Al Hosn and Oman contributed to the overall sequential increase, partially offset by a decline in Colombia as a result of pipeline disruptions. The international oil and gas operations comprised of our core 4 areas generated nearly $300 million of free cash flow after capital during the third quarter.
Domestic oil and gas cash operating costs of $12.26 per BOE in the third quarter of 2016 were slightly higher on a sequential basis; however, declined by 7% compared to the full year 2015 cost of $13.13 per BOE.
9-month year-to-date costs are down nearly 10% compared with full year 2015, with the decline mainly the result of improved efficiencies and logistics management around our surface operations, including water handling, as well as lower downhole maintenance and energy-related costs. 
Cash operating costs in Permian Resources saw a further sequential decline in the third quarter and, for the year-to-date, have fallen to $8.43 per BOE, an improvement of 25% compared to 2015 full year costs. 
Overall, oil and gas DD&A for the third quarter of 2016 was $15.58 per BOE compared to $15.81 per BOE during 2015.
Taxes other than on income were $0.97 per BOE for the third quarter of 2016 compared to $1.32 per BOE during 2015. The third quarter exploration expense was $9 million.
Chemical's third quarter 2016 pretax core earnings were $117 million compared with second quarter earnings of $88 million. The sequential quarterly increase in core earnings resulted from higher chloro-vinyls production volumes and higher realized caustic soda prices. These improvements were partially offset by higher energy costs, combined with lower vinyls margins. Vinyl prices remained largely unchanged despite significantly higher ethylene prices, resulting from both meaningful planned and unplanned industry ethylene cracker outages. Our chemicals business generated $100 million of free cash flow before working capital during the third quarter.
Midstream pretax core results were a loss of $20 million for the third quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $58 million in the second quarter. Despite the loss, the results came in at the positive range of our previous guidance, with the sequential improvement resulting from better oil and gas marketing margins.
During the third quarter, we renegotiated some of our crude oil supply contracts, which resulted in an after-tax charge of $103 million. The new agreement should mitigate some of the transportation costs and improve overall profitability going forward.
Turning to our cash flows for the third quarter. We generated $860 million of cash flow from continuing operations before working capital and other changes and adjusted for a onetime payment for the renegotiation of a crude oil supply contract as well as some tax-related items.
Net working capital changes provided $50 million of cash during the period. We expect that this trend on working capital will continue as we exit the year at a slightly higher run rate for capital expenditures compared to the current pace of spending and activity.
Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $642 million, bringing our total year-to-date capital spending to approximately $2 billion. As Vicki mentioned, our capital spending in the fourth quarter is expected to increase modestly as certain project-related expenditures in both chemicals and midstream had been deferred into the latter part of the year. In addition, we plan to recycle some of the efficiencies and savings generated around drilling and completions back into our Permian Resources drilling program, in addition to pursuing some project opportunities in Colombia.
Despite the higher planned capital spending during the fourth quarter, our total -- 2016 total capital program is expected to come in slightly under our original budget of $3 billion. We paid $575 million in dividends during the third quarter and ended the period with $3.2 billion of cash.
As Vicki mentioned, yesterday, we announced several acquisitions of producing properties and nonproducing leasehold acreage in the Permian as well as interests in several enhanced oil recovery and CO2 properties and related infrastructure. These acquisitions were funded with existing cash on hand and without the use of any equity. The transactions are immediately accretive to cash flow and at current commodity prices.
Although our view on product prices remains relatively conservative into next year, we believe we have the balance sheet flexibility to allow us to cover a modest increase in our capital program, which we expect to deliver production growth of 5% to 8% in 2017.
Assuming oil prices of approximately $50 per barrel, we expect to generate cash flow from operations of at least $4.5 billion in 2017. Incremental cash flow contributions would include $150 million from the start-up of a joint venture ethylene cracker; approximately $200 million from improving results in the midstream segment, which would include the Ingleside crude oil terminal; and at least $100 million from the announced Permian acquisitions. In addition, every $1 per barrel improvement in oil prices would provide a further $100 million of operating cash flow.
With respect to guidance and as Vicki mentioned, we now expect our full year 2016 production growth from ongoing operations to be approximately 7% and exceeding the high end of our previous 4% to 6% range. We expect our company-wide production volumes to be in the range of 600,000 to 610,000 BOE per day during the fourth quarter. We anticipate our overall domestic production to be in the range of 290,000 to 295,000 BOE per day, which includes a partial contribution from the Permian acquisitions during the quarter. Permian Resources production is expected to be roughly flat with volumes seen during the third quarter, with full year 2016 growth estimated to be about 12%. International production is estimated to be in the range of 310,000 to 315,000 BOE per day during the fourth quarter. This incorporates the impact of a planned maintenance turnaround at Al Hosn and assumes normal operations in Colombia.
Our plan is to remain disciplined with our capital within the current price environment and to recycle some of the efficiency and productivity gains realized this year into greater activity during the fourth quarter and early next year. We expect this additional activity to help support our Permian Resources production as we exit this year and provide a platform for growth into 2017. Jody will share some of those specifics during his prepared remarks.
In the midstream segment, we expect the fourth quarter to generate a pretax loss of between $20 million and $40 million. While quarter-to-quarter changes are inherently volatile in this segment, we anticipate favorable spreads for our West Texas to Gulf shipments to continue, higher domestic pipeline earnings as well as increased flow of crude to our Ingleside crude terminal, in anticipation of full operations beginning early in 2017.
In chemicals, we anticipate pretax earnings of about $100 million for the fourth quarter or roughly flat with the third quarter. Our DD&A expense for oil and gas is expected to be approximately $15.50 per BOE during 2016, and depreciation for the oil and gas segment is expected to exceed this year's capital investment by more than $1.4 billion.
The combined depreciation for the chemical and midstream segments should be approximately $655 million. Exploration expense is estimated to be about $25 million pretax during the fourth quarter. Price changes at current global prices affect our annual operating cash flow by about $100 million for every dollar per barrel per change in WTI, and a swing of $0.50 per million BTUs in domestic natural gas prices affects our annual operating cash flow by about $45 million.
Using current strip prices for oil and gas, we expect our full year 2016 domestic tax rate to be about 36%. Our international tax rate should be about 55%.
I'll now turn the call over to Jody Elliott, who'll provide an update on activity around our Permian operations."

Today, I will provide a review of our domestic operations during the third quarter, guidance on our program in the fourth quarter and an outlook for the start of 2017. For this year, our Permian Resources business achieved significant",1759,"Thank you, Chris. Today, I will provide a review of our domestic operations during the third quarter, guidance on our program in the fourth quarter and an outlook for the start of 2017. 
For this year, our Permian Resources business achieved significant improvement in well economics across our Permian-leading acreage position through step-change advancements and well productivity and field development design. We believe this improvement in value starts with our subsurface characterization where we are leveraging our geology, petrophysics and geochemistry expertise to achieve breakthroughs in our multi-bench appraisal, stimulation and other key subsurface design factors. We expect to quickly deliver a new series of breakthroughs in 2017 as we advance our seismic-based characterization and second phase of geoscience analytics.
On the cost structure front, we continue to lower our capital and operating cost structure through faster drilling, leveraging engineering innovation and integrated planning to optimize execution and logistics. We expect these efforts, when combined in our field development plans, will ensure Oxy as a leader in realizing maximum value per acre by optimizing recovery and capitalization.
Our unconventional business is well positioned to provide a competitive return in a low-cost environment and achieve significant growth in an improved price environment. As a result, during the third quarter, we added a drilling rig in Permian Resources plus another at the beginning of the fourth quarter and have capacity and locations on standby to respond to improved pricing in 2017.
Turning to the performance of Permian Resources. In the third quarter, we achieved daily production of 121,000 BOE per day, a 4% increase versus the prior year. Oil production declined modestly due to lower capital spending with 9 wells put online versus 54 wells in the third quarter of 2015. Improved well productivity and our emphasis on base management mitigated some of the base decline on the horizontal wells.
In the second and third quarters, we completed gas processing and compression facilities allowing for the capture and sales of more gas and NGLs.
As we announced yesterday, we acquired producing properties and nonproducing leasehold acreage in the Permian. In Permian Resources, we acquired 35,000 net acres in Southern Reeves and Pecos counties, where we currently operate and have working interest. The properties will include approximately 7,000 BOE per day of net production with 72% oil from 68 horizontal wells. On key portions of the acreage, we gained operatorship, where we had existing non-operated interest, and most of the acreage is already held by production. 
Development will initially target the Wolfcamp A, Wolfcamp B and Bone Spring. Simply put, we know the acreage very well. It's very competitive with our existing inventory. 
We expect to drill longer laterals, execute multi-bench development and leverage our existing infrastructure in the area, notably the joint venture gas processing plant completed this summer. 
This transaction brings our overall position in the leasehold area to 59,000 net acres with an aggregate acquisition cost under $2 billion. We plan on allocating approximately $200 million in capital in 2017 to the acquired acreage, utilizing 1 to 2 drilling rigs.
Turning to our activities in our core development areas. Much of the focus of the drilling program in the second and third quarters was to appraise the potential for multi-bench development in Southern Reeves, Eddy, Howard, Glasscock and Northern Reagan County. In Southeast New Mexico, we drilled and completed 2 Cedar Canyon third Bone Spring wells and 1 Cedar Canyon Wolfcamp A well in Eddy County. All of the wells had 30-day peak IPs over 1,000 BOE per day -- excuse me, 1,000 BOE per -- 1,000 BO per day.
In Southern Reeves County, we brought the Roan State 24 51H second Bone Spring well online at a peak rate of 944 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 702 BOE per day at a 90% oil cut. The well had a 4,500-foot lateral and increases our confidence in the potential for multi-bench development for our acreage in the area. We're on the learning curve in developing this bench and expect well productivity to improve as we apply our experience in drilling and completion technology and further integrate our subsurface analysis.
In Glasscock County, we brought the appraisal well, Powell 1720 1H online with a 7,500-foot lateral, which targeted the Spraberry formation with a 30-day rate of 931 BOE per day.
As cited last quarter, we now compare and benchmark our well costs on a cost per thousand feet of lateral basis as we continue to increase our lateral lengths.
Slide 23 illustrates our demonstrated improvement in well cost, which has declined roughly 38% from 2015. Similarly, our 1,000-foot of lateral per rig per quarter has also improved from 25.2 per rig in 2015 to 35.4 per rig in the third quarter. We believe that a significant percentage of these improvements and efficiency are driven by structural changes in how we drill and complete wells and expect to continue to improve these efficiencies as we add drilling rigs.
In the Delaware Basin, we're aggressively appraising new benches while maintaining focus on improving well recoveries in our development benches.
In Southeast New Mexico, we tested a new second Bone Spring slickwater frac design on the Cedar Canyon 27 Fed 5H with 2,000 pounds per foot and 50-foot cluster spacing. The cumulative production results from the new design have exceeded the first half 2016 design, and we expect to see continued improvement in future results.
We're targeting an average well cost of $7.1 million for the second Bone Spring and 3 -- $8.3 million for the third Bone Spring with 7,500-foot laterals on the increased completion size. 
Overall, we're very encouraged by the development and appraisal results in Southeast New Mexico, and we expect to increase activity in Q4 and throughout 2017.
In the Texas-Delaware, we drilled 1 well and turned 1 appraisal well to production. The reduction in activity in the area is consistent with the overall balance of activity shift between Texas and New Mexico, and we plan to increase activity in this area in the fourth quarter. Our upcoming wells in the fourth quarter will test new completion designs and drilling technology that we believe will drive step-change value addition across all of our development areas. We expect to increase our average lateral length from approximately 5,200 feet in 2016 to over 9,000 feet in 2017.
Shifting our results to the East Midland Basin. In the third quarter, we drilled 8 wells, brought 4 wells online, 3 of which have not reached peak production rates. We had multiple record drilling and completion achievements during the quarter. For example, we drilled a Wolfcamp B 7,500-foot lateral in 12.5 days rig release to rig release. We completed 10 frac stages in 1 day, and we drilled and completed 2 Wolfcamp A horizontals for $4.6 million and $4.9 million. Well productivity, measured by the initial production rates per 1,000 foot of lateral, continues to improve.
In the Permian Resources as a whole, we achieved another quarter of lower quarter-over-quarter field operating expenses, due mainly to improved surface operations with optimized water handling, lower workover expenses and better downhole performance. Since the second quarter of 2015, we reduced our operating cost per barrel by 28%, continue to work additional cost reduction and efficiency improvements.
As stated earlier, our focus on maximizing production from existing wells has been central to reducing declines in the business. We expect that our annual average uplift for our investment will be approximately 6,000 net BOE per day. This is another example of leveraging our decades of base management expertise in the EOR business to our resources business.
As previously stated, we expect to increase our drilling activity in the fourth quarter of 2016 and bring on approximately 20 wells. We expect production to be about 120,000 BOE per day in the fourth quarter and be growing as we exit the year. With over 115 wells planned for 2017, we expect to achieve double-digit production growth in Permian Resources. 
In addition to the recent acreage acquisition, we've been actively trading and swapping acreage in order to core up our position. We've traded approximately 10,000 acres, which will enable longer lateral development. So for 2017, we expect to drill more wells with more than double the total lateral lengths drilled in 2016.
Now I'd like to shift to our Permian EOR business. We continue to take advantage of lower drilling costs and manage the operations to run our gas processing facilities at full capacity. Permian EOR had another quarter of free cash flow generation. Drilling costs are running 22% below our benchmark target, and we've lowered our cash operating expenses by 20% since the fourth quarter of 2014 and 7% year-over-year, driven mainly by lower downhole maintenance and injecting costs.
In similar fashion to our resources business, the capital savings achieved by the EOR team will be reinvested into additional wells and CO2 flood expansions. As we've mentioned in previous calls, the Residual Oil Zone development, or ROZ, is a vertical expansion of the CO2 flooded integral. The ROZ lies -- underlines most of our major EOR properties and can developed between $3 and $7 per barrel. Year-to-date, we have completed 94 well deepenings and recompletions, along with 36 wells -- new wells in the ROZ developments. We anticipate an additional 50 deepenings and recompletions and 10 new wells in ROZ developments in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Yesterday, we announced acquisitions of working interest in 11 producing oil and gas properties and related infrastructure. The acquisition increases our ownership in several properties where we currently operate or in existing working interest partner. These properties have production of approximately 4,000 barrels of equivalent per day at 80% oil with estimated net proved developed producing reserves of approximately 25 million BOE and total proved reserves of approximately 41 million BOE.
To summarize, our domestic business will provide competitive returns in a low cost environment and achieve significant growth in an improved price environment. We believe our Permian business is uniquely positioned to leverage our subsurface innovation in unconventional and leadership in enhanced oil recovery to maximize the value per acre across our entire 2.4-million-acre portfolio.
We plan to exit this year running 8 drilling rigs on our operated acreage plus another 1.5 to 2 net rigs on our non-operated development acreage. We're pleased with the strides our teams have made in subsurface characterization, execution and performance thus far in 2016 and look forward to continuing breakthroughs in 2017.
Thank you, and I'll now hand it back to Chris Degner."

The 5 benches, the shared infrastructure and the operational efficiencies that we'll gain by combining these 2 areas and becoming operator of it where we can manage the development to maximize the net present value, we believe, was the best use of our cash at this point. This inventory is -- fits within the -- in the less than $50 per barrel breakeven price for us, and our -- the price that generates a positive NPV of $10 for us.

But in general, it is tighter cluster spacing and higher sand concentrations and then doing trials to understand where you've kind of hit diminishing returns. But in general, more sand, tighter cluster spacing is generating better results. But combining that with longer laterals has really been the key for us. And as you look at the numbers I talked about on extending lateral length, that's another real benefit for us. In New Mexico, this year, we'll average around 5,000-foot laterals. We'll go almost to 7,000 next year. In the Texas-Delaware, a little over 5,000-foot laterals. Next year, it'll be closer -- and this is effective lateral length -- over 9,000 feet. And in East Midland Basin, we probably averaged -- we'll average around 7,800-foot laterals in '16. And then in '17, that will be over 9,000 feet. So the combination of extended lateral giving us really better EURs, better declined profiles, combined with this continued integration of our geoscience with the stimulation design.

I'll begin by summarizing our key accomplishments in the third quarter. First, cost reduction efficiencies, combined with improvement in new well productivity and better base management, have enabled us to further reduce our total spend per barrel of production this year compared to 2015.
Second, we again increased year-over-year production in our core areas, and we're on target to exceed the higher end of our guidance for 2016.
Third, we remain prudent with our capital allocation as we focused on returns and maintained discipline to stay within our $3 billion capital budget. 
Fourth, to further increase our low-decline production and improve efficiencies, we have acquired additional working interests in enhanced oil recovery projects and unconventional acreage in the Permian. 
Last, our aggressive appraisal and development efforts in our Permian Resources business have resulted in an improvement in the number and quality of wells in our inventory.
As I've previously mentioned, our total spend per barrel of production metric includes our overhead, operating and capital cost per barrel of production. This metric is designed to drive cost reductions, increase well productivity and optimize base production. To align employees with this metric, we have linked this to incentive compensation.
Our efforts to focus on efficiency and capital discipline are paying off as we continue to lower our total spend per barrel of production. We averaged close to 62 barrels (sic) [ $62 per barrel ] in 2014, about $40 per barrel in 2015 and have targeted $28.50 per barrel in 2016. Year-to-date, we have beaten our target with average total spend of about $27.50 per barrel.
In the third quarter, total company production from our ongoing operations was about 605,000 BOE per day, an increase of 5% year-over-year, driven by Al Hosn Gas in Abu Dhabi, a new gas project in Oman and resilient base production in Permian Resources.
The performance of the Al Hosn team continues to exceed our expectations as they optimize deliverability. They have again achieved a record production of 74,000 BOE per day for the quarter. It's even more impressive that the plant operated well during the summer months where temperatures can reach 120 degrees. We're optimistic that the plant can continue to deliver from 65,000 BOE per day to 75,000 BOE per day depending on seasonal maintenance. We have commenced engineering studies for a potential expansion of the plant and expect to reach an investment decision in the second half of 2017.
Permian Resources production this quarter was 121,000 BOE per day, representing year-over-year growth of 4%. As per our original development plan, Permian Resources production will decline slightly in the fourth quarter. We are adding rigs now to stabilize production and reach our growth in early 2017. We continue to see improvements in well productivity in all of our areas.
The increases in production from Al Hosn, Oman's Block 62, along with strong year-over-year production growth from Permian Resources, will help us exceed the higher end of our production growth guidance for 2016. As we look forward to 2017, we expect to deliver 5% to 8% production growth with a variance subject to our activity levels in the Permian. Longer term, we have a deep inventory of well locations in the Permian with the capabilities to drive production growth above this range. 
Additionally, we have focused our international business on the core 4 areas: Abu Dhabi, Qatar, Oman and Colombia, where we have a track record of operational success, free cash flow generation and strong financial returns as well as growth opportunities that could drive the capabilities to drive production growth higher than our long-term 5% to 8% target. I have emphasized to our partners in those areas that the returns on any new projects or capital investments must compete with the Permian Basin.
I'm pleased to announce that we have formally completed the exit of our contracts in Bahrain and Iraq. We have no meaningful liabilities related to those contracts nor will we incur any material spending on capital or overhead to manage those terminated contracts. We've also made solid progress toward a formal exit from our contracts in Libya.
Our capital spending in the third quarter declined slightly as we maintained our drilling program in the Permian and shifted timing on spending for certain midstream and chemicals projects. The Permian drilling program is consistent with plans we put in place at the beginning of this year and with our strategy to remain relatively conservative in this price environment. Continued improvements in project design and capital executions have helped us do more than expected with our $3 billion capital budget. These, along with improved production performance in many of our areas, are the reasons we will achieve the upper end of our production guidance for the year.
The construction of the OxyChem joint venture ethylene cracker at Ingleside is on budget and on schedule. We have targeted to finish the commissioning of the plant by mid-January and expect ethylene production in the first quarter of 2017. 
In addition, the crude oil export terminal at Ingleside has started operations and successfully loaded and dispatched 3 ships. The terminal has oil storage capacity of 2 million barrels and throughput capacity of approximately 300,000 barrels of oil per day. The export facility will have the flexibility to take various gravities of crude oil to both domestic and foreign markets.
As the production from the Permian Basin grows in coming years, we would expect to increase demand for access to multiple markets. The ship channel in Corpus Christi has clear advantages to Houston and should allow for shorter transportation times to market.
With the completion of long-term projects in both our chemical and midstream segments, we expect to have increased flexibility with our capital program in 2017. As we enter the fourth quarter, we have increased our activity in the Permian to prepare the business for growth in 2017. While we plan to release a more detailed budget early next year, at this point it's our expectation that capital will increase modestly from a little under $3 billion in 2016 to a range of $3.3 billion to $3.8 billion in 2017. The progress this year of multiyear committed capital will allow for more of our 2017 capital to be devoted to upstream oil and gas development.
Our program in the Permian Resources business will receive the largest increase in capital. And due to the shorter cycle nature of the asset base, it can be adjusted depending on the extent of commodity price recovery.
As we announced yesterday, we have made several strategic acquisitions of producing properties and nonproducing leasehold in the Permian. As we have said previously, we already have a very large inventory in our resources business. The main reason to acquire additional acreage is to improve the value of the inventory we currently have. The selection criteria we use to evaluate our acquisition opportunities are: the proximity of the acreage to our existing infrastructure; the quality of the subsurface reservoirs, and in most cases, we need to have multi-bench development potential; and the ability to optimize recovery per well by drilling longer laterals.
The acquisition we just made met all of these objectives, with the added bonus that we already had a working interest in the properties, making the overall acreage investment lower than current market. In fact, all of the assets we just purchased in both resources and EOR are in fields where we currently operate or own a working interest.
The resources acquisition is in the Texas-Delaware Basin. Increasing our working interest enabled us to become operator of this area, which we believe to be among the most prospective areas in the Permian. Current production is 7,000 BOE per day. The acreage is mostly contiguous, which will enable us to drill longer laterals. It has high oil content and at least 5 prospective benches, 3 of which have a high level of certainty and 2 that are currently being appraised. The properties also have infrastructure that fits well with the infrastructure and takeaway capacity that we already have built in the area.
Including our previous acquisitions, our aggregate investment in this area totals $2 billion and increases our working interest in 59,000 acres. The $2 billion includes a cost of $100 million for the infrastructure on the acquired acreage. From an operating standpoint, this area will become part of what we will call the greater Barilla Draw development. This enables us to utilize and control shared infrastructure to reduce development capital and operating costs, thus increasing our margins as we grow our production.
We will leverage this infrastructure, along with our knowledge of the subsurface, to drive improved financial returns and production growth. We expect to add a rig or 2 to the acreage early next year to accelerate the development of the resource.
As with the resources acquisition, we also acquired additional working interest in enhanced oil recovery projects in Permian, mostly in areas that we operate. This acquisition provides low-decline net production of 4,000 BOE per day and has additional development upside.
Going forward, we will continue to actively evaluate our acquisition opportunities. Due to the nature of its ownership base and long history of production, ownership throughout the Permian is fragmented. We will target bolt-on opportunities with the clear strategic synergies I previously listed to leverage both our understanding of the subsurface geology and our existing midstream and infrastructure investments. Our approach will be disciplined. We'll also continue to actively swap and trade small blocks of acreage. Year-to-date, we have swapped approximately 10,000 acres through many small negotiated transactions. These trades will enable longer lateral development and improved returns without material capital outlay.
As we have continued to appraise and develop our own acreage in the Permian Resources business, we have seen steady improvement in well productivity and a reduction in our drilling and completion costs. Improved logistical capabilities and integrated planning will ensure the majority of these cost savings are sustainable. Through efforts to core up our acreage to drill longer laterals, we have lowered the breakeven cost on our inventory. Simply put, we can deliver more production with fewer wells.
We expect to provide updated disclosure of our inventory and breakeven prices in early 2017 once we have fully integrated recent appraisal efforts and acquisitions.
I'm pleased with our progress to date. We have exceeded our production targets for the year with less capital than we had planned to spend, and we have positioned the company for continued profitable production and cash flow growth as we enter 2017. Directionally, we are planning for modestly higher oil prices in 2017, and we'll set our budget accordingly.
I'll now turn the call over to Chris Stavros."

Today, I'll focus on the following items: our third quarter segment and overall financial results; Oxy's balance sheet strength, liquidity and cash flow in the context of the Permian acquisitions we just announce",1765,"Thanks, Vicki, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll focus on the following items: our third quarter segment and overall financial results; Oxy's balance sheet strength, liquidity and cash flow in the context of the Permian acquisitions we just announced; and oil and gas production and segment guidance for the fourth quarter.
Third quarter 2016 reported financial results for GAAP purposes were a loss of $0.32 per diluted share compared to a loss of $0.18 a share in this year's second quarter. Our third quarter reported results included a net after-tax charge of $129 million related to nonrecurring items in both the oil and gas and midstream segments. Our core financial results for the third quarter of 2016 were a loss of $112 million or $0.15 per diluted share, a slight improvement from a loss of $136 million or $0.18 a share during the second quarter. Importantly, each of our operating segments generated improved quarter-to-quarter core financial results despite the continued challenging conditions for product prices.
Oil and gas pretax core results for the third quarter of 2016 were a loss of $49 million compared to a loss of $117 million in the second quarter, an income of $162 million in the same year-ago period. The sequential improvement of $68 million was primarily a result of higher product price realizations.
During the third quarter, the oil and gas segment recorded a noncore net charges related to the exit from both Libya and Iraq of $61 million and a $38 million after-tax gain on the sale of some noncore, non-operated oil and gas properties in South Texas.
Third quarter total company production volumes of 605,000 BOE per day were at the high end of our previous guidance range, with better-than-expected production results coming from Permian Resources, improved performance at Al Hosn in the UAE and production growth in Oman from Block 62.
Total domestic production was 294,000 BOE per day during the third quarter, down sequentially from 302,000 BOE per day in the second quarter. Despite the overall decline in domestic volumes, production in Permian Resources of 121,000 BOE per day exceeded our earlier guidance by 5,000 BOE per day, largely due to better management around our base production. The sequential decline in third quarter domestic volumes is also partially due to a drop in production from the absence of gas-directed drilling activity in South Texas.
Our domestic oil and gas operations generated $67 million of free cash flow after capital during the third quarter. In a moment, Jody Elliott will discuss our plans for increased drilling activity in Permian Resources for the fourth quarter and as we exit the year.
International production from our ongoing operations was 311,000 BOE per day during the third quarter of 2016, an increase of 4,000 BOE per day compared to the second quarter. Higher volumes from Al Hosn and Oman contributed to the overall sequential increase, partially offset by a decline in Colombia as a result of pipeline disruptions. The international oil and gas operations comprised of our core 4 areas generated nearly $300 million of free cash flow after capital during the third quarter.
Domestic oil and gas cash operating costs of $12.26 per BOE in the third quarter of 2016 were slightly higher on a sequential basis; however, declined by 7% compared to the full year 2015 cost of $13.13 per BOE.
9-month year-to-date costs are down nearly 10% compared with full year 2015, with the decline mainly the result of improved efficiencies and logistics management around our surface operations, including water handling, as well as lower downhole maintenance and energy-related costs. 
Cash operating costs in Permian Resources saw a further sequential decline in the third quarter and, for the year-to-date, have fallen to $8.43 per BOE, an improvement of 25% compared to 2015 full year costs. 
Overall, oil and gas DD&A for the third quarter of 2016 was $15.58 per BOE compared to $15.81 per BOE during 2015.
Taxes other than on income were $0.97 per BOE for the third quarter of 2016 compared to $1.32 per BOE during 2015. The third quarter exploration expense was $9 million.
Chemical's third quarter 2016 pretax core earnings were $117 million compared with second quarter earnings of $88 million. The sequential quarterly increase in core earnings resulted from higher chloro-vinyls production volumes and higher realized caustic soda prices. These improvements were partially offset by higher energy costs, combined with lower vinyls margins. Vinyl prices remained largely unchanged despite significantly higher ethylene prices, resulting from both meaningful planned and unplanned industry ethylene cracker outages. Our chemicals business generated $100 million of free cash flow before working capital during the third quarter.
Midstream pretax core results were a loss of $20 million for the third quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $58 million in the second quarter. Despite the loss, the results came in at the positive range of our previous guidance, with the sequential improvement resulting from better oil and gas marketing margins.
During the third quarter, we renegotiated some of our crude oil supply contracts, which resulted in an after-tax charge of $103 million. The new agreement should mitigate some of the transportation costs and improve overall profitability going forward.
Turning to our cash flows for the third quarter. We generated $860 million of cash flow from continuing operations before working capital and other changes and adjusted for a onetime payment for the renegotiation of a crude oil supply contract as well as some tax-related items.
Net working capital changes provided $50 million of cash during the period. We expect that this trend on working capital will continue as we exit the year at a slightly higher run rate for capital expenditures compared to the current pace of spending and activity.
Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $642 million, bringing our total year-to-date capital spending to approximately $2 billion. As Vicki mentioned, our capital spending in the fourth quarter is expected to increase modestly as certain project-related expenditures in both chemicals and midstream had been deferred into the latter part of the year. In addition, we plan to recycle some of the efficiencies and savings generated around drilling and completions back into our Permian Resources drilling program, in addition to pursuing some project opportunities in Colombia.
Despite the higher planned capital spending during the fourth quarter, our total -- 2016 total capital program is expected to come in slightly under our original budget of $3 billion. We paid $575 million in dividends during the third quarter and ended the period with $3.2 billion of cash.
As Vicki mentioned, yesterday, we announced several acquisitions of producing properties and nonproducing leasehold acreage in the Permian as well as interests in several enhanced oil recovery and CO2 properties and related infrastructure. These acquisitions were funded with existing cash on hand and without the use of any equity. The transactions are immediately accretive to cash flow and at current commodity prices.
Although our view on product prices remains relatively conservative into next year, we believe we have the balance sheet flexibility to allow us to cover a modest increase in our capital program, which we expect to deliver production growth of 5% to 8% in 2017.
Assuming oil prices of approximately $50 per barrel, we expect to generate cash flow from operations of at least $4.5 billion in 2017. Incremental cash flow contributions would include $150 million from the start-up of a joint venture ethylene cracker; approximately $200 million from improving results in the midstream segment, which would include the Ingleside crude oil terminal; and at least $100 million from the announced Permian acquisitions. In addition, every $1 per barrel improvement in oil prices would provide a further $100 million of operating cash flow.
With respect to guidance and as Vicki mentioned, we now expect our full year 2016 production growth from ongoing operations to be approximately 7% and exceeding the high end of our previous 4% to 6% range. We expect our company-wide production volumes to be in the range of 600,000 to 610,000 BOE per day during the fourth quarter. We anticipate our overall domestic production to be in the range of 290,000 to 295,000 BOE per day, which includes a partial contribution from the Permian acquisitions during the quarter. Permian Resources production is expected to be roughly flat with volumes seen during the third quarter, with full year 2016 growth estimated to be about 12%. International production is estimated to be in the range of 310,000 to 315,000 BOE per day during the fourth quarter. This incorporates the impact of a planned maintenance turnaround at Al Hosn and assumes normal operations in Colombia.
Our plan is to remain disciplined with our capital within the current price environment and to recycle some of the efficiency and productivity gains realized this year into greater activity during the fourth quarter and early next year. We expect this additional activity to help support our Permian Resources production as we exit this year and provide a platform for growth into 2017. Jody will share some of those specifics during his prepared remarks.
In the midstream segment, we expect the fourth quarter to generate a pretax loss of between $20 million and $40 million. While quarter-to-quarter changes are inherently volatile in this segment, we anticipate favorable spreads for our West Texas to Gulf shipments to continue, higher domestic pipeline earnings as well as increased flow of crude to our Ingleside crude terminal, in anticipation of full operations beginning early in 2017.
In chemicals, we anticipate pretax earnings of about $100 million for the fourth quarter or roughly flat with the third quarter. Our DD&A expense for oil and gas is expected to be approximately $15.50 per BOE during 2016, and depreciation for the oil and gas segment is expected to exceed this year's capital investment by more than $1.4 billion.
The combined depreciation for the chemical and midstream segments should be approximately $655 million. Exploration expense is estimated to be about $25 million pretax during the fourth quarter. Price changes at current global prices affect our annual operating cash flow by about $100 million for every dollar per barrel per change in WTI, and a swing of $0.50 per million BTUs in domestic natural gas prices affects our annual operating cash flow by about $45 million.
Using current strip prices for oil and gas, we expect our full year 2016 domestic tax rate to be about 36%. Our international tax rate should be about 55%.
I'll now turn the call over to Jody Elliott, who'll provide an update on activity around our Permian operations."
293286,404979780,1069398,"Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Occidental Petroleum Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Chris. Today, I will provide a review of our domestic operations during the third quarter, guidance on our program in the fourth quarter and an outlook for the start of 2017. For this year, our Permian Resources business achieved significant",1759,"Thank you, Chris. Today, I will provide a review of our domestic operations during the third quarter, guidance on our program in the fourth quarter and an outlook for the start of 2017. 
For this year, our Permian Resources business achieved significant improvement in well economics across our Permian-leading acreage position through step-change advancements and well productivity and field development design. We believe this improvement in value starts with our subsurface characterization where we are leveraging our geology, petrophysics and geochemistry expertise to achieve breakthroughs in our multi-bench appraisal, stimulation and other key subsurface design factors. We expect to quickly deliver a new series of breakthroughs in 2017 as we advance our seismic-based characterization and second phase of geoscience analytics.
On the cost structure front, we continue to lower our capital and operating cost structure through faster drilling, leveraging engineering innovation and integrated planning to optimize execution and logistics. We expect these efforts, when combined in our field development plans, will ensure Oxy as a leader in realizing maximum value per acre by optimizing recovery and capitalization.
Our unconventional business is well positioned to provide a competitive return in a low-cost environment and achieve significant growth in an improved price environment. As a result, during the third quarter, we added a drilling rig in Permian Resources plus another at the beginning of the fourth quarter and have capacity and locations on standby to respond to improved pricing in 2017.
Turning to the performance of Permian Resources. In the third quarter, we achieved daily production of 121,000 BOE per day, a 4% increase versus the prior year. Oil production declined modestly due to lower capital spending with 9 wells put online versus 54 wells in the third quarter of 2015. Improved well productivity and our emphasis on base management mitigated some of the base decline on the horizontal wells.
In the second and third quarters, we completed gas processing and compression facilities allowing for the capture and sales of more gas and NGLs.
As we announced yesterday, we acquired producing properties and nonproducing leasehold acreage in the Permian. In Permian Resources, we acquired 35,000 net acres in Southern Reeves and Pecos counties, where we currently operate and have working interest. The properties will include approximately 7,000 BOE per day of net production with 72% oil from 68 horizontal wells. On key portions of the acreage, we gained operatorship, where we had existing non-operated interest, and most of the acreage is already held by production. 
Development will initially target the Wolfcamp A, Wolfcamp B and Bone Spring. Simply put, we know the acreage very well. It's very competitive with our existing inventory. 
We expect to drill longer laterals, execute multi-bench development and leverage our existing infrastructure in the area, notably the joint venture gas processing plant completed this summer. 
This transaction brings our overall position in the leasehold area to 59,000 net acres with an aggregate acquisition cost under $2 billion. We plan on allocating approximately $200 million in capital in 2017 to the acquired acreage, utilizing 1 to 2 drilling rigs.
Turning to our activities in our core development areas. Much of the focus of the drilling program in the second and third quarters was to appraise the potential for multi-bench development in Southern Reeves, Eddy, Howard, Glasscock and Northern Reagan County. In Southeast New Mexico, we drilled and completed 2 Cedar Canyon third Bone Spring wells and 1 Cedar Canyon Wolfcamp A well in Eddy County. All of the wells had 30-day peak IPs over 1,000 BOE per day -- excuse me, 1,000 BOE per -- 1,000 BO per day.
In Southern Reeves County, we brought the Roan State 24 51H second Bone Spring well online at a peak rate of 944 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 702 BOE per day at a 90% oil cut. The well had a 4,500-foot lateral and increases our confidence in the potential for multi-bench development for our acreage in the area. We're on the learning curve in developing this bench and expect well productivity to improve as we apply our experience in drilling and completion technology and further integrate our subsurface analysis.
In Glasscock County, we brought the appraisal well, Powell 1720 1H online with a 7,500-foot lateral, which targeted the Spraberry formation with a 30-day rate of 931 BOE per day.
As cited last quarter, we now compare and benchmark our well costs on a cost per thousand feet of lateral basis as we continue to increase our lateral lengths.
Slide 23 illustrates our demonstrated improvement in well cost, which has declined roughly 38% from 2015. Similarly, our 1,000-foot of lateral per rig per quarter has also improved from 25.2 per rig in 2015 to 35.4 per rig in the third quarter. We believe that a significant percentage of these improvements and efficiency are driven by structural changes in how we drill and complete wells and expect to continue to improve these efficiencies as we add drilling rigs.
In the Delaware Basin, we're aggressively appraising new benches while maintaining focus on improving well recoveries in our development benches.
In Southeast New Mexico, we tested a new second Bone Spring slickwater frac design on the Cedar Canyon 27 Fed 5H with 2,000 pounds per foot and 50-foot cluster spacing. The cumulative production results from the new design have exceeded the first half 2016 design, and we expect to see continued improvement in future results.
We're targeting an average well cost of $7.1 million for the second Bone Spring and 3 -- $8.3 million for the third Bone Spring with 7,500-foot laterals on the increased completion size. 
Overall, we're very encouraged by the development and appraisal results in Southeast New Mexico, and we expect to increase activity in Q4 and throughout 2017.
In the Texas-Delaware, we drilled 1 well and turned 1 appraisal well to production. The reduction in activity in the area is consistent with the overall balance of activity shift between Texas and New Mexico, and we plan to increase activity in this area in the fourth quarter. Our upcoming wells in the fourth quarter will test new completion designs and drilling technology that we believe will drive step-change value addition across all of our development areas. We expect to increase our average lateral length from approximately 5,200 feet in 2016 to over 9,000 feet in 2017.
Shifting our results to the East Midland Basin. In the third quarter, we drilled 8 wells, brought 4 wells online, 3 of which have not reached peak production rates. We had multiple record drilling and completion achievements during the quarter. For example, we drilled a Wolfcamp B 7,500-foot lateral in 12.5 days rig release to rig release. We completed 10 frac stages in 1 day, and we drilled and completed 2 Wolfcamp A horizontals for $4.6 million and $4.9 million. Well productivity, measured by the initial production rates per 1,000 foot of lateral, continues to improve.
In the Permian Resources as a whole, we achieved another quarter of lower quarter-over-quarter field operating expenses, due mainly to improved surface operations with optimized water handling, lower workover expenses and better downhole performance. Since the second quarter of 2015, we reduced our operating cost per barrel by 28%, continue to work additional cost reduction and efficiency improvements.
As stated earlier, our focus on maximizing production from existing wells has been central to reducing declines in the business. We expect that our annual average uplift for our investment will be approximately 6,000 net BOE per day. This is another example of leveraging our decades of base management expertise in the EOR business to our resources business.
As previously stated, we expect to increase our drilling activity in the fourth quarter of 2016 and bring on approximately 20 wells. We expect production to be about 120,000 BOE per day in the fourth quarter and be growing as we exit the year. With over 115 wells planned for 2017, we expect to achieve double-digit production growth in Permian Resources. 
In addition to the recent acreage acquisition, we've been actively trading and swapping acreage in order to core up our position. We've traded approximately 10,000 acres, which will enable longer lateral development. So for 2017, we expect to drill more wells with more than double the total lateral lengths drilled in 2016.
Now I'd like to shift to our Permian EOR business. We continue to take advantage of lower drilling costs and manage the operations to run our gas processing facilities at full capacity. Permian EOR had another quarter of free cash flow generation. Drilling costs are running 22% below our benchmark target, and we've lowered our cash operating expenses by 20% since the fourth quarter of 2014 and 7% year-over-year, driven mainly by lower downhole maintenance and injecting costs.
In similar fashion to our resources business, the capital savings achieved by the EOR team will be reinvested into additional wells and CO2 flood expansions. As we've mentioned in previous calls, the Residual Oil Zone development, or ROZ, is a vertical expansion of the CO2 flooded integral. The ROZ lies -- underlines most of our major EOR properties and can developed between $3 and $7 per barrel. Year-to-date, we have completed 94 well deepenings and recompletions, along with 36 wells -- new wells in the ROZ developments. We anticipate an additional 50 deepenings and recompletions and 10 new wells in ROZ developments in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Yesterday, we announced acquisitions of working interest in 11 producing oil and gas properties and related infrastructure. The acquisition increases our ownership in several properties where we currently operate or in existing working interest partner. These properties have production of approximately 4,000 barrels of equivalent per day at 80% oil with estimated net proved developed producing reserves of approximately 25 million BOE and total proved reserves of approximately 41 million BOE.
To summarize, our domestic business will provide competitive returns in a low cost environment and achieve significant growth in an improved price environment. We believe our Permian business is uniquely positioned to leverage our subsurface innovation in unconventional and leadership in enhanced oil recovery to maximize the value per acre across our entire 2.4-million-acre portfolio.
We plan to exit this year running 8 drilling rigs on our operated acreage plus another 1.5 to 2 net rigs on our non-operated development acreage. We're pleased with the strides our teams have made in subsurface characterization, execution and performance thus far in 2016 and look forward to continuing breakthroughs in 2017.
Thank you, and I'll now hand it back to Chris Degner."

So that's kind of the minimum location count in the Wolfcamp A, the Wolfcamp B, second Bone Spring. We're very optimistic about 2 additional benches in the Bone Spring and in the Wolfcamp debris flow, which sits between the A and the B. At $60, again, that inventory just continues to grow, whether it's tighter spacing. The other aspect is we continue to improve both well performance and our execution results. I mentioned that we have some technology things working in the drilling area, which we believe can be a step-change in multi-well, multi-pad development. And so as we test those in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter of '17, we'll be more able to talk about some of those details. But we think that would generate even more bench activity not just in the acquisition, but on all of our core areas."

We don't see any need to acquire any additional acreage unless it's smaller bolt-ons that do provide us the efficiencies to develop what we currently have. And those are the types of things that we would target going forward. Our inventory is huge, and we still haven't fully appraised the inventory we have. So what we view this to have done is in the greater Barilla Draw area, what it's done for us is just -- in addition to the 59,000 associated with the acquisition, we have in that general area around 100,000 acres. So that gives us a really sizable position that's bigger than most positions. And that's why this was so important to us. It was a special case because, as you've noticed, we haven't really acquired anything in the last couple of years, and this is the reason. We're looking for those things that provide us a unique opportunity to do something that's -- what we consider to be really a step-change in a given area. Looking at the rest of our acreage, we're spending quite a bit of time and effort to appraise the rest of what we have and to rank it in terms of development. So now we feel very comfortable with the greater Barilla Draw area. Southeast New Mexico is in prime position for aggressive development, and we have some areas in the Midland Basin as well. What we have to do now is we've got our appraisal team working on those parts of our acreage that are outside of those areas."

But in general, it is tighter cluster spacing and higher sand concentrations and then doing trials to understand where you've kind of hit diminishing returns. But in general, more sand, tighter cluster spacing is generating better results. But combining that with longer laterals has really been the key for us. And as you look at the numbers I talked about on extending lateral length, that's another real benefit for us. In New Mexico, this year, we'll average around 5,000-foot laterals. We'll go almost to 7,000 next year. In the Texas-Delaware, a little over 5,000-foot laterals. Next year, it'll be closer -- and this is effective lateral length -- over 9,000 feet. And in East Midland Basin, we probably averaged -- we'll average around 7,800-foot laterals in '16. And then in '17, that will be over 9,000 feet. So the combination of extended lateral giving us really better EURs, better declined profiles, combined with this continued integration of our geoscience with the stimulation design. The drilling technology piece is something that we'll talk a little bit more about in future quarters, but it's really an innovative way to access multiple benches and again, leveraging your infrastructure across -- again, multiple benches with minimizing your facility cost."
