We're glad you could join us today for Anadarko's year-end 2015 conference call. 
I need to remind you that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions. However, a number of factors could cause results to differ materially from what we discuss today. 
So I encourage you to read our full disclosure on forward-looking statements and the GAAP reconciliations located on our website and attached to last night's earnings release. 
Additionally, as we always do, we provided more detail in the quarterly operations report on our website. 
I'd like to take a moment and thank Robin Fielder for the contribution she's made to the IR team and our efforts over the last 1.5 years. She's transitioning back to the operations group, and [indiscernible], a geologist with experience across the company, is joining our team and she's looking forward to taking your calls after the call today. 
At this time, I'll turn the call over to Al Walker, and we'll open the lines in a few minutes for Q&A, with Al and our executive team following his remarks. Al?"

Many of you know Mitch joined us in the fourth quarter of last year as EVP of LNG coming to us from BG Group, where he's an Executive Vice President of the technical aspects of the company as well as a member of the Executive Committee. Mitch's background with BG includes accomplishments, most noteworthy is the accomplishment she achieved associated with our Queensland Curtis LNG project. 
Additionally, I'd like to say how proud I am of our employees who served and proved more than once of the challenges of last year just how great they were at navigating the uncertain price environment we anticipated as we entered 2015. Through their combined efforts, we outperformed our initial expectations by increasing our higher margin oil sales and volumes while spending significantly capital and improving our cost structure and enhancing efficiencies. We also closed $2 billion of monetizations.
Additionally, during the year, we reduced our capital spending by almost 40%, and oil prices fell by almost 50% [ph] over that time horizon. We organically replaced more than 130% of our production with reserve additions at a cost of about $14 per BOE. We also significantly increased the percentage of our reserves and improved developed category to 80% at year-end 2015 compared to 30 -- 69% at the end of 2014. These achievements position us well to manage through the market uncertainty and volatility we see in the coming years. 
As I mentioned in last night's news release and later this month, we will recommend a capital program to our Board that reflects our review of 2016 and beyond. Our preliminary expectation is that APC will spend about $2.8 billion this year, which is roughly half of what we spent in 2015 and 70% less than our expenditures in 2014. As stated on other occasions, we will fare a value preservation and allocating this capital, and as such, our short-cycle U.S. onshore investments would be impacted the most. Frankly, even with 2 of the best assets in North America, we don't find the returns in this environment to be compelling. Therefore, we are choosing to fund a reduced program in the Wattenberg field and only a delineation and lease preservation program in the Delaware Basin as we seek to preserve these shorter-cycle opportunities for a better day. 
Even with these reductions, our total sales volumes across the company are expected to only decline by 1% to 4% on a divestiture-adjusted basis, with lower margin gas volumes accounting for all of the decline. We expect to keep our divestiture-adjusted year-over-year oil sales volumes and the year-over-year Q4 exit rate oil production relatively flat. 
Given our materially lower capital plans for 2016, this is very noteworthy and a result of exceptional efforts by our employees. We plan to achieve this through starting the production of the Heidelberg spar much earlier than expected, continued outperformance at Lucius, the TEN complex in Ghana coming online as expected in Q3 and an increased focus on our [indiscernible] tieback opportunities. 
Leveraging our infrastructure enables us to deliver these incredibly capital-efficient tieback opportunities, which we believe generate rates of return of 30% to 100% even at today's prices. We will also continue to seek innovative ways to monetize assets this year. We already have greater than $1 billion of monetization opportunities that are at very advanced stages, with no current plans to monetize more of our ownership in WGP in this environment. 
As we have done historically with great success, we plan to continue actively managing our portfolio this year and have other monetizations identified, which will be pursued through the course of the year. The quality of our balance sheet remains a key objective. For the flexibility provided by our reduced capital program, the ongoing benefits of an improved capital and cost structure and our pathway to several near-term monetizations, we are very confident in our ability to maintain or decrease Anadarko's net debt levels this year while spending well inside of our cash inflows. 
We look forward to going into greater detail about our capital plans and expectations for 2016 on our March 1 call, which we look forward to doing as soon as possible, but March 1 will be here soon enough. 
During these times and more than ever, our company's culture, its employees, its track record and its approach to value creation matter, and we believe these are all competitive advantages for Anadarko. 
With that, we'll open it up for questions."

And we would hope and expect that the agencies are going up by their historic standards and their historic methodology in their current analysis.

I think as we think about 2016 and taking the comment that's been made about trying to preserve value, when you consider us, I believe this year, we would estimate that our maintenance CapEx is going to be about 2/3 of what it was in the prior year for maintaining volumes. You couple that with -- we anticipate our oil volumes being relatively flat through the year that only the decline we see on a divestiture-adjusted coming from gas, we believe that at some point, when growth matters again, we're prepared to go back to growth. But I think by lowering that maintenance CapEx 2/3 or 2/3 rather of what it was the prior year, that's pretty impressive in terms of being able to create that value preservation that we're looking for. I think these other longer-data projects, we believe, today are worthy of spending capital, expecting that oil is not going to be at 30 for the rest of our life. And at some point, we'll only make decisions to take either to sanction or FID any of these longer-dated projects. It will be in our environment, which we believe we can recommend to our Board first that we make that investment. So I think that's the confidence I would have if I were an investor, that we will do that when it's appropriate."

But those are the focus that we would have today. But I also believe that the things that we're trying to do to take 2016's environment and making them most out of it is probably the most important agenda at hand. I think getting through this year, being able to keep our oil volumes flat on a divestiture-adjusted basis, the only reduction we see in volumes coming through gas properties that we're not investing in, in this market, those are the things that, I think, we will do this year while preserving the balance sheet and looking at it as a key objective for improving the quality where we can because I made a comment earlier and are reaffirming here, I think we believe we can maintain net debt at a level that it's at today, if not reduce it further, while still meeting the capital objectives that I laid out this morning."

And consequently, until we see event stabilize, then we see oil prices in particular take on and unit supply/demand dynamic than it's currently or anticipated in the near future. We will continue to see a very cautious investor in this environment. And you're right, you go back to this call a year ago, I think we were very concerned that this was going to be a much longer in its recovery period. And it tends to -- you that time, people want to think it might be the case. We also go back to prior periods and in history, some of us have been around in the oil and gas business a lot of time. Typically, when you go to a down cycle, you come out of a down cycle with a pretty good price increase. We are a little concerned that this time, there is one dynamic we've never had previously, and that is shale response in a short-cycle investment to a rising price environment has not been in the equation previously. And that will probably add to greater volatility in the coming years than we have certainly seen in the last 5 and I would say even in the last 30. We've just not seen shale in the short term inventory on its ability to respond to prices in the same way we do now. Now I'm not try to paint a picture that looks like North American natural gas that goes year, we've got 94 million barrels a day of demand being maybe oversupplied 1.5 million to 2 million barrels. That's a very different environment than natural gas in North America. And so it could correct itself. But as prices move up and the intersection of supply and demand improves prices over time, it'll largely come from a supply contraction in the near term, not from a demand response. I think all of us and I think, most importantly, most economists have been very surprised at the very limited demand response we've seen by the lower petroleum product prices around the world. So it's for those reasons that I think we're taking again this year and into '17 a very cautious approach."

We found over 620 feet of high-quality oil play that well. We are very pleased with it. We also were able to get about 550 feet of core that's important for planning what that development could look like. So that's going to be analyzed, turned over to the reservoir engineers as they put together a scenario for how we might develop that. At the same time, we're looking at drilling Shenendoah 5. We think that's a well that's required. It's off to the East. It'd be kind o f between Shenendoah 3 and the original Shenendoah 1, up dip of Shenendoah 3, which was what well, income and very, very good sands, give us down-dip limit on these eastern side. So that well should spud here in the first quarter. We have high expectations for it. But we need to drill the well and say that's what appraisal is all about. Meanwhile, the guys are taking all the information that we obtained from this, rolling it into conceptual planning as to what resources we may be able to recover, how much it might cost us, those types of things. And as Al said, we're a long ways from sanctioning at this point. If Shenendoah 5 is successful, we may move even farther to the east of a the Shenendoah 6, but of course, that will be all depend on what happens to Shenendoah 5. Yeti, we're pretty much done at Yeti with the assessment of it. We drilled the initial well, had success there in minimizing good oil pay, good reservoirs, we went down-dip with the sidetracked. And and come in the water so that the that a good handle on where the water contact would be. So we've got a fairly good limit on that side of it. We then drilled the Yeti 3 well, which was really an exploratory well with a down-dip tail to get some information on Yeti. But we really didn't think it was going to be particularly good well from a hydrocarbon prospectivity in the original Yeti discovery. The upper zone that we were targeting had very good sands, but it was wet. But we were then able to go down to the middle my see, give up or across that. So then, get the information that's needed for the teams to put together their development plans. This is going to be a very nice tieback into one of the existing nearby infrastructure. And so the folks are working on that, but again, they got a lot of work to. And then the commodity prices have to cooperate, along with service cost to make sure that, that's economically viable project when we do decide to move forward with it."

I think greenfield project development, unless we have a substantial estimated ultimate recovery from some of our exploration activities, do make it a little more challenging. One of the things I think we've done a good job of is we've developed various things as to be able to fund the market to take the development component of our funding and development costs. Whether that market's always there will be a function of the economics. I think as we come out of this cycle, and we certainly, at some point, will, and to what extent we'll find out, I think in the near term, as we come out of the cycle, we will move back to a higher weighting and our short-cycle inventory and move the weighting that we've moved the last couple of years into intermediate and longer-cycle investing and ship that back to short. That, in part, will have something to do with what we believe will be attractive rates of return we can get from our short-cycle investing. So the 2 of those would be taken together, but the volatility is something, I think, we, as people who have to look at this every day, is going to be a lot different than the next 5 years, maybe 10 years.

I talked about the Kronos well on our last call where we found 130 to 230 feet of gas bay that looked to be biodegraded thermogenic oil based on the geochemistry. Everything that we've done on the geochemical side is holding up with that type of an interpretation. The Kronos well was not as -- didn't have developed sands and maybe we would have hoped, although the objective section does look like it blooms out to the North in a much better area. And we'll be testing that this year. As you move 100 miles to the north of Calasu, we're moving closer to what we look at the epicenter, which is the Magdalena system. We are very peripheral to it at Kronos, but in the Calasu, we're getting into much more proximal portion of it. We saw excellent sand development at Calasu. We had about 17 meters of gas bay in one of the sands. We're working the geochemistry and at as we went deeper into the well, we seem to be getting evidence of heavier components, but we didn't have any significant accumulation to speak of as we move further down. And the temperature data seem to confirm our interpretation as we move from Kronos up towards Calasu, the overall basin gets warmer, but it's still a very cool basin. So that it still speaks to the, most likely, generative bays being oil in the areas that we're looking. So we're encouraged about what we've seen. We've learned an awful lot. And we're studying back deciding what it means to us in the Grant Forte area. At the same time, we acquired a big 3D up in the coal area. Last year, we're doing Phase 2 this year. And what we're seeing up there is really exciting and is also -- given the ties that we have from the previous 2 wells, when we take that up into the coal area, it gets us very excited about the prospectivity of the coal area. And so Colombia has got a lot more to do. We've got a lot of the data, and so we're rolling that in. We're over and Paon right now. We've got quite a bit of activity at Paon. It's going to take us to the second half of the year, but when we're done there, the rig will come back into Colombia and drill, what we call, our [indiscernible] well, which will be testing the Forte area and probably the Kronos appraisal is really what it's targeted.

So that dislocation is, we believe, is going to continue. We don't find the margins that we're seeing today to be attractive for the reasons I have talked about this morning. And I think indicative of how we've, over time, done things, our ability with a substantially reduced capital plan, 60% [ph], down from last year's 70%, down from 2014, being able to maintain oil volumes flat year-over-year on a divestiture-adjusted basis speaks to the quality of the portfolio that has a good mix of conventional and unconventional resources to lean on.

We spent rest of the money to get the volumes from the TEN complex. Having a full year of Lucius, that's outperforming the expectations, all that blends into a much lower capital requirement, deeper volumes flat year-to-year. And to Al's comment in his opening remarks, we expect to be down on a divestiture-adjusted basis, plus or minus, 1% to 4%. So it kind of says even then that we're not spending even to the level to keep volumes flat.

David, obviously, we talked to those bondholders. I'm not in a position to comment on things they might have said about their ability or willingness to continue to hold the bond I think they need to -- those conversations are best held with the individuals. I will say that certain of them that I've spoken into are concerned about some of the approaches that Moody's, in particular, might take relative to their historic methodology conversations that they've held that caused them to believe that, perhaps, what traditionally were just subcomponents of Moody's methodology become overriding factors that there's a political dynamic at work that is not necessarily linear relative to the last several years of an approach that we can all rely upon. And that certainly appears to be affecting bondholders comfort with the current situation. I don't believe that same dynamic exists with the views of how S&P is taking, what I would call, more traditional measured response to the commodity price environment. But those are all anecdotal types of things. We don't know that they come to pass, but they're the types of things that, quite frankly, I think our fixed income holders are concerned about and appropriately so. And then all the community in the top of an environment is managed this possibly as we can, continue to do what we've done, focusing on the quality of the assets. The asset coverage obviously cash flows are impacting the current environment. And that is a temporary dislocation even if it exists longer than a year.

So it's very important to us. Certainly, we've got a lot of flexibility before, in our opinion, before we need to raise capital in order to address concerns. I think one of the issues is that Clinton's reasonable and are they addressable by simple knobs that one can turn. We talked about the dividend earlier. We talked about asset sales. We mentioned north of $1 billion in the near term that would more than fund, in addition to our discretionary cash flow with more than fund the $2.8 billion budget. We've got a list of assets beyond that that we're actively working and would expect to be able to execute during 2016, things that went out talk about, our net debt stay flat or reducing the big variable and reducing there, which they are executing against. And it is for some reason, we needed to continue to embrace that, that appeared able to execute an asset sales, then you continue to work down your list of items that become a little more distasteful to further down the list you go, but are the types of things that we would have to consider whether or not to pursue a relative to where the rating agencies, where the ratings from all 3 agencies are and whether steps are defined by those agencies that they'd like to see if, indeed, they take actions. So it is -- you're right, we're far more than bystanders. We're actively engaged in addressing this all very proactively. But we also want to make sure that we're doing things that are responsible relative to the true underlying risk and not -- and that true underlying risk isn't always captured in a particular agency's view of an action that they may take at a point in time. We're just trying to the balance and be responsible and iterative in our approach."

And I think it is appropriate that the wait for the composition with our Board first. But our business is, as we see it today, philosophically, is about preservation. And we do think there are things we can invest in, in the intermediate long cycle that, in fact, do just that. But I think at $2.8 billion or the $1.8 billion maintenance number, our ability in this environment to hold oil volumes flat year-over-year on a divestiture-adjusted basis, only declining actual volume coming from gas properties that we're not investing in is a pretty good indication of what we feel like as a way in which we want to manage a very difficult and challenging period and yet have it be capital-responsive to the environment that the hydrocarbon prices are giving us. If you allow ourselves to continue to do a copy of the hibernation, and things come out to at some point from this cycle and you're not prepared to then take advantage of what you can do, then we somewhat allowed ourselves to not maximize our equity return for the costs associated with the credit profile. And I think Bob addressed beautifully exactly what we feel like we want to do in order to maintain the highest credit quality possible, at the same time, not stall other equity story."

I think also, you've heard from us today, will go into greater detail on March 1 about how we get to that $1.8 billion maintenance contracts. I talked repeatedly about our -- what we believe is a very attractive year-over-year sales volume that we're able to achieve and only declines coming from natural gas properties that we're not investing in. I also made a comment or 2, and I'll just highlighted again. We have extremely good line of sight today for monetizations in excess of $1 billion, which we hope to be announcing between here and our March 1 conference call. We think that would, and should, address a lot of the concerns and questions that have been posted about how we intend to fund our activities in 2016. I think one of the things that is probably been lost in the scheme of just exactly who we are and what we are, but I've tried, I think almost every call to emphasize this. We are a mix of conventional and unconventional resources. And in 2016, you're seeing the benefit of conventional assets coming into the production profile. And that's a very different opportunity set than a lot of other companies have. I think that nice cocktail of mix between conventional and unconventional continue to resonate. I think you'll see it in a way in which our performance plays out through the year. And I do think, and I know a lot of companies talk about this, I'll say it again, we have an exceptional culture with great employees and a tremendous track record of achieving what we established for the year is what we think we can achieve an want to achieve, typically go beyond that. So I don't think 201 and will be any different than that. It's definitely going to be a tough year. But the opportunities we have, I think, are quite significant. And I also think the way in which we manage our capital, we manage our business, that we have a culture that can succeed in any environment, will be quite important as we get through this year and the years to come after this. So I appreciate the support we've seen from a lot of investors through this very difficult period. Those of you that have hung in there with us, we greatly appreciate it. Those of you that are new to the investment, we look forward to making sure that everybody feels that we're doing everything we possibly can.

And I'd also like to take a moment and just say, Shandell, welcome to the organization that John has built, and also introduce Mitch Ingram. Many of you know that Mitch joined us in the fourth quarter of last year as EVP of LNG, coming to us from BG Group, where he's an Executive Vice President of the technical aspects of the company as well as a member of the Executive Committee. Mitch's background with BG includes accomplishments, most noteworthy is the accomplishment he achieved associated with our Queensland Curtis LNG project. 
Additionally, I'd like to say how proud I am of our employees who served and proved more than once in the challenges of last year just how great they were at navigating the uncertain price environment we anticipated as we entered 2015. Through their combined efforts, we outperformed our initial expectations by increasing our higher-margin oil sales and volumes while spending significantly less capital and improving our cost structure and enhancing efficiencies. We also closed $2 billion of monetizations.
Additionally, during the year, we reduced our capital spending by almost 40%, and oil prices fell by almost 50% over that time horizon. We organically replaced more than 130% of our production with reserve additions at a cost of about $14 per BOE. We also significantly increased the percentage of our reserves and improved developed category to 80% at year-end 2015 compared to 30 -- compared to 69% at the end of 2014. These achievements position us well to manage through the market uncertainty and volatility we see in the coming years. 
As I mentioned in last night's news release and later this month, we will recommend a capital program to our Board that reflects our view of 2016 and beyond. Our preliminary expectation is that APC will spend about $2.8 billion this year, which is roughly half of what we spent in 2015 and 70% less than our expenditures in 2014. As stated on other occasions, we will fare value preservation and allocating this capital, and as such, our short-cycle U.S. onshore investments would be impacted the most. 
Frankly, even with 2 of the best assets in North America, we don't find the returns in this environment to be compelling. Therefore, we are choosing to fund a reduced program in the Wattenberg field and only a delineation and lease preservation program in the Delaware Basin as we seek to preserve these shorter-cycle opportunities for a better day. 
Even with these reductions, our total sales volumes across the company are expected to only decline by 1% to 4% on a divestiture-adjusted basis, with lower margin gas volumes accounting for all of the decline. We expect to keep our divestiture-adjusted year-over-year oil sales volumes and the year-over-year Q4 exit rate oil production relatively flat. 
Given our materially lower capital plans for 2016, this is very noteworthy and a result of exceptional efforts by our employees. We plan to achieve this through starting the production of the Heidelberg spar much earlier than expected, continued outperformance at Lucius, the TEN complex in Ghana coming online as expected in Q3 and an increased focus on our GOM tieback opportunities. 
Leveraging our infrastructure enables us to deliver these incredibly capital-efficient tieback opportunities, which we believe generate rates of return of 30% to 100% even at today's prices. We will also continue to seek innovative ways to monetize assets this year. We already have greater than $1 billion of monetization opportunities that are at very advanced stages, with no current plans to monetize more of our ownership in WGP in this environment. 
As we have done historically with great success, we plan to continue actively managing our portfolio this year and to have other monetizations identified, which will be pursued through the course of the year. The quality of our balance sheet remains a key objective. With the flexibility provided by our reduced capital program, the ongoing benefits of an improved capital and cost structure and our pathway to several near-term monetizations, we are very confident in our ability to maintain or decrease Anadarko's net debt levels this year while spending well inside of our cash inflows. 
We look forward to going into greater detail about our capital plans and expectations for 2016 on our March 1 call, which we look forward to doing as soon as possible, but March 1 will be here soon enough. 
During these times and more than ever, our company's culture, its employees, its track record and its approach to value creation matter, and we believe these are all competitive advantages for Anadarko. 
With that, we'll open it up for questions."

Our wells produced upwards from 6,000 to 10,000 barrels a day. So Caesar/Tonga offers those tieback opportunities, and we have 2 wells. One has been drilled and is in the completion phase.

I think as we think about 2016 and taking the comment that's been made about trying to preserve value, when you consider us, I believe this year, we would estimate that our maintenance CapEx is going to be about 2/3 of what it was in the prior year for maintaining volumes. You couple that with -- we anticipate our oil volumes being relatively flat through the year that only the decline we see on a divestiture-adjusted basis is coming from gas. We believe that at some point, when growth matters again, we're prepared to go back to growth. But I think by lowering that maintenance CapEx 2/3 or 2/3 rather of what it was the prior year, that's pretty impressive in terms of being able to create that value preservation that we're looking for. I think these other longer-data projects, we believe, today, are worthy of spending capital, expecting that oil is not going to be at $30 for the rest of our life. And at some point, we'll only make decisions to take either to sanction or FID any of these longer-dated projects.

But I also believe that the things that we're trying to do to take 2016's environment and making the most out of it is probably the most important agenda at hand.

So again, we'll talk a little bit more about it in the March call, but I think it's going to benefit '17. But no, we will not get through our complete iDUC inventory."

We have concerns of events here that really are well beyond our control. And consequently, until we see events stabilize and we see oil prices, in particular, take on new supply/demand dynamic than it's currently or anticipated in the near future, we will continue to be a very cautious investor in this environment. And you're right, you go back to this call a year ago, I think we were very concerned that this was going to be much longer in its recovery period and it tends to -- at that time, people tended to want to think it might be the case. We also go back to prior periods in history, with some of us that have been around in the oil and gas business a long time, typically, when you go into a down cycle, we've come out of a down cycle with a pretty good price increase. We are a little concerned that this time, there is one dynamic we've never had previously, and that is shale response in a short-cycle investment to a rising price environment. It's not been in the equation previously, and that will probably add to greater volatility in the coming years than we have certainly seen in the last 5, and I would even say, in the last 30. We've just not seen shale in its short-term inventory and its ability to respond to prices in the same way we do now. Now I'm not trying to paint a picture that looks like North American natural gas because here, we've got 94 million barrels a day of demand being maybe oversupplied 1.5 million to 2 million barrels a day. That's a very different environment than natural gas in North America, and so it could correct itself. But as prices move up and the intersection of supply and demand improves prices over time, it'll largely come from a supply contraction in the near term, not from a demand response. And I think all of us and I'd say, most importantly, most economists have been very surprised at the very limited demand response we've seen by the lower petroleum product prices around the world. So it's for those reasons that I think we're taking, again, this year and into '17 a very cautious approach."

We found over 620 feet of high-quality oil play in that well. We're very pleased with it. We also were able to get about 550 feet of core that's important for planning what that development could look like. So that's going to be analyzed, turned over to the reservoir engineers as they put together a scenario for how we might develop that. At the same time, we're looking at drilling Shenandoah 5. We think that's a well that's required. It's off to the East. It'd be kind of between Shenandoah 3 and the original Shenandoah 1, up dip of Shenandoah 3, which was a wet well that encountered very, very good sands, kind of gave us a down-dip limit on the eastern side. So that well should spud here in this first quarter. We have high expectations for it. But we need to drill the well and say, that's what appraisal is all about. Meanwhile, the guys are taking all the information that we obtained from this, rolling it into conceptual planning as to what resources we may be able to recover, how much it might cost, those types of things. And as Al said, we're a long ways from sanction at this point. If Shenandoah 5 is successful, we may move even farther to the east with the Shenandoah 6, but of course, that'll be all dependent on what happens to Shenandoah 5. Yeti, we're pretty much done at Yeti with the assessment of it. We drilled the initial well, had success there in minimizing good oil pay, good reservoirs. We went down-dip with the sidetrack and encountered the water, so that we got a good handle on where the oil-water contact would be. So we've got a fairly good limit on that side of it. We then drilled the Yeti 3 well, which was really an exploratory well with a down-dip tail to get some information on Yeti. But we didn't think it was going to be particularly good well from a hydrocarbon prospectivity in the original Yeti discovery. The upper zone that we were targeting had very good sands, but it was wet. But we were then able to go down to the Middle Miocene, get a core across that interval. So again, get the information that's needed for the teams to put together their development plans. This is going to be a very nice tieback into one of the existing nearby infrastructures. And so the folks are working on that, but again, they got a lot of work to do. And then the commodity prices have to cooperate, along with service costs, to make sure that, that's economically viable project when we do decide to move forward with it."

Whether that market's always there will be a function of the economics. I think as we come out of this cycle, and we certainly, at some point, will, and to what extent we'll find out, I think in the near term, as we come out of the cycle, we will move back to a higher weighting in our short-cycle inventory and move the weighting that we've moved the last couple of years into intermediate and longer-cycle investing and ship that back to short. That, in part, will have something to do with what we believe would be attractive rates of return we can get from our short-cycle investing.

Everything that we've done on the geochemical side is holding up with that type of an interpretation. The Kronos well was not as -- didn't have as well developed sands as maybe we would have hoped, although the objective section does look like it blooms out to the North in a much better area, and we'll be testing that this year. As you move 100 miles to the north of Calasu, we're moving closer to what we look at the depicenter [ph], which is the Magdalena fan system. We are very peripheral to it at Kronos, but in the Calasu, we're getting into a much more proximal portion of it. We saw excellent sand development at Calasu. We had about 17 meters of gas bay in one of the sands. We're working the geochemistry on it to see -- as we went deeper in the well, we seem to be getting evidence of heavier components, but we didn't have any significant accumulation to speak of as we move further down. So -- and the temperature data seem to confirm our interpretation. As we move from Kronos up towards Calasu, the overall basin gets warmer, but it's still a very cool basin. So that -- it still speaks to the, most likely, generative bays being oil in the areas that we're looking. So we're encouraged about what we've seen. We've learned an awful lot. We're now stepping back and deciding what it means to us in the Grand Fort area. At the same time, we acquired a big 3D up in the coal area last year, and we're doing Phase 2 this year. And what we're seeing up there is really exciting and is also -- given the ties that we have from the previous 2 wells, when we take that up into the coal area, it gets us very excited about the prospectively of the coal area. And so Colombia has got a lot more to do. We've got a lot of good data, and so we're rolling that in. We're over at Paon right now. We've got quite a bit of activity at Paon. It's going to take us into the second half of the year, but when we're done there, the rig will come back into Colombia and drill, what we call our purple angel well, which will be testing the Forte area, and probably the Kronos appraisal is really what it's targeted, but it got some exploratory components to it."

Every types -- every asset has a little bit different characteristics. As you think about our DJ Basin position with the mineral interest underlying in there versus the Delaware Basin where we see ourselves in a very attractive yield stream associated with the hydrocarbons being produced there, we can't just pinpoint a number for you as easily as it probably sounds like we should be able to. I think if you think back to a year ago when we were at a much higher price and we were having hesitation then, we have seen our efficiencies improve. We've seen some costs continue to come down. I think you saw that most recently in the fourth quarter. And I think we'll continue to find improvements around efficiencies. And again, we're in the margin business. We're not in the revenue business. So it really is, when our margins return to a level that gives us a wellhead margin that creates an acceptable rate of return, asset-by-asset, that we'll see ourselves going back into our various portfolio opportunities with capital. Until then, we're going to stay in a value-preservation mode."

But all that contributes, and especially, taking into account what Jim Kleckner and his guys are doing in the Gulf of Mexico with the tiebacks. I don't have to sum up -- I'm not spending money this year to get Heidelberg. We've already spent most of the money to get the volumes from the TEN complex. Having a full year of Lucius, that's outperforming expectations, all that blends in to a much lower capital requirement keep our volumes flat year-to-year. And to Al's comment in his opening remarks, we expect to be down on a divestiture-adjusted basis, plus or minus, 1% to 4%. So it kind of says even then that we're not spending even to the level to keep volumes flat. So I think having the flexibility to still focus on our longer-dated assets and keep the sustainability portion of the portfolio going, it is a pretty special thing, and I'm pretty proud of what we've been able to do."

David, obviously, we talked to those bondholders. I'm not in a position to comment on things they might have said about their ability or willingness to continue to hold the bonds I think they need to -- those conversations are best held with the individuals. I will say that certain of them that I've spoken to are concerned about some of the approaches that Moody's, in particular, might take relative to their historic methodology conversations that they've held that caused them to believe that, perhaps, what traditionally were just subcomponents of Moody's methodology become overriding factors and that there's a political dynamic at work that is not necessarily linear relative to the last several years of an approach that we can all rely upon. And that certainly appears to be affecting bondholders comfort with the current situation. I don't believe that same dynamic exists with the views of how S&P is taking, what I would call, more of a traditional, measured response to the commodity price environment. But those are all anecdotal types of things. We don't know that they would come to pass, but they're the types of things that, quite frankly, I think our fixed income holders are concerned about and appropriately so. And then all we can really do in that type of an environment is manage as responsibly as we can, continue to do what we've done historically, focusing on the quality of the assets. The asset coverage, obviously, cash flows are impacting the current environment. And that is a temporary dislocation, even if it exists longer than a year. And we've tried to, and are continuing to manage the portfolio of what we believe is a long-term responsible basis to provide stability as an investor-grade company to those fixed income investors that have relied upon the way that we have traditionally managed the business and the way the rating agencies have traditionally established their parameters."

The ratings are a very high priority for us. I mean, we've said on several occasions that maintaining investment-grade ratings are important to us and very central to the way we want to operate our business model as an international exploration company, as a company that is leading a project, selling LNG volumes are on the world, et cetera. So it's very important to us. Certainly, we've got a lot of flexibility before we -- in our opinion, before we'd need to raise capital in order to address concerns. I think one of the issues is that are their concerns reasonable? And are they addressable by simple knobs that one could turn? We talked about the dividend earlier. We've talked about asset sales. We mentioned north of $1 billion in the near term that would more than fund, in addition to our discretionary cash flow, would more than fund the $2.8 billion budget. We've got a list of assets beyond that, that we're actively working and would expect to be able to execute during 2016. Things that we now talks about, our net debt staying flat or reducing the big variable and reducing leverage there is execution against the asset sales. And if for some reason, we needed to continue to reduce net debt, and weren't able to execute on asset sales, then you continue to work down your list of items that become a little more distasteful. The further down the list you go, but are the types of things that we would have to consider whether or not to pursue, relative to where the rating agencies, where the ratings from all 3 agencies are and whether steps are defined by those agencies that they'd like to see if, indeed, they take actions. So it is -- you're right, we're far more than bystanders. We're actively engaged in addressing this all very proactively. But we also want to make sure that we're doing things that are responsible relative to the true underlying risk and not -- and that true underlying risk isn't always captured in a particular agency's view of an action that they may take at a point in time. So we're just trying to take it all in balance and be responsible and iterative in our approach."

And as the question was asked earlier, and I think Bob appropriately replied, is we look at the yield associated with our common stock at 3%. That's historically high for us.

And we do think there are things that we can invest in, in the intermediate long cycle that, in fact, do just that. But I think at $2.8 billion or the $1.8 billion maintenance number, our ability in this environment to hold oil volumes flat year-over-year on a divestiture-adjusted basis, and are only declining actual volume coming from gas properties, that we're not investing in, is a pretty good indication of what we feel like is the way in which we want to manage through a very difficult and challenging period, and yet have it be capital-responsive to the environment that the hydrocarbon prices are giving us. If you allow ourselves to continue to go, completely into hibernation, and things come out at some point from this cycle and you're not prepared to then take advantage of what you can do, then we've somewhat allowed ourselves to not maximize our equity return for the cost associated with the credit profile.

I think also, you've heard from us today, we'll go into greater detail on March 1 about how we get to that $1.8 billion maintenance CapEx. I've talked repeatedly about our -- what we believe is a very attractive year-over-year sales volume that we're able to achieve, and the only declines coming from natural gas properties that we're not investing in. I also made a comment or 2, and I'll just highlight it again. We have extremely good line of sight today for monetizations in excess of $1 billion, which we hope to be announcing between here and our March 1 conference call. We think that would, and should, address a lot of the concerns and questions that have been posed to us about how we intend to fund our activities in 2016. And I think, one of the things that has probably been lost in the scheme of just exactly who we are and what we are, but I've tried -- I think almost every call to emphasize it, we are a mix of conventional and unconventional resources. And in 2016, you're seeing the benefit of conventional assets coming into the production profile. And that's a very different opportunity set than a lot of other companies have. I think that nice cocktail of mix between conventional and unconventional continue to resonate. I think you'll see it in the way in which our performance plays out through the year. And I do think, and I know a lot of companies talk about this, I'll say it again, we have an exceptional culture with great employees and a tremendous track record of achieving what we established for the year is what we think we can achieve, and want to achieve, and typically go beyond that. So I don't think 2016 will be any different than that. It's definitely going to be a tough year. But the opportunities we have, I think, are quite significant. And I also think the way in which we manage our capital, we manage our business, and we have a culture that can succeed in any environment will be quite important as we get through this year and in the years to come after this. So I appreciate the support we've seen from a lot of investors through this very difficult period. Those of you that have hung in there with us, we greatly appreciate it. Those of you that are new to the investment, we look forward to making sure that everybody feels that we're doing everything we possibly can.

And I'd also like to take a moment and just say, Shandell, welcome to the organization that John has built, and also introduce Mitch Ingram. Many of you know that Mitch joined us in the fourth quarter of last year as EVP of LNG, coming to us from BG Group, where he's an Executive Vice President of the technical aspects of the company as well as a member of the Executive Committee. Mitch's background with BG includes accomplishments, most noteworthy is the accomplishment he achieved associated with our Queensland Curtis LNG project. 
Additionally, I'd like to say how proud I am of our employees who served and proved more than once in the challenges of last year just how great they were at navigating the uncertain price environment we anticipated as we entered 2015. Through their combined efforts, we outperformed our initial expectations by increasing our higher-margin oil sales and volumes while spending significantly less capital and improving our cost structure and enhancing efficiencies. We also closed $2 billion of monetizations.
Additionally, during the year, we reduced our capital spending by almost 40%, and oil prices fell by almost 50% over that time horizon. We organically replaced more than 130% of our production with reserve additions at a cost of about $14 per BOE. We also significantly increased the percentage of our reserves and improved developed category to 80% at year-end 2015 compared to 30 -- compared to 69% at the end of 2014. These achievements position us well to manage through the market's uncertainty and volatility we see in the coming years. 
As I mentioned in last night's news release and later this month, we will recommend a capital program to our Board that reflects our view of 2016 and beyond. Our preliminary expectation is that APC will spend about $2.8 billion this year, which is roughly half of what we spent in 2015 and 70% less than our expenditures in 2014. As stated on other occasions, we will favor value preservation and allocating this capital, and as such, our short-cycle U.S. onshore investments would be impacted the most. 
Frankly, even with 2 of the best assets in North America, we don't find the returns in this environment to be compelling. Therefore, we are choosing to fund a reduced program in the Wattenberg field and only a delineation and lease preservation program in the Delaware Basin as we seek to preserve these shorter-cycle opportunities for a better day. 
Even with these reductions, our total sales volumes across the company are expected to only decline by 1% to 4% on a divestiture-adjusted basis, with lower margin gas volumes accounting for all of the declines. We expect to keep our divestiture-adjusted year-over-year oil sales volumes and the year-over-year Q4 exit rate oil production relatively flat. 
Given our materially lower capital plans for 2016, this is very noteworthy and a result of exceptional efforts by our employees. We plan to achieve this through starting the production of the Heidelberg spar much earlier than expected, continued outperformance at Lucius, the TEN complex in Ghana coming online as expected in Q3 and an increased focus on our GOM tieback opportunities. 
Leveraging our infrastructure enables us to deliver these incredibly capital-efficient tieback opportunities, which we believe generate rates of return of 30% to 100% even at today's prices. We will also continue to seek innovative ways to monetize assets this year. We already have greater than $1 billion of monetization opportunities that are at very advanced stages, with no current plans to monetize more of our ownership in WGP in this environment. 
As we have done historically with great success, we plan to continue actively managing our portfolio this year and have other monetizations identified, which will be pursued through the course of the year. The quality of our balance sheet remains a key objective. With the flexibility provided by our reduced capital program, the ongoing benefits of an improved capital and cost structure and our pathway to several near-term monetizations, we are very confident in our ability to maintain or decrease Anadarko's net debt levels this year while spending well inside of our cash inflows. 
We look forward to going into greater detail about our capital plans and expectations for 2016 on our March 1 call, which we look forward to doing as soon as possible, but March 1 will be here soon enough. 
During these times and more than ever, our company's culture, its employees, its track record and its approach to value creation matter, and we believe these are all competitive advantages for Anadarko. 
With that, we'll open it up for questions."

I think as we think about 2016 and taking the comment that's been made about trying to preserve value, when you consider that-- I believe this year, we would estimate that our maintenance CapEx is going to be about 2/3 of what it was in the prior year for maintaining volumes.

We believe that at some point, when growth matters again, we're prepared to go back to growth.

I know that there's obviously some issues around debt maturities and stuff like that, that, perhaps, some people think is weighing on the balance sheet-- or on the share price. Our feedback is probably just as much about whether there's still an active acquisition appetite at Anadarko. So I wonder if you could maybe just take a minute to just give us an explanation as to why you have thought the Apache deal was attractive to Anadarko. Could those concerns go to rest once for all. I'll leave it there."

I think, really, the comments that we made back in November associated with the press release that day is about all I have to say on that matter. There really is nothing else that I can add to it. In addition, I think we continue to make the comment or reaffirm here, the acquisitions that we're most interested in have to do with areas that we have focused areas of concentrated operations, be that in the DJ Basin or in the Delaware Basin, very competitive places in which we buy things. But those are the focus that we would have today. But I also believe that the things that we're trying to do to take 2016's environment and making the most out of it is probably the most important agenda at hand. I think getting through this year, being able to keep our oil volumes flat on a divestiture-adjusted basis, the only reduction we see in volumes coming through gas properties that we're not investing in, in this market, those are the things that, I think, we will do this year while preserving the balance sheet and looking at it as a key objective for improving the quality where we can. Because I made the comment earlier and I'll reaffirm here, I think we believe we can maintain net debt at a level that it's at today, if not reduce it further, while still meeting the capital objectives that I laid out this morning."

We have concerns of events here that really are well beyond our control. And consequently, until we see events stabilize and we see oil prices, in particular, take on new supply/demand dynamic than is currently in the market or anticipated in the near future, we will continue to be a very cautious investor in this environment. And you're right, you go back to this call a year ago, I think we were very concerned that this was going to be much longer in its recovery period and it tends to -- at that time, people tended to want to think it might be the case. We also go back to prior periods in history, when some of us that have been around in the oil and gas business a long time, typically, when you go into a down cycle, we've come out of a down cycle with a pretty good price increase. We are a little concerned that this time, there is one dynamic we've never had previously, and that is shale response in a short-cycle investment to a rising price environment has not been in the equation previously, and that will probably add to greater volatility in the coming years than we have certainly seen in the last 5, and I would even say, in the last 30. We've just not seen shale in its short-term inventory and its ability to respond to prices in the same way we do now. Now I'm not trying to paint a picture that looks like North American natural gas because here, we've got 94 million barrels a day of demand being maybe oversupplied 1.5 million to 2 million barrels a day. That's a very different environment than natural gas in North America, and so it could correct itself. But as prices move up and the intersection of supply and demand improves prices over time, it'll largely come from a supply contraction in the near term, not from a demand response. And I think all of us and I'd say, most importantly, most economists have been very surprised at the very limited demand response we've seen by the lower petroleum product prices around the world. So it's for those reasons that I think we're taking, again, this year and into '17 a very cautious approach."

We found over 620 feet of high-quality oil play in that well. We're very pleased with it. We also were able to get about 550 feet of core that's important for planning what that development could look like. So that's going to be analyzed, turned over to the reservoir engineers as they put together a scenario for how we might develop that. At the same time, we're looking at drilling Shenandoah 5. We think that's a well that's required. It's off to the East. It'd be kind of between Shenandoah 3 and the original Shenandoah 1, up dip of Shenandoah 3, which was a wet well that encountered very, very good sands, kind of gave us a down-dip limit on the eastern side. So that well should spud here in this first quarter. We have high expectations for it. But we need to drill the well and say, that's what appraisal is all about. Meanwhile, the guys are taking all the information that we obtained from this, rolling it into conceptual planning as to what resources we may be able to recover, how much it might cost, those types of things. And as Al said, we're a long ways from sanction at this point. If Shenandoah 5 is successful, we may move even farther to the east with the Shenandoah 6, but of course, that'll be all dependent on what happens to Shenandoah 5. Yeti, we're pretty much done at Yeti with the assessment of it. We drilled the initial well, had success there in Middle Miocene, good oil pay, good reservoirs. We went down-dip with the sidetrack and encountered the water, so that we got a good handle on where the oil-water contact would be. So we've got a fairly good limit on that side of it. We then drilled the Yeti 3 well, which was really an exploratory well with a down-dip tail to get some information on Yeti. But we didn't think it was going to be particularly good well from a hydrocarbon prospectivity in the original Yeti discovery. The upper zone that we were targeting had very good sands, but it was wet. But we were then able to go down to the Middle Miocene, get a core across that interval. So again, get the information that's needed for the teams to put together their development plans. This is going to be a very nice tieback into one of the existing nearby infrastructures. And so the folks are working on that, but again, they got a lot of work to do. And then the commodity prices have to cooperate, along with service costs, to make sure that, that's an economically viable project when we do decide to move forward with it."

Whether that market's always there will be a function of the economics. I think as we come out of this cycle, and we certainly, at some point, will, and to what extent we'll find out, I think in the near term, as we come out of the cycle, we will move back to a higher weighting in our short-cycle inventory and move the weighting that we've moved the last couple of years into intermediate and longer-cycle investing and ship that back to short. That, in part, will have something to do with what we believe would be attractive rates of return we can get from our short-cycle investing.

I've talked about the Kronos well on our last call where we found 130 to 230 feet of gas bay that looked to be biodegraded thermogenic oil based on the geochemistry. Everything that we've done on the geochemical side is holding up with that type of an interpretation. The Kronos well was not as -- didn't have as well developed sands as maybe we would have hoped, although the objective section does look like it blooms out to the North in a much better area, and we'll be testing that this year. As you move 100 miles to the north of Calasu, we're moving closer to what we look at the depicenter [ph], which is the Magdalena fan system. We are very peripheral to it at Kronos, but in the Calasu, we're getting into a much more proximal portion of it. We saw excellent sand development at Calasu. We had about 17 meters of gas bay in one of the sands. We're working the geochemistry on it to see -- as we went deeper in the well, we seem to be getting evidence of heavier components, but we didn't have any significant accumulation of-- to speak of as we move further down. So -- and the temperature data seem to confirm our interpretation. As we move from Kronos up towards Calasu, the overall basin gets warmer, but it's still a very cool basin. So that -- it still speaks to the, most likely, generative bays being oil in the areas that we're looking. So we're encouraged about what we've seen. We've learned an awful lot. We're now stepping back and deciding what it means to us in the Grand Fuerte area. At the same time, we acquired a big 3D up in the coal area last year, and we're doing Phase 2 this year. And what we're seeing up there is really exciting and is also -- given the ties that we have from the previous 2 wells, when we take that up into the coal area, it gets us very excited about the prospectively of the coal area. And so Colombia has got a lot more to do. We've got a lot of good data, and so we're rolling that in. We're over at Paon right now. We've got quite a bit of activity at Paon. It's going to take us into the second half of the year, but when we're done there, the rig will come back into Colombia and drill, what we call our purple angel well, which will be testing the Fuerte area, and probably the Kronos appraisal is really what it's targeted, but it got some exploratory components to it."

So that dislocation is -- we believe, is going to continue. We don't find the margins, that we're seeing today, to be attractive for the reasons I have talked about this morning. And I think indicative of how we've, over time, done things, our ability with a substantially reduced capital plan, 50%, down from last year's 70%, down from 2014, being able to maintain oil volumes flat year-over-year on a divestiture-adjusted basis speaks to the quality of a portfolio that has a good mix of conventional and unconventional resources to lean on.

As you think about our DJ Basin position with the mineral interest underlying it there versus the Delaware Basin where we see ourselves in a very attractive yield stream associated with the hydrocarbons being produced there, we can't just pinpoint a number for you as easily as it probably sounds like we should be able to. I think if you think back to a year ago when we were at a much higher price and we were having hesitation then, we have seen our efficiencies improve. We've seen some costs continue to come down. I think you saw that most recently in the fourth quarter. And I think we'll continue to find improvements around efficiencies. And again, we're in the margin business. We're not in the revenue business.

I don't have to sum up -- I'm not spending money this year to get Heidelberg. We've already spent most of the money to get the volumes from the TEN complex. Having a full year of Lucius that's outperforming expectations, all that blends in to a much lower capital requirement keep our volumes flat year-to-year. And to Al's comment in his opening remarks, we expect to be down on a divestiture-adjusted basis, plus or minus, 1% to 4%. So it kind of says even then that we're not spending even to the level to keep volumes flat.

David, obviously, we talked to those bondholders. I'm not in a position to comment on things they might have said about their ability or willingness to continue to hold the bonds I think they need to -- those conversations are best held with the individuals. I will say that certain of them that I've spoken to are concerned about some of the approaches that Moody's, in particular, might take relative to their historic methodology conversations that they've held that caused them to believe that, perhaps, what traditionally were just subcomponents of Moody's methodology become overriding factors and that there's a political dynamic at work that is not necessarily linear relative to the last several years of an approach that we can all rely upon. And that certainly appears to be affecting bondholders comfort with the current situation. I don't believe that same dynamic exists with the views of how S&P is taking, what I would call, more of a traditional, measured response to the commodity price environment. But those are all anecdotal types of things. We don't know that they would come to pass, but they're the types of things that, quite frankly, I think our fixed income holders are concerned about and appropriately so. And then all we can really do in that type of an environment is manage as responsibly as we can, continue to do what we've done historically, focusing on the quality of the assets. The asset coverage, obviously, cash flows are impacting the current environment. And that is a temporary dislocation, even if it exists longer than a year.

The ratings are a very high priority for us. I mean, we've said on several occasions that maintaining investment-grade ratings are important to us and very central to the way we want to operate our business model as an international exploration company, as a company that is leading a project, selling LNG volumes are on the world, et cetera. So it's very important to us. Certainly, we've got a lot of flexibility before we -- in our opinion, before we would need to raise capital in order to address concerns. I think one of the issues is that are the concerns reasonable? And are they addressable by simple knobs that one could turn? We talked about the dividend earlier. We've talked about asset sales. We mentioned north of $1 billion in the near term that would more than fund, in addition to our discretionary cash flow, would more than fund the $2.8 billion budget. We've got a list of assets beyond that, that we're actively working and would expect to be able to execute during 2016. Things that are what Al talked about, our net debt staying flat or reducing the big variable and reducing leverage there is execution against the asset sales. And if for some reason, we needed to continue to reduce net debt, and weren't able to execute on asset sales, then you continue to work down your list of items that become a little more distasteful the further down the list you go, but are the types of things that we would have to consider whether or not to pursue, relative to where the rating agencies, where the ratings from all 3 agencies are and whether steps are defined by those agencies that they'd like to see if, indeed, they take actions. So it is -- you're right, we're far more than bystanders. We're actively engaged in addressing this all very proactively. But we also want to make sure that we're doing things that are responsible relative to the true underlying risk and not -- and that true underlying risk isn't always captured in a particular agency's view of an action that they may take at a point in time. So we're just trying to take it all in balance and be responsible and iterative in our approach."

And as the question was asked earlier, and I think Bob appropriately replied, is we look at the yield associated with our common stock at 3%, that's historically high for us. So we look forward to discussing that with our Board. And I believe those are the most important variables in the near term that we can address."

And we do think there are things that we can invest in, in the intermediate long cycle that, in fact, do just that. But I think at $2.8 billion or the $1.8 billion maintenance number, our ability in this environment to hold oil volumes flat year-over-year on a divestiture-adjusted basis, and our only decline in actual volume coming from gas properties, that we're not investing in, is a pretty good indication of what we feel like is the way in which we want to manage through a very difficult and challenging period, and yet have it be capital-responsive to the environment that the hydrocarbon prices are giving us. If you allow ourselves to continue to go completely into hibernation, and things come out at some point from this cycle and you're not prepared to then take advantage of what you can do, then we've somewhat allowed ourselves to not maximize our equity return for the cost associated with the credit profile. And I think Bob addressed it beautifully, exactly what we feel like we want to do in order to maintain the highest credit quality as possible, at the same time, not stall out our equity story."

I think also, you've heard from us today, we'll go into greater detail on March 1 about how we get to that $1.8 billion maintenance CapEx. I've talked repeatedly about our -- what we believe is a very attractive year-over-year sales volume that we're able to achieve, and the only declines coming from natural gas properties that we're not investing in. I also made a comment or 2, and I'll just highlight it again. We have extremely good line of sight today for monetizations in excess of $1 billion, which we hope to be announcing between here and our March 1 conference call. We think that would, and should, address a lot of the concerns and questions that have been posed to us about how we intend to fund our activities in 2016. And I think, one of the things that has probably been lost in the scheme of just exactly who we are and what we are, but I've tried -- I think almost every call to emphasize it, we are a mix of conventional and unconventional resources. And in 2016, you're seeing the benefit of conventional assets coming into the production profile. And that's a very different opportunity set than a lot of other companies have. I think that nice cocktail of mix between conventional and unconventional continue to resonate. I think you'll see it in the way in which our performance plays out through the year. And I do think, and I know a lot of companies talk about this, I'll say it again, we have an exceptional culture with great employees and a tremendous track record of achieving what we established for the year is what we think we can achieve, and want to achieve, and typically go beyond that. So I don't think 2016 will be any different than that. It's definitely going to be a tough year. But the opportunities we have, I think, are quite significant. And I also think the way in which we manage our capital, we manage our business, and we have a culture that can succeed in any environment will be quite important as we get through this year and in the years to come after this. So I appreciate the support we've seen from a lot of investors through this very difficult period. Those of you that have hung in there with us, we greatly appreciate it. Those of you that are new to the investment, we look forward to making sure that everybody feels that we're doing everything we possibly can.

I think it almost goes without saying that things feel better today than it did 90 days ago, both for our industry and for investors. The very fragile energy capital markets we've seen for most of the first quarter appear t",674,"Thanks, John, and good morning. I think it almost goes without saying that things feel better today than it did 90 days ago, both for our industry and for investors. The very fragile energy capital markets we've seen for most of the first quarter appear to be stabilizing, the outlook for commodity prices are improving and I think, for industry, our operating environment is definitely strengthening. 
As a company, our employees delivered very solid results despite the challenges in the first quarter. As a company, we're poised to take advantage of the market as opportunity to develop. 
If I could, let me take a moment and recap what we achieved in the first quarter. We announced a capital plan that was 60% [ph] lower than 2015 and 70% lower than 2014. Our cap plan produces all volumes are expected to be flat year-over-year as well as on an exit rate basis. We monetized $1.3 billion of assets with another $700 million expected in the second quarter. 
We will continue to be an industry leader in active portfolio management. 
We reduced our dividend 81%, which we believe will save us $450 million of cash per annum. And we positioned our company to be more successful financially and operationally in the years ahead if prices stay lower.
Our savings from these efforts, we believe, will increase our ability to be more cost-efficient and should provide more than $350 million of costs in savings per annum. 
We issued $3 billion of fixed income securities to refinance our 2016 debt and the first 125 -- pardon me, $1.25 billion of our 2017 debt at very attractive rates and terms. 
Operationally, we continued to set a very high bar. As you've seen, our reductions in various cost savings, LOE per barrel improved 22% in the first quarter versus the prior year. Our liquids mix continues to increase, and our well costs in the DJ were reduced 11% from the year before to a level today of about $2.4 million per well. 
The Delaware Basin also has seen really good efforts as well with cost reductions, where their wells are costing us $1 million per well less quarter-over-quarter to about $6.2 million per copy. 
What can you expect from us through the balance of the year? Do not expect us to increase our capital spending this year even if oil exceeds $50. We could reallocate some of our savings in our budget to increase capital to certain places like the Delaware basin. We'll be very patient as we look beyond 2016 to a sustained higher price environment to increase capital and return to a growth mode, if warranted. 
Our operations report includes various highlights across our portfolio, and I encourage you to take a look at that for more details as your time permits.
Our employees have done an incredible job, as I mentioned earlier, during this first quarter, maintaining a focus on safety and productivity, meeting the challenges of a workforce reduction without losing focus on our operating results, being aggressive with portfolio management and diligent in our divestiture process. They consistently and constantly look for ways to improve our business and manage through this volatile cycle successfully. 
Working to improve our financial position is something we think about everyday, and I think the most recent example of that is the receipt of our cash tax refund approaching $1 billion through a lot of good efforts. Our combined efforts to improve our cash inflows will position us through the balance of the year to reduce our net debt. 
In closing, I think we've taken the right actions in the first quarter to position Anadarko for success. We do believe we're going to continue to see improving commodity prices, but however, near-term volatility remains a concern. 
Our industry and company are both in a much better place than we were 90 days ago, and it gives us renewed optimism this cycle is on a track to much better investment returns. 
With that, why don't we open it up for questions?"

It's partly some of the complexities that we are seeing out there, mostly on the imaging side of it. Not necessarily that we're seeing lots of bad surprises, although we did to our most recent wells, realize that there are some faults that we're poorly to not imaged and some of the seismic data that we're going to have to build into a potential development plan. And so that means that we needed a few more appraisal wells to make sure that there's not any more compartmentalization as we move across. So those are the issues that we're looking at. I'd say it's mostly based around the qualitative image in the sub-salt and making sure that what we're seeing or interpreting is actual reality, and so we're drilling the 5 well now to the west and pushing that down quite significantly to proof of those volumes as we move over. And then with success there, we've moved over even farther to the -- I'm sorry, to the east, and we've moved over even farther to the east with a number 6 well. So those are what's happening there. The biggest issue on timing and making sure that we have the data is -- this is going to be a big development if we move forward with it, and it's going to be an expensive development. And you want to know what the well deliverability is going to be, what the actual resources greater than anyone a come up with a solution that actually makes sense for this resource. And it's in a technically challenging environment from a pressure standpoint. We have to make sure we get it right before we take those final decisions.

So the comments and the concerns associated with Heidelberg leave me a little bit in the category of scratching my head. Now as it relates to oil volumes through the course of the year, as I'm sure you can appreciate in a capital-intensive business, onshore, we have certain places where we're adding to capital and certain places we're taking away. But I think we have given you largely the types of volumes we anticipate through the year. The one thing that we can't anticipate and schedule well is listings. And listings sometimes happen either to our advantage or disadvantage.

I think, as we've talked about this year, we see a number of tieback opportunities in the Gulf of Mexico that have very attractive potential rates of return if they're drilled out successfully.",472,"Yes, understandable question, Paul. Thank you for asking it. I think, as we've talked about this year, we see a number of tieback opportunities in the Gulf of Mexico that have very attractive potential rates of return if they're drilled out successfully. The you may see those categorized as exploration or exploitation. Certainly, the existence of infrastructure allows us to go out and drill something today that is an exploration well, with the ability to tie it back to existing infrastructure and reduce the development costs. I think the area that you're focused on and accurately so is if we're looking at true new infrastructure to support exploration efforts, are we likely to do that in an environment where we're drilling below salt? And I think today, as we made the comment on the last call, that's pretty challenging a bit of arithmetic. So I think we'll continue to look for opportunities in the near term, for which we've given some detail in our ops report and other commentary around it, that we think in the Gulf of Mexico, we have really good opportunities to tie back to infrastructure, to take advantage of our exploitation, exploration and development that we see there. Outside the U.S., we look at places where basically, in a post-salt environment where the well costs are substantially less, as I know you fully appreciate. And there, as we have before, we see exploration creating option value for the future. It turned out to be a pretty good premise, for which we think that our business strategy, and I know you know it quite well, but when we think about short-term, medium-term and long-term cycling of cash, cycling of cash for us in the short term has produced extremely good rates of return and good characteristics of cash-on-cash. The medium- and long-term cycling is more to create that option value and enhance value for the future. Whether we take that to production and development will be dependent upon the pricing environment at that time. So I'm not probably inching your questions as specifically as you answered it, but I am trying to approach it from the standpoint, it still fits in the business model, which I think we've done a pretty good job of since 2007 of staying within. And that's just simply thinking about the cycling of cash, the rates of return for the near term, thinking about the value added from the long term from an option standpoint, staying within cash inflows with our investment and being mindful of early aggressive portfolio management in order to enhance these rates of return of the value creation. And maybe if I could go have Bob Daniels talk a little bit about what you're seeing specifically in other areas with our exploration beyond just the quantitative assessment I gave you."

The rig from there will move back into Colombia and do an appraisal well on our Kronos discovery and follow that up, hopefully next year, with some additional work down in the forte area. Meanwhile, we're acquiring a huge -- the second half of a huge 3D up in coal area and the Deepwater Colombia. We really are excited with what we're seeing on the first phase and looking to that second phase done and putting that will put them together. in the meanwhile in the Gulf, Al mentioned, all the type asked and your infrastructure work that we're doing next year.

So we anticipate good performance of our additional wells at Heidelberg. As an example, and part answer to the prior question, we initiated Phase 2 Caesar-Tonga last year.

And I think the broader property market certainly has a pretty good depth of private equity chasing it. But I think the other thing, and I continue to highlight this, is that when we look to monetize an asset, many times, we are a seller of choice from the standpoint that they're not taking on operational problems you might be taking on with less capitalized companies or companies that don't have the operational history and success that we've had. So I think the fact that we've been a good prudent operator for a long time, we're a brand name, if you want to call it that, in our space, when we choose to redeploy capital by exiting a particular property, you're not taking on problems that you might with a smaller or less well-known company. And that, to date, is to our benefit, as you've seen a very successful effort in the last 2 years to monetize properties into, I think anyone would describe as a very difficult environment. Now Bob Gwin deals within day in and day out, and I would really like for him to please add to those comments."

And with the improvement in forward curve, we've seen some strengthening in the interests for those assets. And it doesn't take a whole lot of improvement on the price side to get so materially better economics at the outside level. And so as you would expect, you see that read through in terms of level of interest and in terms of the bids that we receive. And obviously, on all these assets, we're evaluating this old case versus the whole case.

I don't think there's going to be likened to onshore U.S., where  it becomes the prevailing methodology of drilling these wells. But in the case of the Paon wells and the development of that field or the appraisal of that field, we have very, very good imaging of the reservoir section using some in-house techniques that have allowed us to ahead of the wells, potentially predict plus minus 10% accuracy, the gross sand count. And so we were able to really place the well very, very accurately. And what it allows us to do then is also more reservoir section for DST that will give us data earlier on deliverability conductivity, those types of things. So there was an application here that sped up the evaluation process. But the only reason we could do it is because we knew very, very accurately what to expect in the wellbore and how to place the lateral section. So it worked very well. We are doing very entry of the #3. We also have a high angle sidetrack out of it to monitor the DST results. But will have applications better, it's not to be the tremendously widespread."

So therefore, it doesn't seem to create for us the problems it seems to be creating for others. maybe haven't taken as much time to look at it as we'd like them to. I think the other thing is you have to realize is that we have a very limited cost basis in this development. If you recall, a few years ago, we farmed down our interest there, and almost all of our development cost has been borne by a third-party. In fact, there's still carry left associated with that farm-down. So therefore, if you're thinking about impairments, if you're thinking about balance sheet treatment, this asset would be carried on our books very differently than maybe some of our partners. So if people would take those 2 together, they might understand that we're not as concerned about Heidelberg as certainly appears to be some people are as it might relate to our partner.

They look at the activation costs of liquids and oil versus what they think is a fairly good market for natural gas at a good market for those folks, as I listen to them, as they feel very good about the ability of natural gas to run the $3 or more. From where we are today, they see that product, if you want to call it a quality product, just refer to is product, having better sustainability in the near term with less volatility than oil.

So if I could just stay with Anadarko only for a minute because typically, in the past at least, when we make an upstream investment, we think about the cost of also getting that to whatever the delivery points, so that midstream buildout is a part of the upstream spend. So it would be a rate of return that would include getting the product into a market. Now that's different than Western Gas. I know you fully appreciate that. That's what going back to 2008, we sold those 2 markets valuing the assets different the. And while we put Western Gas in place as a result, we thought like it's really give us a lot of optionality around 2 distinct assets, although from the standpoint of the investment, if you can't move a hydrocarbon into a market, then you haven't completed the cost of completion. So when we look at whatever we're doing new or whatever Darrell maybe as an example is thinking about incrementally in the Delaware basin, that buildout, if it's on our nickel, will include that rate of return bundled will be the upstream. Now it's Western Gas evolves and as lifecycle and becomes larger, in many cases, particularly, say, for instance, in the Permian, we're Western Gas has a lot of stand-alone third-party business, then that becomes a little bit different equation. And maybe with that, if I could, I'll let Bob just approach it a little bit with Darrell by saying that you do have a bifurcation, where Western Gas has its own rates of return and has its own rates of return.

Let me start by saying having infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico definitely separates us from many, but not all of our peers. It allows companies like ourselves to be able to look to commercialize opportunities in this price environment at attractive rates of return that we wouldn't be able to even consider without the leverage of that infrastructure. Consequently, as we think about the infrastructure we have today, we're pretty comforted by the fact that it gives us that kind of optionality. And whether it's for our own volumes, as you described, or for the production handling agreement that we would have in place to move that for others, we see that as a real strategic advantage for us. And I might ask Jim to handle the second part of your question and ask Bob Danielson with the third part."

And as Al stated, those tiebacks provide very good opportunities because they're generally high flow rate wells with very little connection costs to the existing subsea infrastructure. In a lot of cases where we have the infrastructure already installed and we have available processing capacity and pipeline takeout capacity, we can lever that infrastructure, which has already been depreciated, not only with our own equity opportunities, as we've mentioned, in Caesar-Tonga and some of our infield wells and Lucius, but also with other tieback that may be close proximity to our hubs. And so oftentimes, you'll find other operators, who have had discoveries, who may be not as large to justify a greenfield development but have tieback capability within distances, within negotiated process handling agreements. So those opportunities are out there. We continue to seek those as well as operators seek those tieback to us. Regarding the Miocene opportunity, after what we currently have identified all that -- I'll address that from an exploration standpoint. ."

I think it almost goes without saying that things feel better today than it did 90 days ago, both for our industry and for investors. The very fragile energy capital markets we've seen for most of the first quarter appear to be stabilizing, the outlook for commodity prices are improving and I think for industry, our operating environment is definitely strengthening. As a company, our employees delivered very solid results despite the challenges in the first quarter. As a company, we're poised to take advantage of the market as opportunities develop. 
If I could, let me take a moment and recap what we achieved in the first quarter. We announced a capital plan that was 50% lower than 2015 and 70% lower than 2014. Our cap plan produces all volumes are expected to be flat year-over-year as well as on an exit rate basis. We monetized $1.3 billion of assets with another $700 million expected in the second quarter. We will continue to be an industry leader in active portfolio management. 
We reduced our dividend 81%, which we believe will save us $450 million of cash per annum, and we positioned our company to be more successful financially and operationally in the years ahead if prices stay lower. Our savings from these efforts, we believe, will increase our ability to be more cost-efficient and should provide more than $350 million of costs in savings per annum. We issued $3 billion of fixed income securities to refinance our 2016 debt and the first 125 -- well, pardon me, $1.25 billion of our 2017 debt at very attractive rates and terms. 
Operationally, we continue to set a very high bar. As you've seen, our reductions in various cost savings, LOE per barrel improved 22% in the first quarter versus the prior year. Our liquids mix continues to increase and our well costs in the DJ were reduced 11% from the year before to a level today of about $2.4 million per well. The Delaware Basin also has seen really good efforts as well with cost reductions where their wells are costing us $1 million per well less quarter-over-quarter to about $6.2 million per copy. 
What can you expect from us through the balance of the year? Do not expect us to increase our capital spending this year even if oil exceeds $50. We could reallocate some of our savings in our budget to increase capital to certain plays like the Delaware basin. We'll be very patient as we look beyond 2016 to a sustained higher price environment to increase capital and return to a growth mode, if warranted. Our operations report includes various highlights across our portfolio, and I encourage you to take a look at that for more details as your time permits.
Our employees have done an incredible job, as I mentioned earlier, during this first quarter, maintaining a focus on safety and productivity, meeting the challenges of a workforce reduction without losing focus on our operating results, being aggressive with portfolio management and diligent in our divestiture process. They've consistently and constantly look for ways to improve our business and manage through this volatile cycle successfully. 
Working to improve our financial position is something we think about every day, and I think the most recent example of that is the receipt of our cash tax refund approaching $1 billion through a lot of good efforts. Our combined efforts to improve our cash inflows will position us through the balance of the year to reduce our net debt. 
In closing, I think we've taken the right actions in the first quarter to position Anadarko for success. We do believe we're going to continue to see improving commodity prices, but however, near-term volatility remains a concern. Our industry and company are both in a much better place than we were 90 days ago, and it gives us renewed optimism this cycle is on a track to much better investment returns. 
With that, why don't we open it up for questions?"

So we're going to take a look at the value of that asset over time, just like we do with the rest of the assets in our monetization program.

Doug, on the wells and the appraisal program, it's partly scale, it's partly -- some of the complexities that we're seeing out there, mostly on the imaging side of it, not necessarily that we're seeing lots of bad surprises. Although we did, through our most recent wells, realize that there are some faults that we're poorly to not imaged and some of the seismic data that we're going to have to build into a potential development plan. And so that means that we needed a few more appraisal wells to make sure that there's not any more compartmentalization as we move across. So those are the issues that we're looking at. I'd say it's mostly based around the quality of the image in the sub-salt and making sure that what we're seeing or interpreting is actual reality, and so we're drilling the 5 well now to the West and pushing that downdip quite significantly to prove up of those volumes as we move over. And then with success there, we'd move over even farther to the -- I'm sorry, to the East, and we'd move over even farther to the East with the #6 well. So those are what's happening there. The biggest issue on timing and making sure that we have the data is -- this can be a big development if we move forward with it. And it's going to be an expensive development and you want to know what the well deliverabilities are going to be, what your actual resources range are going to and you want to come up with a solution that actually makes sense for this resource. And it's in a technically challenging environment from a pressure standpoint. We have to make sure we get it right before we take those final decisions.

As the wells that we expect to drill and have produced to date, they performed as we anticipated. So the comments and the concerns associated with Heidelberg leave me a little bit in the category of scratching my head. Now as it relates to oil volumes through the course of the year, as I'm sure you can appreciate in a capital-intensive business, onshore, we have certain places where we're adding to capital and certain places we're taking away. But I think we have given you largely the types of volumes we anticipate through the year. The one thing that we can't anticipate and schedule well is liftings. And liftings sometimes happen either to our advantage or disadvantage. But I think the thing that we still feel like, and I made this in my earlier comments, is that we believe, for the year, we will be flat year-over-year on all volumes and probably, just as importantly, on an exit rate basis, so no change from our perspective on that."

Understandable question, Paul. Thank you for asking it. I think, as we've talked about this year, we see a number of tieback opportunities in the Gulf of Mexico that have very attractive potential rates of return if they're drilled out successfully.",480,"Yes. Understandable question, Paul. Thank you for asking it. I think, as we've talked about this year, we see a number of tieback opportunities in the Gulf of Mexico that have very attractive potential rates of return if they're drilled out successfully. You may see those categorized as exploration or exploitation. Certainly, the existence of infrastructure allows us to go out and drill something today that is an exploration well, with the ability to tie it back to existing infrastructure and reduce the development costs. I think the area that you're focused on, and accurately so, is if we're looking at true new infrastructure to support exploration efforts, are we likely to do that in an environment where we're drilling below salt? And I think, today, as we made the comment on the last call, that's pretty challenging a bit of arithmetic. So I think we'll continue to look for opportunities in the near term, for which we've given some good detail in our ops report and other color commentary around it, that we think in the Gulf of Mexico, we have really good opportunities to tie back to infrastructure to take advantage of our exploitation, exploration and development that we see there. Outside the U.S., we look at places where, basically, in a post-salt environment where the well costs are substantially less, as I know you fully appreciate. And there, as we have before, we see exploration creating option value for the future. That turned out to be a pretty good premise for which we think that our business strategy, and I know you know it quite well, but when we think about short-term, medium-term and long-term cycling of cash, cycling of cash for us in the short term has produced extremely good rates of return and good characteristics of cash-on-cash. The medium- and long-term cycling is more to create that option value and enhance value for the future. Whether we take that to production and development will be dependent upon the price environment at that time. So I'm not -- I mean, I'm not probably inching your question as specifically as you answered it, but I am trying to approach it from the standpoint it still fits in the business model, which I think we've done a pretty good job of since 2007 of staying within. And that's just simply thinking about the cycling of cash, the rates of return for the near term, thinking about the value added from the long term, from an option standpoint, staying within cash inflows with our investing and being mindful of early aggressive portfolio management in order to enhance these rates of return of the value creation. And -- well, maybe if I could go have Bob Daniels talk a little bit about what we're seeing specifically in other areas with our exploration beyond just the quantitative assessment I gave you."

We've slowed down like we've done in all sectors of our business given the cash flows that we have now in the capital program. But this year, we're in Côte d’Ivoire drilling appraisal wells and then we're going to do a DST at our Paon complex. And then follow that up with 2 exploratory wells to the South and exploration acreage we have adjacent to that. So that's all are going to be very interesting. The rig from there, we'll move back into Colombia and do an appraisal well on our Kronos discovery and follow that up, hopefully, next year, with some additional work down in the Fuerte area. Meanwhile, we're acquiring a huge -- the second half of a huge 3D up in Col area and the deepwater Colombia. We really are excited with what we're seeing on the first phase and looking forward to get that second phase done and putting that whole program together. And then meanwhile in the Gulf, Al mentioned the -- all the tiebacks and all the -- near infrastructure work that we're doing this year. And that is similar to what we're doing at Phobos where we have discovery in the lower tertiary that we're going to try to get on appraisal later in the year. So we've got quite a few things that are going on. And when you look out to the future, 16 million acres in the deepwater of Colombia, we picked up our current high bidder for new blocks in the Gulf of Mexico. So we're continuing to move forward, but it's got to be within the context of the price environment that we find ourselves. And we're trying to set ourselves up for the future as we come out of this.

And I think what distinguishes Heidelberg is it's, structurally, is a little more complex because of the steepness of dipping beds up against the salt well. But we anticipate, just like Caesar/Tonga, which we bought online in Phase 1 was -- is in the process of being completed. These wells have very good flow characteristics with good porosity and permeability. So we anticipate good performance of our additional wells at Heidelberg. As an example, and part answer to the prior question, we initiated Phase 2 of Caesar/Tonga last year. And so we see additional extension of that field once we've resolved some of the reservoir well targeting locations and then the flow performance issues. So anticipate, just as we did in Caesar/Tonga, along the same trend, we'll do the same thing at Heidelberg."

And what it allows us to do then is also more reservoir section for DST that will give us data earlier on deliverability, conductivity, those types of things. So there was an application here that sped up the evaluation process. But the only reason we could do it is because we knew very, very accurately what to expect in the wellbore and how to place the lateral section, so it worked very well.

I can't speak to what our partner provided in the way of guidance for the year, but I'll reiterate what I said earlier and that is, Heidelberg has produced exactly the way we've provided guidance to The Street. It's not underperformed and it's performed in line with what we thought the wells would do. So therefore, it doesn't seem to create, for us, the problems it seems to be creating for others. It maybe haven't taken as much time to look at it as we'd like them to. I think the other thing is you have to realize is that we have a very limited cost basis in this development. If you recall, a few years ago, we farmed down our interest there and almost all of our development cost has been borne by a third-party. In fact, there's still carry left associated with that farm-down. So therefore, if you're thinking about impairments, if you're thinking about balance sheet treatment, this asset would be carried on our books very differently than maybe some of our partners. So if people would take those 2 together, they might understand that we're not as concerned about Heidelberg as certainly it appears to be. Some people are as it might relate to our partner, but from our perspective, Heidelberg has produced in line with what we anticipated it would do for the year and relative to the way in which we provide guidance in The Street."

If you recall, both in March as well as when we reported our first -- or our fourth quarter and prior year results in January, we said at that time that we still believe that there's -- dependent upon the private equity firm, there are firms that have a very fundamental view that natural gas is a better place to invest than oil. They look at the activation costs of liquids and oil versus what they think is a fairly good market for natural gas and a good market for those folks, as I listen to them, as they feel very good about the ability of natural gas to run at the $3 or more. From where we are today, they see that product, if you want to call it a product but just refer to it as product, having better sustainability in the near term with less volatility than oil. So yes, you do have people who have fundamentally different views between the 2 hydrocarbons for things they want to invest in.

So I don't want to comment on the particular assets you mentioned. i don't think you should look for us to do something that you characterize as transformative, but we've got beyond the math that we've laid out there in terms of the closed and announced transactions and the $1.3 billion in the first quarter as of that March 1 Investor Call and another $700 million now. We put a range out there of $2 billion to $3 billion, so that leaves roughly another $1 billion that we're working on. And as we've said before, that's a risked number. So the gross number we're working on is a bigger number. There are some sizable assets in there and some small ones. And how that portfolio of assets help candidates comes together is going to be based upon the relative demand for and interest in those assets from not just private equity but industry players. So as the year progresses, there'll be greater clarity on that. And I think -- the plan that we've laid out, I think, puts us in a position relative to what we believe is, even with the moderate recovery, still a relatively low commodity price environment; we believe, positions us for a pro forma appropriate leverage position."

Certain is there's a structure with the higher of your ratings and certain with the lower of your ratings.

So if I could just stay with Anadarko only for a minute because typically, in the past at least, when we make an upstream investment, we think about the cost of also getting that to whatever is the delivery point, so that midstream build-out is a part of the upstream spend. So it would be a rate of return that would include getting the product into a market. Now that's different than Western Gas, and I know you fully appreciate that. That's why, going back to 2008, we saw those 2 markets valuing the assets differently. And while we put Western Gas in place as a result, we felt like it just really gave us a lot of optionality around 2 distinct assets. Although, from the standpoint of the investment, if you can't move a hydrocarbon into a market, then you haven't completed the cost of completion. So when we look at whatever we're doing new; or whatever Darrell maybe, as an example, is thinking about incrementally in the Delaware Basin, that build-out, if it's on our nickel, would include that rate of return bundled with the upstream. Now as Western Gas evolves in its life cycle and becomes larger and in many cases, particularly say for instance, in the Permian, where Western Gas has a lot of stand-alone third-party business, then that becomes a little bit different equation. And maybe with that, if I could, I'll let Bob just approach it a little bit with Darrell by saying that you do have a bifurcation where Western Gas has its own rates of return and Anadarko has its own rates of return. But we do think about the process, I mean gathering, in a vacuum pretty much the way I just described it. And Bob, I don't know if you have anything you'd like to add."

The advantage with the horizontal is that you got to see a lot of that section in a lateral sense, which confirmed our seismic interpretation. Our EEI volume would have said the exact same thing. And really, the deliverability issue around the #5 is to get as good a flow rate as quick as we can to send a pressure pulse to the 1 and 3 so that we can prove up connectivity. So we wanted as much reservoir section open to give us those high volumes and a good pressure drawdown pulse that would send -- that we could then monitor because that's a key question that we have to have answered before we would move into a development phase. It's what is the connectivity of the reservoir.

I think it almost goes without saying that things feel better today than they did 90 days ago, both for our industry and for investors. The very fragile energy capital markets we've seen for most of the first quarter appear",675,"Thanks, John, and good morning. I think it almost goes without saying that things feel better today than they did 90 days ago, both for our industry and for investors. The very fragile energy capital markets we've seen for most of the first quarter appear to be stabilizing, the outlook for commodity prices are improving and I think for industry, our operating environment is definitely strengthening. As a company, our employees delivered very solid results despite the challenges in the first quarter. As a company, we're poised to take advantage of the market as opportunities develop. 
If I could, let me take a moment and recap what we achieved in the first quarter. We announced a capital plan that was 50% lower than 2015 and 70% lower than 2014. Our cap plan produces oil volumes that are expected to be flat year-over-year as well as on an exit rate basis. We monetized $1.3 billion of assets with another $700 million expected in the second quarter. We will continue to be an industry leader in active portfolio management. 
We reduced our dividend 81%, which we believe will save us $450 million of cash per annum, and we positioned our company to be more successful financially and operationally in the years ahead if prices stay lower. Our savings from these efforts, we believe, will increase our ability to be more cost-efficient and should provide more than $350 million of costs in savings per annum. We issued $3 billion of fixed income securities to refinance our 2016 debt and the first 125 -- well, pardon me, $1.25 billion of our 2017 debt at very attractive rates and terms. 
Operationally, we continue to set a very high bar. As you've seen, our reductions in various cost savings, LOE per barrel improved 22% in the first quarter versus the prior year. Our liquids mix continues to increase and our well costs in the DJ were reduced 11% from the year before to a level today of about $2.4 million per well. The Delaware Basin also has seen really good efforts as well with cost reductions where their wells are costing us $1 million per well less quarter-over-quarter to about $6.2 million per copy. 
What can you expect from us through the balance of the year? Do not expect us to increase our capital spending this year even if oil exceeds $50. We could reallocate some of our savings in our budget to increase capital to certain plays like the Delaware Basin. We'll be very patient as we look beyond 2016 to a sustained higher price environment to increase capital and return to a growth mode, if warranted. Our operations report includes various highlights across our portfolio, and I encourage you to take a look at that for more details as your time permits.
Our employees have done an incredible job, as I mentioned earlier, during this first quarter, maintaining a focus on safety and productivity, meeting the challenges of a workforce reduction without losing focus on our operating results, being aggressive with portfolio management and diligent in our divestiture process. They've consistently and constantly look for ways to improve our business and manage through this volatile cycle successfully. 
Working to improve our financial position is something we think about every day, and I think the most recent example of that is the receipt of our cash tax refund approaching $1 billion through a lot of good efforts. Our combined efforts to improve our cash inflows will position us through the balance of the year to reduce our net debt. 
In closing, I think we've taken the right actions in the first quarter to position Anadarko for success. We do believe we're going to continue to see improving commodity prices, but however, near-term volatility remains a concern. Our industry and company are both in a much better place than we were 90 days ago, and it gives us renewed optimism this cycle is on a track to much better investment returns. 
With that, why don't we open it up for questions?"

So we're going to take a look at the value of that asset over time, just like we do with the rest of the assets in our monetization program. And if we think that relatively fair value can be achieved, then we'd consider it. But we don't have any current plans to sell WGP.

Doug, on the wells and the appraisal program, it's partly scale, it's partly -- some of the complexities that we're seeing out there, mostly on the imaging side of it, not necessarily that we're seeing lots of bad surprises. Although we did, through our most recent wells, realize that there are some faults that were poorly to not imaged in some of the seismic data that we're going to have to build into a potential development plan. And so that means that we needed a few more appraisal wells to make sure that there's not any more compartmentalization as we move across. So those are the issues that we're looking at. I'd say it's mostly based around the quality of the image in the sub-salt and making sure that what we're seeing or interpreting is actual reality, and so we're drilling the 5-well now to the west and pushing that downdip quite significantly to prove up of those volumes as we move over. And then with success there, we'd move over even farther to the -- I'm sorry, to the east, and we'd move over even farther to the east with the #6 well. So those are what's happening there. The biggest issue on timing and making sure that we have the data is -- this can be a big development if we move forward with it. And it's going to be an expensive development and you want to know what the well deliverabilities are going to be, what your actual resources range are going to and you want to come up with a solution that actually makes sense for this resource.

So we -- maybe different from you -- don't see Heidelberg performing any differently than we anticipated this year. As the wells that we expect to drill and have produced to date, they've performed as we anticipated. So the comments and the concerns associated with Heidelberg leave me a little bit in the category of scratching my head. Now as it relates to oil volumes through the course of the year, as I'm sure you can appreciate in a capital-intensive business, onshore, we have certain places where we're adding to capital and certain places we're taking away. But I think we have given you largely the types of volumes we anticipate through the year. The one thing that we can't anticipate and schedule well is liftings. And liftings sometimes happen either to our advantage or disadvantage. But I think the thing that we still feel like, and I made this in my earlier comments, is that we believe, for the year, we will be flat year-over-year on all volumes and probably, just as importantly, on an exit rate basis, so no change from our perspective on that."

Understandable question, Paul. Thank you for asking it. I think, as we've talked about this year, we see a number of tieback opportunities in the Gulf of Mexico that have very attractive potential rates of return if they're drilled out successfully.",480,"Yes. Understandable question, Paul. Thank you for asking it. I think, as we've talked about this year, we see a number of tieback opportunities in the Gulf of Mexico that have very attractive potential rates of return if they're drilled out successfully. You may see those categorized as exploration or exploitation. Certainly, the existence of infrastructure allows us to go out and drill something today that is an exploration well, with the ability to tie it back to existing infrastructure and reduce the development costs. I think the area that you're focused on, and accurately so, is if we're looking at true new infrastructure to support exploration efforts, are we likely to do that in an environment where we're drilling below salt? And I think, today, as we made the comment on the last call, that's a pretty challenging bit of arithmetic. So I think we'll continue to look for opportunities in the near term, for which we've given some good detail in our ops report and other color commentary around it, that we think in the Gulf of Mexico, we have really good opportunities to tie back to infrastructure to take advantage of our exploitation, exploration and development that we see there. Outside the U.S., we look at places where, basically, in a post-salt environment where the well costs are substantially less, as I know you fully appreciate. And there, as we have before, we see exploration creating option value for the future. That turned out to be a pretty good premise for which we think that our business strategy, and I know you know it quite well, but when we think about short-term, medium-term and long-term cycling of cash, cycling of cash for us in the short term has to produce extremely good rates of return and good characteristics of cash-on-cash. The medium- and long-term cycling is more to create that option value and enhanced value for the future. Whether we take that to production and development will be dependent upon the price environment at that time. So I'm not -- I mean, I'm not probably answering your question as specifically as you answered it, but I am trying to approach it from the standpoint it still fits in the business model, which I think we've done a pretty good job of since 2007 of staying within. And that's just simply thinking about the cycling of cash, the rates of return for the near term, thinking about the value added from the long term, from an option standpoint, staying within cash inflows with our investing and being mindful of really aggressive portfolio management in order to enhance either the rates of return or the value creation. And -- maybe if I could have Bob Daniels talk a little bit about what we're seeing specifically in other areas with our exploration beyond just the quantitative assessment I gave you."

We've slowed down like we've done in all sectors of our business given the cash flows that we have now in the capital program. But this year, we're in Côte d’Ivoire drilling appraisal wells and then we're going to do a DST at our Paon complex. And then follow that up with 2 exploratory wells to the south in exploration acreage we have adjacent to that. So that's all are going to be very interesting. The rig from there, we'll move back into Colombia and do an appraisal well on our Kronos discovery and follow that up, hopefully, next year, with some additional work down in the Fuerte area. Meanwhile, we're acquiring a huge -- the second half of a huge 3D up in COL area and the deepwater Colombia. We really are excited with what we're seeing on the first phase and looking forward to getting that second phase done and putting that whole program together. And then meanwhile in the Gulf, Al mentioned the -- all the tiebacks and all the -- near infrastructure work that we're doing this year. And that is similar to what we're doing at Phobos where we have discovery in the lower tertiary that we're going to try to get on appraisal later in the year. So we've got quite a few things that are going on. And when you look out to the future, 16 million acres in the deepwater of Colombia, we picked up -- we're apparent high bidder, 4 new blocks in the Gulf of Mexico. So we're continuing to move forward, but it's got to be within the context of the price environment that we find ourselves. And we're trying to set ourselves up for the future as we come out of this.

And I think what distinguishes Heidelberg is, it's structurally -- it was little more complex because of the steepness of the dipping beds up against the salt well. But we anticipate, just like Caesar/Tonga, which we brought online and Phase 1 was -- is in the process of being completed. These wells have very good flow characteristics with good porosity and permeability. So we anticipate good performance of our additional wells at Heidelberg. As an example, and part answer to the prior question, we initiated Phase 2 of Caesar/Tonga last year. And so we see additional extension of that field once we've resolved some of the reservoir well targeting locations and then the flow performance issues. So anticipate, just as we did in Caesar/Tonga, along the same trend, we'll do the same thing at Heidelberg."

I think the broader property market certainly has a pretty good depth of private equity chasing it. But I think the other thing, and I continue to highlight this, is that when we look to monetize an asset, many times, we are a seller of choice from the standpoint that you're not taking on operational problems that you might be taking on with less capitalized companies or companies that don't have the operational history and success that we've had. So I think the fact that we've been a good, prudent operator for a long time, we're a brand name, if you want to call it that, in our space, when we choose to redeploy capital by exiting a particular property, you're not taking on problems that you might with a smaller or less well-known company.

I don't think that's going to be like in the onshore U.S. where it becomes the prevailing methodology of drilling these wells.

And what it allows us to do then is also more reservoir section for DST that will give us data earlier on deliverability, conductivity, those types of things. So there was an application here that sped up the evaluation process. But the only reason we could do it is because we knew very, very accurately what to expect in the wellbore and how to place the lateral section, so it worked very well.

So therefore, it doesn't seem to create, for us, the problems it seems to be creating for others that maybe haven't taken as much time to look at it as we'd like them to. I think the other thing is you have to realize is that we have a very limited cost basis in this development. If you recall, a few years ago, we farmed down our interest there and almost all of our development cost has been borne by a third-party. In fact, there's still carry left associated with that farm-down. So therefore, if you're thinking about impairments, if you're thinking about balance sheet treatment, this asset would be carried on our books very differently than maybe some of our partners. So if people would take those 2 together, they might understand that we're not as concerned about Heidelberg as certainly it appears to be.

If you recall, both in March as well as when we reported our first -- or our fourth quarter and prior year results in January, we said at that time that we still believe that there's -- depending upon the private equity firm, there are firms that have a very fundamental view that natural gas is a better place to invest than oil. They look at the activation costs of liquids and oil versus what they think is a fairly good market for natural gas and a good market from those folks, as I listen to them, is they feel very good about the ability of natural gas to run to $3 or more. From where we are today, they see that product -- if you want to call it a product -- but just refer to it as product, having better sustainability in the near term with less volatility than oil. So yes, you do have people who have fundamentally different views between the 2 hydrocarbons for things they want to invest in.

So I don't want to comment on the particular assets you mentioned. I don't think you should look for us to do something that you characterize as transformative, but we've got beyond the math that we've laid out there in terms of the closed and announced transactions and the $1.3 billion in the first quarter, or as of that March 1 Investor Call and another $700 million now. We put a range out there of $2 billion to $3 billion, so that leaves roughly another $1 billion that we're working on. And as we've said before, that's a risked number. So the gross number we're working on is a bigger number. There are some sizable assets in there and some small ones. And how that portfolio of assets sale [ph] candidates comes together is going to be based upon the relative demand for and interest in those assets from not just private equity but industry players. So as the year progresses, there'll be greater clarity on that.

So if I could just stay with Anadarko only for a minute because typically, in the past at least, when we make an upstream investment, we think about the cost of also getting that to whatever is the delivery point, so that midstream build-out is a part of the upstream spend. So it would be a rate of return that would include getting that product into a market. Now that's different than Western Gas, and I know you fully appreciate that. That's why, going back to 2008, we saw those 2 markets valuing the assets differently. And why we put Western Gas in place as a result, we felt like it just really gave us a lot of optionality around 2 distinct assets. Although, from the standpoint of the investment, if you can't move a hydrocarbon into a market, then you haven't completed the cost of completion. So when we look at whatever we're doing new; or whatever Darrell may be, as an example, is thinking about incrementally in the Delaware Basin, that build-out, if it's on our nickel, would include that rate of return bundled with the upstream. Now as Western Gas evolves in its life cycle and becomes larger and in many cases, particularly say for instance, in the Permian, where Western Gas has a lot of stand-alone third-party business, then that becomes a little bit different equation. And maybe with that, if I could, I'll let Bob just approach it a little bit with Darrell by saying that you do have a bifurcation where Western Gas has its own rates of return and Anadarko has its own rates of return. But we do think about the process, I mean gathering, in a vacuum pretty much the way I just described it. And Bob, I don't know if you have anything you'd like to add."

The advantage with the horizontal is that you got to see a lot of that section in a lateral sense, which confirmed our seismic interpretation. Our EEI volume would have said the exact same thing. And really, the deliverability issue around the #5 is to get as good a flow rate as quick as we can to send a pressure pulse to the 1 and 3 so that we can prove up connectivity. So we wanted as much reservoir section open to give us those high volumes and a good pressure drawdown pulse that would send -- that we could then monitor because that's a key question that we have to have answered before we would move into a development phase is, what is the connectivity of the reservoir. So there were reasons beyond the actual ultimate production of this field that we put a horizontal well here because it's going to accelerate the evaluation during the appraisal phase and get us better data quicker.

In a lot of cases where we have the infrastructure already installed and we have available processing capacity and pipeline takeout capacity, we can lever that infrastructure, which has already been depreciated not only with our own equity opportunities, as we've mentioned, in Caesar/Tonga and some of our infield wells in Lucius, but also with other tiebacks that may be close proximity to our hubs. And so oftentimes, you'll find other operators who have had discoveries and maybe not as large to justify a greenfield development but have tieback capability within distance to us.

As we turn the corner into the second half of 2016, we've made exceptional progress on the goals we established for this year of enhancing value, strengthening the balanced sheet, hydrating the portfolio and reducing cost.",603,"Thanks, John, and good morning. As we turn the corner into the second half of 2016, we've made exceptional progress on the goals we established for this year of enhancing value, strengthening the balanced sheet, hydrating the portfolio and reducing cost. 
In terms of enhancing value, our operating organization has done a tremendous job achieving several milestones during the quarter. As you can see on our operations report available online, we had outstanding performance in the Gulf of Mexico. This is an area where we had several competitive advantages, a successful exploration track record, an industry-leading project management capability and a large operated infrastructure position. 
Our Gulf assets provide us a capital efficient value driver, and our record production achievement at constitution and K2 are great examples of that. Our operating solutions facility also achieved record production during the quarter with oil volumes exceeding nameplate capacity. As I suspect you know that our ops report, we drove another appraisal well at Shenandoah. The Shenandoah 5 well encountered more than 1,000 feet of net oil play and expanded the eastern extent of the field with planning of the Shen 6 now underway. 
We have a 33% working interest in Shenandoah after participating in a right process, and through that process, we picked up some additional blocks and exploration opportunities at no cost. 
Record production levels are also achieved in the DJ and the Delaware basins, and we're able to increase our activity over initial expectations, while still keeping capital expenditures within guidance. 
In the Delaware Basin, we have further reduced our DC cost per well and improved our drilling cycle times, while advancing our delineation program across a very large acreage position. 
In the DJ Basin, we achieved record production while lowering our LOE by about 15% year-over-year. Our outstanding operating results are complemented by another year of strong monetization results. In the first quarter, we announced approximately 1.3 billion of monetizations. Since then, we've achieved and have received an additional 1.2 billion of proceeds and executed a successful secondary offering of WGP earnings. 
We now expect total proceeds to be at or above 3.5 billion for the full year. So far this year, through the cost structuring improvements I have mentioned as well as the dividend reduction and monetization efforts, we have significantly strengthened the balance sheet. 
We've done this by retiring 3 billion of near term maturities with our first quarter '16 common issuance and planning to retire the remaining 750 million of 2017 maturities from our monetization proceeds. 
The cautious approach we outlined for oil price recovery at the beginning of 2015 has played out as much as we anticipated. It now appears U.S. also flat peaked at around 9.6 million barrels per day, and we expect it to bottom out around 8 million barrels per day, all the while with global demand now exceeding expectations. 
Given this dynamic, I am now encouraged that a sustained $60 oil price environment is likely to emerge as we move into 2017. This price level should provide the necessary cash margins and resulting cash cycle improvements to encourage us to accelerate activity and achieve strong returns.
In this scenario, we would evaluate redeploying some of the incremental proceeds from asset sales towards our highest quality U.S. onshore assets later this year. 
Our unique position in the DJ and Delaware basins, combined with the tieback opportunities in the Gulf of Mexico, give us strong line of sight for attractive, capital efficient, short cycle oil investments as crude prices recover. 
With that, we would love to take your questions, and thanks for joining us this morning."

And as the market went through that congestion, we've -- we're going to see the lag down that we're seeing right now.

That's going to be important to understand. I'd point to mad dog, which I believe VP spoke discussed the fact they're going to take a decision on this year, and they've indicated that sanction is likely. And I think there's just a couple of takeaways from that's not necessarily related to Shenandoah. One is they reduced the production solution cost from $20 billion to $8 billion, so that helps with the economics. And two, they think they've got an estimate also in recovery. That's pretty significant. And so the EUR combined with a lower cost probably gives you a threshold for price that would not have been anticipated a few years ago for sanctioning. So we're hopeful that some of those ingredients will work into our favor as that decisions comes to us over the last couple of years."

We think that's very important. We see both the U.S. cylinders from the state as well as the governor being very understanding of this issue. In fact, the Governor Hagan Luper was on CNBC earlier this morning, and I think he's considered one of the better governors in the United States. And certainly, he's very thoughtful around these issues being a part of the oil and gas industry much earlier in his career as a geologist. So I say politically, we have a very good understanding from both a Democratic governor, a Democratic senator and a Republican senator. And I think the politics in the state are such that we just need to continue to do what we can do with the help of other industry participants to educate the voters in a way when they do go the ballot and if the ballot were, in fact, on the docket for this fall, that they understand why they're voting on.

And debt to cap is somewhat less relevant. The oil target is somewhat less relevant, given that with the way the commodity price have backed up, we and everyone else have taken a lot of write-downs of assets on the balanced sheet that have affected that -- what that debt-to-cap number might look like in the future. But when you look at debt to cash flow in particular, when we look at debt per barrel and producing barrel, it is -- we feel that the balance sheet is not that far out of whack of where we'd like for it to be. The difference between the past is that we don't expect the commodity price recovery to, I don't know, $90, $100, or whatever we were facing at a point in time when debt-to-EBITDA metrics across the industry were so much lower. And so the way we're looking at it is to try to have -- try to match our pro forma metrics to our pro forma activity levels and that pro forma commodity prices I'll mention where we go back to work. So it's a bit of a moving target. What we know we will certainly we'll do was take -- is repay the $750 million of debt that we stated publicly repeatedly that we are going to repay the 2017 maturities. And we believe that there should be an opportunity to reduce gross debt further through some liability management programs around many of our smaller less liquid issues. But in many cases, the holders are very happy with those issues, and we certainly wouldn't expect to pay material premium just to retire them. We do have a put bond out there that is not callable, but it's quotable to us once a year. Certainly, there, you can negotiate around some of that type of debt if you want to take our gross debt number down further. But it's our clear intent, as we stated in the past, to continue to build cash and to ensure that we're reducing that net debt number that we continue to remain focused on liquidity, and we're very comfortable through liquidity position, a leverage position, allows us to accelerate drilling should the commodity price warranted. But to accelerate it within reason. We're talking in a hundreds of millions of dollars, not massive changes of about spending cash flow. We're pretty close even at current discretionary cash flow to spending within discretionary cash flow. So the delta here is asset sales. If we're successful with asset sale the way we have been, and then it gives us a lot of flexibility based on the commodity environment and outlook that we see at the time to moderately reduce leverage consistently with that commodity price environment and to moderately accelerate spending in places where we have really attractive returns to begin to move our production back to our growth and away from maintenance."

And simply, as we see U.S. oil production cascading towards that 8 million barrels a day that I made reference to in terms of where I think it will bottom out before it starts to go back up, that will, in my estimation, help a lot. And if we -- on the demand side, we continue to see 1.2 million to 1.4 million barrels per day of demand per annum through the balance of the decade, I think the combination too are quite significant. It's been our view that we will see this price recovery win is demand-driven, but -- rather than supply constrained. Market forces don't work real well when you're relying on supply constraints to drive price, but I think if you think about it as a demand function that improves annually at the clip of 1.2 million to 1.3 million barrels a day, you can see pretty quickly that in an expanding demand relative to supply, demand is going to move up the curve and the intersection creates peak will put pressure on prices to move up to a level of around $60 a barrel. After that point, I mean, we're going to have to see what happens. From a, a demand standpoint; b, from a cost. Are we're going to see margin erosion? The returns in the cycling characteristics that we particularly follow with our onshore investing? Are distant going to be as attractive as we thought? So I'm not going to go beyond $60, but I think clearly, in our estimation, the ingredients are there for recovery to sustain $60 price environment for next year. Then I probably been as big a bear around oil expectations as anyone since early 2015. And I think with this, if we continue to see the characteristics I just laid out, continue to be prevalent in the market, that will be a great indication to us for what we want to do. Looking at the forward curve, I think you know us well as I do that's a little fragile. And as you look out further, particularly in light of the world we live in today and the lack of real -- lack of players in the market for the forward curve, it looks flat for a reason because we don't have the same participants in the curve today that we had 5 years or certainly 10 years ago. So the curve itself probably is not going to be as much of an indicator of activity as the other things I just made reference to."

But our view is it can happen as early as late this year. And that's why I made the comment earlier. We think it's likely, and we can see a sustained price environment of $60 developing later this year. Now for reasons that I can't quite explain, but it takes a little bit longer to get to 8 million. That could be pushed into 2017, but you know better than I do how capital-intensive our industry is, particularly for unconventional development and the sustaining and production levels. And we, as the industry, have not been investing at a level that allows production to be held flat. Just exactly how fast it cascades is sort of a question, I think, each other need to watch. But my comment to you would be I think it could be as early as the fourth quarter, and that's the basis by which I'm making my comments. Because I still see the demand side using IEA as the basis for that wit having 1 to 2, maybe 1.2 million to 1.4 million barrels per annum of additional demand, yet it will be a demand recovery, not a supply recovery. And it's really the basis of that demand expansion or the large and increasing portion of the pie I think will give us some comfort around how that actually will be sustained. As it relates to capital planning, you're right. This is not a step function. It's not linear and it's probably more likely a lot. As we approach $60, we'll invest more at the will at $43-ish and in terms of where WTI is today. So we're already sort of telling you today that we anticipate with improvements that we think are forecasted, but we will start to reallocate some of our monetization proceeds as we've described on this call. I think if we -- as we get into our planning for capital for next year and think about that in conjunction with the discussions with our Board, the more we feel comfortable about that sustained $60 price environment, the more likely you will see us increase in capital, particularly in the areas that we're talking about on the margin, increasing capital to in anticipation of a price recovery. I hope that helps. You had a question about -- I'm sorry, you had a question about debt. Let me Paul answer that."

That starts and foremost, starts our views on natural gas, but they're not particularly bullish. But I think we've left ourselves some upside to benefit in particular with our associated gas production. That remains a pretty significant part of the portfolio. We have not focused on layering on any oil hedges. We don't like the structure of the market today to go ahead and lock in prices at all. And we've never looked at hedging as a way to justify drilling activity at any given price. We've instead looked at hedges as a way of providing some moderate protection of the balance sheet, reducing volatility of our cash flow relative to the commodity price environment. So we've as we've done historically, we'd probably like to win some more oil hedges with the right price and we like the shape of the curve. And I think from a gas standpoint, whether we do anymore or not just also remains to be seen. We're pretty comfortable of what we've got done for '17 at this stage."

Good morning, everyone. We're glad you could join us today for Anadarko's second quarter 2016 conference calls.
I would like to remind you that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures, and be aware that a number of factors could cause results to differ materially from what we discuss today. So I encourage you to read our full disclosure on forward-looking statements and the GAAP reconciliations located on our website and attached to yesterday's earnings release.
In just a moment, I'll turn the call over to Al Walker for some brief opening remarks, but first, I'd like to thank Jeremy Smith for his contributions he's made to the IR group over the last couple of years. Jeremy is now in his new role as Vice President of Mozambique project finance.
And along with that, I'd like to introduce Pete Zagrzecki, who has joined IR and will be available to assist with questions later this afternoon, along with the rest of our team.
I'll also remind you that we have a lot of additional detail in our quarterly ops report available on our website. And following Al's prepared remarks, we'll open it up for questions with our executive team. Al?"

As we turn the corner into the second half of 2016, we've made exceptional progress on the goals we established for this year of enhancing value, strengthening the balanced sheet, high grading the portfolio and reducing cost.
In terms of enhancing value, our operating organization has done a tremendous job achieving several milestones during the quarter. As you can see in our operations report available online, we had outstanding performance in the Gulf of Mexico. This is an area, where we hold several competitive advantages, a successful exploration track record, an industry-leading project management capability and a large operated infrastructure position.
Our Gulf assets provide us a capital efficient value driver, and our record production achievements at constitution and K2 are great examples of that. Our operations at Lucius facility also achieved record production during the quarter, with oil volumes exceeding nameplate capacity. As I suspect you know in our ops report, we drove another appraisal well at Shenandoah. The Shenandoah 5 well encountered more than 1,000 feet of net oil play and expanded the eastern extent of the field with planning of the Shen 6 now underway.
We have a 33% working interest in Shenandoah after participating in a pref right process, and through that process, we picked up some additional blocks and exploration opportunities at no cost.
Record production levels are also achieved in the DJ and the Delaware Basins, and we're able to increase our activity over our initial expectations, while still keeping capital expenditures within guidance.
In the Delaware Basin, we have further reduced our DC&E cost per well and improved our drilling cycle times, while advancing our delineation program across a very large acreage position.
In the DJ Basin, we achieved record production, while lowering our LOE by about 15% year-over-year. Our outstanding operating results are complemented by another year of strong monetization results. In the first quarter, we announced approximately $1.3 billion of monetizations. Since then, we've achieved and received an additional $1.2 billion of proceeds and executed a successful secondary offering of WGP units.
We now expect total proceeds to be at or above $3.5 billion for the full year. So far this year, through the cost structure improvements I have mentioned as well as the dividend reduction and monetization efforts, we have significantly strengthened the balance sheet.
We've done this by retiring $3 billion of near-term maturities with our first quarter '16 common issuance and planning to retire the remaining $750 million of 2017 maturities from our monetization proceeds.
The cautious approach we outlined for oil price recovery at the beginning of 2015 has played out much as we anticipated. It now appears U.S. also flat peaked at around 9.6 million barrels per day, and we expect it to bottom out around 8 million barrels per day, all the while with global demand now exceeding expectations.
Given this dynamic, I am now encouraged that a sustained $60 oil price environment is likely to emerge as we move into 2017. This price level should provide the necessary cash margins and resulting cash cycle improvements to encourage us to accelerate activity and achieve strong returns. In this scenario, we would evaluate redeploying some of the incremental proceeds from asset sales towards our highest quality U.S. onshore assets later this year.
Our unique positions in the DJ and Delaware Basins, combined with the tieback opportunities in the Gulf of Mexico, give us strong line of sight for attractive, capital efficient, short cycle oil investments as crude prices recover.
With that, we would love to take your questions, and thanks for joining us this morning."

And -- so the ultimate planning has to be after #6. We've got a lot of work that's going on right now though related to how we might develop this field.

That's going to be important to understand. I'd point to Mad Dog, which I believe VP has publicly discussed the fact they're going to take a decision on this year, and they've indicated that sanction is likely. And I think there's just a couple of takeaways from that, not necessarily related to Shenandoah, one is they reduced the production solution cost from $20 billion to $8 billion, so that helps with the economics. And two, they think they've got an estimate also in recovery. That's pretty significant. And so the EUR combined with a lower cost probably gives you a threshold for price that would not have been anticipated a few years ago for sanctioning. So we're hopeful that some of those ingredients will work into our favor as that decision comes to us over the next couple of years."

So it's things that are small enough, they generally don't get reported. The ones that we're summarizing in our asset divesture program were generally our larger transactions. Or in some cases like even recently in the Permian, where we saw some acreage that we had in the portfolio, felt like we wouldn't get to that acreage for quite a while and that it didn't necessarily fit as well relative to our development plans. And so we saw it as unique opportunity to sell something. I think it's fair to say that the market should continue to be receptive based on the dynamics we're seeing. It should continue to be receptive for the types of assets that we're bringing to market. Those assets share a common characteristic that they're generally not going to attract capital in our portfolio, really virtually any gas price. And I mentioned the gas price because they're mostly dry gas assets. We will retain a lot of exposure to gas through the associated gas of our 2 primary U.S. onshore assets. But the dry gas assets have pretty good economics, intrinsic economics. It's strip pricing. And so we've seen buyers that see it as a neat assets relative to the size of their firm and the types of things they're trying to do, not as attractive to us. They make a lot of sense for us to sell. On the margin, we, however, are a buyer of assets. And if they're priced right and if they're in the right location, and really, the 3 core areas where we're putting capital and we believe we have competitive advantages in the Delaware, and in Wattenberg and in the Gulf of Mexico or places where we continue to look at packages.

We feel like with knowledge of and understanding and appreciation for what the industry does and how we're doing it and the issues associated with what setbacks really mean that an educated voter is more likely to understand why this is important and why the ballot initiative has structured, particularly this year, would do so much damage to the state. We think that's very important. We see both the U.S. cylinders from the state as well as the governor being very understanding of this issue. In fact, the Governor Hickenlooper was on CNBC earlier this morning, and I think he's considered one of the better governors in the United States. And certainly, he's very thoughtful around these issues being a part of the oil and gas industry much earlier in his career as a geologist. So I think politically, we have a very good understanding from both a Democratic governor, a Democratic senator and a Republican senator.

And debt to cap is somewhat less relevant. The oil target is somewhat less relevant. Given that with the way the commodity prices have backed up, we and everyone else have taken a lot of write-downs of assets on the balanced sheet that have affected that -- what that debt-to-cap number might look like in the future. But when you look at debt to cash flow in particular and we look at debt per barrel and producing barrel, it is -- we feel that the balance sheet is not that far out of whack of where we'd like for it to be. The difference versus the past is that we don't expect commodity price recovery to, I don't know, $90, $100, or whatever we were facing at a point in time when debt-to-EBITDA metrics across the industry were so much lower. And so the way we're looking at it is to try to have -- try to match our pro forma metrics to our pro forma activity levels and that pro forma commodity prices Al mentioned, where we go back to work. So it's a bit of a moving target. And now what we know is certainly will do is take -- is repay the $750 million of debt that we stated publicly repeatedly that we are going to repay at the 2017 maturities. And we believe that there should be an opportunity to reduce gross debt further through some liability management programs around many of our smaller less liquid issues. But in many cases, the holders are very happy with those issues, and we certainly wouldn't expect to pay a material premium just to retire them. We do have a put bond out there that is not callable, but it's puttable to us once a year. Certainly, there, you can negotiate around some of that type of debt, if we wanted to take our gross debt number down further. But it's our clear intent, as we stated in the past, to continue to build cash and to ensure that we're reducing that net debt number that we continue to remain focused on liquidity, and we're very comfortable. The liquidity position, the leverage position allows us to accelerate drilling should the commodity price warranted. But to accelerate within reason. We're talking in the hundreds of millions of dollars, not massive changes of about spending cash flow. We're pretty close even at current discretionary cash flow to spending within discretionary cash flow. So the delta here is asset sales. If we're successful with asset sales the way we have been, then it gives us a lot of flexibility based on the commodity environment and outlook that we see at the time to moderately reduce leverage, consistent with that commodity price environment and to moderately accelerate spending in places where we have really attractive returns to begin to move our production back toward growth and away from maintenance."

And simply, as we see U.S. oil production cascading towards that 8 million barrels a day that I made reference to in terms of where I think it will bottom out before it starts to go back up, that will, in my estimation, help a lot. And if we -- on the demand side, we continue to see 1.2 million to 1.4 million barrels per day of demand per annum through the balance of the decade, I think the combination too are quite significant. It's been our view that we will see this bear -- a price recovery when it's demand-driven, but rather than supply constrained. Market forces don't work real well when you're relying on supply constraints to drive price. But I think if you think about it as a demand function that improves annually at the cliff of 1.2 million to 1.3 million barrels a day, you can see pretty quickly that in an expanding demand relative to the supply, demand is going to move up the curve and the intersection creates P will put pressure on prices to move up to a level of around $60 a barrel. After that point, I mean, we're going to have to see what happens from a, a demand standpoint; b, from a cost, are we going to see margin erosion? Are there returns in the cycling characteristics that we particularly follow with our onshore investing? Are they still going to be as attractive as we thought? So I'm not going to go beyond $60, but I think clearly in our estimation, the ingredients are there for recovery to sustain $60 price environment for next year. And I probably been as big a bear around oil expectations as anyone since early 2015. And I think with this, if we continue to see the characteristics, I just laid out, continue to be prevalent in the market, that will be a great indication to us for what we want to do. Looking at the forward curve, I think you know as well as I do that's a little fragile. And as you look out further, particularly in light of our -- the world we live in today and the lack of players in the market for the forward curve, it looks flat for a reason because we don't have the same participants in the curve today that we had 5 years or certainly 10 years ago. So the curve itself probably is not going to be as much of an indicator of activity as the other things I just made reference to."

It's -- the timing for 8 million barrels a day, I'm no better at projecting that than a lot of people are paying money just to do that by themselves in the vacuum of their own thoughts. But our view is that it could happen as early as late this year. And that's why we made -- I made the comment earlier, we think it's likely. And we can see a sustained price environment of $60 developing later this year. Now for reasons that I can't quite explain, but it takes a little bit longer to get to 8 million. That could be pushed into 2017, but you know better than I do how capital intensive our industry is, particularly for unconventional development and the sustaining production levels. And we, as the industry, have not been investing at a level that allows production to be held flat. Just exactly how fast it cascades is sort of a question. I think, each of us need to watch. But my comment to you would be I think it could be as early as the fourth quarter, and that's the basis by which I'm making my comments. Because I still see the demand side using IEA as the basis for that with having 1 million to 2 million, maybe 1.2 million to 1.4 million barrels per annum of additional demand. It will be a demand recovery, not a supply recovery. And it's really the basis of that demand expansion or the large and increasing portion of the pie, I think, will give us some comfort around how that actually will be sustained. As it relates to capital planning, you're right. This is not a step function. It's not linear and it's probably more likely a lot arithmetic. As we approach $60, we'll invest more than we will at $43-ish and in terms of where WTI is today. So we're already sort of telling you today that we anticipate with improvements that we think are forecasted, but we will start to reallocate some of our monetization proceeds as we've described on this call. I think if we -- as we get into our planning for capital for next year and think about that in conjunction with the discussions with our board, the more we feel comfortable about that sustained $60 price environment, the more likely you will see us increase in capital, particularly in the areas that we're talking about on the margin, increasing capital to in anticipation of a price recovery. I hope that helps. You had a question about -- I'm sorry, you had a question about debt. Let me Bob answer that."

We have not focused on layering any oil hedges. We don't like the structure or the market today to go ahead and lock in prices at all. And we've never looked at hedging as a way to justify drilling activity at any given price. We've instead looked at hedges as a way of providing some moderate protection to the balance sheet and reducing the volatility of our cash flows relative to the commodity price environment. So we've -- as we've done historically, we'd probably like to layer in some oil hedges at the right price when we like the shape of the curve.

And so I think from a practical standpoint, as Al was suggesting, as we look forward into the end of the year and into next year and we have the opportunity to stand up rigs and additional crews, you will see that all of that really becomes the inventory in which we'll work off of.

Good morning, everyone. We're glad you could join us today for Anadarko's second quarter 2016 conference calls.
I would like to remind you that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures, and be aware that a number of factors could cause results to differ materially from what we discuss today. So I encourage you to read our full disclosure on forward-looking statements and the GAAP reconciliations located on our website and attached to yesterday's earnings release.
In just a moment, I'll turn the call over to Al Walker for some brief opening remarks, but first, I'd like to thank Jeremy Smith for his contributions he's made to the IR group over the last couple of years. Jeremy is now in his new role as Vice President of Mozambique project finance.
And along with that, I'd like to introduce Pete Zagrzecki, who has joined IR and will be available to assist with questions later this afternoon, along with the rest of our team.
I'll also remind you that we have a lot of additional detail in our quarterly ops report available on our website. And following Al's prepared remarks, we'll open it up for questions with our executive team. Al?"

As we turn the corner into the second half of 2016, we've made exceptional progress on the goals we established for this year of enhancing value, strengthening the balance sheet, high grading the portfolio and reducing cost",606,"Thanks, John, and good morning. As we turn the corner into the second half of 2016, we've made exceptional progress on the goals we established for this year of enhancing value, strengthening the balance sheet, high grading the portfolio and reducing costs.
In terms of enhancing value, our operating organization has done a tremendous job achieving several milestones during the quarter. As you can see in our operations report available online, we had outstanding performance in the Gulf of Mexico. This is an area, where we hold several competitive advantages: a successful exploration track record, an industry-leading project management capability and a large operated infrastructure position.
Our Gulf assets provide us a capital efficient value driver, and our record production achievements at Constitution and K2 are great examples of that. Our operators at Lucius facility also achieved record production during the quarter, with oil volumes exceeding nameplate capacity. As I suspect you noticed in our ops report, we drove another appraisal well at Shenandoah. The Shenandoah 5 well encountered more than 1,000 feet of net oil pay and expanded the eastern extent of the field with planning of the Shen 6 now underway.
We have a 33% working interest in Shenandoah after participating in a pref right process, and through that process, we picked up some additional blocks and exploration opportunities at no cost.
Record production levels were also achieved in the DJ and the Delaware Basins, and we were able to increase our activity over our initial expectations, while still keeping capital expenditures within guidance.
In the Delaware Basin, we have further reduced our DC&E cost per well and improved our drilling cycle times, while advancing our delineation program across a very large acreage position.
In the DJ Basin, we achieved record production, while lowering our LOE by about 15% year-over-year. Our outstanding operating results are complemented by another year of strong monetization results. In the first quarter, we announced approximately $1.3 billion of monetizations. Since then, we've achieved and have received an additional $1.2 billion of proceeds and executed a successful secondary offering of WGP units.
We now expect total proceeds to be at or above $3.5 billion for the full year. So far this year, through the cost structure improvements I have mentioned as well as the dividend reduction and monetization efforts, we have significantly strengthened the balance sheet.
We've done this by retiring $3 billion of near-term maturities with our first quarter '16 covenant issuance and planning to retire the remaining $750 million of 2017 maturities from our monetization proceeds.
The cautious approach we outlined for oil price recovery at the beginning of 2015 has played out much as we anticipated. It now appears U.S. oil supply peaked at around 9.6 million barrels per day, and we expect it to bottom out around 8 million barrels per day, all the while with global demand now exceeding expectations.
Given this dynamic, I am now encouraged that a sustained $60 oil price environment is likely to emerge as we move into 2017. This price level should provide the necessary cash margins and resulting cash cycle improvements to encourage us to accelerate activity and achieve strong returns. In this scenario, we would evaluate redeploying some of the incremental proceeds from asset sales towards our highest quality U.S. onshore assets later this year.
Our unique positions in the DJ and Delaware Basins, combined with the tieback opportunities in the Gulf of Mexico, give us strong line of sight for attractive, capital efficient, short cycle oil investments as crude prices recover.
With that, we would love to take your questions, and thanks for joining us this morning."

And I foreshadowed this a little bit at the Wells Conference a few months ago, when I made the comments there that we anticipated we'd have a let down as the market tried to absorb the 3 million barrels associated with disruptions from Venezuela, Nigeria and Canada. And as the market went through that congestion, we've -- we were going to see the leg down that we're seeing right now. And I think once we get behind -- we get that behind us, to use an economics term, ceteris paribus, we think we're looking at a sustained $60 oil price environment for next year.

That's going to be important to understand. I'd point to Mad Dog, which I believe BP has publicly discussed the fact they're going to take a decision on this year, and they've indicated that sanctioning is likely. And I think there's just a couple of takeaways from that, not necessarily that they're related to Shenandoah. One is they reduced the production solution cost from $20 billion to $8 billion, so that helps with the economics. And two, they think they've got an estimated ultimate recovery that's pretty significant. And so the EUR combined with a lower cost probably gives you a threshold for price that would not have been anticipated a few years ago for sanctioning. So we're hopeful that some of those ingredients will work into our favor as that decision comes to us over the next couple of years."

So it's things that are small enough, they generally don't get reported. The ones that we're summarizing in our asset divesture program are generally our larger transactions. Or in some cases like even recently in the Permian, where we saw some acreage that we had in the portfolio, felt like we wouldn't get to that acreage for quite a while and that it didn't necessarily fit as well relative to our development plans. And so we saw it as a unique opportunity to sell something. I think it's fair to say that the market should continue to be receptive based on the dynamics we're seeing. It should continue to be receptive for the types of assets that we're bringing to market. Those assets share a common characteristic that they're generally not going to attract capital in our portfolio, really at virtually any gas price. And I mention the gas price because they're mostly dry gas assets. We will retain a lot of exposure to gas through the associated gas of our 2 primary U.S. onshore assets. But the dry gas assets have pretty good economics, intrinsic economics that strip pricing. And so we've seen buyers that see it as a -- need assets relative to the size of their firm and the types of things they're trying to do. Not as attractive to us. They make a lot of sense for us to sell. On the margin, we, however, are a buyer of assets. And if they're priced right and if they're in the right location, and really, the 3 core areas where we're putting capital and we believe we have competitive advantages in the Delaware, and in the Wattenberg and in the Gulf of Mexico or places where we continue to look at packages.

We see both the U.S. senators from the state as well as the governor being very understanding of this issue. In fact, I saw Governor Hickenlooper was on CNBC earlier this morning, and I think he's considered one of the better governors in the United States. And certainly, is very thoughtful around these issues being a part of the oil and gas industry much earlier in his career as a geologist. So I think politically, we have a very good understanding from both a Democratic governor, a Democratic senator and a Republican senator. And I think the politics in the state are such that we just need to continue to do what we can do with the help of other industry participants to educate the voters in a way where when they do go to the ballot, if a ballot were, in fact, on the docket for this fall, that they understand what they're voting on.

And debt to cap is somewhat less relevant. The oil targets  are somewhat less relevant. Given that with the way the commodity prices have backed up, we and everyone else have taken a lot of write-downs of assets on the balanced sheet that have affected that -- what that debt-to-cap number might look like in the future. But when you look at debt to cash flow in particular and we look at debt per barrel and producing barrel, it is -- we feel that the balance sheet is not that far out of whack of where we'd like for it to be. The difference versus the past is that we don't expect a commodity price recovery to, I don't know, $90, $100, or whatever we were facing at a point in time when debt-to-EBITDA metrics across the industry were so much lower. And so the way we're looking at it is to try to have -- try to match our pro forma metrics to our pro forma activity levels and that pro forma commodity price, as Al mentioned, where we go back to work. So it's a bit of a moving target. And now what we know with certainly we'll do is take -- is repay the $750 million of debt that we've stated publicly repeatedly that we are going to repay of the 2017 maturities. And we believe that there should be an opportunity to reduce gross debt further through some liability management programs around many of our smaller less liquid issues. But in many cases, the holders are very happy with those issues, and we certainly wouldn't expect to pay a material premium just to retire them. We do have a put bond out there that is not callable, but it's puttable to us once a year. Certainly, there, you can negotiate around some of that type of debt, if we wanted to take our gross debt number down further. But it's our clear intent, as we've stated in the past, to continue to build cash and to ensure that we're reducing that net debt number, that we continue to remain focused on liquidity, and we're very comfortable that the liquidity position, the leverage position allows us to accelerate drilling should the commodity price warranted. But to accelerate within reason. We're talking within the hundreds of millions of dollars, not massive changes of outspending cash flow. We're pretty close even at current discretionary cash flow to spending within discretionary cash flow. So the delta here is asset sales. If we're successful with asset sales the way we have been, then it gives us a lot of flexibility based on the commodity environment and outlook that we see at the time to moderately reduce leverage, consistent with that commodity price environment and to moderately accelerate spending in places where we have really attractive returns to begin to move our production back toward growth and away from maintenance."

And that's simply, as we see U.S. oil production cascading towards that 8 million barrels a day that I made reference to in terms of where I think it will bottom out before it starts to go back up, that will, in my estimation, help a lot. And if we -- on the demand side, we continue to see 1.2 million to 1.4 million barrels per day of demand per annum through the balance of the decade, I think the combination of the 2 are quite significant. It's been our view that we will see this be a price recovery when it's demand-driven, but rather than supply constrained. Market forces don't work real well when you're relying on supply constraints to drive price. But I think if you think about it as a demand function that improves annually at the clip of 1.2 million to 1.3 million barrels a day, you can see pretty quickly that in an expanding demand relative to the supply, demand is going to move up the curve and the intersection that creates P will put pressure on prices to move up to a level of around $60 a barrel. After that point, I mean, we're going to have to see what happens from a, a demand standpoint; b, from a cost, are we going to see margin erosion? Are there returns in the cycling characteristics that we particularly follow with our onshore investing? Are they still going to be as attractive as we thought? So I'm not going to go beyond $60, but I think clearly in our estimation, the ingredients are there for recovery to sustain $60 price environment for next year. And I've probably been as big a bear around oil expectations as anyone since early 2015. And I think with this, if we continue to see the characteristics I just laid out, continue to be prevalent in the market, that will be a great indication to us for what we want to do. Looking at the forward curve, I think you know as well as I do that's a little fragile. And as you look out further, particularly in light of our -- the world we live in today and the lack of players in the market for the forward curve, it looks flat for a reason because we don't have the same participants in the curve today that we had 5 years or certainly 10 years ago. So the curve itself probably is not going to be as much of an indicator of activity as the other things I just made reference to."

It's -- the timing for 8 million barrels a day, I'm no better at projecting that than -- a lot of people are paid money just to do that by themselves in the vacuum of their own thoughts. But our view is that it could happen as early as late this year. And that's why we made -- I made the comment earlier, we think it's likely that we could see a sustained price environment of $60 developing later this year. Now for reasons that I can't quite explain, but it takes a little bit longer to get to 8 million. That could be pushed into 2017, but you know better than I do how capital intensive our industry is, particularly for unconventional development and the sustaining of production levels. And we, as an industry, have not been investing at a level that allows production to be held flat. Just exactly how fast it cascades is sort of the question I think each of us need to watch. But my comment to you would be I think it could be as early as the fourth quarter, and that's the basis by which I'm making my comments. Because I still see the demand side using IEA as the basis for that with having 1 million to 2 million, maybe 1.2 million to 1.4 million barrels per annum of additional demand. It will be a demand recovery, not a supply recovery. And it's really the basis of that demand expansion or the large and increasing portion of the pie, that I think will give us some comfort around how that actually will be sustained. As it relates to capital planning, you're right. This is not a step function. It's not linear and it's probably more likely logarithmic. As we approach $60, we'll invest more than we will at $43-ish and in terms of where WTI is today. So we're already sort of telling you today that we anticipate with improvements that we think are forecasted, that we will start to reallocate some of our monetization proceeds as we've described on this call. I think if we -- as we get into our planning for capital for next year and think about that in conjunction with the discussions with our board, the more we feel comfortable about that sustained $60 price environment, the more likely you will see us increase in capital, particularly in the areas that we're talking about on the margin, increasing capital to -- in anticipation of a price recovery.

It starts to inform us to our views on natural gas, which are not particularly bullish. But we think we've left ourselves some upside to benefit, in particular, with our associated gas production. That remains a pretty significant part of the portfolio. We have not focused on layering any oil hedges. We don't like the structure of the market today to go ahead and lock in prices at all. And we've never looked at hedging as a way to justify drilling activity at any given price. We've instead looked at hedges as a way of providing some moderate protection to the balance sheet and reducing the volatility of our cash flows relative to the commodity price environment. So we've -- as we've done historically, we'd probably like to layer in some oil hedges at the right price when we like the shape of the curve. And I think from a gas standpoint, whether we do anymore or not just also remains to be seen. We're pretty comfortable with what we've got done for '17 at this stage."

With big project management, understanding how big boxes need to be built and how the project management needs to be executed, I think his experience will be quite helpful as we approach and consider the day when we take FID in Mozambique. And he'll also be a wonderful board member for management to be able to go to and use as a resource as we consider that decision.

But I think from a practical standpoint to address your issue on iDUCs, we've got other wells that we usually have in the queue in terms of their drilled and uncompleted. And so we have probably in excess of 500 wells like that. And so I think from a practical standpoint, as Al was suggesting, as we look forward into the end of the year and into next year and we have the opportunity to stand up rigs and additional crews, you will see that all of that really becomes the inventory in which we'll work off of.

As we turn the corner into the second half of 2016, we've made exceptional progress on the goals we established for this year of enhancing value, strengthening the balance sheet, high grading the portfolio and reducing costs.
In terms of enhancing value, our operating organization has done a tremendous job achieving several milestones during the quarter. As you can see in our operations report available online, we had outstanding performance in the Gulf of Mexico. This is an area, where we hold several competitive advantages: a successful exploration track record, an industry-leading project management capability and a large operated infrastructure position.
Our Gulf assets provide us a capital efficient value driver, and our record production achievements at Constitution and K2 are great examples of that. Our operators at Lucius facility also achieved record production during the quarter, with oil volumes exceeding nameplate capacity. As I suspect you noticed in our ops report, we drove another appraisal well at Shenandoah. The Shenandoah 5 well encountered more than 1,000 feet of net oil pay and expanded the eastern extent of the field with planning of the Shen 6 now underway.
We have a 33% working interest in Shenandoah after participating in a pref right process, and through that process, we picked up some additional blocks and exploration opportunities at no cost.
Record production levels were also achieved in the DJ and the Delaware Basins, and we were able to increase our activity over our initial expectations, while still keeping capital expenditures within guidance.
In the Delaware Basin, we have further reduced our DC&E cost per well and improved our drilling cycle times, while advancing our delineation program across a very large acreage position.
In the DJ Basin, we achieved record production, while lowering our LOE by about 15% year-over-year. Our outstanding operating results are complemented by another year of strong monetization results. In the first quarter, we announced approximately $1.3 billion of monetizations. Since then, we've achieved and have received an additional $1.2 billion of proceeds and executed a successful secondary offering of WGP units.
We now expect total proceeds to be at or above $3.5 billion for the full year. So far this year, through the cost structure improvements I have mentioned as well as the dividend reduction and monetization efforts, we have significantly strengthened the balance sheet.
We've done this by retiring $3 billion of near-term maturities with our first quarter '16 covenant issuance and planning to retire the remaining $750 million of 2017 maturities from our monetization proceeds.
The cautious approach we outlined for oil price recovery at the beginning of 2015 has played out much as we anticipated. It now appears U.S. oil supply peaked at around 9.6 million barrels per day, and we expect it to bottom out around 8 million barrels per day, all the while with global demand now exceeding expectations.
Given this dynamic, I am now encouraged that a sustained $60 oil price environment is likely to emerge as we move into 2017. This price level should provide the necessary cash margins and resulting cash cycle improvements to encourage us to accelerate activity and achieve strong returns. In this scenario, we would evaluate redeploying some of the incremental proceeds from asset sales towards our highest quality U.S. onshore assets later this year.
Our unique positions in the DJ and Delaware Basins, combined with the tieback opportunities in the Gulf of Mexico, give us strong line of sight for attractive, capital efficient, short cycle oil investments as crude prices recover.
With that, we would love to take your questions, and thanks for joining us this morning."

And I foreshadowed this a little bit at the Wells Conference a few months ago, when I made the comments there that we anticipated we'd have a letdown as the market tried to absorb the 3 million barrels associated with disruptions from Venezuela, Nigeria and Canada. And as the market went through that congestion, we've -- we were going to see the leg down that we're seeing right now. And I think once we get behind -- we get that behind us, to use an economics term, ceteris paribus, we think we're looking at a sustained $60 oil price environment for next year.

And -- so the ultimate planning has to be after #6. We've got a lot of work that's going on right now though related to how we might develop this field.

That's going to be important to understand. I'd point to Mad Dog, which I believe BP has publicly discussed the fact they're going to take a decision on this year, and they've indicated that sanctioning is likely. And I think there's just a couple of takeaways from that, not necessarily that they're related to Shenandoah. One is they reduced the production solution cost from $20 billion to $8 billion, so that helps with the economics. And two, they think they've got an estimated ultimate recovery that's pretty significant. And so the EUR combined with a lower cost probably gives you a threshold for price that would not have been anticipated a few years ago for sanctioning. So we're hopeful that some of those ingredients will work into our favor as that decision comes to us over the next couple of years."

So it's things that are small enough, they generally don't get reported. The ones that we're summarizing in our asset divesture program are generally our larger transactions.

And so we saw it as a unique opportunity to sell something. I think it's fair to say that the market should continue to be receptive based on the dynamics we're seeing. It should continue to be receptive for the types of assets that we're bringing to market. Those assets share a common characteristic that they're generally not going to attract capital in our portfolio, really at virtually any gas price. And I mention the gas price because they're mostly dry gas assets. We will retain a lot of exposure to gas through the associated gas of our 2 primary U.S. onshore assets. But the dry gas assets have pretty good economics, intrinsic economics that strip pricing. And so we've seen buyers that see it as a -- need assets relative to the size of their firm and the types of things they're trying to do. Not as attractive to us. They make a lot of sense for us to sell. On the margin, we, however, are a buyer of assets. And if they're priced right and if they're in the right location, and really, the 3 core areas where we're putting capital and we believe we have competitive advantages in the Delaware, and in the Wattenberg and in the Gulf of Mexico or places where we continue to look at packages.

And debt to cap is somewhat less relevant. The oil targets are somewhat less relevant. Given that with the way the commodity prices have backed up, we and everyone else have taken a lot of write-downs of assets on the balanced sheet that have affected that -- what that debt-to-cap number might look like in the future. But when you look at debt to cash flow in particular and we look at debt per barrel and producing barrel, it is -- we feel that the balance sheet is not that far out of whack of where we'd like for it to be. The difference versus the past is that we don't expect a commodity price recovery to, I don't know, $90, $100, or whatever we were facing at a point in time when debt-to-EBITDA metrics across the industry were so much lower. And so the way we're looking at it is to try to have -- try to match our pro forma metrics to our pro forma activity levels and that pro forma commodity price, as Al mentioned, where we go back to work. So it's a bit of a moving target. And now what we know with certainly we'll do is take -- is repay the $750 million of debt that we've stated publicly repeatedly that we are going to repay of the 2017 maturities. And we believe that there should be an opportunity to reduce gross debt further through some liability management programs around many of our smaller less liquid issues. But in many cases, the holders are very happy with those issues, and we certainly wouldn't expect to pay a material premium just to retire them. We do have a put bond out there that is not callable, but it's puttable to us once a year. Certainly, there, you can negotiate around some of that type of debt, if we wanted to take our gross debt number down further. But it's our clear intent, as we've stated in the past, to continue to build cash and to ensure that we're reducing that net debt number, that we continue to remain focused on liquidity, and we're very comfortable that the liquidity position, the leverage position allows us to accelerate drilling should the commodity price warranted. But to accelerate within reason. We're talking within the hundreds of millions of dollars, not massive changes of outspending cash flow. We're pretty close even at current discretionary cash flow to spending within discretionary cash flow. So the delta here is asset sales. If we're successful with asset sales the way we have been, then it gives us a lot of flexibility based on the commodity environment and outlook that we see at the time to moderately reduce leverage, consistent with that commodity price environment and to moderately accelerate spending in places where we have really attractive returns to begin to move our production back toward growth and away from maintenance."

And that's simply, as we see U.S. oil production cascading towards that 8 million barrels a day that I made reference to in terms of where I think it will bottom out before it starts to go back up, that will, in my estimation, help a lot. And if we -- on the demand side, we continue to see 1.2 million to 1.4 million barrels per day of demand per annum through the balance of the decade, I think the combination of the 2 are quite significant. It's been our view that we will see this be a price recovery when it's demand-driven, but rather than supply constrained. Market forces don't work real well when you're relying on supply constraints to drive price. But I think if you think about it as a demand function that improves annually at the clip of 1.2 million to 1.3 million barrels a day, you can see pretty quickly that in an expanding demand relative to the supply, demand is going to move up the curve and the intersection that creates P will put pressure on prices to move up to a level of around $60 a barrel. After that point, I mean, we're going to have to see what happens from a, a demand standpoint; b, from a cost, are we going to see margin erosion? Are there returns in the cycling characteristics that we particularly follow with our onshore investing? Are they still going to be as attractive as we thought? So I'm not going to go beyond $60, but I think clearly in our estimation, the ingredients are there for recovery to sustain $60 price environment for next year. And I've probably been as big a bear around oil expectations as anyone since early 2015. And I think with this, if we continue to see the characteristics I just laid out, continue to be prevalent in the market, that will be a great indication to us for what we want to do. Looking at the forward curve, I think you know as well as I do that's a little fragile. And as you look out further, particularly in light of our -- the world we live in today and the lack of players in the market for the forward curve, it looks flat for a reason because we don't have the same participants in the curve today that we had 5 years or certainly 10 years ago. So the curve itself probably is not going to be as much of an indicator of activity as the other things I just made reference to."

It's -- the timing for 8 million barrels a day, I'm no better at projecting that than -- a lot of people are paid money just to do that by themselves in the vacuum of their own thoughts. But our view is that it could happen as early as late this year. And that's why we made -- I made the comment earlier, we think it's likely that we could see a sustained price environment of $60 developing later this year. Now for reasons that I can't quite explain, but it takes a little bit longer to get to 8 million. That could be pushed into 2017, but you know better than I do how capital intensive our industry is, particularly for unconventional development and the sustaining of production levels. And we, as an industry, have not been investing at a level that allows production to be held flat. Just exactly how fast it cascades is sort of the question I think each of us need to watch. But my comment to you would be I think it could be as early as the fourth quarter, and that's the basis by which I'm making my comments. Because I still see the demand side using IEA as the basis for that with having 1 million to 2 million, maybe 1.2 million to 1.4 million barrels per annum of additional demand. It will be a demand recovery, not a supply recovery. And it's really the basis of that demand expansion or the large and increasing portion of the pie, that I think will give us some comfort around how that actually will be sustained. As it relates to capital planning, you're right. This is not a step function. It's not linear and it's probably more likely logarithmic. As we approach $60, we'll invest more than we will at $43-ish and in terms of where WTI is today. So we're already sort of telling you today that we anticipate with improvements that we think are forecasted, that we will start to reallocate some of our monetization proceeds as we've described on this call. I think if we -- as we get into our planning for capital for next year and think about that in conjunction with the discussions with our board, the more we feel comfortable about that sustained $60 price environment, the more likely you will see us increase in capital, particularly in the areas that we're talking about on the margin, increasing capital to -- in anticipation of a price recovery.

So we've -- as we've done historically, we'd probably like to layer in some oil hedges at the right price when we like the shape of the curve. And I think from a gas standpoint, whether we do anymore or not just also remains to be seen. We're pretty comfortable with what we've got done for '17 at this stage."

Sometimes we put press releases out, you wonder if people look at them in any detail. So thanks for the question. Yes, we really felt like adding someone like David Constable to our board was very important for his skill set. Dave has got a long career at Fluor and then later at Sasol. With big project management, understanding how big boxes need to be built and how the project management needs to be executed, I think his experience will be quite helpful as we approach and consider the day when we take FID in Mozambique. And he'll also be a wonderful board member for management to be able to go to and use as a resource as we consider that decision. So not to say that we don't have board members today that are helpful in that area, we do. But we recognize the challenges associated with taking FID in Mozambique are fairly significant. And being able to add a board member like David with his skill set, we're very, very fortunate to be able to do that. And thank you, John, for asking the question."

And so I think from a practical standpoint, as Al was suggesting, as we look forward into the end of the year and into next year and we have the opportunity to stand up rigs and additional crews, you will see that all of that really becomes the inventory in which we'll work off of.

And we've also positioned the portfolio for the future, with our assets in the Delaware, DJ and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico serving as the primary sources for our growth. 
As a result, we're increasing our anticipated divestiture adjusted sales volumes for the year by 8 million BOE from the midpoint of our initial expectations, continuing to make significant reductions in our cost structure, expecting to now close more than $4 billion of monetizations this year and projecting to finish the year with more than $2.5 billion of cash on hand. 
Operationally, we've accelerated activity by adding 2 rigs in the Delaware Basin of West Texas. The company's made great strides to enhance the economics of our premier position in this world-class oil play. This has been achieved by further cost reductions, while incorporating an enhanced completion design that's increased our EURs to more than 1 million BOE per well, which enjoyed a very high oil cut. 
With our increased rig activity, we will continue to rapidly evaluate the stack [ph] pay potential across our almost 600,000 gross acres in this position. And as we move to start the development program for next year, we're quite excited.
In Colorado, the DJ Basin also added 2 rigs, and that has been done during the quarter. Our organization has done a fantastic job of driving savings and efficiencies here as well, enabling us to deliver more for less. As a result of these savings, we will reinvest this capital and drill 90 more wells, complete 50 additional wells; and with -- combined with our base optimization, we will provide more than 5 million BOE of additional production well above our expectations. 
In the Gulf of Mexico, Lucius continues to outperform, achieving a daily record of over 100,000-plus barrels of oil per day. This, along with new production from our development wells at K2 and Caesar/Tonga, increased our year-over-year oil volumes in the Gulf of Mexico by 10,000 barrels per day to 65,000 barrels per day. 
And as we announced last month, upon closing the acquisition of Freeport McMoRan's Gulf of Mexico assets, we expect to double production in the Gulf of Mexico to about 160,000 BOE per day, 85% of which is comprised of oil. We will plan to use a portion of the $4 billion of cash that we will have at quarter end to fund our [ph] acquisition and redeem the remaining $750 million of senior notes due September of 2017. As noted in last night's news release, we also expect to receive in excess of $1 billion of proceeds from the pending divestiture of our Carthage assets in East Texas. 
Our monetization program has significantly exceeded expectations as we streamlined our portfolio and materially strengthened the financial position of our company. We are increasingly more focused and competitive as a result. And as mentioned, our expectations continue accelerating our activities in the Delaware, the DJ, as well as growing the Gulf of Mexico, in an effort to improve the production and the investment of our company. This should result in delivering oil production with a combined compounded annual rate of return over the next 5 years that will show very strong double-digit growth.
Our employees have done an outstanding job of ensuring that we enhance value in the near term, and now, well into the future. I want to thank each of them for the long hours and hard work that have resulted in having Anadarko be very favorably positioned, given the operating  environment in the last 2 years.
And before I turn it to Q&A, I also want to express my appreciation from the board, from management and all of the Anadarko employees for the years of tireless effort John has provided to us and to our shareholders. John, you've done a few -- a lot of things a few can, and you'll be greatly missed. These calls won't be quite the same, but we will always remember those things that you did to make everything at Anadarko go so well on mornings when sometimes it just didn't seem to go as usually [ph] as it could have. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

But let me just say, as we looked at Silver Hill, and obviously you know the geography quite well. You know they're right next door to us in terms of how their acreage is very close. As I've looked at how these acreage values have increasingly gone to places I would never have imagined. I mean, we're paying -- or seeing people, rather, pay price per acre today that exceeded acreage values when oil was over $100. And so consequently, I think we have a little bit of pause around just the valuations and how certain of these have escalated in places. I think as we've talked to you about Mormont, the rock that we have and the Tier 1 acreage position that we're fortunate enough to be able to enjoy, have given us a lot to be proud of. Now it's not just the Wolfcamp, as you've heard us talk about in a lot of occasions. It's in addition to the Wolfcamp, the Avalons, the Bone Spring. And as a result, we have a lot here. And so maybe rather than having me explain things in detail, I'll have Darrell do so. But I will just comment lastly, and it relates to just M&A in the Delaware portion. I don't think we're done. I mean, I think I saw something from one of our competitors that said that we might see $100,000 values per acre out here pretty soon. I'm not sure if I can imagine that, but I also can't believe that we're double where we were in 2014 on a per acre basis either. So, Darrell?"

Obviously, if we pull back the $25 a share -- or $25 per barrel rather, that'll have an impact upon our investing. How we will deploy capital at that point, I think we would reconsider. We can't [ph] tell you today that we have an answer for that per se, other than we'd spend less. I think we've been very diligent about trying to stay within cash inflows with the way in which we invest and not put our balance sheet at risk. But I'm not really sure today that we see if there's a finite concern associated with investing in the Delaware, the DJ in particular, with respect to having an abundance of cash as long as we're in a $50 to $60 oil price world. So assuming that for a moment, I think you can continue to expect that we will reposition our portfolio more towards oil and away from natural gas, particularly dry grass, and that we believe it compete -- there's inability within our portfolio for dry gas to compete for capital, given what we have in the Delaware, the DJ and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. And it's not really that we are naysayers on natural gas, it's just we're the beneficiaries in extremely attractive position in both the Delaware and the DJ onshore. And as we like to remind people, and I'm sure you're well aware of this, if we happen to be a little wrong and natural gas prices go up higher than anticipated, it just makes the Delaware and DJ investments worth even more than what we had originally expected it to be with a more modest outlook for natural gas."

It's not that we think that that's the only place we're going to make investments and take consideration in the future, simply because a lot of our exploration, as you know better than most, Doug, is there for option value. So it's very important that we continue to take opportunities where we think it's a good risk rate of return opportunity to simply look for places where we may be able to have option value in the future. Colombia could be just that. Mozambique continue to be just that. It's not requiring much capital, neither one are that capital-intensive at this point, but it gives us option guide for the future. But I think the point we're trying to make is that we are and have been, for most of the last 1.5 years, consistently explaining that we're moving away from natural gas as a focus for investing. We're moving into oil and liquids concentrated opportunities, and that we're trying to simplify the way we think about, particularly our onshore business. And that means that our focus then is going to go into 2 particular place, the Delaware and the DJ Basin, simply because they provide us the best rates of return within our portfolio that compete for capital better than anything else that we have. And we believe if -- maybe we're just a little bit biased in this, but we believe it creates the best rates of return in our industry for onshore assets. So we have industry-leading assets, we believe, within our portfolio. We also think that for the allocation of capital, the return associated with that, the focus on those 3 areas is particularly important in order to show growth.

When you look at Delaware, we were at 6 rigs for the summer. We picked up a seventh rig here in the third quarter, and we picked up an eighth already in October and we'd like to pick up a ninth. So as we look at our inventory, it's all becoming one, and we just look at that as wells to be completed. So I'd sort of get away from the iDUCs. We had the same issues going on in Wattenberg where we had, I guess, the one rig, and we now picked up 2 here in October.

I mean, we've gone from 7 operated facilities in the Gulf of Mexico to 10 now. Our ability to leverage those into opportunities like Constellation, I don't think that's going to be a one and done.

And where they stood at the plant, it's not very expensive development but it was hard to do a Greenfield there. And with our Constitution platform just miles away, we were able to leverage our way in there for third working interest and we gave a PHA across our facility. And so you'll see us drilling our first development well here next year in '17, and we should see production in '18. But again, you talk compliancing. We would expect these wells to produce 15,000 barrels a day-type wells. Exactly how many n need to drill, we haven't worked through that. But it was be a great opportunity for us, like Al said, because of our infrastructure.

I think we did in the DJ Basin was for us a bit of a road map for what we're trying to do in the Delaware Basin. The difference being the Delaware Basin, Don Sinclair is using a lot of third party money. And by that, I mean, we're transmitting or processing volumes for third parties. As a result, it's not as capital-intensive net to Anadarko as it was in the DJ Basin where we were largely, if not in some cases, exclusively the equity behind system. So consequently here, we're a bit more of a third party provider of processing and transmission services or gathering. And consequently, the net capital requirements for Anadarko is a lot less as we take where we believe is the playbook in the DJ and put it work in the Delaware. That's why you've seen us make acquisitions like we did. Took about 2 years ago. That's why you've seen us organically add to what we have as well as what we acquired. And that's why we've been fairly focused on these various ramps we planned to increase our production and processing capabilities. Darrell has a fairly aggressive plan for drilling upstream dollars behind these plants, and he has, I'd say, a more modest need on capital as it relates to midstream. Darrell?"

So consequently, our ability to put more capital to work, either through cash flow or through cash on hand, we have a lot of flexibility. I'm real proud of what Bob Glennon, a lot of Our corporate Development folks working with our asset teams have been able to accomplish with the monetizations we've achieved to date and things we hope to do in the future. So whether it's cash flow or the use of cash at the point in time, we have the capacity today to do things that we've talked about wanting to be in a position to go into '17, believing that fundamentally, we should see better price support for oil. And if that's the case, I think you'll see us cycle to cash faster. You'll see us likely increase the types of things we've been talking about in the Delaware Basin first.

We don't look at exploration as sources in the near term for production. Really, our exploration activities are option value for the future, and as a result, we really do see things that we're doing today in Colombia as having option value. Now once we determine whether or not we have a commercial opportunity, we want go to development then we start to figure out where it is in the queue over a time horizon for production. But the reason for a lot of the answers today about where we put incremental capital, when you've got the positions that we do on shore on the Delaware and the DJ, that provides us extremely attractive rates of return and it also gives us a type of on-site growth that we find very attractive from a standpoint of how we enhance shareholder value. Longer term, we need to continue to find ways to look for new opportunities. What we see in Colombia excites us, both in terms of what we're currently drilling as well as what we see ourselves to the balance of the decade. So that option value is something that we'll continue to look for. There are other places and certainly the Gulf of Mexico, as you made reference to the FCX deal, I don't know if there's another one of the corner. Bob, Glenn and a lot of people did a really good job with that one. We're certainly in business as there are other people that kind of Gulf of Mexico now is attractive as we do.

Again, I sound like a broken record this morning, but Bob Glenn did a great job selling that down to ONGC. As a result, today, we still, even with all the capital we've spent in Mozambique, if you just think of it at the project level basis, we're still $300-plus million to the positive in terms of what we've invested there versus what we've taken in. So consequently, again on a project level basis, we've done a pretty darn good job of managing our exposure from a cash or capital perspective and still give ourselves a lot of option value over and whether or not we take FID. If someone decides that they like it better than we do or they see more value than we do, we're not married to it anymore are we married to any other asset of our portfolio.

I think that's what we've historically done. I think we'll continue to do that. We have 16 million acres offshore Colombia because we see a lot of prospects activity there and a lot of running room if we're correct. So I think philosophically, the types of things that we will do at exploration, whether it's in the Gulf of Mexico or internationally, are fairly similar. And the Gulf of Mexico today, given the price environment that we're in, if we don't have tieback to existing infrastructure, we're not trying out trying to drill opportunities that require greenfield development as a result. So that may be where the 2 were a little bit different because we're dealing with a much higher cost per well. Typically, we're in a pre-salt environment where the exploration opportunities. Whereas in many cases, internationally, we're post-salt. We're the cost to drill the wells substantially less and so, therefore, if we're successful, the development drilling associated with any development opportunity in a little more economically positive from the standpoint of the price environment. So now I don't think, from a standpoint of Anadarko's view of exploration or my hope for what we're able to deliver on exploration is any different today than it would have been in 2013 or '14 in a different price environment."

If I just look at your production over the -- just over the last year, you all kind of flattish [indiscernible] in gas have continued to grow. So I guess a two-part question. One, should we see that reverse as the rig counts are to climb again or is that just a function of the slowdown or drilling it from a gas geowaters climbing in the out years? And then second, I know some of the other operators may have potential issues next summer as far as really flying pressures more in that the CP the middle to the upper part of the basin.

In terms of the well count, then -- and maybe the oil ratio, I do think you're seeing the impact of the lack of capital spend this year in Wattenberg. And so as the field continues to produce, it does go to a higher GOR. And generally, we've been able to offset as we brought in and drill more wells and put new wells on because they are higher oil cut. So if you just think about, we went 2 quarters in a row with 1 rig, so we don't have a lot of new production coming on. I will have to say that the field guys did a fantastic job hitting the records they did. Yes, a lot of it was gas, but I can tell you that the peek we had in the third quarter after such activity was a fantastic accomplishment on their part. But as we stand up more rigs, and we bring more wells online, you're going to see that turn and again and you should start seeing our oil production go up. It may not be by year-end or even first quarter, but I think we would anticipate next year to reverse that trend, and you'll see the oil production start rising again."

So we really see little impact in '17 from a volume standpoint, but we got to remap this thing and try to better understand it. It may have a reserve impact, and we'll work through that before the end of the year. But I think as part as we're concerned, we don't see an impairment on our side based on our investment here. But it was truly a disappointment and a real surprise as to this being wet there. So it sort of takes away from the northern end of the field, but we're still very high on the south end of the field and high in the Burg as well. So that will be future wells."

It's a bittersweet morning, but we achieved a lot in the first 3 quarters of 2016 and positioned the company well. And we've also positioned the portfolio for the future, with our assets in the Delaware, DJ and the deepwater Gulf of Me",719,"Well, thanks, John. It's a bittersweet morning, but we achieved a lot in the first 3 quarters of 2016 and positioned the company well. And we've also positioned the portfolio for the future, with our assets in the Delaware, DJ and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico serving as the primary sources for our growth. 
As a result, we're increasing our anticipated divestiture adjusted sales volumes for the year by 8 million BOE from the midpoint of our initial expectations, continuing to make significant reductions in our cost structure, expecting to now close more than $4 billion of monetizations this year and projecting to finish the year with more than $2.5 billion of cash on hand. 
Operationally, we've accelerated activity by adding 2 rigs in the Delaware Basin of West Texas. The company's made great strides to enhance the economics of our premier position in this world-class oil play. This has been achieved by further cost reductions, while incorporating an enhanced completion design that's increased our EURs to more than 1 million BOE per well, which enjoyed a very high oil cut. 
With our increased rig activity, we will continue to rapidly evaluate the stack pay potential across our almost 600,000 gross acres in this position. And as we move to start the development program for next year, we're quite excited.
In Colorado, the DJ Basin also added 2 rigs, and that has been done during the quarter. Our organization has done a fantastic job of driving savings and efficiencies here as well, enabling us to deliver more for less. As a result of these savings, we will reinvest this capital and drill 90 more wells, complete 50 additional wells; and with -- combined with our base optimization, we will provide more than 5 million BOE of additional production well above our expectations. 
In the Gulf of Mexico, Lucius continues to outperform, achieving a daily record of over 100,000-plus barrels of oil per day. This, along with new production from our development wells at K2 and Caesar/Tonga, increased our year-over-year oil volumes in the Gulf of Mexico by 10,000 barrels per day to 65,000 barrels per day. 
And as we announced last month, upon closing the acquisition of Freeport McMoRan's Gulf of Mexico assets, we expect to double production in the Gulf of Mexico to about 160,000 BOE per day, 85% of which is comprised of oil. We will plan to use a portion of the $4 billion of cash that we will have at quarter end to fund our acquisition and redeem the remaining $750 million of senior notes due September of 2017. As noted in last night's news release, we also expect to receive in excess of $1 billion of proceeds from the pending divestiture of our Carthage assets in East Texas. 
Our monetization program has significantly exceeded expectations as we streamlined our portfolio and materially strengthened the financial position of our company. We are increasingly more focused and competitive as a result. And as mentioned, our expectations continue accelerating our activities in the Delaware, the DJ, as well as growing the Gulf of Mexico, in an effort to improve the production and the investment of our company. This should result in delivering oil production with a combined compounded annual rate of return over the next 5 years that will show very strong double-digit growth.
Our employees have done an outstanding job of ensuring that we enhance value in the near term, and now, well into the future. I want to thank each of them for the long hours and hard work that have resulted in having Anadarko be very favorably positioned, given the operating  environment in the last 2 years.
And before I turn it to Q&A, I also want to express my appreciation from the board, from management and all of the Anadarko employees for the years of tireless effort John has provided to us and to our shareholders. John, you've done a few -- a lot of things a few can, and you'll be greatly missed. These calls won't be quite the same, but we will always remember those things that you did to make everything at Anadarko go so well on mornings when sometimes it just didn't seem to go as usually as it could have. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

But let me just say, as we looked at Silver Hill, and obviously you know the geography quite well. You know they're right next door to us in terms of how their acreage is very close. As I've looked at how these acreage values have increasingly gone to places I would never have imagined. I mean, we're paying -- or seeing people, rather, pay price per acre today that exceeded acreage values when oil was over $100. And so consequently, I think we have a little bit of pause around just the valuations and how certain of these have escalated in places. I think as we've talked to you about Mormont, the rock that we have and the Tier 1 acreage position that we're fortunate enough to be able to enjoy, have given us a lot to be proud of. Now it's not just the Wolfcamp, as you've heard us talk about in a lot of occasions. It's in addition to the Wolfcamp, the Avalons, the Bone Spring. And as a result, we have a lot here. And so maybe rather than having me explain things in detail, I'll have Darrell do so. But I will just comment lastly, and it relates to just M&A in the Delaware portion. I don't think we're done. I mean, I think I saw something from one of our competitors that said that we might see $100,000 values per acre out here pretty soon. I'm not sure if I can imagine that, but I also can't believe that we're double where we were in 2014 on a per acre basis either. So, Darrell?"

When you think about what else is there outside the Wolfcamp, and we recognize those things and we keep quoting numbers on the Wolfcamp, and that's because we think that's the largest price, not that the other ones won't contribute to our bottom line overtime. But if you go back to the offshore port, you can see on Page 6 some of the -- because of our acreage position being as large as it is, we're continuing to spend time to make sure we understand the Wolfcamp -- particularly the Wolfcamp A, it's the -- it's by far the best zone because it has a number of benches in it. We're not discounting the Avalon and Bone Springs. We think they have a lot of potential. But at this point, we're going to some of the deeper depths and testing that first. So we'll get to that, eventually. But right now, we're really focused on exploiting the Wolfcamp and understanding exactly what we have in our position.

Obviously, if we pull back the $25 a share -- or $25 per barrel rather, that'll have an impact upon our investing. How we will deploy capital at that point, I think we would reconsider. We can't tell you today that we have an answer for that per se, other than we'd spend less. I think we've been very diligent about trying to stay within cash inflows with the way in which we invest and not put our balance sheet at risk. But I'm not really sure today that we see if there's a finite concern associated with investing in the Delaware, the DJ in particular, with respect to having an abundance of cash as long as we're in a $50 to $60 oil price world. So assuming that for a moment, I think you can continue to expect that we will reposition our portfolio more towards oil and away from natural gas, particularly dry grass, and that we believe it compete -- there's inability within our portfolio for dry gas to compete for capital, given what we have in the Delaware, the DJ and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. And it's not really that we are naysayers on natural gas, it's just we're the beneficiaries in extremely attractive position in both the Delaware and the DJ onshore. And as we like to remind people, and I'm sure you're well aware of this, if we happen to be a little wrong and natural gas prices go up higher than anticipated, it just makes the Delaware and DJ investments worth even more than what we had originally expected it to be with a more modest outlook for natural gas."

Colombia could be just that. Mozambique continue to be just that. It's not requiring much capital, neither one are that capital-intensive at this point, but it gives us option guide for the future. But I think the point we're trying to make is that we are and have been, for most of the last 1.5 years, consistently explaining that we're moving away from natural gas as a focus for investing. We're moving into oil and liquids concentrated opportunities, and that we're trying to simplify the way we think about, particularly our onshore business. And that means that our focus then is going to go into 2 particular place, the Delaware and the DJ Basin, simply because they provide us the best rates of return within our portfolio that compete for capital better than anything else that we have. And we believe if -- maybe we're just a little bit biased in this, but we believe it creates the best rates of return in our industry for onshore assets. So we have industry-leading assets, we believe, within our portfolio. We also think that for the allocation of capital, the return associated with that, the focus on those 3 areas is particularly important in order to show growth. And that growth will largely be oil growth in the coming years through the balance of the decade."

But at this juncture, I would describe the success we've had as quite good, but that does not correlate yet into a commercial discussion until we have a gas contract that we believe, in fact, gives us that development opportunity.

We've talked about increasing there another 50 completions just based upon the capital we've saved by being more efficient. So as we move through this, we're moving into a higher-price environment. We think, fundamentally, we should continue to see improvement in the quarters ahead. As a result, you'll see us continue to work more to, I'll call it, a working inventory level of drilled but uncompleted. It's not an abnormal level of that. Because I think, as each of the people in this call know quite well, I mean, we have an ongoing sort of like working capital position with respect to drilled uncompleted locations. So it's not like it'll be completely eliminated. But I think given the price environment that we see ourselves in today and projected in the coming quarters, we'll convert more as appropriate of that current inventory into completions. But it's not a marked change.

When you look at Delaware, we were at 6 rigs for the summer. We picked up a seventh rig here in the third quarter, and we picked up an eighth already in October and we'd like to pick up a ninth. So as we look at our inventory, it's all becoming one, and we just look at that as wells to be completed. So I'd sort of get away from the iDUCs. We had the same issues going on in Wattenberg where we had, I guess, the one rig, and we now picked up 2 here in October. And it's very likely we'll pick up another rig, if not 2, here before the end of the year as we go into 2017 and move our program forward.

I think what we did in the DJ Basin was for us a bit of a road map for what we're trying to do in the Delaware Basin. The difference being the Delaware Basin, and Don Sinclair is using a lot of third party money, and by that I mean we're transmitting or processing volumes for third parties. As a result, it's not as capital-intensive net to Anadarko as it was in the DJ Basin where we were largely, if not, in some cases, exclusively the equity behind the system. So consequently here, we're a bit more of a third-party provider of processing and transmission services or gathering. And consequently, the net capital requirement for Anadarko is a lot less as we take what we believe is the playbook in, well, the DJ and put it work in the Delaware. That's why you've seen us make acquisitions like we did just about 2 years ago. That's why you've seen us organically add to what we have as well as what we acquired. And that's why we've been fairly focused on these various ramps we planned to increase our production and processing capabilities. Darrell has a fairly aggressive plan for drilling upstream dollars behind these plants, and he has, I'd say, a more modest need on capital as it relates to midstream. So, Darrell?"

I'm real proud of what Bob Gwin and what our corporate development folks working with our asset teams have been able to accomplish with the monetizations we've achieved to date and things we hope to do in the future. So whether it's cash flow or the use of cash at a point in time, we have the capacity today to do things that we've talked about wanting to be in a position to go into '17, believing that fundamentally, we should see better price support for oil. And if that's the case, I think you'll see us cycle the cash faster.

We don't look at exploration as sources in the near term for production. That really our exploration activities are our option value for the future, and as a result, we really do see things that we're doing today in Colombia as having option value. Now once we determine whether or not we have a commercial opportunity, we want go to development then we start to figure out where it is in the queue over a time horizon for production. But the reason for a lot of the answers today about where we put incremental capital, when you've got the positions that we do onshore in the Delaware and the DJ, that provides us extremely attractive rates of return and it also gives us the type of on-site growth that we find very attractive from a standpoint of how we enhance shareholder value. Longer term, we need to continue to find ways to look for new opportunities. What we see in Colombia excites us, both in terms of what we're currently drilling as well as what we see ourselves drilling through the balance of the decade. So that option value is something that we'll continue to look for. There are other places -- and certainly the Gulf of Mexico, as you made reference to the FCX deal. I don't know if there's another one of the corner. Bob Gwin and a lot of people did a really good job with that one. We're certainly in business. But there are other people that find of Gulf of Mexico now is attractive as we do, we'd be happy to try to buy some more assets for 1.5x next year's cash flow."

So it'd be pure conjecture on my part. I don't know that I even could come close to telling you whether or not I have a view on that. I know that when we executed the 10% working interest sell-down, it was a part of the playbook that we did not want that much working interest if we were to take FID. Again, I sound like a broken record this morning, but Bob Gwin did a great job selling that down to ONGC. As a result, today, we still, even with all the capital we've spent in Mozambique, if you just think of it on a project level basis, we're still $300-plus million to the positive in terms of what we've invested there versus what we've taken in. So consequently, again on a project level basis, we've done a pretty darn good job of managing our exposure from a cash or capital perspective and still give ourselves a lot of option value around whether or not we take FID. If someone decides that they like it better than we do or they see more value than we do, we're not married to it any more than we are married to any other asset in our portfolio. But we do believe today that we have the skills, capability. And we also believe the opportunity, if we take it to FID, for it to be a game-changer for our company. And so consequently, Mitch looks at this every day with a very balanced view of what's best for Anadarko in the next decade."

And that's what we've historically done, I think we'll continue to do that. We have 16 million acres offshore Colombia because we see a lot of prospectivity there and a lot of running room if we're correct. So I think, philosophically, the types of things that we will do in exploration, whether it's in the Gulf of Mexico or internationally, are fairly similar. And the Gulf of Mexico today, given the price environment that we're in, if we don't have tieback to existing infrastructure, we're not trying out trying to drill opportunities that require greenfield development as a result. So that maybe where the 2 are a little bit different because we're dealing with a much higher cost per well. Typically, we're in a pre-salt environment with the exploration opportunities. Whereas in many cases, internationally, we're post-salt, where the cost to drill a well is substantially less. And so, therefore, if we're successful, the development drilling associated with any development opportunity is little more economically positive from the standpoint of the price environment. So now I don't think, from a standpoint of Anadarko's view of exploration or my hope for what we're able to deliver on exploration, is any different today than it would have been in 2013 or '14 in a different price environment."

In terms of the well count and maybe the oil ratio, I do think you're seeing the impact of the lack of capital spend this year in Wattenberg. And so as the field continues to produce, it does go to a higher GOR. And generally, we've been able to offset as we brought in -- drill more wells and put new wells on because they're higher oil cut. So if you just think about we went 2 quarters in a row with 1 rig, so we don't have a lot of new production coming on. I will have to say that the field guys did a fantastic job hitting the records they did. Yes, a lot of it was gas, but I can tell you that the peak we hit in the third quarter after such little activity was a fantastic accomplishment on their part. But as we stand up more rigs and we bring more wells online, you're going to see that turn again, and you'll -- you should start seeing our oil production go up.

So the next well we'll get to will actually top set the first well and go over to drill a Purple Angel well, and that's probably going to be about a 45-day well, give or take a few days. And as we carry into the new year in 2017, we'll move over and drill another prospect in the similar section. They're called Gorgon. So they're not long wells. We're continuing to get up the learning curve on drilling wells in Colombia, and we look forward to seeing those results. But what I would remind you of a little bit is we're really looking forward to getting over to the coal area where we shot the 30,000 square kilometers of 3D, and we've just got a fast-track volume in looking for the final volume in by the end of next year. And our goal is really to accelerate drilling activity over in that big chunk of acreage in the ultra-deepwater offshore in Colombia. Looking for oil, of course, there.

I mean, we see -- we've always believed around $3 that there was just an impediment from a demand standpoint for now. But I think it also is the reason a lot of people -- in January, we talked about selling our natural gas properties and people kind of looked at me cross-eyed that we would actually have a market for it. There's been a lot of very successful private equity people that have taken a view on natural gas and done quite well with it. I think for a company like ours that has the assets that we do and our access to oil and liquids that we do, consequently, it's not really in our best interest to pursue natural gas. It doesn't give us the same wellhead margin. It doesn't give us the same ability to add scalability. And the returns, coupled with the scalability, just always tilt in the favor of the DJ and the Delaware for us. John, I just have to say, I don't mind being wrong, but I think our view is that it would take natural gas to approach $6 before it would probably displace our interest investing in oil, and I don't see that happening."

It's a bittersweet morning, but we achieved a lot in the first 3 quarters of 2016 and positioned the company well. And we've also positioned the portfolio for the future, with our assets in the Delaware, DJ and the deepwater Gulf of Me",718,"Well, thanks, John. It's a bittersweet morning, but we achieved a lot in the first 3 quarters of 2016 and positioned the company well. And we've also positioned the portfolio for the future, with our assets in the Delaware, DJ and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico serving as the primary sources for our growth. 
As a result, we're increasing our anticipated divestiture adjusted sales volumes for the year by 8 million BOE from the midpoint of our initial expectations, continuing to make significant reductions in our cost structure, expecting to now close more than $4 billion of monetizations this year and projecting to finish the year with more than $2.5 billion of cash on hand. 
Operationally, we've accelerated activity by adding 2 rigs in the Delaware Basin of West Texas. The company's made great strides to enhance the economics of our premier position in this world-class oil play. This has been achieved by further cost reductions while incorporating an enhanced completion design that's increased our EURs to more than 1 million BOE per well, which enjoys a very high oil cut. 
With our increased rig activity, we will continue to rapidly evaluate the stack pay potential across our almost 600,000 gross acres in this position. And as we move to start the development program for next year, we're quite excited.
In Colorado, the DJ Basin also added 2 rigs, and that has been done during the quarter. Our organization has done a fantastic job of driving savings and efficiencies here as well, enabling us to deliver more for less. As a result of these savings, we will reinvest this capital and drill 90 more wells, complete 50 additional wells, and with -- combined with our base optimization, we will provide more than 5 million BOE of additional production, well above our expectations. 
In the Gulf of Mexico, Lucius continues to outperform, achieving a daily record of over 100,000-plus barrels of oil per day. This, along with new production from our development wells at K2 and Caesar/Tonga, increased our year-over-year oil volumes in the Gulf of Mexico by 10,000 barrels per day to 65,000 barrels per day. 
And as we announced last month, upon closing the acquisition of Freeport McMoRan's Gulf of Mexico assets, we expect to double production in the Gulf of Mexico to about 160,000 BOE per day, 85% of which is comprised of oil. We will plan to use a portion of the $4 billion of cash that we will have at quarter-end to fund our acquisition and redeem the remaining $750 million of senior notes due September of 2017. As noted in last night's news release, we also expect to receive in excess of $1 billion of proceeds from the pending divestiture of our Carthage assets in East Texas. 
Our monetization program has significantly exceeded expectations as we streamlined our portfolio and materially strengthened the financial position of our company. We are increasingly more focused and competitive as a result. And as mentioned, our expectations continue accelerating our activities in the Delaware, the DJ, as well as growing the Gulf of Mexico, in an effort to improve the production and the investment of our company. This should result in delivering oil production with a combined compounded annual rate of return over the next 5 years that will show very strong double-digit growth.
Our employees have done an outstanding job of ensuring that we enhance value in the near term, and now, well into the future. I want to thank each of them for the long hours and hard work that have resulted in having Anadarko be very favorably positioned, given the operating environment in the last 2 years.
And before I turn it to Q&A, I also want to express my appreciation from the board, from management and all of the Anadarko employees for the years of tireless effort John has provided to us and to our shareholders. John, you've done a few -- a lot of things that few can, and you'll be greatly missed. These calls won't be quite the same, but we will always remember those things that you did to make everything at Anadarko go so well on mornings when sometimes it just didn't seem to go as easily as it could have. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

And so maybe rather than having me explain things in detail, I'll have Darrell do so. But I will just comment lastly, and it relates to just M&A in the Delaware portion. I don't think we're done. I mean, I think I saw something from one of our competitors that said that we might see $100,000 values per acre out here pretty soon. I'm not sure if I can imagine that, but I also can't believe that we're double where we were in 2014 on a per-acre basis either. So, Darrell?"

When you think about what else is there outside the Wolfcamp -- and we recognize those things and we keep quoting numbers on the Wolfcamp, and that's because we think that's the largest prize, not that the other ones won't contribute to our bottom line over time. But if you go back to the offshore part, you can see on Page 6 some of the -- because of our acreage position being as large as it is, we're continuing to spend time to make sure we understand the Wolfcamp, particularly the Wolfcamp A. It's the -- it's by far the best zone because it has a number of benches in it. We're not discounting the Avalon and Bone Springs. We think they have a lot of potential. But at this point, we're going to some of the deeper depths and testing that first. So we'll get to that, eventually. But right now, we're really focused on exploiting the Wolfcamp and understanding exactly what we have in our position. And we've been pretty pleased as to what we've found to date."

Obviously, if we pull back to $25 a share -- or $25 per barrel rather, that'll have an impact upon our investing. How we will deploy capital at that point, I think we would reconsider. I wouldn't tell you today that we have an answer for that per se, other than we'd spend less. I think we've been very diligent about trying to stay within cash inflows with the way in which we invest and not put our balance sheet at risk. But I'm not really sure today that we see if there's a finite concern associated with investing in the Delaware, the DJ in particular, with respect to having an abundance of cash as long as we're in a $50 to $60 oil price world. So assuming that for a moment, I think you can continue to expect that we will reposition our portfolio more towards oil and away from natural gas, particularly dry gas, and that we believe it compete -- there's inability within our portfolio for dry gas to compete for capital, given what we have in the Delaware, the DJ and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. And it's really not that we are naysayers on natural gas, it's just we're the beneficiaries in extremely attractive positions in both the Delaware and the DJ onshore. And as we like to remind people, and I'm sure you're well aware of this, if we happen to be a little wrong and natural gas prices go up higher than anticipated, it just makes the Delaware and DJ investments worth even more than what we had originally expected it to be with a more modest outlook for natural gas."

It's not that we think that that's the only place we're going to make investments and take consideration in the future, simply because a lot of our exploration, as you know better than most, Doug, is there for option value. So it's very important that we continue to take opportunities where we think it's a good risk rate of return opportunity to simply look for places where we may be able to have option value in the future. Colombia could be just that. Mozambique could continue to be just that. It's not requiring much capital, neither one are that capital-intensive at this point, but it gives us option value for the future. But I think the point we're trying to make is that we are and have been, for most of the last 1.5 years, consistently explaining that we're moving away from natural gas as a focus for investing. We're moving into oil and liquids concentrated opportunities, and that we're trying to simplify the way in which we think about, particularly, our onshore business. And that means that our focus then is going to go into 2 particular plays, the Delaware and the DJ Basin, simply because they provide us the best rates of return within our portfolio that compete for capital better than anything else that we have. And we believe if -- maybe we're just a little bit biased in this, but we believe it creates the best rates of return in our industry for onshore assets. So we have industry-leading assets, we believe, within our portfolio. We also think that for the allocation of capital, the return associated with that, the focus on those 3 areas is particularly important in order to show growth. And that growth will largely be oil growth in the coming years through the balance of the decade."

So as we look at our inventory, it's all becoming one, and we just look at it as wells to be completed. So I'd sort of get away from the iDUCs. We had the same issues going on in Wattenberg where we had, like I said, the one rig, and we now picked up 2 here in October. And it's very likely we'll pick up another rig, if not 2, here before the end of the year as we go into 2017 and move our program forward.

I think what we did in the DJ Basin was, for us, a bit of a road map for what we're trying to do in the Delaware Basin. The difference being the Delaware Basin, and Don Sinclair is using a lot of third-party money, and by that I mean we're transmitting or processing volumes for third parties. As a result, it's not as capital-intensive net to Anadarko as it was in the DJ Basin where we were largely, if not, in some cases, exclusively the equity behind the system. So consequently here, we're a bit more of a third-party provider of processing and transmission services or gathering. And consequently, the net capital requirement for Anadarko is a lot less as we take what we believe is the playbook in the DJ and put it work in the Delaware. That's why you've seen us make acquisitions like we did just about 2 years ago. That's why you've seen us organically add to what we have as well as what we acquired. And that's why we've been fairly focused on these various ramps we planned to increase our production and processing capabilities. Darrell has a fairly aggressive plan for drilling upstream dollars behind these plants, and he has, I'd say, a more modest need on capital as it relates to midstream. So, Darrell?"

But if you -- again, going back to the offshore part, you see the scattered fashion in which we're trying to delineate the field, it does create some challenges on the facility side. And so we'll still be trucking some of our volumes. But the extent we can, it's giving us the opportunity to really extend that footprint. I think from a bigger-picture standpoint, as we look into '17, your question on capacity constraints, we don't see it.

So consequently, our ability to put more capital to work, either through cash flow or through cash on hand, we have a lot of flexibility. I'm real proud of what Bob Gwin and what our corporate development folks working with our asset teams have been able to accomplish with the monetizations we've achieved to date and things we hope to do in the future. So whether it's cash flow or the use of cash at a point in time, we have the capacity today to do things that we've talked about wanting to be in a position to do going into '17, believing that fundamentally, we should see better price support for oil. And if that's the case, I think you'll see us cycle the cash faster. You'll see us likely increase the types of things we've been talking about in the Delaware Basin first, and I think Darrell probably would stand up rigs in the Delaware ahead of DJ to some extent.

We don't look at exploration as sources in the near term for production. That really our exploration activities are our option value for the future, and as a result, we really do see things that we're doing today in Colombia as having option value. Now once we determine whether or not we have a commercial opportunity, we want go to development, then we start to figure out where it is in the queue over a time horizon for production. But the reason for a lot of the answers today about where we put incremental capital, when you've got the positions that we do onshore in the Delaware and the DJ, that provides us extremely attractive rates of return and it also gives us the type of on-site growth that we find very attractive from a standpoint of how we enhance shareholder value. Longer term, we need to continue to find ways to look for new opportunities. What we see in Colombia excites us, both in terms of what we're currently drilling as well as what we see ourselves drilling through the balance of the decade. So that option value is something that we'll continue to look for. There are other places, and certainly the Gulf of Mexico, as you made reference to the FCX deal. I don't know if there's another one around the corner. Bob Gwin and a lot of people did a really good job with that one. We're certainly in business. If there are other people that find of Gulf of Mexico not as attractive as we do, we'd be happy to try to buy some more assets for 1.5x next year's cash flow."

So it'd be pure conjecture on my part. I don't know that I even could come close to telling you whether or not I have a view on that. I know that when we executed the 10% working interest sell-down, it was a part of the playbook that we did not want that much working interest if we were to take FID. Again, I sound like a broken record this morning, but Bob Gwin did a great job selling that down to ONGC. As a result, today, we still, even with all the capital we've spent in Mozambique, if you just think of it on a project-level basis, we're still $300-plus million to the positive in terms of what we've invested there versus what we've taken in. So consequently, again on a project level basis, we've done a pretty darn good job of managing our exposure from a cash or capital perspective and still give ourselves a lot of option value around whether or not we take FID. If someone decides that they like it better than we do or they see more value than we do, we're not married to it any more than we are married to any other asset in our portfolio. But we do believe today that we have the skills, the capability, and we also believe the opportunity, if we take it to FID, for it to be a game-changer for our company.

And that's what we've historically done, I think we'll continue to do that. We have 16 million acres offshore Colombia because we see a lot of prospectivity there and a lot of running room if we're correct. So I think, philosophically, the types of things that we will do in exploration, whether it's in the Gulf of Mexico or internationally, are fairly similar. And the Gulf of Mexico today, given the price environment that we're in, if we don't have tieback to existing infrastructure, we're not out trying to drill opportunities that require greenfield development as a result. So that may be where the 2 are a little bit different because we're dealing with a much higher cost per well. Typically, we're in a pre-salt environment with the exploration opportunities. Whereas in many cases, internationally, we're post-salt, where the cost to drill a well is substantially less. And so, therefore, if we're successful, the development drilling associated with any development opportunity is a little more economically positive from the standpoint of the price environment. So I don't think, from a standpoint of Anadarko's view of exploration or my hope for what we're able to deliver on exploration, is any different today than it would have been in 2013 or '14 in a different price environment."

If I just look at your production over the -- just over the last year, the oil kind of stayed flattish, NGLs and gas have continued to grow. So I guess a 2-part question. One, should we see that reverse as the rig count starts to climb again? Or is that just a function of the slowdown of drilling and some of the gas GORs climbing in the outyears? And then second, I know some of the other operators may have potential issues next summer as far as it relates to line pressures up more in that the DCP, the middle to the upper part of the basin. How do you guys -- I assume you're okay with your infrastructure, given what you did a few years prior, but how do you -- how would you answer those 2 questions?"

We've got Lancaster plants. We're in pretty good shape. So we don't actually see any of those pressures that you're talking about. In terms of the well count and maybe the oil ratio, I do think you're seeing the impact of the lack of capital spend this year in Wattenberg. And so as the field continues to produce, it does go to a higher GOR. And generally, we've been able to offset as we brought in -- drill more wells and put new wells on because they're higher oil cut. So if you just think about we went 2 quarters in a row with 1 rig, so we don't have a lot of new production coming on. I will have to say that the field guys did a fantastic job hitting the records they did. Yes, a lot of it was gas, but I can tell you that the peak we hit in the third quarter after such little activity was a fantastic accomplishment on their part. But as we stand up more rigs and we bring more wells online, you're going to see that turn again, and you'll -- you should start seeing our oil production go up. It may not be by year-end or even first quarter, but I think we would anticipate next year to reverse that trend and you'll see the oil production start rising again."

A lot of times, our industry is very focused on rate of return and not cash-on-cash because, as everybody knows on this call, it's great to have an internal rate of return that's 50%, but if you get the cash back in the year and you're pretty much done, that's a hard treadmill to continue. So we want a cocktail or a mix that gives us really good rates of return with really good cash-on-cash characteristics. So there could be a role that Shenandoah or another option like that plays in our portfolio.

And our goal is really to accelerate drilling activity over in that big chunk of acreage in the ultra-deepwater offshore in Colombia. Looking for oil, of course, there.

I think for a company like ours that has the assets that we do and our access to oil and liquids that we do, consequently, it's not really in our best interest to pursue natural gas.

Yes, we've been surprised by it, but I will say that if we end up finding ourselves having to take a reserve right now, it will be very modest. The reason we've not impaired to-date, if you recall, we promoted out the development drilling here, so our cost basis here is a lot different than our partners. And therefore, in addition to the cost base, we also have the advantage of the way it's carried from an impairment standpoint or reserve adjustment if one's needed. So in the scheme of things for us, it's a very small adjustment if it turns out to be the case."

It's been a pleasure for the 10 years that he's been on the job to work with him, and we have every confidence that he has got Robin ready to go.

And as most of you know, after 41 quarterly calls, 10 investor conferences or updates, I'm retiring from Anadarko, and today is my last day in Investor Relations. I've had a great time working with the company over the years, and especially working with you guys on -- over the course of my 10 years here in Investor Relations. I'm very confident in passing the baton to Robin Fielder who, along with Pete Zagrzecki; and the newest member of the IR team, Jim Grant, a geoscientist, who is replacing Shandell Szabo, who was recently promoted to Vice President in our onshore group.

It's a bittersweet morning, but we achieved a lot in the first 3 quarters of 2016 and positioned the company well.

It's a bittersweet morning, but we achieved a lot in the first 3 quarters of 2016 and positioned the company well. And we've also positioned the portfolio for the future, with our assets in the Delaware, DJ and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico serving as the primary sources for our growth. 
As a result, we're increasing our anticipated divestiture adjusted sales volumes for the year by 8 million BOE from the midpoint of our initial expectations, continuing to make significant reductions in our cost structure, expecting to now close more than $4 billion of monetizations this year and projecting to finish the year with more than $2.5 billion of cash on hand. 
Operationally, we've accelerated activity by adding 2 rigs in the Delaware Basin of West Texas. The company's made great strides to enhance the economics of our premier position in this world-class oil play. This has been achieved by further cost reductions while incorporating an enhanced completion design that's increased our EURs to more than 1 million BOE per well, which enjoys a very high oil cut. 
With our increased rig activity, we will continue to rapidly evaluate the stack pay potential across our almost 600,000 gross acres in this position. And as we move to start the development program for next year, we're quite excited.
In Colorado, the DJ Basin also added 2 rigs, and that has been done during the quarter. Our organization has done a fantastic job of driving savings and efficiencies here as well, enabling us to deliver more for less. As a result of these savings, we will reinvest this capital and drill 90 more wells, complete 50 additional wells, and with -- combined with our base optimization, we will provide more than 5 million BOE of additional production, well above our expectations. 
In the Gulf of Mexico, Lucius continues to outperform, achieving a daily record of over 100,000-plus barrels of oil per day. This, along with new production from our development wells at K2 and Caesar/Tonga, increased our year-over-year oil volumes in the Gulf of Mexico by 10,000 barrels per day to 65,000 barrels per day. 
And as we announced last month, upon closing the acquisition of Freeport McMoRan's Gulf of Mexico assets, we expect to double production in the Gulf of Mexico to about 160,000 BOE per day, 85% of which is comprised of oil. We will plan to use a portion of the $4 billion of cash that we will have at quarter-end to fund our acquisition and redeem the remaining $750 million of senior notes due September of 2017. As noted in last night's news release, we also expect to receive in excess of $1 billion of proceeds from the pending divestiture of our Carthage assets in East Texas. 
Our monetization program has significantly exceeded expectations as we streamlined our portfolio and materially strengthened the financial position of our company. We are increasingly more focused and competitive as a result. And as mentioned, our expectations continue accelerating our activities in the Delaware, the DJ, as well as growing the Gulf of Mexico, in an effort to improve the production and the investment of our company. This should result in delivering oil production with a combined compounded annual rate of return over the next 5 years that will show very strong double-digit growth.
Our employees have done an outstanding job of ensuring that we enhance value in the near term, and now, well into the future. I want to thank each of them for the long hours and hard work that have resulted in having Anadarko be very favorably positioned, given the operating environment in the last 2 years.
And before I turn it to Q&A, I also want to express my appreciation from the board, from management and all of the Anadarko employees for the years of tireless effort John has provided to us and to our shareholders. John, you've done a few -- a lot of things that few can, and you'll be greatly missed. These calls won't be quite the same, but we will always remember those things that you did to make everything at Anadarko go so well on mornings when sometimes it just didn't seem to go as easily as it could have. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

But let me just say, as we looked at Silver Hill -- and obviously you know the geography quite well. You know they're right next door to us in terms of how their acreage is very close. As I've looked at how these acreage values have increasingly gone to places I would never have imagined. I mean, we're paying -- or seeing people, rather, pay price per acre today that exceeded acreage values when oil was over $100. And so consequently, I think we have a little bit of pause around just the valuations and how certain of these have escalated in places. I think as we've talked to you about more than once [ph], the rock that we have and the Tier 1 acreage position that we're fortunate enough to be able to enjoy have given us a lot to be proud of. Now it's not just the Wolfcamp, as you've heard us talk about on a lot of occasions. It's in addition to the Wolfcamp, the Avalons, the Bone Spring. And as a result, we have a lot here. And so maybe rather than having me explain things in detail, I'll have Darrell do so. But I will just comment lastly, and it relates to just M&A in the Delaware portion. I don't think we're done. I mean, I think I saw something from one of our competitors that said that we might see $100,000 values per acre out here pretty soon. I'm not sure if I can imagine that, but I also can't believe that we're double where we were in 2014 on a per-acre basis either. So Darrell?"

But if you go back to the offshore part, you can see on Page 6 some of the -- because of our acreage position being as large as it is, we're continuing to spend time to make sure we understand the Wolfcamp, particularly the Wolfcamp A. It's the -- it's by far the best zone because it has a number of benches in it. We're not discounting the Avalon and Bone Springs. We think they have a lot of potential. But at this point, we're going to some of the deeper depths and testing that first. So we'll get to that, eventually.

Obviously, if we pull back to $25 a share -- or $25 per barrel rather, that'll have an impact upon our investing. How we will deploy capital at that point, I think we would reconsider. I wouldn't tell you today that we have an answer for that per se, other than we'd spend less. I think we've been very diligent about trying to stay within cash inflows with the way in which we invest and not put our balance sheet at risk. But I'm not really sure today that we see if there's a finite concern associated with investing in the Delaware, the DJ in particular, with respect to having an abundance of cash as long as we're in a $50 to $60 oil price world. So assuming that for a moment, I think you can continue to expect that we will reposition our portfolio more towards oil and away from natural gas, particularly dry gas, and that we believe it compete -- there's inability within our portfolio for dry gas to compete for capital, given what we have in the Delaware, the DJ and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. And it's really not that we are naysayers on natural gas, it's just we're the beneficiaries in extremely attractive positions in both the Delaware and the DJ onshore. And as we like to remind people, and I'm sure you're well aware of this, if we happen to be a little wrong and natural gas prices go up higher than anticipated, it just makes the Delaware and DJ investments worth even more than what we had originally expected it to be with a more modest outlook for natural gas."

It's not that we think that that's the only place we're going to make investments and take consideration in the future, simply because a lot of our exploration, as you know better than most, Doug, is there for option value. So it's very important that we continue to take opportunities where we think it's a good risk rate of return opportunity to simply look for places where we may be able to have option value in the future. Colombia could be just that. Mozambique could continue to be just that. It's not requiring much capital, neither one are that capital-intensive at this point, but it gives us option value for the future. But I think the point we're trying to make is that we are and have been, for most of the last 1.5 years, consistently explaining that we're moving away from natural gas as a focus for investing. We're moving into oil and liquids concentrated opportunities, and that we're trying to simplify the way in which we think about, particularly, our onshore business. And that means that our focus then is going to go into 2 particular plays, the Delaware and the DJ Basin, simply because they provide us the best rates of return within our portfolio that compete for capital better than anything else that we have. And we believe if -- maybe we're just a little bit biased in this, but we believe it creates the best rates of return in our industry for onshore assets. So we have industry-leading assets, we believe, within our portfolio. We also think that for the allocation of capital, the return associated with that, the focus on those 3 areas is particularly important in order to show growth.

We've talked about increasing there another 50 completions just based upon the capital we've saved by being more efficient. So as we move through this, we're moving into a higher-price environment. We think, fundamentally, we should continue to see improvement in the quarters ahead. As a result, you'll see us continue to work more to, I'll call it, a working inventory level of drilled but uncompleted. It's not an abnormal level of that. Because I think, as each of the people in this call know quite well, I mean, we have an ongoing sort of like working capital position with respect to drilled uncompleted locations. So it's not like it'll be completely eliminated. But I think given the price environment that we see ourselves in today and projected in the coming quarters, we'll convert more, as appropriate, of that current inventory into completions. But it's not a marked change. I think it's just what we've been trying to say through the course of the year that we will, at the appropriate time, start to convert our drilled and uncompleted locations into opportunities for production.

When you look at Delaware, we were at 6 rigs for the summer. We picked up a seventh rig here in the third quarter, and we picked up an eighth already in October and we'd like to pick up a ninth. So as we look at our inventory, it's all becoming one, and we just look at it as wells to be completed. So I'd sort of get away from the iDUCs. We had the same issues going on in Wattenberg where we had, like I said, the one rig, and we now picked up 2 here in October. And it's very likely we'll pick up another rig, if not 2, here before the end of the year as we go into 2017 and move our program forward.

I think what we did in the DJ Basin was, for us, a bit of a road map for what we're trying to do in the Delaware Basin. The difference being the Delaware Basin, and Don Sinclair is using a lot of third-party money, and by that I mean we're transmitting or processing volumes for third parties. As a result, it's not as capital-intensive net to Anadarko as it was in the DJ Basin where we were largely, if not, in some cases, exclusively the equity behind the system. So consequently here, we're a bit more of a third-party provider of processing and transmission services or gathering. And consequently, the net capital requirement for Anadarko is a lot less as we take what we believe is the playbook in the DJ and put it work in the Delaware. That's why you've seen us make acquisitions like we did just about 2 years ago. That's why you've seen us organically add to what we have as well as what we acquired. And that's why we've been fairly focused on these various ramps we planned to increase our production and processing capabilities. Darrell has a fairly aggressive plan for drilling upstream dollars behind these plants, and he has, I'd say, a more modest need on capital as it relates to midstream. So Darrell?"

So consequently, our ability to put more capital to work, either through cash flow or through cash on hand, we have a lot of flexibility. I'm real proud of what Bob Gwin and what our corporate development folks working with our asset teams have been able to accomplish with the monetizations we've achieved to date and things we hope to do in the future. So whether it's cash flow or the use of cash at a point in time, we have the capacity today to do things that we've talked about wanting to be in a position to do going into '17, believing that fundamentally, we should see better price support for oil. And if that's the case, I think you'll see us cycle the cash faster. You'll see us likely increase the types of things we've been talking about in the Delaware Basin first, and I think Darrell probably would stand up rigs in the Delaware ahead of DJ to some extent.

Now once we determine whether or not we have a commercial opportunity, we want go to development, then we start to figure out where it is in the queue over a time horizon for production. But the reason for a lot of the answers today about where we put incremental capital, when you've got the positions that we do onshore in the Delaware and the DJ, that provides us extremely attractive rates of return and it also gives us the type of on-site growth that we find very attractive from a standpoint of how we enhance shareholder value. Longer term, we need to continue to find ways to look for new opportunities. What we see in Colombia excites us, both in terms of what we're currently drilling as well as what we see ourselves drilling through the balance of the decade.

So it'd be pure conjecture on my part. I don't know that I even could come close to telling you whether or not I have a view on that. I know that when we executed the 10% working interest sell-down, it was a part of the playbook that we did not want that much working interest if we were to take FID. Again, I sound like a broken record this morning, but Bob Gwin did a great job selling that down to ONGC. As a result, today, we still, even with all the capital we've spent in Mozambique, if you just think of it on a project-level basis, we're still $300-plus million to the positive in terms of what we've invested there versus what we've taken in. So consequently, again on a project level basis, we've done a pretty darn good job of managing our exposure from a cash or capital perspective and still give ourselves a lot of option value around whether or not we take FID. If someone decides that they like it better than we do or they see more value than we do, we're not married to it any more than we are married to any other asset in our portfolio. But we do believe today that we have the skills, the capability, and we also believe the opportunity, if we take it to FID, for it to be a game-changer for our company. And so consequently, Mitch looks at this every day with a very balanced view of what's best for Anadarko in the next decade."

So just focusing on the Wolfcamp, yes, we would love -- as these things start to settle out in the Delaware Basin, thinking about blocking up with people and making it a little more attractive. Given the velocity of change in the basin, it makes it a little more difficult today. So I think sort of just in the evolution of the basin's development, it's unlikely we're going to see people doing what we did in the DJ with Noble, and doing something that was a win-win for both of us. But I'm sure Darrell and his folks, Brad and others, have been trying. It's just it's early in the evolution or lifecycle of the basin's development."

And that's what we've historically done, I think we'll continue to do that. We have 16 million acres offshore Colombia because we see a lot of prospectivity there and a lot of running room if we're correct. So I think, philosophically, the types of things that we will do in exploration, whether it's in the Gulf of Mexico or internationally, are fairly similar. And the Gulf of Mexico today, given the price environment that we're in, if we don't have tieback to existing infrastructure, we're not out trying to drill opportunities that require greenfield development as a result. So that may be where the 2 are a little bit different because we're dealing with a much higher cost per well. Typically, we're in a pre-salt environment with the exploration opportunities. Whereas in many cases, internationally, we're post-salt, where the cost to drill a well is substantially less. And so therefore, if we're successful, the development drilling associated with any development opportunity is a little more economically positive from the standpoint of the price environment. So I don't think, from a standpoint of Anadarko's view of exploration or my hope for what we're able to deliver on exploration, is any different today than it would have been in 2013 or '14 in a different price environment."

In terms of the well count and maybe the oil ratio, I do think you're seeing the impact of the lack of capital spend this year in Wattenberg. And so as the field continues to produce, it does go to a higher GOR. And generally, we've been able to offset as we brought in -- drill more wells and put new wells on because they're higher oil cut. So if you just think about we went 2 quarters in a row with 1 rig, so we don't have a lot of new production coming on. I will have to say that the field guys did a fantastic job hitting the records they did. Yes, a lot of it was gas, but I can tell you that the peak we hit in the third quarter after such little activity was a fantastic accomplishment on their part. But as we stand up more rigs and we bring more wells online, you're going to see that turn again, and you'll -- you should start seeing our oil production go up. It may not be by year-end or even first quarter, but I think we would anticipate next year to reverse that trend and you'll see the oil production start rising again."

We're just finishing up our program in West Africa right now, and we expect the rig will be demobilizing from that prospect over there and get to Colombia within the next month or so. We've got a 2-well program set up there. We're making strides in reducing the time to drill the wells in Colombia after our initial campaign. So the next well we'll get to, we'll actually top set the first well and go over to drill a Purple Angel well, and that's probably going to be about a 45-day well, give or take a few days. And as we carry into the new year in 2017, we'll move over and drill another prospect in a similar section there called Gorgon. So they're not long wells. We're continuing to get up the learning curve on drilling wells in Colombia, and we look forward to seeing those results. But what I would remind you of a little bit is we're really looking forward to getting over to the coal area where we shot the 30,000 square kilometers of 3D, and we've just got a fast-track volume in, looking for the final volume in by the end of next year. And our goal is really to accelerate drilling activity over in that big chunk of acreage in the ultra-deepwater offshore in Colombia. Looking for oil, of course, there. And very hopeful that we've got a thicker source rock and buried a little bit deeper, so we're anxious to get over there on that particular acreage."

I think we always thought that gas would find its way up around $3, and we'd find the ceiling there. And to a large extent, that's been correct. I mean, we see -- we've always believed around $3 that there was just an impediment from a demand standpoint for now. But I think it also is the reason a lot of people -- in January, we talked about selling our natural gas properties and people kind of looked at me cross-eyed that we would actually have a market for it. There's been a lot of very successful private equity people that have taken a view on natural gas and done quite well with it. I think for a company like ours that has the assets that we do and our access to oil and liquids that we do, consequently, it's not really in our best interest to pursue natural gas. It doesn't give us the same wellhead margin. It doesn't give us the same ability to have scalability. And the returns, coupled with the scalability, just always tilt in the favor of the DJ and the Delaware for us. John, I just have to say, I don't mind being wrong, but I think our view is that it would take natural gas to approach $6 before it would probably displace our interest investing in oil, and I don't see that happening."
