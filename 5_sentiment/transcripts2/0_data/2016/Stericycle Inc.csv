This conference call may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control, for example, general economic and market conditions. Our actual results could differ significantly from the results described in the forward-looking statements.
Factors that could cause such differences include: changes in governmental regulations of the collection, transportation, treatment and disposal of regulated waste; increases in transportation and other operating costs; the level of governmental enforcement of regulations governing regulated waste collection and treatment; our ability to execute our acquisition strategy and to integrate acquired businesses; competition and demand for services in the regulated waste industry; political, economic and currency risks related to our foreign operations; impairments of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangibles; exposure to environmental liabilities; compliance with existing and future legal and regulatory requirements; as well as other factors described in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K.
As a result, past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future results or trends. We make no commitment to disclose any subsequent revisions to forward-looking statements.

Revenues were $888.3 million, up 31.2% from $676.9 million in Q4 2014, an internal growth excluding returns and recall revenues was up 5.2%; domestic revenues were $651.1 million, of which is $626.28 million[ph] was domestic-regulated waste in compliant services and $24.3 million was recalls and returns.
fourth quarter domestic internal growth, excluding returns and recalls, revenues was up 4%, consisting of [indiscernible] up 6% and LQ, up 2%. As anticipated, growth rates were impacted by lower fuel surcharges and lower hazardous waste volumes from our industrial customers. 
International revenues were $237.2 million, an internal growth adjusted for unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $26.9 million, was up 8.1%. This growth rate was also impacted by lower hazardous waste volume. 
Acquisitions contributed $200 million to growth in the quarter. Gross profit was $380.4 million or 42.8% of revenues. 
SG&A expense, including amortization, was $203.6 million or 22.9% of revenues. Net interest expense was $24.9 million. Net income, attributable to Stericycle, was $78.9 million or $0.80 per share on an as-reported basis and $1.11 when adjusted for acquisition-related expenses and other adjustments. 
Now for the balance sheet. Our covenant debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.45 at the end of the quarter. The [indiscernible] portion of the revolver at the end of the quarter was approximately $686 million. 
In the quarter, we repurchased 240,468 shares of common stock in the open market in an amount of $28,646,000. At the end of the quarter, we have authorization to purchase 3.7 million shares. 
Our CapEx was $42.2 million, which included accelerated spending to support 2016 integration associated Shred-It.

Worldwide, we continued to use our strong free cash flow to drive our growth through acquisitions. In the quarter we closed 10 acquisitions, 6 domestic and 4 international, including Shred-it. International acquisitions were: 1 in Canada, 1 Netherlands, 1 in Mexico and 1 in Spain. Revenues from the 10 acquisitions were $176.4 million in the quarter and annualized are approximately $728 million. Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust with well over $100 million in annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business. 
In the fourth quarter, we continue to see strong growth on our pharmaceutical waste compliance program. Both our SQ and LQ adoption rates continued to increase as customers look for compliant solutions for those waste stream. This program not only helps our customer manage their pharmaceutical wastes, but it often paves the way Stericycle to manage all of their hazardous wastes. 
Our Shred-it integration efforts remain a priority across the organization. The Sintosh[ph] Shred-It synergies are on track, focusing on efficiencies and onsite to offsite conversions. The Stericycle Shred-it integration is gaining momentum and the team has kicked off a number of exciting cross-selling pilots. 
As a reminder, less than 20% of our existing Stericycle customers use Shred-it for secure information distraction. This represents a tremendous growth opportunity for Stericycle. 
To assist with the integration, we are working with the consulting firm to help us optimize our long-term organizational structure. The goal is to maximize our growth opportunities and to better serve our customers. We anticipate implementation to start later this year. 
Looking ahead, we continue to see expanding growth opportunities as Stericycle provides multiple services that help our customers improve their operations and achieve their goals. As we execute on this strategy, we can more than triple our customer revenues. 
In closing, I want to thank each member of our worldwide team for their strong performance and continued commitment to our customers, our shareholders and to our core values.

I would now like to provide insights on our current guidance for 2016. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements and our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, integration, acquisition-related and other adjusted items. As a reminder, our 2016 EPS guidance is adjusted for amortization expense. 
For 2016, we believe analyst EPS estimates will be in the range of $5.26 to $5.33, reflecting the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange and the share count of approximately $92 million, which we are comfortable with. We believe analyst revenue estimates were for 2016 will be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.67 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. 
We anticipate 2016 internal growth rates to be: SQ, 7% to 9%; LQ, 4% to 7%; international, 6% to 9%; and recall and return revenues, between $95 million to $120 million. 
We believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow in 2016 between $460 million to $480 million. 2016 CapEx is anticipated to be between $125 million to $135 million. 
We expect the 2016 full year as-reported tax rate to be in the range of 36% to 36.5%. 
In closing, we are very pleased with our fourth quarter results and remain excited about our multiple growth opportunities for 2016 and beyond.

And internal growth excluding returns and recall revenues, was up 5.2%. Domestic revenues were $651.1 million, of which $626.8 million was domestic-regulated waste in compliance services, and $24.3 million was recalls and returns.
Fourth quarter domestic internal growth, excluding returns and recalls revenues, was up 4%, consisting of SQ up 6% and LQ up 2%. As anticipated, growth rates were impacted by lower fuel surcharges and lower hazardous waste volumes from our industrial customers.
International revenues were $237.2 million, and internal growth adjusted for unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $26.9 million was up 8.1%. This growth rate was also impacted by lower hazardous waste volume. 
Acquisitions contributed $200 million to growth in the quarter. Gross profit was $380.4 million or 42.8% of revenues.
SG&A expense, including amortization, was $203.6 million or 22.9% of revenues. Net interest expense was $24.9 million. Net income attributable to Stericycle was $78.9 million or $0.80 per share on an as-reported basis and $1.11 when adjusted for acquisition-related expenses and other adjustments. 
Now for the balance sheet. Our covenant debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.45 at the end of the quarter. The unused portion of the revolver at the end of the quarter was approximately $686 million.
In the quarter, we repurchased 240,468 shares of common stock on the open market in an amount of $28,646,000. At the end of the quarter, we have authorization to purchase 3.7 million shares.
Our CapEx was $42.2 million, which included accelerated spending to support 2016 integration associated with Shred-it.
Our DSO was 64 days. Year-to-date, as-reported cash from operations was $390 million. When adjusted for recall reimbursement and other items, cash from operations was $501 million.

In the quarter, we closed 10 acquisitions: 6 domestic and 4 international, including Shred-it. International acquisitions were 1 in Canada, 1 in the Netherlands, 1 in Mexico and 1 in Spain. Revenues from the 10 acquisitions were $176.4 million in the quarter, and annualized are approximately $728 million. Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust with well over $100 million in annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business.
In the fourth quarter, we continue to see strong growth in our pharmaceutical waste compliance program. Both our SQ and LQ adoption rates continue to increase as customers look for a compliant solution for this waste stream. This program not only helps our customers manage their pharmaceutical waste, but it often paves the way for Stericycle to manage all of their hazardous waste.
Our Shred-it integration efforts remain a priority across the organization. The Cintas/Shred-It synergies are on track, focusing on routing efficiencies and on-site to off-site conversions. The Stericycle Shred-it integration is gaining momentum, and the team has kicked off a number of exciting cross-selling pilots.
As a reminder, less than 20% of our existing Stericycle customers use Shred-it for secure information destruction. This represents a tremendous growth opportunity for Stericycle.
To assist with the integration, we are working with a consulting firm to help us optimize our long-term organizational structure. The goal is to maximize our growth opportunities and to better serve our customers. We're anticipating implementation to start later this year.
Looking ahead, we continue to see expanding growth opportunities as Stericycle provides multiple services that help our customers improve their operations and achieve their goals. As we execute on this strategy, we can more than triple our customer revenues.
In closing, I want to thank each member of our worldwide team for their strong performance and continued commitment to our customers, our shareholders and to our core values.

I would now like to provide insight on our current guidance for 2016. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements and our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, integration, acquisition-related and other adjusted items. As a reminder, our 2016 EPS guidance is adjusted for amortization expense.
For 2016, we believe analyst EPS estimates will be in the range of $5.26 to $5.33, reflecting the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange and a share count of approximately 92 million, which we are comfortable with. 
We believe analyst revenue estimates for 2016 will be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.67 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates.
We anticipate 2016 internal growth rates to be: SQ, 7% to 9%; LQ, 4% to 7%; international, 6% to 9%; and recall and return revenues, between $95 million to $120 million.
We believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow in 2016 between $460 million to $480 million. 2016 CapEx is anticipated to be between $125 million to $135 million. We expect the 2016 full year as-reported tax rate to be in the range of 36% to 36.5%.

I -- where I continue to get most excited is the cross-sell opportunities. We've got multiple opportunities, everywhere you look, to cross-sell their services into our customers. I was just at the national sales meeting last week. And our LQ team, who's had a great deal of success selling additional services into hospitals, like our SMS or our Rx Waste or hazardous waste, all of them now are trained and ready to go with regard to selling that service into hospitals. And again, I am very confident we'll be successful there. We also have another -- several pilots going on with regard to their sales executives and selling into our existing Stericycle medical waste customers. What they typically do is they go in and give them a compliance review, looking at how they manage all their secure information. Oftentimes, when they do that audit, we can find compliance breaches. And that's a great way for them to switch to an outsourced service, and therefore, we're selling multiple services. So overall, I would tell you that we continue to be very encouraged. And the things that we thought going into this are turning out true. And again, we think this will be a great long-term acquisition for us."

And internal growth excluding returns and recall revenues, was up 5.2%. Domestic revenues were $651.1 million, of which $626.8 million was domestic-regulated waste in compliance services, and $24.3 million was recalls and returns.
Fourth quarter domestic internal growth, excluding returns and recalls, revenues was up 4%, consisting of SQ up 6% and LQ up 2%. As anticipated, growth rates were impacted by lower fuel surcharges and lower hazardous waste volumes from our industrial customers.
International revenues were $237.2 million, and internal growth adjusted for unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $26.9 million was up 8.1%. This growth rate was also impacted by lower hazardous waste volume. 
Acquisitions contributed $200 million to growth in the quarter. Gross profit was $380.4 million or 42.8% of revenues.
SG&A expense, including amortization, was $203.6 million or 22.9% of revenues. Net interest expense was $24.9 million. Net income attributable to Stericycle was $78.9 million or $0.80 per share on an as-reported basis and $1.11 when adjusted for acquisition-related expenses and other adjustments. 
Now for the balance sheet. Our covenant debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.45 at the end of the quarter. The unused portion of the revolver at the end of the quarter was approximately $686 million.
In the quarter, we repurchased 240,468 shares of common stock on the open market in an amount of $28,646,000. At the end of the quarter, we have authorization to purchase 3.7 million shares.
Our CapEx was $42.2 million, which included accelerated spending to support 2016 integration associated with Shred-it.

In the quarter, we closed 10 acquisitions: 6 domestic and 4 international, including Shred-it. International acquisitions were 1 in Canada, 1 in the Netherlands, 1 in Mexico and 1 in Spain. Revenues from the 10 acquisitions were $176.4 million in the quarter, and annualized are approximately $728 million. Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust with well over $100 million in annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business.
In the fourth quarter, we continue to see strong growth in our pharmaceutical waste compliance program. Both our SQ and LQ adoption rates continue to increase as customers look for a compliant solution for this waste stream. This program not only helps our customers manage their pharmaceutical waste, but it often paves the way for Stericycle to manage all of their hazardous waste.
Our Shred-it integration efforts remain a priority across the organization. The Cintas/Shred-It synergies are on track, focusing on routing efficiencies and on-site to off-site conversions. The Stericycle Shred-it integration is gaining momentum, and the team has kicked off a number of exciting cross-selling pilots.
As a reminder, less than 20% of our existing Stericycle customers use Shred-it for secure information destruction. This represents a tremendous growth opportunity for Stericycle.
To assist with the integration, we are working with a consulting firm to help us optimize our long-term organizational structure. The goal is to maximize our growth opportunities and to better serve our customers. We're anticipating implementation to start later this year.
Looking ahead, we continue to see expanding growth opportunities as Stericycle provides multiple services that help our customers improve their operations and achieve their goals. As we execute on this strategy, we can more than triple our customer revenues.

I would now like to provide insight on our current guidance for 2016. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements and our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, integration, acquisition-related and other adjusted items. As a reminder, our 2016 EPS guidance is adjusted for amortization expense.
For 2016, we believe analyst EPS estimates will be in the range of $5.26 to $5.33, reflecting the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange and a share count of approximately 92 million, which we are comfortable with. 
We believe analyst revenue estimates for 2016 will be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.67 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates.
We anticipate 2016 internal growth rates to be: SQ, 7% to 9%; LQ, 4% to 7%; international, 6% to 9%; and recall and return revenues, between $95 million to $120 million.
We believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow in 2016 between $460 million to $480 million. 2016 CapEx is anticipated to be between $125 million to $135 million. We expect the 2016 full year as-reported tax rate to be in the range of 36% to 36.5%.

The other part of the business I think you're talking to is that other part of the project in industrial waste work that's not affected by commodity. And that performed as expected, of course. We didn't see any pullback in that part of the business. I think Brent talked about it in his comments, Rx waste specifically which -- that is hazardous waste. A good portion of that's hazardous waste upon disposal. The team had a really good quarter in Q4. And again, to remind everybody, our focus in hazardous waste is on health care hazardous waste. It's on retail hazardous waste and SQ hazardous waste. And those parts of the business are doing well."

What they typically do is they go in and give them a compliance review, looking at how they manage all their secure information. Oftentimes, when they do that audit, we can find compliance breaches. And that's a great way for them to switch to an outsourced service, and therefore, we're selling multiple services. So overall, I would tell you that we continue to be very encouraged.

And internal growth excluding returns and recall revenues, was up 5.2%. Domestic revenues were $651.1 million, of which $626.8 million was domestic-regulated waste in compliance services, and $24.3 million was recalls and returns.
Fourth quarter domestic internal growth, excluding returns and recalls, revenues was up 4%, consisting of SQ up 6% and LQ up 2%. As anticipated, growth rates were impacted by lower fuel surcharges and lower hazardous waste volumes from our industrial customers.
International revenues were $237.2 million, and internal growth adjusted for unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $26.9 million was up 8.1%. This growth rate was also impacted by lower hazardous waste volume. 
Acquisitions contributed $200 million to growth in the quarter. Gross profit was $380.4 million or 42.8% of revenues.
SG&A expense, including amortization, was $203.6 million or 22.9% of revenues. Net interest expense was $24.9 million. Net income attributable to Stericycle was $78.9 million or $0.80 per share on an as-reported basis and $1.11 when adjusted for acquisition-related expenses and other adjustments. 
Now for the balance sheet. Our covenant debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.45 at the end of the quarter. The unused portion of the revolver at the end of the quarter was approximately $686 million.
In the quarter, we repurchased 240,468 shares of common stock on the open market in an amount of $28,646,000. At the end of the quarter, we have authorization to purchase 3.7 million shares.
Our CapEx was $42.2 million, which included accelerated spending to support 2016 integration associated with Shred-it.

In the quarter, we closed 10 acquisitions: 6 domestic and 4 international, including Shred-it. International acquisitions were 1 in Canada, 1 in the Netherlands, 1 in Mexico and 1 in Spain. Revenues from the 10 acquisitions were $176.4 million in the quarter, and annualized are approximately $728 million. Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust with well over $100 million in annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business.
In the fourth quarter, we continue to see strong growth in our pharmaceutical waste compliance program. Both our SQ and LQ adoption rates continue to increase as customers look for a compliant solution for this waste stream. This program not only helps our customers manage their pharmaceutical waste, but it often paves the way for Stericycle to manage all of their hazardous waste.
Our Shred-it integration efforts remain a priority across the organization. The Cintas/Shred-It synergies are on track, focusing on routing efficiencies and on-site to off-site conversions. The Stericycle Shred-it integration is gaining momentum, and the team has kicked off a number of exciting cross-selling pilots.
As a reminder, less than 20% of our existing Stericycle customers use Shred-it for secure information destruction. This represents a tremendous growth opportunity for Stericycle.
To assist with the integration, we are working with a consulting firm to help us optimize our long-term organizational structure. The goal is to maximize our growth opportunities and to better serve our customers. We're anticipating implementation to start later this year.
Looking ahead, we continue to see expanding growth opportunities as Stericycle provides multiple services that help our customers improve their operations and achieve their goals. As we execute on this strategy, we can more than triple our customer revenues.

Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements and our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, integration, acquisition-related and other adjusted items. As a reminder, our 2016 EPS guidance is adjusted for amortization expense.
For 2016, we believe analyst EPS estimates will be in the range of $5.26 to $5.33, reflecting the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange and a share count of approximately 92 million, which we are comfortable with. 
We believe analyst revenue estimates for 2016 will be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.67 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates.
We anticipate 2016 internal growth rates to be: SQ, 7% to 9%; LQ, 4% to 7%; international, 6% to 9%; and recall and return revenues, between $95 million to $120 million.
We believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow in 2016 between $460 million to $480 million. 2016 CapEx is anticipated to be between $125 million to $135 million. We expect the 2016 full year as-reported tax rate to be in the range of 36% to 36.5%.

We had $0.03 of nonrecurring EPS that won't repeat itself. So that really brings the jump-off point to about $1.01. We have been -- I'm sorry, $1.21. And then we have about $0.03 of normal seasonality that we would expect in Q1 and additional $0.01 of headwind to tax. So I think you're best to jump off the year at about $1.17 and then ramp up throughout the course of the year, probably evenly dispersing it from there on."

What they typically do is they go in and give them a compliance review, looking at how they manage all their secure information. Oftentimes, when they do that audit, we can find compliance breaches. And that's a great way for them to switch to an outsourced service, and therefore, we're selling multiple services. So overall, I would tell you that we continue to be very encouraged.

[Audio Gap]
First quarter domestic internal growth, excluding recalls and returns revenues was up 5%, consisting of SQ up 6%, and LQ up 4%. As anticipated, growth rates were impacted by lower fuel surcharges and lower hazardous waste volumes from our industrial customers. International revenues were $224.5 million, and internal growth adjusted for unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $23.8 million was up 7%. 
This growth rate was also impacted by lower hazardous waste volume. Acquisitions contributed $194.5 million to growth in the quarter. Gross profit was $369.2 million or 42.2% of revenues. 
SG&A expense, including amortization was $207.3 million or 23.7% of revenues. 
Net interest expense was $24 million. Net income attributable to Stericycle was $66.7 million or $0.78 per share on an as reported basis, and $1.11 when adjusted for acquisition-related expenses and other adjustments. 
Our covenants, debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.41 at the end of the quarter. The unused portion of the revolver at the end of the quarter was approximately $584 million. In the quarter, we repurchased 327,952 shares of common stock on the open market in an amount of $37,693,000. At the end of the quarter, we have authorization to purchase 3.4 million shares.
Our CapEx was $34.2 million or 3.9% of revenues. Our DSO was 63 days. Year-to-date, cash from operations was $156.9 million, when adjusted for recall reimbursement and other items, cash from operations was $163.6 million. I will now turn it over to Brent."

In the quarter, we closed 7 acquisitions, 5 domestic and 2 international. International acquisitions were 1 in Spain, and 1 in Romania. Revenues in the 7 acquisitions were approximately $1 million in the quarter, and annualized are approximately $12.4 million. Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust with well over $100 billion annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business. 
In the quarter, the Shred-it sales team deliver strong new sales growth. As a reminder, Shred-it has over 350 sales professionals across North America focused on converting customers that either do not shred or shred themselves. This unwinded market represents at $2.5 billion growth opportunity for Stericycle. 
We also encouraged by the progress the combined sales teams are having and selling Shred-it solution. This quarter, the team closed 8 health systems in multiple national accounts. Today, less than 20% of our current Stericycle healthcare customers use Shred-it is a secure information instruction provider, representing a nice growth opportunity for Stericycle. 
Our Shred-it integration efforts remain a priority across the organization. We are confident in our ability to achieve the full $73 million in Cintas Shred-it synergies, and our team has either completed or made solid progress on many of the integration projects. 
However, we have reassessed the original time line associated with the rebound and on-site to on-site conversion. While several regions have successfully made this conversion, the time to convert each region is taking longer than previously anticipated. 
In order to ensure high service levels and support ongoing new customer growth, we have decided to extend the rollout schedule going forward. 
The new timeline enables the rebound teams to provide the necessary support and assistance without negatively impacting our customers. 
Based on these changes, approximately $20 million of $1 of the anticipated rebound and on-site to off-site synergies will be extended into 2017, with a full impact in 2018. 
And our retail and healthcare has this waste compliance program, we continue to experience strong growth. The growth is fueled by increase in enforcement of existing regulation and by Stericycle strong customer relationships in both retail and the healthcare industry. 
Looking ahead, we continue to see expanding growth opportunities. Stericycle provides multiple services that help our customers improve their operations and achieve their goal. 
As we execute on the strategy, we can more than triple our customers revenue. 
We would like to congratulate Stericycle's partners for West Virginia facility for receiving congressional recognition as a star status site in Osho's voluntary protection program. This was the first medical waste facility to earn the VPP award, and it demonstrates the team's dedication to our corporate values.

I would now like to provide insight on our current guidance for 2016. 
Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements and our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, integration, acquisition-related expenses and other adjusted items. As a reminder, our 2016 EPS guidance is adjusted for amortization expense.
For 2016, we believe analyst EPS estimates will be in the range of $4.90 to $5.05, reflecting the unfavorable impact of the timing of the Shred-it synergies, software industrial hazardous waste volume, and higher costs associated with our international operations. 
We believe analyst revenue estimates for 2016 will be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.66 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and the impact of foreign exchange rates. 
We anticipate 2016 internal growth rates to be: SQ, 7% to 9%; LQ 4% to 7%; international, 6% to 9%; and recall and returns revenues between $95 million and $115 million. 
We believe analyst will estimates for free cash flow in 2016 between $435 million and $455 million. 
2016 CapEx is anticipated to be between $125 million to $135 million. We expect the 2016 full year as reported tax rate to be approximately 35.5%.

The delay as -- Brent mentioned in his dialogue in recognition of Shred-it synergy is anywhere between $0.07 to $0.12 unfavorable.

All of us either want to get these synergies as soon as possible. We just need to make sure, we do it in a time frame that does not negatively impact our customers. It probably make sense to give a little bit of description of what we're talking about, and what really goes into and on-site to off-site conversions. First, with all of the conversions of this type, you have to have clean data, you need to know things like, service location, number of counsels, hours of operation, key contact information. Let me remind you that the team recently went through a merger of operating systems, when Cintas joins Shred-it. And while that went well, they're definitely some items that still need to be cleaned up as part of that data cleanup. 
Then you notify the customers, so you're notifying all the customers that are currently on-site, and you're lying to know that we're going to be searching their service from on-site shredding with a truck that has shredder on it. To taking that back to our facility and shredding it back at our facility. So you have to make sure you have all the supplies right, because you're switching trucks, you have to have the right number of box trucks with gates, consuls, the transport, the materials, so all of those things needed to be in place, 
Ultimately though, and this is really where we're noticing the biggest challenge is when you make the change, our team members now are going to new sites. So imagine, Ryan, if a CSR is coming to your facility, the number of consuls you have across William Blair, and they're not serviced it before, you now are, while they have a description of location in their handheld, you still need to find those, you needed to find your the best way to kind of wrap through your office to find all those consuls. So there is a learning curve that our CSRs or drivers need to go through, when we make this changes of the ground. Believe it or not, the first probably several weeks after re-route, we're actually less efficient than we were before the re-route. But as they go to their learning cover and that settles down, we start to get efficiencies, and we ultimately, we'll do a final kind of polishing re-route to really put as many stops on those routes as possible. 
So again, our focus here is about how do we do this without impacting the customer, recognizing the synergies and ultimately doing it in the way that allows us to continue to close new business. 
The reason we're confident that we're going to get that $73 million, we've done this many times before, our pilot market in Toronto, in Cleveland, in Charlotte, in Boston, in Detroit is the number of markets, where we have successfully done this, but what we've decided to do is you know what, this needs to be more of a 16 week process than an 8 with process in the time line we're just too aggressive. So when assessing that, we decided to extended out ultimately, because we do not want to disrupt the service with our customers."

So roughly speaking about $5.5 million soft on our industrial or hazardous waste volumes. In addition, the mix of the waste that we bid actually pick up in our projects resulting in a higher anticipated disposal expense of roughly about $1.5 million, and that has to do with some of the larger projects we did, where direct disposal and we have direct disposal as opposed going through our facilities we do incur higher disposal expense for those accounts, and that's what Dan was referring to when he's talking about mix in the environmental solutions business or hazardous waste business. 
So certainly, we did see a lower hazardous waste volume. The good news I think though, and Brent talked about in his opening is, where we're focused, that's the healthcare hazardous waste, that's the retail hazardous waste, that's the SQ hazardous waste. We had really strong growth there, but unfortunately, we have a mix issue when it comes to the facilities that we've acquired to support this growth. And that has a very high fixed cost to it and that's what you see hurting us not only on the revenue line, but also on the profit line."

The pressure points, and we feel be the pressure points for the rest of the year are in 2 distinct lines. It's first of all, guts of view with our patient transport business in the U.K., and one of our biggest contributors to our international cost pressures because it has rapidly grown over the last several years. We then did experience, an increase and a cost to operates certain contracts. And as a result, that has had their pressure on the overall international margins. Most of that work was previously performed by the hospital and as a result, there was difficult to get historical data prior to bidding. And what we're doing about that, how we're going to try on team is working diligently working on the cost overall, working on contract by contract basis, see if this cause some of them pastor our customers and be made some of those agreements. So that's certainly, something that's been, at the headwind in Q1, we think it will be a headwind for the rest of the year. And the other issue we're facing is in Latin America, obviously, the economic pressures and Latin America especially Brazil are impacting our business, the economic pressure most things in pricing pressure on government accounts. Just in Brazil alone 50% of our medical waste volumes are tied to government contract, when you think about Latin America, kind of for us, we had increased cost, we talked about that last year. Usually, in Latin America, we can pass those cost along, but now we're experiencing some headwinds with respect to government accounts and being able to pass along those prices. So we'll continue to work on that certainly, the team is working on all fronts to improve margins over a longer period of time. Acquisitions, we looked at certain markets, and we'll take a cautious stand in acquisitions, it's a good and that can acquisition that has a good return in our core business, certainly, willing to complete that.

And tell you in the by taking a step back and telling you why we're got into, what the strategy is for the long run.

And why do we think Stericycle they were Broad-based business, they were SQ type volume, they came in complex or greater issues for the generator are the customer. And we are established relationship and a lot of those markets. So we looked at it, we said that he tell hazardous waste businesses at approximately $1 billion and we still think that today. And the healthcare hazardous waste market, we identified at least $1 billion market. And we quickly become the market leader and is growing segments of, but unfortunately, as we spoke about before, we needed to add our operational infrastructure to support our growth. So we acquired PSC, we acquired other acquisitions to give us that additional facilities in order to meet the demand of the growing business. Unfortunately, these acquisitions came with other hazardous waste streams, industrial waste, other hazardous waste, projects and obviously, we're frustrated that it is based revenue is shrinking and most of this is really outside of our control and it's more market driven. We also have to look at bargain do better on the cost escalations on that business to make it better. We need it infrastructure, which came with some things that you didn't want to focus on, where we are focusing, we're seeing a really great growth and healthcare and retail, we continue to look at that focus for the business and we think overtime that will become a bigger part and that will minimize the impact of this industrial and project work. And I think about why do we still think it's a good business, I mean, I'm sure question of should you guys be focused on this, and you think about the recent enforcement action, recently Comcast announced a $26 million settlement in this state of California. It was related to 2 things. Was related to the improper disposal of hazardous waste and the disposal of that care information. So obviously, enforcement continues to build a witness, I think this is a great example, of how do we have debated to cross-sell a wide variety of combines related services although in the customer base that we have over 1 customer.

Domestic revenues were $649.7 million of which $624.9 million was domestic regulated waste in compliance services and $24.8 million was recalls and returns.
First quarter domestic internal growth, excluding recalls and returns revenues was up 5%, consisting of SQ up 6%, and LQ up 4%. As anticipated, growth rates were impacted by lower fuel surcharges and lower hazardous waste volumes from our industrial customers. International revenues were $224.5 million, and internal growth adjusted for unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $23.8 million was up 7%.
This growth rate was also impacted by lower hazardous waste volume. Acquisitions contributed to $194.5 million to growth in the quarter. Gross profit was $369.2 million or 42.2% of revenues. 
SG&A expense, including amortization was $207.3 million or 23.7% of revenues.

Revenues in the 7 acquisitions were approximately $1 million in the quarter, and annualized are approximately $12.4 million. Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust with well over $100 million [ph] annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business.
In the quarter, the Shred-it sales team delivered strong new sales growth. As a reminder, Shred-it has over 350 sales professionals across North America focused on converting customers that either do not shred or shred themselves. This unvended market represents at $2.5 billion growth opportunity for Stericycle.
We also are encouraged by the progress the combined sales teams are having and selling Shred-it solution. This quarter, the team closed 8 health systems in multiple national accounts. Today, less than 20% of our current Stericycle health care customers use Shred-it as a secure information instruction provider, representing a nice growth opportunity for Stericycle.
Our Shred-it integration efforts remain a priority across the organization. We are confident in our ability to achieve the full $73 million in Cintas/Shred-it synergies, and our team has either completed or made solid progress on many of the integration projects. 
However, we have reassessed the original time line associated with the re-routes and on-site to on-site conversion. While several regions have successfully made this conversion, the time to convert each region is taking longer than previously anticipated.
In order to ensure high service levels and support ongoing new customer growth, we have decided to extend the rollout schedule going forward.
The new time line enables the re-route teams to provide the necessary support and assistance without negatively impacting our customers. 
Based on these changes, approximately $20 million of dollars of the anticipated re-route and on-site to off-site synergies will be extended into 2017, with a full impact in 2018.
And our retail and healthcare hazardous waste compliance program, we continue to experience strong growth. The growth is fueled by increase in enforcement of existing regulation and by Stericycle strong customer relationships in both retail and the healthcare industry. 
Looking ahead, we continue to see expanding growth opportunities, as Stericycle provides multiple services that help our customers improve their operations and achieve their goal. 8
As we execute on the strategy, we can more than triple our customer's revenues.
We would like to congratulate Stericycle's partners for West Virginia facility for receiving congressional recognition as a star status site in Osho's voluntary protection program. This was the first medical waste facility to earn the VPP award, and it demonstrates the team's dedication to our corporate values.

Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements and our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, integration, acquisition-related expenses and other adjusted items. As a reminder, our 2016 EPS guidance is adjusted for amortization expense.
For 2016, we believe analyst EPS estimates will be in the range of $4.90 to $5.05, reflecting the unfavorable impact of the timing of the Shred-it synergies, software industrial hazardous waste volume and higher costs associated with our international operations.
We believe analyst revenue estimates for 2016 will be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.66 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and the impact of foreign exchange rates. 
We anticipate 2016 internal growth rates to be: SQ, 7% to 9%; LQ 4% to 7%; International, 6% to 9%; and recall and returns revenues between $95 million and $115 million.
We believe analyst who have estimates for free cash flow in 2016 between $435 million and $455 million.

There were some strength in paper prices and slightly lower interest rates, and we had some acquisition contribution, and that was offset by some higher depreciation expense, and that is to about $0.01 to $0.02 of favorable expense -- favorable EPS. The delay as -- Brent mentioned in his dialogue in recognition of Shred-it synergy is anywhere between $0.07 to $0.12 unfavorable. International, cost pressures in Latin America and the U.K. is between $0.07 to $0.10 unfavorable. And we had some softness in the industrial market and a mix of customers in [indiscernible] business, that will be anywhere from $0.10 to $0.11 on the year unfavorable. So the new guidance from there will bridge to $4.90 to $5.05. And I think when you're looking at Q2, I think it's best to pick a range between $1.16 and $1.20, and I think you'd be in good position for the quarter."

All of us either want to get these synergies as soon as possible. We just need to make sure we do it in a time frame that does not negatively impact our customers. It probably makes sense to give a little bit of description of what we're talking about, and what really goes into and on-site to off-site conversion. First, with all of the conversions of this type, you have to have clean data, you need to know things like service location, number of consoles, hours of operation, key contact information. Let me remind you that the team recently went through a merger of operating systems, when Cintas joined Shred-it. And while that went well, they're definitely some items that still need to be cleaned up as part of that data cleanup. Then you notify the customers. So you're notifying all the customers that are currently on-site, and you're letting to know that we're going to be switching their service from on-site shredding with a truck that has a shredder on it. To taking that back to our facility and shredding it back at our facility. So you have to make sure you have all the right supplies, right, because you're switching trucks. So you have to have the right number of box trucks, liftgates, consoles, the transport, the materials. So all of those things needed to be in place. Ultimately though -- and this is really where we're noticing the biggest challenge is when you make the change, our team members now are going to new sites. So imagine, Ryan, if a CSR is coming to your facility, the number of consoles you have across William Blair, they're not serviced it before, you now are -- while they have a description of location in the handheld, you still need to find those. We needed to find you the best way to kind of wrap through your office to find all those consoles. So there is a learning curve that our CSRs or drivers need to go through, when we make these changes around. Believe it or not, the first probably several weeks after re-route, we're actually less efficient than we were before the re-route. But as they go to their learning cover and that settles down, we start to get efficiencies, and we ultimately, we'll do a final kind of polishing re-route to really put as many stops on those routes as possible. So again, our focus here is about how do we do this without impacting the customer, recognizing the synergies and ultimately doing it in the way that allows us to continue to close new business. The reason we're confident that we're going to get that $73 million, we've done this many times before. Our pilot market in Toronto, in Cleveland, in Charlotte, in Boston, in Detroit is the number of markets where we have successfully done this, but what we've decided to do is, you know what, this needs to be more of a 16-week process than an 8-week process, and the time line, we're just too aggressive. So when assessing that, we decided to extended out ultimately, because we do not want to disrupt the service with our customers."

It actually came in at a negative 4% for the quarter. So roughly speaking about $5.5 million soft on our industrial or hazardous waste volumes. In addition, the mix of the waste that we bid actually pick up in our project resulting in a higher-anticipated disposal expense of roughly about $1.5 million, and that has to do with some of the larger projects we did where direct disposal and we have direct disposal as opposed going through our facilities we do incur a higher disposal expense for those accounts, and that's what Dan was referring to when he was talking about mix in the environmental solutions business or hazardous waste business. So certainly, we did see a lower hazardous waste volume. The good news I think though, and Brent talked about in his opening is, where we are focused, that's the healthcare hazardous waste, that's the retail hazardous waste, that's the SQ hazardous waste. We had really strong growth there, but unfortunately, we have a mix issue when it comes to the facilities that we've acquired to support this growth. And that has a very high fixed cost to it and that's what you see hurting us not only on the revenue line but also on the profit line."

But the pressure points -- and we feel will be the pressure points for the rest of the year are in 2 distinct lines. It's first of all, that's the view with our patient transport business in the U.K., and obviously, that's been one of our biggest contributors to our international cost pressures because it has rapidly grown over the last several years. We continued to experience an increase in the cost to operate certain contracts. And as a result, that has had a pressure on the overall international margins. Just educating, most of that work was previously performed by the hospital, and as a result, there was difficult to get historical data prior to bidding. And what we're doing about that, how we're going to try to work on that. Well, the team is working diligently. They are working on these cost overrides. They are working on a contract-by-contract basis, to see if these costs some of them to be passed to our customers and we made [indiscernible] exiting some of those agreements. So that's certainly is something that's been a headwind in Q1. We think it will be a headwind for the rest of the year. The other issue we're facing is in Latin America, obviously, the economic pressures in Latin America, especially in Brazil, are impacting our business. The economic pressures are mostly in the form of now pricing pressure on government accounts. Just in Brazil alone 58% of our medical waste volumes are tied to government contracts. When you think about Latin America, kind of, a perfect storm for us. We had increased cost, we talked about that last year. Usually, in Latin America, we can pass those costs along, but now we're experiencing some headwinds with respect to government accounts and being able to pass along those prices. So we'll continue to work on that certainly. The team is working on all fronts to improve margins over a longer period of time. Acquisitions, we looked at certain markets, and we'll take a cautious stand on acquisitions. If it's a good tuck-in acquisition that has a good return in our core business, certainly, we'll look to complete that. To add, we're not looking to add any new services though at this point until we can get the base business stabilized in some of the international countries."

I think this is a good time may be to take out a step back and think about that business. And tell you -- and really -- by taking a step back and telling you why we got into, what the strategy is for the long run. If you think about it 6 years ago, we identified 2 significant growth opportunities, retail and healthcare hazardous waste. And why do we think they were good for Stericycle, they were a route-based business, they were SQ type volumes, they came with complex regulatory issues for the generator of the waste or the customer. And we had established relationship in a lot of those markets. So we looked at it, we said that retail hazardous waste businesses was approximately $1 billion, and we still think that today. And the health care SQ has waste market, we identified it's at least $1 billion market. And we quickly become the market leader in these growing segments. But unfortunately, as we spoke about before, we needed to add our operational infrastructure to support our growth. So know we acquired PSC, we acquired other acquisitions to give us that additional facilities in order to meet the demand of the growing business. Unfortunately, these acquisitions came with other hazardous waste streams as industrial waste, other hazardous waste, project work. And obviously, we're frustrated that this base revenue is shrinking and most of this is really outside of our control and it's more market driven. But we also have to look at what can we do better on the cost escalations on that business to make it better. But we needed the infrastructure, it came with some things that we didn't want to focus on, where we are focusing, we're seeing really great growth and the health care has and retail has. So we continue to look at that as a focus for the business, and we think overtime that will become a bigger part and that will minimize the impact of this industrial and project work. And I think about why do we still think it's a good business, I mean, that's I'm sure question of should you guys be focused on this or not. And you think about recent enforcement action, recently Comcast announced a $26 million settlement in this state of California. It was related to 2 things. It was related to the improper disposal of hazardous waste and the disposal of secured information. So obviously, enforcement continues to build a awareness, and I think this is a great example of how we have the ability to cross-sell a wide variety of compliance-related services over the customer base that we have or over one customer. So that's really our strategy and continues to be our strategy, is to focus on retail, health care and SQ hazardous waste."

And by definition those rural routes are not dense, they're not dense with secured information, they'll not dense for regulated medical waste. So one of the reasons we are taking our time on the study, one of the reasons we're taking time not to disrupt customers as we know there will be opportunities over the next 2, 3, 4 years to improve both the operations of our Stericycle business, and the Shred-it business. There will be things like we have a tech inside the hospital, collecting sharps containers. Our plan long-term is to make sure, if we have a hospital account to secure information destruction that tech, while they are there, will collect all the secured information bin. So will turn an account that used to take a secure information driver a long time because they [indiscernible] park their truck walk throughout the hospital, like all these bins. We will have a waiting for that driver and it'll be just another stopper they're picking up on that way.

Domestic revenues were $649.7 million of which $624.9 million was domestic regulated waste in compliance services and $24.8 million was recalls and returns.
First quarter domestic internal growth, excluding recalls and returns revenues was up 5%, consisting of SQ up 6%, and LQ up 4%. As anticipated, growth rates were impacted by lower fuel surcharges and lower hazardous waste volumes from our industrial customers. International revenues were $224.5 million, and internal growth adjusted for unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $23.8 million was up 7%.
This growth rate was also impacted by lower hazardous waste volume. Acquisitions contributed to $194.5 million to growth in the quarter. Gross profit was $369.2 million or 42.2% of revenues. 
SG&A expense, including amortization was $207.3 million or 23.7% of revenues.

In the quarter, we closed 7 acquisitions, 5 domestic and 2 international. International acquisitions were 1 in Spain, and 1 in Romania. Revenues in the 7 acquisitions were approximately $1 million in the quarter, and annualized are approximately $12.4 million. Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust with well over $100 million annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business.
In the quarter, the Shred-it sales team delivered strong new sales growth. As a reminder, Shred-it has over 350 sales professionals across North America focused on converting customers that either do not shred or shred themselves. This unvended market represents at $2.5 billion growth opportunity for Stericycle.
We also are encouraged by the progress the combined sales teams are having and selling Shred-it solution. This quarter, the team closed 8 health systems in multiple national accounts. Today, less than 20% of our current Stericycle health care customers use Shred-it as a secure information destruction provider, representing a nice growth opportunity for Stericycle.
Our Shred-it integration efforts remain a priority across the organization. We are confident in our ability to achieve the full $73 million in Cintas/Shred-it synergies, and our team has either completed or made solid progress on many of the integration projects. 
However, we have reassessed the original time line associated with the re-routes and on-site to on-site conversion. While several regions have successfully made this conversion, the time to convert each region is taking longer than previously anticipated.
In order to ensure high service levels and support ongoing new customer growth, we have decided to extend the rollout schedule going forward.
The new time line enables the re-route teams to provide the necessary support and assistance without negatively impacting our customers. 
Based on these changes, approximately $20 million of dollars of the anticipated re-route and on-site to off-site synergies will be extended into 2017, with a full impact in 2018.
And our retail and healthcare hazardous waste compliance program, we continue to experience strong growth. The growth is fueled by increase in enforcement of existing regulation and by Stericycle strong customer relationships in both retail and the healthcare industry. 
Looking ahead, we continue to see expanding growth opportunities, as Stericycle provides multiple services that help our customers improve their operations and achieve their goal. 
As we execute on the strategy, we can more than triple our customer's revenues.
We would like to congratulate Stericycle's partners for West Virginia facility for receiving congressional recognition as a star status site in Osho's voluntary protection program. This was the first medical waste facility to earn the VPP award, and it demonstrates the team's dedication to our corporate values.

Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements and our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, integration, acquisition-related expenses and other adjusted items. As a reminder, our 2016 EPS guidance is adjusted for amortization expense.
For 2016, we believe analyst EPS estimates will be in the range of $4.90 to $5.05, reflecting the unfavorable impact of the timing of the Shred-it synergies, software industrial hazardous waste volume and higher costs associated with our international operations.
We believe analyst revenue estimates for 2016 will be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.66 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and the impact of foreign exchange rates. 
We anticipate 2016 internal growth rates to be: SQ, 7% to 9%; LQ 4% to 7%; International, 6% to 9%; and recall and returns revenues between $95 million and $115 million.
We believe analyst who have estimates for free cash flow in 2016 between $435 million and $455 million.
2016 CapEx is anticipated to be between $125 million to $135 million. We expect the 2016 full year as reported tax rate to be approximately 35.5%.

All of us either want to get these synergies as soon as possible. We just need to make sure we do it in a time frame that does not negatively impact our customers. It probably makes sense to give a little bit of description of what we're talking about, and what really goes into and on-site to off-site conversion. First, with all of the conversions of this type, you have to have clean data, you need to know things like service location, number of consoles, hours of operation, key contact information. Let me remind you that the team recently went through a merger of operating systems, when Cintas joined Shred-it. And while that went well, they're definitely some items that still need to be cleaned up as part of that data cleanup. Then you notify the customers. So you're notifying all the customers that are currently on-site, and you're letting to know that we're going to be switching their service from on-site shredding with a truck that has a shredder on it. To taking that back to our facility and shredding it back at our facility. So you have to make sure you have all the right supplies, right, because you're switching trucks. So you have to have the right number of box trucks, liftgates, consoles, to transport the materials. So all of those things needed to be in place. Ultimately though -- and this is really where we're noticing the biggest challenge is when you make the change, our team members now are going to new sites. So imagine, Ryan, if a CSR is coming to your facility, the number of consoles you have across William Blair, they've not serviced it before, you now are -- while they have a description of location in the handheld, you still need to find those. We needed to find you the best way to kind of route through your office to find all those consoles. So there is a learning curve that our CSRs or drivers need to go through, when we make these changes around. Believe it or not, the first probably several weeks after a re-route, we're actually less efficient than we were before the re-route. But as they go to their learning cover and that settles down, we start to get efficiencies, and we ultimately, we'll do a final kind of polishing re-route to really put as many stops on those routes as possible. So again, our focus here is about how do we do this without impacting the customer, recognizing the synergies and ultimately doing it in the way that allows us to continue to close new business. The reason we're confident that we're going to get that $73 million, we've done this many times before. Our pilot market in Toronto, in Cleveland, in Charlotte, in Boston, in Detroit is the number of markets where we have successfully done this, but what we've decided to do is, you know what, this needs to be more of a 16-week process than an 8-week process, and the time line, was just too aggressive. So when assessing that, we decided to extended out ultimately, because we do not want to disrupt the service with our customers."

I think when you think about how is this waste with Stericycle roughly 80% is domestic, 20% is international, but if we dig down to the Q1 impact on what we call our environmental solutions business, hazardous waste volumes that is excluding retail hazard waste and healthcare hazard waste, we're anticipating that to grow at seasonally -- seasonably adjusted rate of about 3%. It actually came in at a negative 4% for the quarter. So roughly speaking about $5.5 million soft on our industrial or hazardous waste volumes. In addition, the mix of the waste that we did actually pick up in our project resulting in a higher-anticipated disposal expense of roughly about $1.5 million, and that has to do with some of the larger projects we did where direct disposal and we have direct disposal as opposed going through our facilities we do incur a higher disposal expense for those accounts, and that's what Dan was referring to when he was talking about mix in the environmental solutions business or hazardous waste business. So certainly, we did see a lower hazardous waste volume. The good news I think though, and Brent talked about in his opening is, where we are focused, that's the healthcare hazardous waste, that's the retail hazardous waste, that's the SQ hazardous waste. We had really strong growth there, but unfortunately, we have a mix issue when it comes to the facilities that we've acquired to support this growth. And that has a very high fixed cost to it and that's what you see hurting us not only on the revenue line but also on the profit line."

I want to walk you through what are some of the pressures that we're facing currently Gary, and then walking out I'll take a stab at your question around long term what I think we can do there. But the pressure points -- and we feel will be the pressure points for the rest of the year are in 2 distinct lines. It's first of all, that's the view with our patient transport business in the U.K., and obviously, that's been one of our biggest contributors to our international cost pressures because it has rapidly grown over the last several years. We continued to experience an increase in the cost to operate certain contracts. And as a result, that has had a pressure on the overall international margins. Just to educate everybody, most of that work was previously performed by the hospital, and as a result, it was difficult to get historical data prior to bidding. And what we're doing about that, how we're going to try to work on that? Well, the team is working diligently. They are working on these cost overrides. They are working on a contract-by-contract basis, to see if these costs some of them to be passed to our customers and we may look at exiting some of those agreements. So that's certainly is something that's been a headwind in Q1. We think it will be a headwind for the rest of the year. The other issue we're facing is in Latin America, obviously, the economic pressures in Latin America, especially in Brazil, are impacting our business. The economic pressures are mostly in the form of now pricing pressure on government accounts. Just in Brazil alone 58% of our medical waste volumes are tied to government contracts. When you think about Latin America, kind of, a perfect storm for us. We had increased cost, we talked about that last year. Usually, in Latin America, we can pass those costs along, but now we're experiencing some headwinds with respect to government accounts and being able to pass along those prices. So we'll continue to work on that certainly. The team is working on all fronts to improve margins over a longer period of time. Acquisitions, we looked at certain markets, and we'll take a cautious stand on acquisitions. If it's a good tuck-in acquisition that has a good return in our core business, certainly, we'll look to complete that. To add, we're not looking to add any new services though at this point until we can get the base business stabilized in some of the international countries."

We need a couple of those to get to the high end of the range, so we probably just to shave the top end of the range down a little bit.

Obviously, you got to cover health care and you know there is a consolidation of SQ practices by hospital systems.

Remember the decision-maker changes a little bit when the hospital acquires a doctor's practice, where we normally deal with an office administrator or office manager. We are now dealing with more personnel from the hospital. So we believe we'll see some pricing pressure on hospital-affiliated SQ account as these contracts come up for renewal. But on the flip side, it does create an opportunity to sell a broader suite of more LQ type services, like pharmaceutical waste disposal and our sharps management system. And again, to give you a little bit of color on that, we estimate that about 16% of our SQ accounts are now somewhat hospital affiliated internally. Stericycle refers to that as a blend customer, and we certainly are keeping an eye on that consolidation and the decision-making process."

As we went through the bridge, and I can share with you that they had pulled some marketing COGS forwards that effected the EBITA or EBITDA margins a little bit, and they got some higher cost. But they are largely performing pretty well I think from a guidance perspective and the rest of the year when you looking at the model. They are running at an EBIT that when we delayed the synergies now I think it will be around 13.5 [ph] because we're moving those synergies out. We are going to get to those up [ph] next year.

I think this is a good time may be to take out a step back and think about that business. And tell you -- and really -- by taking a step back and telling you why we got into, what the strategy is for the long run. If you think about it 6 years ago, we identified 2 significant growth opportunities, retail and healthcare hazardous waste. And why do we think they were good for Stericycle, they were a route-based business, they were SQ type volumes, they came with complex regulatory issues for the generator of the waste or the customer. And we had established relationship in a lot of those markets. So we looked at it, we said that retail hazardous waste businesses was approximately $1 billion, and we still think that today. And the health care SQ has waste market, we identified it's at least $1 billion market. And we quickly become the market leader in these growing segments. But unfortunately, as we spoke about before, we needed to add our operational infrastructure to support our growth. So know we acquired PSC, we acquired other acquisitions to give us that additional facilities in order to meet the demand of the growing business. Unfortunately, these acquisitions came with other hazardous waste streams as industrial waste, other hazardous waste, project work. And obviously, we're frustrated that this base revenue is shrinking and most of this is really outside of our control and it's more market driven. But we also have to look at what can we do better on the cost escalations on that business to make it better. But we needed the infrastructure, it came with some things that we didn't want to focus on, where we are focusing, we're seeing really great growth in the health care haz and retail haz. So we continue to look at that as a focus for the business, and we think overtime that will become a bigger part and that will minimize the impact of this industrial and project work. And I think about why do we still think it's a good business, I mean, that's I'm sure question of should you guys be focused on this or not. And you think about recent enforcement action, recently Comcast announced a $26 million settlement in the state of California. It was related to 2 things. It was related to the improper disposal of hazardous waste and the disposal of secure information. So obviously, enforcement continues to build a awareness, and I think this is a great example of how we have the ability to cross-sell a wide variety of compliance-related services over the customer base that we have or over one customer. So that's really our strategy and continues to be our strategy, is to focus on retail, health care and SQ hazardous waste."

I mean, we think about one of the reasons we're going through the consultant study is that, we think there will be an opportunity down the road, when we're looking at markets that don't have density, where we might be able to combine some routes and have our drivers or the Shred-it drivers combined both medical waste and secure information on the same truck. And by definition those rural routes are not dense, they're not dense with secured information, they'll not dense with regulated medical waste. So one of the reasons we are taking our time on the study, one of the reasons we're taking time not to disrupt customers as we know there will be opportunities over the next 2, 3, 4 years to improve both the operations of our Stericycle business, and the Shred-it business. There will be things like we have a tech inside the hospital, collecting sharps containers. Our plan long-term is to make sure, if we have a hospital account to secure information destruction that tech, while they are there, we'll collect all the secured information bins. So will turn an account that used to take a secure information driver a long time because they used to have to park their truck walk throughout the hospital, like all these bins. We will have a waiting for that driver and it'll be just another stopper they're picking up on their route. So certainly, we're still excited about that, I think as we get closer to the Shred-it business, we -- all the things we thought about and how closely it is related to Stericycle and what we do, we think there are things like that longer-term that really set us up to improve the overall margin for Stericycle going forward."

We can do, we can break that waste apart, we try not to use incineration or even landfilling that material, sometimes we can remediate that material sometimes it's used as an alternative fuel. So that's why our focus is there, because that part of the business is not as an dependent on disposal as is projects and larger industrial waste. And overtime, we'd like to grow that. So that the industrial and hazardous waste part of the business is just a baseline business for us and it's a small part of the larger business. And in our RX waste, all of the nonhazardous pharmaceutical waste, we actually can utilizing our medical waste facilities for that material. So we do have a closed loop on some of that non-haz pharmaceutical waste, when we sell that product to a hospital or to a doctor's office, even some of the mail backs that we have and the take back program will actually utilize from our own, our goal is to utilize some of our own medical waste facility. So we certainly -- that's something we considered we got into this business. When we looked at, why we want to grow those particular segments."

Before I give the numbers, I'd like to highlight some of the changes that will enhance our reporting and disclosure to our internal and our external stakeholders. Our Q2 press release included a global revenue table and additional non-GAAP disclosures. In our second quarter 10-Q, we will have changes to our operating segment. Our new operating segments are as follows. We will have a direct -- domestic regulated waste in Compliance Solution segment. This includes our compliance and logistics related services. We will have a domestic Communication and Related Services segment. This includes our Communication Solutions and Recall businesses. International Regulated Waste and Compliance Solutions is another segment and there's no change to this operating segment. 
Now for the numbers. The results for the second quarter are as follows.  Global revenues were $891.6 million, up 24.6% from $715.7 million in Q2 2015. In internal growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and manufacturing and industrial services was up 3.3%. Domestic revenues were $651.1 million. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and manufacturing and industrials revenues, internal growth was 2.3%. 
For consistency of your models, we will continue to report the following for the remainder of the year: Domestic Regulated Waste and Compliant Service revenues was $486.1 million, up 1%. SQ revenue was up 2%. LQ was up 1%. Growth rates were impacted by lower fuel surcharges and lower manufacturing and industrial waste revenues. Recalls and returns revenues was $20.9 million. International revenues were $234.5 million excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and manufacturing and industrial services, internal growth was 5.8%. 
Acquisitions contributed $185.9 million to growth in the quarter. Gross profit was $381.6 million or 42.8% of revenues. SG&A expense excluding amortization was $189.5 million or 21.3% of revenues. Net interest expense was $24.4 million. Net income attributable to Stericycle was $37.3 million or $0.43 per share on an as-reported basis and $1.18 when adjusted for acquisition-related expenses and other adjustments. 
Now for the balance sheet. Our covenant debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.45 at the end of the quarter. The unused portion of the revolver at the end of the quarter was approximately $506 million. In the quarter, we repurchased 32,962 shares of common stock on the open market in the amount of $3.1 million. And we repurchased 65,000 shares of mandatory convertible shares on the open market in the amount of $5 million. At the end of the quarter, we have authorization to purchase 3.3 million shares. Our CapEx was $32.9 million or 3.7% of revenues. Our DSO was 64 days. Year-to-date, as reported -- year-to-date cash from operations was $245.4 million. And when adjusted for recall reimbursement and other items, cash from operations was $282.9 million. 
Today, we filed a Form 8-K reporting our decision to amend Stericycle's timing of quarterly accruals from legal settlements in 2015. The amendments will have no effect on our 2015 year-end financial results.

In the quarter, we closed 10 acquisitions, 6 domestic and 4 international. The international acquisitions were 1 in Spain, 1 in Romania, 1 in South Korea and 1 in the U.K. Revenues from the 10 acquisitions were approximately $1.5 million in the quarter and annualized for approximately $10.6 million. Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust, with well over $100 million in annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business. 
In the quarter, we saw strong performance from the Secure Information Destruction business. The sales team set a record for new sales and closed several major national accounts. In addition, we continue to make progress toward our synergy plan and we remain on track with previous guidance. Overall, we are pleased with the momentum we are building in this new service line. 
As you all well aware, over the last 6 months, we've been working with a consulting firm to optimize our organizational structure in the U.S. and Canada. In Q2, we began implementing the new structure. First, our sales organization was realigned to focus on growing our healthcare customer base, expanding national account relationships, converting the [indiscernible] Secured Information Destruction market and expanding our multiple services across new and existing customers. 
Next, we established 1 field operations management organization for our Regulated Waste, Compliant Services and Secured Information Destruction businesses. By having these operations aligned under one leadership team, we will drive best practices across the organization and provide best-in-class service to our customers. This will also enable us to drive long-term efficiencies and margin improvement. 
In addition, we have combined our Recall and Communication Solutions businesses under one operating segment. This is the large, since a large portion of our Recall business is call center related, we have consolidated the operations, sales and marketing and client service functions under one leadership team. 
Finally, we are developing a long-term plan to expand our shared services model across all of our businesses. Some of these shared services include IT, financial support, human resources and continuous improvement. When fully implemented, this plan will enable us to better leverage best practices and SG&A. 
We are excited about this new organizational structure. We believe this will allow us to drive team member engagement, better serve our customers and provide long-term sustainable growth. 
In closing, we would like to thank all of those team members who contributed their time, effort and input to this important organizational redesign.

I would now like to provide insight on our current guidance for 2016. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements and our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, integration and acquisition-related",440,"Thank you, Brent. I would now like to provide insight on our current guidance for 2016. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements and our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, integration and acquisition-related expenses and other adjusted items. Our guidance is adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange and the following factors. Currently, the overall hazardous waste market remains challenging. This has led to increased competition for available volume. These market conditions have further reduced the revenue and profitability of our manufacturing and industrial waste business. 
We're also seeing increased pricing pressure on our SQ customer base. This is a result of the consolidation of physician practices by hospitals and the overall healthcare cost pressures resulting from managed care. To counter the SQ pricing pressure, we'll be making incremental SG&A investments to drive new customer growth. 
With respect to our international business, we have a negotiated plan to aid to 2 patient transport contracts in the U.K. later this year. We will still incur costs while we transition out of these contracts. 
As a reminder, our 2016 EPS guidance is adjusted for amortization expense. For 2016, we believe the analyst EPS estimates will be in the range of $4.68 to $4.75. We believe analyst revenue estimates for 2016 will be in the range of $3.56 billion to $3.6 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and the impact of foreign exchange rates. We anticipate 2016 internal growth rates to be: SQ, 3% to 6%, LQ, 2% to 4%; international, 3% to 5%; and recall and returns revenue between $90 million and $100 million. We believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow in 2016 between $435 million to $450 million. 2016 CapEx is anticipated to be between $125 million to $135 million. We expect the 2016 full year as-reported tax rate to be approximately 35.5%. 
We continue to be the market leader in multiple services and geographies with a strong team and an unmatched infrastructure. We recognize the challenges that our business faces and we continue to take steps to address these challenges. We remain confident in the long-term outlook of our business. 
With that in mind, Stericycle will be hosting its first Investor Day and webcast on the morning of Thursday, November 10, to share perspectives on Stericycle's strategies, capabilities and plans to drive long-term shareholder value. More details are posted on the Events page of our Investor Relations website. We encourage investors, analysts and the public to join the live webcast or watch the meeting replay.

When you adjust though for all of those impacts, the impacts around M&I and lower fuel surcharges, we would have been at a comparative of about 6 SQ and 4 LQ. And then I think it makes the question around well, what does that mean going forward into 2017? So when we -- obviously, we're going to provide our exact guidance on 2017 on the October call.

First of all, when we look at combining the business, the first thing we looked at was that 60% of recalls revenues were call center related. As you know, recalls consisted of retrieval, disposal, notification and call center. But the lion's share of the work there was call center. So there was a lot of synergies and we have been working for more than a year trying to figure out how do we leverage our Communication Solutions team to take those recall works which is lumpy in nature. So that was one of the thought process of bringing the two together. Secondly, on your question around well, what is the growth rate that we exclude some things. And recall certainly, was down this quarter, it was $20.9 million. It was down to 26% year-over-year. So let's remove the noise there on the number. I think the team, the com-sol team and the recall team did a good job of winning all our call-center contracts which we utilized to Communication Solutions team for us. So they assist in vehicle buybacks and customer care related work. So when you strip out the noise and you exclude the U.S. recall, the Europe recalls and acquisitions, year-to-date growth in com-sol was actually about 11%. I caution you a little bit about moving forward there, we have some year-over-year comps in Q3. But we are -- we think about it, how did we get that work in com-sol in the auto space, it started with an acquisition that we made of a company that had a relationship with all our manufacturers. They were able to pass along where we've got some smaller recall events at auto. But really then, we're able to work with Communication Solutions and we're now doing some large work for auto manufacturers, like I said, in the area of vehicle buybacks and customer care work. So if you think about it, it's worked very well. We took an acquisition, we extended the services they can offer and it is paying off nicely for that part of the business."

And for a couple of years in some of the smaller contracts that we were winning in the north of England and in other parts of the U.K., they were profitable. We are profitable, it were very similar to our med waste business. And as we discussed we went into this business thinking that the NHS was going to outsource this in the large tranches of contract. We were correct on that although we have difficulty setting up and delivering on a profitable bases in that marketplace. So you're right. As we start to look at the unprofitable contracts, there are some contracts, legacy contracts and contracts -- smaller contracts that we've won over the last several years that are profitable. And that's why we'll take a step back at that point to figure out what do we do next? Do we sell that business? Do we stay in that business? We really need to look at it -- we always thought that this was a U.K. centric approach and we're going to spend to the other markets. We just had to make sure that it fits the long-term strategy with that business given the fact that we will remain small and probably won't grow."

We're finding now, they getting around to that part of the integration. And as those renewals come up, you can imagine, right, the purchasing power of our IDN, as they put those out to bid, can be significant. So that's one aspect of it. The other is just with the local and regional competition and just the unaffiliated SQ looking to save more money as their reimbursements going down, we are noticing an increasing amount of discounting that we need to make to renew those agreements.

Before I give the numbers, I'd like to highlight some of the changes that will enhance our reporting and disclosure to our internal and our external stakeholders. Our Q2 press release included a global revenue table and additional non-GAAP disclosures. In our second quarter 10-Q, we will have changes to our operating segments. Our new operating segments are as follows. 
We will have a direct -- domestic regulated waste in compliance solution segment. This includes our compliance and logistics-related services. We will have a domestic communication and related services segment. This includes our communication solutions and recall businesses. International regulated waste and compliance solutions is another segment and there is no change to this operating segment. 
Now for the numbers. The results for the second quarter are as follows.  Global revenues were $891.6 million, up 24.6% from $715.7 million in Q2 2015; and internal growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and manufacturing and industrial services was up 3.3%. Domestic revenues were $651.1 million. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and manufacturing and industrials revenues, internal growth was 2.3%. 
For consistency of your models, we will continue to report the following for the remainder of the year: domestic regulated waste and compliant service revenues was $486.1 million, up 1%. SQ revenue was up 2%. LQ was up 1%. Growth rates were impacted by lower fuel surcharges and lower manufacturing and industrial waste revenues. Recalls and returns revenues was $20.9 million. International revenues were $234.5 million. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and manufacturing and industrial services, internal growth was 5.8%. 
Acquisitions contributed $185.9 million to growth in the quarter. Gross profit was $381.6 million or 42.8% of revenues. SG&A expense excluding amortization was $189.5 million or 21.3% of revenues. Net interest expense was $24.4 million. Net income attributable to Stericycle was $37.3 million or $0.43 per share on an as-reported basis and $1.18 when adjusted for acquisition-related expenses and other adjustments. 
Now for the balance sheet. Our covenant debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.45 at the end of the quarter. The unused portion of the revolver at the end of the quarter was approximately $506 million. In the quarter, we repurchased 32,962 shares of common stock on the open market in the amount of $3.1 million. And we repurchased 65,000 shares of mandatory preferred convertible shares on the open market in the amount of $5 million. 
At the end of the quarter, we have authorization to purchase 3.3 million shares. Our CapEx was $32.9 million or 3.7% of revenues. Our DSO was 64 days. Year-to-date, as reported -- year-to-date cash from operations was $245.4 million. And when adjusted for recall reimbursement and other items, cash from operations was $282.9 million. 
Today, we filed a Form 8-K reporting our decision to amend Stericycle's timing of quarterly accruals from legal settlements in 2015. The amendments will have no effect on our 2015 year-end financial results.

Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust, with well over $100 million in annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business. 
In the quarter, we saw strong performance from the secure information destruction business. The sales team set a record for new sales and closed several major national accounts. In addition, we continue to make progress toward our synergy plan and we remain on track with previous guidance. Overall, we are pleased with the momentum we are building in this new service line. 
As you're all well aware, over the last 6 months, we've been working with a consulting firm to optimize our organizational structure in the U.S. and Canada. In Q2, we began implementing the new structure. First, our sales organization was realigned to focus on growing our health care customer base, expanding national account relationships, converting the unbent Secure Information Destruction market and expanding our multiple services across new and existing customers. 
Next, we established 1 field operations management organization for our regulated waste, compliant services and secured information destruction businesses. By having these operations aligned under one leadership team, we will drive best practices across the organization and provide best-in-class service to our customers. This will also enable us to drive long-term efficiencies and margin improvement. 
In addition, we have combined our recall and communication solutions businesses under one operating segment. This is a large -- since a large portion of our recall business is call center-related, we have consolidated the operations, sales and marketing and client service functions under one leadership team. 
Finally, we are developing a long-term plan to expand our shared services model across all of our businesses. Some of these shared services include IT, financial support, human resources and continuous improvement. When fully implemented, this plan will enable us to better leverage best practices and SG&A. We are excited about this new organizational structure. We believe this will allow us to drive team member engagement, better serve our customers and provide long-term sustainable growth. 
In closing, we would like to thank all of those team members who contributed their time, effort and input to this important organizational redesign. 
I will now turn it over to Charlie."

I would now like to provide insight on our current guidance for 2016. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements and our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, integration and acquisition-related",442,"Thank you, Brent. I would now like to provide insight on our current guidance for 2016. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements and our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, integration and acquisition-related expenses and other adjusted items. 
Our guidance is adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange and the following factors. Currently, the overall hazardous waste market remains challenging. This has led to increased competitions for available volume. These market conditions have further reduced the revenue and profitability of our manufacturing and industrial waste business. 
We are also seeing increased pricing pressure on our SQ customer base. This is a result of the consolidation of physician practices by hospitals and the overall health care cost pressures resulting from managed care. To counter the SQ pricing pressure, we will be making incremental SG&A investments to drive new customer growth. With respect to our international business, we have a negotiated plan to exit 2 patient transport contracts in the U.K. later this year. We will still incur costs while we transition out of these contracts. 
As a reminder, our 2016 EPS guidance is adjusted for amortization expense. For 2016, we believe analyst EPS estimates will be in the range of $4.68 to $4.75. We believe analyst revenue estimates for 2016 will be in the range of $3.56 billion to $3.6 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and the impact of foreign exchange rates. We anticipate 2016 internal growth rates to be: SQ, 3% to 6%;  LQ, 2% to 4%; international, 3% to 5%; and recall and returns revenue between $90 million and $100 million. We believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow in 2016 between $435 million to $450 million. 2016 CapEx is anticipated to be between $125 million to $135 million. We expect the 2016 full year as-reported tax rate to be approximately 35.5%. 
We continue to be the market leader in multiple services and geographies with a strong team and an unmatched infrastructure. We recognize the challenges that our business faces, and we continue to take steps to address these challenges. We remain confident in the long-term outlook of our business. 
With that in mind, Stericycle will be hosting its first Investor Day and webcast on the morning of Thursday, November 10, to share perspectives on Stericycle's strategies, capabilities and plans to drive long-term shareholder value. More details are posted on the Events page of our Investor Relations website. We encourage investors, analysts and the public to join at the live webcast or watch the meeting replay. 
Thank you for your time today. We'll now answer any questions. Sarah, you can open the Q&A queue."

M&I, manufacturing and industrial, lower revenues, customer mix and an Argentinian facility closure or issue will be anywhere from $0.09 to $0.11 in the -- for the rest of the year.

Jump in if I missed anything because you had a couple of parts to that question. So international growth rates for the quarter were approximately 6% and that was driven higher in the quarter by a good communication solution and recall activity overseas. We did bring down a full-year guidance there and that is directly related to the exit of the patient transport contracts in the second half of the year. A little more color on the patient transport business and what that meant with respect to the quarter or guidance is we have negotiated an exit on 2 contracts later this year. We are going to still incur costs, though, while we transition out of these contracts and if you think about what is the headwind for that particular one, I think Dan addressed it earlier on, the bridge there of about $0.02 to $0.04 to EPS for the rest of the year. As far as -- you had a question about Argentina. We do have a facility that was shutdown -- will be shut down for most of the rest of the year. It had to do with heavy rains in the Buenos Aires area earlier on. That facility shutdown I think around April. So it did have some impact a little bit for us in Q2. And your last question related to government contracts in Brazil, and we talked about that as we are having issues taking some of the increases we have on wages and passing that through. There's nothing new there. It hasn't worsened. We didn't think it was going to get better that's why we guided down a little bit on that on the last call. But there's really no update there. It's  still a tough situation with respect to Latin America. We continue to try to work the best we can contract by contract in getting increases passed through.

So the main contributors are lower M&I and lower fuel surcharges. Certainly, we've seen some of this SQ pricing start to build now. So there is a component of that in Q2. When you adjust, though, for all of those impacts, the impacts around M&I and lower fuel surcharges, we would have been at a comparative of about 6 SQ and 4 LQ. And then I think it begs the question around, well, what does that mean going forward into 2017? So when we -- well, obviously, we're going to provide our exact guidance on 2017 on the October call.

But given that recall is such a lumpy business, including it in this segment sort of masks the underlying growth of com-sol, which you've talked about in the past as a nice growth platform for you. So I understand that's a pretty steady recurring revenue stream kind of business. So if you were to exclude recall, how did that com-sol business perform? And what could we expect for that going forward?"

And I think you brought up some good questions there, Barb. First of all, when we look at combining the businesses, the first thing we look at was that 60% of recalls revenues were call center-related.",365,"Yes, so there's a few things I'll point out in that. And I think you brought up some good questions there, Barb. First of all, when we look at combining the businesses, the first thing we look at was that 60% of recalls revenues were call center-related. As you know, recalls consisted of retrieval, disposal, notification and call center. But the lion's share of the work there was call center. So there was a lot of synergies and we have been working for more than a year trying to figure out how do we leverage our Communication Solutions team to take those recall works which is lumpy in nature. So that was one of the thought process of bringing the two together. Secondly, on your question around, well, what is the growth rate if we exclude some things. And recall, certainly, was down this quarter. It was $20.9 million. It was down to 26% year-over-year. So let's remove the noise there on the number. I think the team -- the com-sol team and the recall team did a good job of winning auto call center contracts which we utilized the Communication Solutions team for. So they assist in vehicle buybacks and customer care-related work. So when you strip out the noise and you exclude the U.S. recall, the Europe recalls and acquisitions, year-to-date growth in com-sol was actually about 11%. I cautioned you a little bit about moving forward there. We have some year-over-year comps in Q3. But we are -- we think about it, how did we get that working com-sol in the auto space, it started with an acquisition that we made of a company that had a relationship with all our manufacturers. They were able to pass along where we got some smaller recall events in auto. But really then, we're able to work with Communication Solutions and we're now doing some large work for auto manufacturers, like I said, in the area of vehicle buybacks and customer care work. So if you think about it, it's worked very well. We took an acquisition. We extended the services they can offer, and it's paying off nicely for that part of the business."

Factors that could cause such differences include: changes in governmental regulation of the collection, transportation, treatment and disposal of regular waste or the proper handling and protection of personal and confidential information; increases in transportation and other operating costs; level of governmental enforcement of regulations governing regulated waste collection and treatment or the proper handling and protection of personal and confidential information; our obligation to service our substantial indebtedness and to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our private placement notes, term loan credit facility and revolving credit facility; our ability to execute our acquisition strategy and to integrate acquired businesses; competition and demand for services in the regulated waste and secure information destruction industries; political, economic and currency risks related to our foreign operations; impairments of goodwill or other indefinite lived intangibles; variability in the demand for services we provide on a project or nonrecurring basis; exposure to environmental liabilities; fluctuations in the price we receive for the sale of paper; disruptions in or attacks on our information technology systems; compliance with existing and future legal and regulatory requirements; as well as other factors described in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K.

Before I give the numbers, I'd like to highlight some of the changes that will enhance our reporting and disclosure to our internal and our external stakeholders. Our Q2 press release included a global revenue table and additional non-GAAP disclosures. In our second quarter 10-Q, we will have changes to our operating segments. Our new operating segments are as follows. 
We will have a direct -- domestic regulated waste in compliance solution segment. This includes our compliance and logistics-related services. We will have a domestic communication and related services segment. This includes our communication solutions and recall businesses. International regulated waste and compliance solutions is another segment and there is no change to this operating segment. 
Now for the numbers. The results for the second quarter are as follows.  Global revenues were $891.6 million, up 24.6% from $715.7 million in Q2 2015; and internal growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and manufacturing and industrial services was up 3.3%. Domestic revenues were $651.1 million. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and manufacturing and industrials revenues, internal growth was 2.3%. 
For consistency of your models, we will continue to report the following for the remainder of the year: domestic regulated waste and compliant service revenues was $486.1 million, up 1%. SQ revenue was up 2%. LQ was up 1%. Growth rates were impacted by lower fuel surcharges and lower manufacturing and industrial waste revenues. Recalls and returns revenues was $20.9 million. International revenues were $234.5 million. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and manufacturing and industrial services, internal growth was 5.8%. 
Acquisitions contributed $185.9 million to growth in the quarter. Gross profit was $381.6 million or 42.8% of revenues. SG&A expense excluding amortization was $189.5 million or 21.3% of revenues. Net interest expense was $24.4 million. Net income attributable to Stericycle was $37.3 million or $0.43 per share on an as-reported basis and $1.18 when adjusted for acquisition-related expenses and other adjustments. 
Now for the balance sheet. Our covenant debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.45 at the end of the quarter. The unused portion of the revolver at the end of the quarter was approximately $506 million. In the quarter, we repurchased 32,962 shares of common stock on the open market in the amount of $3.1 million. And we repurchased 65,000 shares of mandatory preferred convertible shares on the open market in the amount of $5 million. 
At the end of the quarter, we have authorization to purchase 3.3 million shares. Our CapEx was $32.9 million or 3.7% of revenues. Our DSO was 64 days. Year-to-date, as reported -- year-to-date cash from operations was $245.4 million. And when adjusted for recall reimbursement and other items, cash from operations was $282.9 million. 
Today, we filed a Form 8-K reporting our decision to amend Stericycle's timing of quarterly accruals from legal settlements in 2015. The amendments will have no effect on our 2015 year-end financial results.

In the quarter, we closed 10 acquisitions, 6 domestic and 4 international. The international acquisitions were 1 in Spain, 1 in Romania, 1 in South Korea and 1 in the U.K. Revenues from the 10 acquisitions were approximately $1.5 million in the quarter in annualized or approximately $10.6 million. Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust, with well over $100 million in annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business. 
In the quarter, we saw strong performance from the secure information destruction business. The sales team set a record for new sales and closed several major national accounts. In addition, we continue to make progress toward our synergy plan and we remain on track with previous guidance. Overall, we are pleased with the momentum we are building in this new service line. 
As you're all well aware, over the last 6 months, we've been working with a consulting firm to optimize our organizational structure in the U.S. and Canada. In Q2, we began implementing the new structure. First, our sales organization was realigned to focus on growing our health care customer base, expanding national account relationships, converting the unbent Secure Information Destruction market and expanding our multiple services across new and existing customers. 
Next, we established 1 field operations management organization for our regulated waste, compliant services and secured information destruction businesses. By having these operations aligned under one leadership team, we will drive best practices across the organization and provide best-in-class service to our customers. This will also enable us to drive long-term efficiencies and margin improvement. 
In addition, we have combined our recall and communication solutions businesses under one operating segment. This is a large -- since a large portion of our recall business is call center-related, we have consolidated the operations, sales and marketing and client service functions under one leadership team. 
Finally, we are developing a long-term plan to expand our shared services model across all of our businesses. Some of these shared services include IT, financial support, human resources and continuous improvement. When fully implemented, this plan will enable us to better leverage best practices and SG&A. We are excited about this new organizational structure. We believe this will allow us to drive team member engagement, better serve our customers and provide long-term sustainable growth. 
In closing, we would like to thank all of those team members who contributed their time, effort and input to this important organizational redesign.

I would now like to provide insight on our current guidance for 2016. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements and our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, integration and acquisition-related expenses and other adjusted items. 
Our guidance is adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange and the following factors. Currently, the overall hazardous waste market remains challenging. This has led to increased competition for available volume. These market conditions have further reduced the revenue and profitability of our manufacturing and industrial waste business. 
We are also seeing increased pricing pressure on our SQ customer base. This is a result of the consolidation of physician practices by hospitals and the overall health care cost pressures resulting from managed care. To counter the SQ pricing pressure, we will be making incremental SG&A investments to drive new customer growth. With respect to our international business, we have a negotiated plan to exit 2 patient transport contracts in the U.K. later this year. We will still incur costs while we transition out of these contracts. 
As a reminder, our 2016 EPS guidance is adjusted for amortization expense. For 2016, we believe analyst EPS estimates will be in the range of $4.68 to $4.75. We believe analyst revenue estimates for 2016 will be in the range of $3.56 billion to $3.6 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and the impact of foreign exchange rates. We anticipate 2016 internal growth rates to be: SQ, 3% to 6%; LQ, 2% to 4%; international, 3% to 5%; and recall and returns revenue between $90 million and $100 million. We believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow in 2016 between $435 million to $450 million. 2016 CapEx is anticipated to be between $125 million to $135 million. We expect the 2016 full year as-reported tax rate to be approximately 35.5%. 
We continue to be the market leader in multiple services and geographies with a strong team and an unmatched infrastructure. We recognize the challenges that our business faces, and we continue to take steps to address these challenges. We remain confident in the long-term outlook of our business. 
With that in mind, Stericycle will be hosting its first Investor Day and webcast on the morning of Thursday, November 10, to share perspectives on Stericycle's strategies, capabilities and plans to drive long-term shareholder value. More details are posted on the Events page of our Investor Relations website. We encourage investors, analysts and the public to join the live webcast or watch the meeting replay.

Jump in if I missed anything because you had a couple of parts to that question. So international growth rates for the quarter were approximately 6% and that was driven higher in the quarter by a good communication solution and recall activity overseas. We did bring down a full-year guidance there and that is directly related to the exit of the patient transport contracts in the second half of the year. A little more color on the patient transport business and what that meant with respect to the quarter or guidance is we have negotiated an exit on 2 contracts later this year. We are going to still incur costs, though, while we transition out of these contracts and if you think about what is the headwind for that particular one, I think Dan addressed it earlier on, the bridge there of about $0.02 to $0.04 to EPS for the rest of the year. As far as -- you had a question about Argentina. We do have a facility that was shut down -- will be shut down for most of the rest of the year. It had to do with heavy rains in the Buenos Aires area earlier on. That facility shut down I think around April. So it did have some impact a little bit for us in Q2. And your last question related to government contracts in Brazil, and we talked about that, that we are having issues taking some of the increases we have on wages and passing that through. There's nothing new there. It hasn't worsened. We didn't think it was going to get better; that's why we guided down a little bit on that on the last call. But there's really no update there. It’s still a tough situation with respect to Latin America. We continue to try to work the best we can contract by contract in getting increases passed through. I believe I caught all of your questions."

So the main contributors are lower M&I and lower fuel surcharges. Certainly, we've seen some of this SQ pricing start to build now. So there is a component of that in Q2. When you adjust, though, for all of those impacts, the impacts around M&I and lower fuel surcharges, we would have been at a comparative of about 6 SQ and 4 LQ. And then I think it begs the question around, well, what does that mean going forward into 2017? So when we -- well, obviously, we're going to provide our exact guidance on 2017 on the October call. However, some of the headwinds we've discussed here today around M&I and around our regulated compliance solutions business will continue into next year.

And I think you brought up some good questions there, Barb. First of all, when we look at combining the businesses, the first thing we look at was that 60% of recalls revenues were call center-related. As you know, recalls consisted of retrieval, disposal, notification and call center. But the lion's share of the work there was call center. So there was a lot of synergies and we have been working for more than a year trying to figure out how do we leverage our Communication Solutions team to take those recall works which is lumpy in nature. So that was one of the thought process of bringing the two together. Secondly, on your question around, well, what is the growth rate if we exclude some things. And recall, certainly, was down this quarter. It was $20.9 million. It was down to 26% year-over-year. So let's remove the noise there on the number. I think the team -- the com-sol team and the recall team did a good job of winning auto call center contracts which we utilized the Communication Solutions team for. So they assist in vehicle buybacks and customer care-related work. So when you strip out the noise and you exclude the U.S. recalls, the Europe recalls and acquisitions, year-to-date growth in com-sol was actually about 11%. I cautioned you a little bit about moving forward there. We have some year-over-year comps in Q3. But we are -- we think about it, how did we get that work in com-sol in the auto space? It started with an acquisition that we made of a company that had a relationship with auto manufacturers. They were able to pass along where we got some small recall events in auto. But really then, we're able to work with Communication Solutions and we're now doing some large work for auto manufacturers, like I said, in the area of vehicle buybacks and customer care work. So if you think about it, it's worked very well. We took an acquisition. We extended the services they can offer, and it's paying off nicely for that part of the business."

Exiting that patient, those 2 patient transportation contracts will be between $7 million and $12 million on the back half. And then the acquisitions that we did will contribute about $5 million foreign exchange, and I think I'm going to answer both questions with this one. The Brexit will create about $10 million in foreign exchange headwinds. Most of it had to do with the Brexit. And then the improvement in paper prices is about $5 million. If you look at that, it will bring you to about $3.56 billion to $3.60 billion in revenue for the year guidance."

It's anywhere from 3% to 5%, which is high -- slightly higher than historical averages. We look to accelerate that -- the investments with regard to cross-selling. I think that's the way the new sales organization we'd set it up to sell all services. It's going to be a great plus there. So again, we're still in the process of learning lessons and continuing the pilot. The ones that work best, we will fund and we will accelerate those in the back half of the year and into next year."

And for a couple of years, in some of the smaller contracts that we're winning in the north of England and other parts of the U.K., they were profitable. And that profitability was very similar to our med waste business. And as we discussed, we went into this business thinking that the NHS was going to outsource this in a large tranches of contract. We were correct on that call, but we've had difficulty setting up and delivering on a profitable basis in that marketplace. So you're right. As we start to look at the unprofitable contracts, there are some contracts, legacy contracts and contracts -- smaller contracts that we've won over the last several years that are profitable. And that's why we'll take a step back at that point to figure out what do we do next. Do we sell that business? Do we stay in that business? We really need to look at it on a -- we always thought that this was a U.K.-centric approach and wasn't going to expand to other markets.

We're finding now, they're getting around to that part of the integration. And as those renewals come up, you can imagine, right, the purchasing power of our IDNs, as they put those out to bid, can be significant. So that's one aspect of it. The other is just with the local and regional competition and just the unaffiliated SQ looking to save more money as their reimbursement is going down, we are noticing an increasing amount of discounting that we need to make to renew those agreements.

Before I give the numbers, I'd like to highlight some of the changes that will enhance our reporting and disclosure to our internal and our external stakeholders. Our Q2 press release included a global revenue table and additional non-GAAP disclosures. In our second quarter 10-Q, we will have changes to our operating segments. Our new operating segments are as follows. 
We will have a direct -- domestic regulated waste in compliance solution segment. This includes our compliance and logistics-related services. We will have a domestic communication and related services segment. This includes our communication solutions and recall businesses. International regulated waste and compliance solutions is another segment and there is no change to this operating segment. 
Now for the numbers. The results for the second quarter are as follows.  Global revenues were $891.6 million, up 24.6% from $715.7 million in Q2 2015; and internal growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and manufacturing and industrial services was up 3.3%. Domestic revenues were $651.1 million. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and manufacturing and industrials revenues, internal growth was 2.3%. 
For consistency of your models, we will continue to report the following for the remainder of the year: domestic regulated waste and compliant service revenues was $486.1 million, up 1%. SQ revenue was up 2%. LQ was up 1%. Growth rates were impacted by lower fuel surcharges and lower manufacturing and industrial waste revenues. Recalls and returns revenues was $20.9 million. International revenues were $234.5 million. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and manufacturing and industrial services, internal growth was 5.8%. 
Acquisitions contributed $185.9 million to growth in the quarter. Gross profit was $381.6 million or 42.8% of revenues. SG&A expense excluding amortization was $189.5 million or 21.3% of revenues. Net interest expense was $24.4 million. Net income attributable to Stericycle was $37.3 million or $0.43 per share on an as-reported basis and $1.18 when adjusted for acquisition-related expenses and other adjustments. 
Now for the balance sheet. Our covenant debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.45 at the end of the quarter. The unused portion of the revolver at the end of the quarter was approximately $506 million. In the quarter, we repurchased 32,962 shares of common stock on the open market in the amount of $3.1 million. And we repurchased 65,000 shares of mandatory preferred convertible shares on the open market in the amount of $5 million. 
At the end of the quarter, we have authorization to purchase 3.3 million shares. Our CapEx was $32.9 million or 3.7% of revenues. Our DSO was 64 days. Year-to-date, as reported -- year-to-date cash from operations was $245.4 million. And when adjusted for recall reimbursement and other items, cash from operations was $282.9 million. 
Today, we filed a Form 8-K reporting our decision to amend Stericycle's timing of quarterly accruals from legal settlements in 2015. The amendments will have no effect on our 2015 year-end financial results. 
I will now turn it over to Brent."

In the quarter, we closed 10 acquisitions, 6 domestic and 4 international. The international acquisitions were 1 in Spain, 1 in Romania, 1 in South Korea and 1 in the U.K. Revenues from the 10 acquisitions were approximately $1.5 million in the quarter in annualized or approximately $10.6 million. Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust, with well over $100 million in annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business. 
In the quarter, we saw strong performance from the secure information destruction business. The sales team set a record for new sales and closed several major national accounts. In addition, we continue to make progress toward our synergy plan and we remain on track with previous guidance. Overall, we are pleased with the momentum we are building in this new service line. 
As you're all well aware, over the last 6 months, we've been working with a consulting firm to optimize our organizational structure in the U.S. and Canada. In Q2, we began implementing the new structure. First, our sales organization was realigned to focus on growing our health care customer base, expanding national account relationships, converting the unbent Secure Information Destruction market and expanding our multiple services across new and existing customers. 
Next, we established 1 field operations management organization for our regulated waste, compliant services and secured information destruction businesses. By having these operations aligned under one leadership team, we will drive best practices across the organization and provide best-in-class service to our customers. This will also enable us to drive long-term efficiencies and margin improvement. 
In addition, we have combined our recall and communication solutions businesses under one operating segment. This is a large -- since a large portion of our recall business is call center-related, we have consolidated the operations, sales and marketing and client service functions under one leadership team. 
Finally, we are developing a long-term plan to expand our shared services model across all of our businesses. Some of these shared services include IT, financial support, human resources and continuous improvement. When fully implemented, this plan will enable us to better leverage best practices and SG&A. We are excited about this new organizational structure. We believe this will allow us to drive team member engagement, better serve our customers and provide long-term sustainable growth. 
In closing, we would like to thank all of those team members who contributed their time, effort and input to this important organizational redesign. 
I will now turn it over to Charlie."

I would now like to provide insight on our current guidance for 2016.

I would now like to provide insight on our current guidance for 2016. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements and our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, integration and acquisition-related expenses and other adjusted items. 
Our guidance is adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange and the following factors. Currently, the overall hazardous waste market remains challenging. This has led to increased competition for available volume. These market conditions have further reduced the revenue and profitability of our manufacturing and industrial waste business. 
We are also seeing increased pricing pressure on our SQ customer base. This is a result of the consolidation of physician practices by hospitals and the overall health care cost pressures resulting from managed care. To counter the SQ pricing pressure, we will be making incremental SG&A investments to drive new customer growth. With respect to our international business, we have a negotiated plan to exit 2 patient transport contracts in the U.K. later this year. We will still incur costs while we transition out of these contracts. 
As a reminder, our 2016 EPS guidance is adjusted for amortization expense. For 2016, we believe analyst EPS estimates will be in the range of $4.68 to $4.75. We believe analyst revenue estimates for 2016 will be in the range of $3.56 billion to $3.6 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and the impact of foreign exchange rates. We anticipate 2016 internal growth rates to be: SQ, 3% to 6%; LQ, 2% to 4%; international, 3% to 5%; and recall and returns revenue between $90 million and $100 million. We believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow in 2016 between $435 million to $450 million. 2016 CapEx is anticipated to be between $125 million to $135 million. We expect the 2016 full year as-reported tax rate to be approximately 35.5%. 
We continue to be the market leader in multiple services and geographies with a strong team and an unmatched infrastructure. We recognize the challenges that our business faces, and we continue to take steps to address these challenges. We remain confident in the long-term outlook of our business. 
With that in mind, Stericycle will be hosting its first Investor Day and webcast on the morning of Thursday, November 10, to share perspectives on Stericycle's strategies, capabilities and plans to drive long-term shareholder value. More details are posted on the Events page of our Investor Relations website. We encourage investors, analysts and the public to join the live webcast or watch the meeting replay.

And at the same time, reduce the period over which we amortize that. And that's why you saw a onetime spike in amortization. But even prior to that, we began looking at the business aspect of that. So I do think it's appropriate when looking at it to continue to do that. And I think you've seen a little bit of improvement in the SG&A number and I think you should show what you're looking at is pretty stable. But as Brent mentioned, we are going to make investments in SG&A to be able to ramp up the growth in the areas that Brent discussed."

Jump in if I missed anything because you had a couple of parts to that question. So international growth rates for the quarter were approximately 6% and that was driven higher in the quarter by a good communication solution and recall activity overseas. We did bring down a full-year guidance there and that is directly related to the exit of the patient transport contracts in the second half of the year. A little more color on the patient transport business and what that meant with respect to the quarter or guidance is we have negotiated an exit on 2 contracts later this year. We are going to still incur costs, though, while we transition out of these contracts and if you think about what is the headwind for that particular one, I think Dan addressed it earlier on, the bridge there of about $0.02 to $0.04 to EPS for the rest of the year. As far as -- you had a question about Argentina. We do have a facility that was shut down -- will be shut down for most of the rest of the year. It had to do with heavy rains in the Buenos Aires area earlier on. That facility shut down I think around April. So it did have some impact a little bit for us in Q2. And your last question related to government contracts in Brazil, and we talked about that, that we are having issues taking some of the increases we have on wages and passing that through. There's nothing new there. It hasn't worsened. We didn't think it was going to get better; that's why we guided down a little bit on that on the last call. But there's really no update there.

We have not made any decisions to sell any part of our hazardous waste business. That includes obviously our retail, health care and SQ or our M&I business, our manufacturing and industrial. One of the reasons to call it out on the table is that, obviously, has a lot of unpredictabilities to it. So from an analyst and a shareholder perspective, we wanted to call that out. If we made a decision to sell or to move away from a business, we certainly look at what's left from an operational infrastructure and make the proper adjustments to make sure that we can run a very predictable, stable and profitable business. We wouldn't just leave and then try to figure out what the infrastructure would look like afterwards. That would all be part of the overall decision."

Is it wrong to think that, that would extend beyond the initial integration?

But given that recall is such a lumpy business, including it in this segment sort of masks the underlying growth of com-sol, which you've talked about in the past as a nice growth platform for you.

And I think you brought up some good questions there, Barb.

And I think you brought up some good questions there, Barb. First of all, when we look at combining the businesses, the first thing we look at was that 60% of recalls revenues were call center-related. As you know, recalls consisted of retrieval, disposal, notification and call center. But the lion's share of the work there was call center. So there was a lot of synergies and we have been working for more than a year trying to figure out how do we leverage our Communication Solutions team to take those recall works which is lumpy in nature. So that was one of the thought process of bringing the two together. Secondly, on your question around, well, what is the growth rate if we exclude some things. And recall, certainly, was down this quarter. It was $20.9 million. It was down to 26% year-over-year. So let's remove the noise there on the number. I think the team -- the com-sol team and the recall team did a good job of winning auto call center contracts which we utilized the Communication Solutions team for. So they assist in vehicle buybacks and customer care-related work. So when you strip out the noise and you exclude the U.S. recalls, the Europe recalls and acquisitions, year-to-date growth in com-sol was actually about 11%. I cautioned you a little bit about moving forward there. We have some year-over-year comps in Q3. But we are -- we think about it, how did we get that work in com-sol in the auto space? It started with an acquisition that we made of a company that had a relationship with auto manufacturers. They were able to pass along where we got some small recall events in auto. But really then, we're able to work with Communication Solutions and we're now doing some large work for auto manufacturers, like I said, in the area of vehicle buybacks and customer care work. So if you think about it, it's worked very well. We took an acquisition. We extended the services they can offer, and it's paying off nicely for that part of the business."

The results for the third quarter are as follows: Global revenues were $890.1 million, up 23.9% from $718.6 million in Q3 2015; an internal growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and manufacturing and industrial services was up 1.6%; domestic revenues were $664.1 million; excluding the impact of acquisitions and manufacturing and industrial revenues, internal growth was 1.6%. 
For consistency of your models, we're providing the following for the remainder of the year. Domestic revenues were $664.1 million, of which $637.1 million was regulated waste and compliant services revenues and $26.9 million was recall and returns. Domestic internal growth, excluding recalls and returns revenues, was up 1%, consisting of SQ up 1% and LQ flat. As anticipated, growth rates were impacted by SQ pricing pressure, lower hazardous waste volumes from our industrial customers and lower fuel surcharges. 
International revenues were $226.1 million or 3% internal growth when adjusted for foreign exchange impact. As anticipated, international growth rates were impacted by the exiting of certain patient transportation contracts. Acquisitions contributed $184.7 million to growth in the quarter. Gross profits were $381 million or 42.8% of revenues. SG&A expense, excluding amortization was $189.3 million or 21.3% of revenues. Adjusted income from operations or EBITA was $191.7 million or 21.5% of revenues. Net interest expense was $24.7 million. Net income attributable to Stericycle was $61.5 million or $0.72 per share on an as-reported basis and $1.24 when adjusted for acquisition-related expenses and other adjustments. 
Now for the balance sheet. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.35 at the end of the quarter. The unused portion of the revolver at the end of the quarter was approximately $607 million. In the quarter, we repurchased 265,000 shares of the mandatory preferred convertible on the open market in the amount of $19.2 million. At the end of the quarter, we have authorization to purchase 3.1 million shares. Our CapEx was $33.8 million or 3.8% of revenues. Our DSO was 65 days. Year-to-date, as-reported, cash from operations was $417.8 million. And when adjusted for recall reimbursement and other items, cash from operations was $467.6 million.

Revenues from the 5 acquisitions were approximately $0.4 million in the quarter and annualized for approximately $4 million. Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust with well over $100 million annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business. 
The SQ pricing pressure discussed previously continued in the quarter and will remain for the foreseeable future. To address these pressures, we are making incremental strategic investments in sales, marketing and data analytics. These investments will enable us to pinpoint and execute on opportunities to grow our business and improve our overall performance. 
Despite the SQ headwinds, we are able to maintain our operating margin profile as well as deliver positive revenue growth in other services. For example, in our hospital customer base, we successfully completed several large charge [ph] management and pharmaceutical compliance installation. We saw strong growth in retail waste services, driven by our high level of service and detailed reporting capability. The combination of our customer relationships and our multiple compliance solutions provides a strong foundation for future growth. 
In the Secure Information Destruction Service, we continued to see strong sales resulting from the conversion of unbended customers to ongoing service. In addition, the national accounts team continues to make progress, securing new large customers. 
Our synergies remain on track with recent progress in streamlining back-office processes and implementing new technology to optimize our inside sales and customer service.

I would now like to provide insight on our current guidance for 2016 and preliminary guidance for 2017. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements and our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, integration and acquisition-related expenses and other adjusted items. 
As a reminder, our 2016 EPS guidance is adjusted for amortization expense. For 2016, we believe EPS will be in the range of $4.74 to $4.76. This includes the benefit of our ongoing strategy for repurchase of mandatory preferred convertible shares. 
We expect revenue for 2016 will be in the range of $3.56 billion to $3.58 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and the impact of foreign exchange rates. 
Internal growth rates are expected to be: SQ, 3% to 5%; LQ, 2% to 3%; international, 4% to 5%; and recall and returns revenue between $95 million and $105 million. We have estimates for free cash flow in 2016 between $450 million and $470 million. 2016 CapEx is anticipated to be between $130 million to $135 million. We expect that 2016 full year as-reported tax rate to be approximately 36%. 
Now I'd like to provide preliminary guidance for 2017. For 2017, we believe EPS estimates will be in the range of $4.57 to $4.77, using a share count of approximately 91.1 million. This includes the unfavorable impact of approximately $0.19 from the normalization of performance compensation and additional SG&A investments to drive future growth and profitability. This is partially offset by approximately $0.17 of benefit from ongoing strategy to repurchase the mandatory preferred convertible shares. 
We believe revenues for 2017 will be in the range of $3.54 billion to $3.67 billion, depending on assumptions of foreign exchange and internal rates of flat to 3%. The worldwide revenue guidance for each of our service lines is as follows: regulated waste and compliant services will be in the range of $2.03 billion to $2.09 billion; Secure Information Destruction Services will be in the range of $780 million to $810 million; communications and related services will be in the range of $340 million to $370 million, depending on recall revenues; and manufacturing and industrial services will be in the range of $380 million to $400 million. 
We have estimates for free cash flow in 2017 between $450 million to $470 million. 2017 CapEx is anticipated to be between $125 million to $150 million. We expect the 2017 full year as-reported tax rate to be approximately 36.5%. 
Stericycle continues to be the market leader in multiple services and geographies. We have a strong team and an unmatched infrastructure. We are confident in the long-term outlook of our business.

This performance compensation was only partially accrued for in 2016 results. And as our practice has been to accrue appropriate levels throughout the year based on real-time [ph] performance. And this is our initial guidance in 2017. We historically included a full performance compensation in our guidance towards -- to reflect all expectation of not only achieving but exceeding our goals.

As far as pricing pressure in the LQ side of the business, we're doing great on the LQ side of the business. We, obviously, just look at our medical waste services, Brent touched on it early on.

The results for the third quarter are as follows: Global revenues were $890.1 million, up 23.9% from $718.6 million in Q3 2015; an internal growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and manufacturing and industrial services was up 1.6%; domestic revenues were $664.1 million; excluding the impact of acquisitions and manufacturing and industrial revenues, internal growth was 1.6%. 
For consistency of your models, we're providing the following for the remainder of the year. Domestic revenues were $664.1 million, of which $637.1 million was regulated waste and compliant services revenues and $26.9 million was recall and returns. Domestic internal growth, excluding recalls and returns revenues, was up 1%, consisting of SQ up 1% and LQ flat. As anticipated, growth rates were impacted by SQ pricing pressure, lower hazardous waste volumes from our industrial customers and lower fuel surcharges. 
International revenues were $226.1 million or 3% internal growth when adjusted for foreign exchange impact. As anticipated, international growth rates were impacted by the exiting of certain patient transportation contracts. Acquisitions contributed $184.7 million to growth in the quarter. Gross profits were $381 million or 42.8% of revenues. SG&A expense, excluding amortization was $189.3 million or 21.3% of revenues. Adjusted income from operations or EBITA was $191.7 million or 21.5% of revenues. Net interest expense was $24.7 million. Net income attributable to Stericycle was $61.5 million or $0.72 per share on an as-reported basis and $1.24 when adjusted for acquisition-related expenses and other adjustments. 
Now for the balance sheet. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.35 at the end of the quarter. The unused portion of the revolver at the end of the quarter was approximately $607 million. In the quarter, we repurchased 265,000 shares of the mandatory preferred convertible on the open market in the amount of $19.2 million. At the end of the quarter, we have authorization to purchase 3.1 million shares. Our CapEx was $33.8 million or 3.8% of revenues. Our DSO was 65 days. Year-to-date, as-reported, cash from operations was $417.8 million. And when adjusted for recall reimbursement and other items, cash from operations was $467.6 million.

Revenues from the 5 acquisitions were approximately $0.4 million in the quarter and annualized for approximately $4 million. Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust with well over $100 million annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business. 
The SQ pricing pressure discussed previously continued in the quarter and will remain for the foreseeable future. To address these pressures, we are making incremental strategic investments in sales, marketing and data analytics. These investments will enable us to pinpoint and execute on opportunities to grow our business and improve our overall performance. 
Despite the SQ headwinds, we are able to maintain our operating margin profile as well as deliver positive revenue growth in other services. For example, in our hospital customer base, we successfully completed several large Sharps Management and pharmaceutical compliance installation. We saw strong growth in retail waste services, driven by our high level of service and detailed reporting capability. The combination of our customer relationships and our multiple compliance solutions provides a strong foundation for future growth. 
In the Secure Information Destruction Service, we continued to see strong sales resulting from the conversion of unbended customers to ongoing service. In addition, the national accounts team continues to make progress, securing new large customers. 
Our synergies remain on track with recent progress in streamlining back-office processes and implementing new technology to optimize our inside sales and customer service. 
In closing, we would like to thank all of our worldwide team members for their continued commitment to our customers, our shareholders and our core values.

I would now like to provide insight on our current guidance for 2016 and preliminary guidance for 2017.

I would now like to provide insight on our current guidance for 2016 and preliminary guidance for 2017. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements and our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, integration and acquisition-related expenses and other adjusted items. 
As a reminder, our 2016 EPS guidance is adjusted for amortization expense. For 2016, we believe EPS will be in the range of $4.74 to $4.76. This includes the benefit of our ongoing strategy for repurchase of mandatory preferred convertible shares. 
We expect revenue for 2016 will be in the range of $3.56 billion to $3.58 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and the impact of foreign exchange rates. 
Internal growth rates are expected to be: SQ, 3% to 5%; LQ, 2% to 3%; international, 4% to 5%; and recall and returns revenue between $95 million and $105 million. We have estimates for free cash flow in 2016 between $450 million and $470 million. 2016 CapEx is anticipated to be between $130 million to $135 million. We expect that 2016 full year as-reported tax rate to be approximately 36%. 
Now I'd like to provide preliminary guidance for 2017. For 2017, we believe EPS estimates will be in the range of $4.57 to $4.77, using a share count of approximately 91.1 million. This includes the unfavorable impact of approximately $0.19 from the normalization of performance compensation and additional SG&A investments to drive future growth and profitability. This is partially offset by approximately $0.17 of benefit from ongoing strategy to repurchase the mandatory preferred convertible shares. 
We believe revenues for 2017 will be in the range of $3.54 billion to $3.67 billion, depending on assumptions of foreign exchange and internal rates of flat to 3%. The worldwide revenue guidance for each of our service lines is as follows: regulated waste and compliant services will be in the range of $2.03 billion to $2.09 billion; Secure Information Destruction Services will be in the range of $780 million to $810 million; communications and related services will be in the range of $340 million to $370 million, depending on recall revenues; and manufacturing and industrial services will be in the range of $380 million to $400 million. 
We have estimates for free cash flow in 2017 between $450 million to $470 million. 2017 CapEx is anticipated to be between $125 million to $150 million. We expect the 2017 full year as-reported tax rate to be approximately 36.5%. 
Stericycle continues to be the market leader in multiple services and geographies. We have a strong team and an unmatched infrastructure. We are confident in the long-term outlook of our business. 
As a reminder, Stericycle will be hosting its first Investor Day and webcast on the morning of Thursday, November 10, to share perspectives on Stericycle's strategies, capabilities and plans to drive long-term shareholder value.

We're seeing obviously more pricing pressure there, up to 30%, 35%, as they bid out multiple locations. So we're aggressive in trying to renew that. We want to keep that route density. And then we're seeing general pricing. We have a national account, as we've talked about, Michael, in that 770 -- $700 million to $750 million of that, roughly 25%, 30% are national account. There's been no change in that business. Obviously, there's preferential pricing in there with contract, good contract [indiscernible] and fees. So that really does not impact and, in fact, revenue had great renewal year on our national account. And then the remainder will be all of the SQ that are not affiliated with any large groups or hospitals or national accounts.

And listen, I thought we're trying to get away from SQ, LQ, right? Because we've got 20% of our SQ customers that are owned by LQ. So they are not truly SQ, because they're not independently making decisions. But I think we have a good handle on the SQ business and the different buckets. And then as to Brent's point, we'll use data analytics that help us get through how we should look at pricing. Maybe we don't have to discount as much if we're proactive.

Related to your question about guidance for 2017 in that communication-related service line of $340 million to $370 million, that has roughly $90 million to $120 million in recall revenue guidance in that number."

And what we did talk about a $0.19 and total recall [ph] corporate expenses, and that's made up of really 2 buckets: it's performance compensation, which is roughly about half of that; and this is primarily related to cash flow and this is tied to specific performance goals. This performance compensation was only partially accrued for in 2016 results. And as our practice has been to accrue appropriate levels throughout the year based on real-time performance. And this is our initial guidance in 2017. We historically included a full-performance compensation in our guidance to reflect all expectation of not only achieving but exceeding our goals. The other half of that is really in SG&A investments for growth. And these would be in things such as IT to enhance our operational and financial systems as well as continued investments to support growth. Throughout the course of the year, we'll evaluate these projects and we'll adjust and release these funds where best appropriate. I think to your other question, Scott, was really about the $0.17 is purchasing the mandatory preferred convertible. What we've looked at and why we're purchasing that over the common is really the best use of cash being. That only gives us the best ability to reduce dilution by being able to buy more shares. But it also offsets 5.25% dividend rather than hang down 2% interest. We were very successful in doing that in Q3 in the -- you would see that we purchased about $0.07 of that. And so we really built that into our guidance going into next year. And even into Q4, we'll do a marginal amount. It's a conservative guidance for next year because it really has to be a balance of how we're going to utilize all of our cash flow."

Factors that could cause such differences include: changes in governmental regulation of the collection, transportation, treatment and disposal of regulated waste or the proper handling and protection of personal and confidential information; increases in transportation and other operating costs; the level of governmental enforcement of regulations governing regulated waste collection and treatment or the proper handling and protection of personal and confidential information; our obligations to service our substantial indebtedness and to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our private placement notes, term loan credit facility and revolving credit facility; our ability to execute our acquisition strategy and to integrate acquired businesses; competition and demand for services in the regulated waste and Secure Information Destruction industries; political, economic and currency risks related to our foreign operations; impairments of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangibles; variability in the demand for services we provide on a project or nonrecurring basis; exposure to environmental liabilities; fluctuations in the price we receive for the sale of paper; disruptions in or attacks on our information technology systems; compliance with existing and future legal and regulatory requirements; as well as other factors described in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K/A.

The results for the third quarter are as follows: Global revenues were $890.1 million, up 23.9% from $718.6 million in Q3 2015; and internal growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and manufacturing and industrial services was up 1.6%; domestic revenues were $664.1 million; excluding the impact of acquisitions and manufacturing and industrial revenues, internal growth was 1.6%. 
For consistency of your models, we're providing the following for the remainder of the year. Domestic revenues were $664.1 million, of which $637.1 million was regulated waste and compliance services revenues and $26.9 million was recall and returns. Domestic internal growth, excluding recalls and returns revenues, was up 1%, consisting of SQ up 1% and LQ flat. As anticipated, growth rates were impacted by SQ pricing pressure, lower hazardous waste volume from our industrial customers and lower fuel surcharges. 
International revenues were $226.1 million or 3% internal growth when adjusted for foreign exchange impact. As anticipated, international growth rates were impacted by the exiting of certain patient transportation contracts. Acquisitions contributed $184.7 million to growth in the quarter. Gross profits were $381 million or 42.8% of revenues. SG&A expense, excluding amortization was $189.3 million or 21.3% of revenues. Adjusted income from operations or EBITA was $191.7 million or 21.5% of revenues. Net interest expense was $24.7 million. Net income attributable to Stericycle was $61.5 million or $0.72 per share on an as-reported basis and $1.24 when adjusted for acquisition-related expenses and other adjustments. 
Now for the balance sheet. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.35 at the end of the quarter. The unused portion of the revolver at the end of the quarter was approximately $607 million. In the quarter, we repurchased 265,000 shares of the mandatory preferred convertible on the open market in the amount of $19.2 million. At the end of the quarter, we have authorization to purchase 3.1 million shares. Our CapEx was $33.8 million or 3.8% of revenues. Our DSO was 65 days. Year-to-date, as-reported, cash from operations was $417.8 million. And when adjusted for recall reimbursement and other items, cash from operations was $467.6 million.

Revenues from the 5 acquisitions were approximately $0.4 million in the quarter and annualized are approximately $4 million. Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust with well over $100 million in annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business. 
The SQ pricing pressure discussed previously continued in the quarter and will remain for the foreseeable future. To address these pressures, we are making incremental strategic investments in sales, marketing and data analytics. These investments will enable us to pinpoint and execute on opportunities to grow our business and improve our overall performance. 
Despite the SQ headwinds, we were able to maintain our operating margin profile as well as deliver positive revenue growth in other services. For example, in our hospital customer base, we successfully completed several large Sharps Management and pharmaceutical compliant installations. We saw strong growth in retail waste services, driven by our high level of service and detailed reporting capabilities. The combination of our customer relationships and our multiple compliance solutions provides a strong foundation for future growth. 
In the Secure Information Destruction Service, we continued to see strong sales resulting from the conversion of unvended customers to ongoing service. In addition, the national accounts team continues to make progress, securing new large customers. 
Our synergies remain on track with recent progress in streamlining back-office processes and implementing new technologies to optimize our inside sales and customer service. 
In closing, we would like to thank all of our worldwide team members for their continued commitment to our customers, our shareholders and our core values.

I would now like to provide insight on our current guidance for 2016 and preliminary guidance for 2017. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements and our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, integration and acquisition-related expenses and other adjusted items. 
As a reminder, our 2016 EPS guidance is adjusted for amortization expense. For 2016, we believe EPS will be in the range of $4.74 to $4.76. This includes the benefit of our ongoing strategy to repurchase our mandatory preferred convertible shares. 
We expect revenue for 2016 will be in the range of $3.56 billion to $3.58 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and the impact of foreign exchange rates. 
Internal growth rates are expected to be: SQ, 3% to 5%; LQ, 2% to 3%; international, 4% to 5%; and recall and returns revenues between $95 million and $105 million. We have estimates for free cash flow in 2016 between $450 million and $470 million. 2016 CapEx is anticipated to be between $130 million to $135 million. We expect the 2016 full year as-reported tax rate to be approximately 36%. 
Now I'd like to provide preliminary guidance for 2017. For 2017, we believe EPS estimates will be in the range of $4.57 to $4.77, using a share count of approximately 91.1 million. This includes the unfavorable impact of approximately $0.19 from the normalization of performance compensation and additional SG&A investments to drive future growth and profitability. This is partially offset by approximately $0.17 of benefit from our ongoing strategy to repurchase the mandatory preferred convertible shares. 
We believe revenues for 2017 will be in the range of $3.54 billion to $3.67 billion, depending on assumptions, on foreign exchange and internal rates of flat to 3%. The worldwide revenue guidance for each of our service lines is as follows: regulated waste and compliance services will be in the range of $2.03 billion to $2.09 billion; Secure Information Destruction Services will be in the range of $780 million to $810 million; communications and related services will be in the range of $340 million to $370 million, depending on recall revenues; and manufacturing and industrial services will be in the range of $380 million to $400 million. 
We have estimates for free cash flow in 2017 between $450 million to $470 million. 2017 CapEx is anticipated to be between $125 million to $150 million. We expect the 2017 full year as-reported tax rate to be approximately 36.5%. 
Stericycle continues to be the market leader in multiple services and geographies. We have a strong team and an unmatched infrastructure. We are confident in the long-term outlook of our business. 
As a reminder, Stericycle will be hosting its first Investor Day and webcast on the morning of Thursday, November 10, to share perspectives on Stericycle's strategies, capabilities and plans to drive long-term shareholder value.

So you're correct, those are some of the things that we're doing. It's just a little too early right now to see if that's having an effect."

As far as we did, we did raise guidance, though. For 2016, we raised it to $95 million to $105 million. That's simply because we saw a lot of activity towards the end of the quarter and it continued into Q4. So we thought it was best to raise guidance for 2016.

So just to be clear, we did -- none of this was from last quarter on the call. This is all new guidance for 2017. And what we did talk about in the $0.19, it's what we would call corporate expenses, and that's made up of really 2 buckets: it's performance compensation, which is roughly about half of that; and this is primarily related to cash flow and this is tied to specific performance goals. This performance compensation was only partially accrued for in 2016 results. And as our practice has been to accrue appropriate levels throughout the year based off real-time performance. As this is our initial guidance in 2017, we historically included a full-performance compensation in our guidance to reflect our expectation of not only achieving but exceeding our goals. The other half of that spend is really in SG&A investments for growth. And these would be in things such as IT to enhance our operational and financial systems as well as continued investments to support growth. Throughout the course of the year, we'll evaluate these projects and we'll adjust and release these funds where best appropriate. I think to your other question, Scott, was really about the $0.17 is purchasing the mandatory preferred convertible. What we've looked at and why we're purchasing that over the common is really it's the best use of cash being. That only gives us the best ability to reduce dilution by being able to buy more shares. But it also offsets 5.25% dividend rather than hang down 2% interest. We were very successful in doing that in Q3 in the -- you would see that we purchased about $0.07 of that. And so we really built that into our guidance going into next year. And even into Q4, we'll do a marginal amount. We set conservative guidance for next year because it really has to be a balance of how we're going to utilize all of our cash flow."

Remember, again, if you take a step back, SQ and LQ is not just our medical waste services, it describes our total business in the U.S. So when you see the decline in M&I, like we faced, most of that M&I work is falling into the LQ bucket. So when you look at LQ, where it was just less than 1% last quarter and flat to down a little bit this quarter, they're the ones taking the brunt of the M&I hit. As far as pricing pressure in the LQ side of the business, we're doing great on the LQ side of the business, to be honest with you, just look at just our medical waste services, Brent touched on it early on. We had really large installations in both Sharps and pharmaceutical waste installations from really large health care centers. The team is doing a really good job there. We've hit the ground running with respect to Secure Information disposal. So certainly, it's always been a category with respect to price, that's why the margin has always been lower than our SQ business. I don't see any changes at all. I think, it will always be a price sensitive. But we've done a really, really good job on our traditional hospital LQ business."

The results for the third quarter are as follows: Global revenues were $890.1 million, up 23.9% from $718.6 million in Q3 2015; and internal growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and manufacturing and industrial services was up 1.6%; domestic revenues were $664.1 million; excluding the impact of acquisitions and manufacturing and industrial revenues, internal growth was 1.6%. 
For consistency of your models, we're providing the following for the remainder of the year. Domestic revenues were $664.1 million, of which $637.1 million was regulated waste and compliance services revenues and $26.9 million was recall and returns. Domestic internal growth, excluding recalls and returns revenues, was up 1%, consisting of SQ up 1% and LQ flat. As anticipated, growth rates were impacted by SQ pricing pressure, lower hazardous waste volume from our industrial customers and lower fuel surcharges. 
International revenues were $226.1 million or 3% internal growth when adjusted for foreign exchange impact. As anticipated, international growth rates were impacted by the exiting of certain patient transportation contracts. Acquisitions contributed $184.7 million to growth in the quarter. Gross profits were $381 million or 42.8% of revenues. SG&A expense, excluding amortization was $189.3 million or 21.3% of revenues. Adjusted income from operations or EBITA was $191.7 million or 21.5% of revenues. Net interest expense was $24.7 million. Net income attributable to Stericycle was $61.5 million or $0.72 per share on an as-reported basis and $1.24 when adjusted for acquisition-related expenses and other adjustments. 
Now for the balance sheet. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.35 at the end of the quarter. The unused portion of the revolver at the end of the quarter was approximately $607 million. In the quarter, we repurchased 265,000 shares of the mandatory preferred convertible on the open market in the amount of $19.2 million. At the end of the quarter, we have authorization to purchase 3.1 million shares. Our CapEx was $33.8 million or 3.8% of revenues. Our DSO was 65 days. Year-to-date, as-reported, cash from operations was $417.8 million. And when adjusted for recall reimbursement and other items, cash from operations was $467.6 million.

These investments will enable us to pinpoint and execute on opportunities to grow our business and improve our overall performance. 
Despite the SQ headwinds, we were able to maintain our operating margin profile as well as deliver positive revenue growth in other services.

We saw strong growth in retail waste services, driven by our high level of service and detailed reporting capabilities. The combination of our customer relationships and our multiple compliance solutions provides a strong foundation for future growth. 
In the Secure Information Destruction Service, we continued to see strong sales resulting from the conversion of unvended customers to ongoing service. In addition, the national accounts team continues to make progress, securing new large customers. 
Our synergies remain on track with recent progress in streamlining back-office processes and implementing new technologies to optimize our inside sales and customer service. 
In closing, we would like to thank all of our worldwide team members for their continued commitment to our customers, our shareholders and our core values. 
I will now turn it over to Charlie."

I would now like to provide insight on our current guidance for 2016 and preliminary guidance for 2017. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements and our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, in",522,"Thank you, Brent. I would now like to provide insight on our current guidance for 2016 and preliminary guidance for 2017. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements and our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, integration and acquisition-related expenses and other adjusted items. 
As a reminder, our 2016 EPS guidance is adjusted for amortization expense. For 2016, we believe EPS will be in the range of $4.74 to $4.76. This includes the benefit of our ongoing strategy to repurchase our mandatory preferred convertible shares. 
We expect revenue for 2016 will be in the range of $3.56 billion to $3.58 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and the impact of foreign exchange rates. 
Internal growth rates are expected to be: SQ, 3% to 5%; LQ, 2% to 3%; international, 4% to 5%; and recall and returns revenues between $95 million and $105 million. We have estimates for free cash flow in 2016 between $450 million and $470 million. 2016 CapEx is anticipated to be between $130 million to $135 million. We expect the 2016 full year as-reported tax rate to be approximately 36%. 
Now I'd like to provide preliminary guidance for 2017. For 2017, we believe EPS estimates will be in the range of $4.57 to $4.77, using a share count of approximately 91.1 million. This includes the unfavorable impact of approximately $0.19 from the normalization of performance compensation and additional SG&A investments to drive future growth and profitability. This is partially offset by approximately $0.17 of benefit from our ongoing strategy to repurchase the mandatory preferred convertible shares. 
We believe revenues for 2017 will be in the range of $3.54 billion to $3.67 billion, depending on assumptions, on foreign exchange and internal rates of flat to 3%. The worldwide revenue guidance for each of our service lines is as follows: regulated waste and compliance services will be in the range of $2.03 billion to $2.09 billion; Secure Information Destruction Services will be in the range of $780 million to $810 million; communications and related services will be in the range of $340 million to $370 million, depending on recall revenues; and manufacturing and industrial services will be in the range of $380 million to $400 million. 
We have estimates for free cash flow in 2017 between $450 million to $470 million. 2017 CapEx is anticipated to be between $125 million to $150 million. We expect the 2017 full year as-reported tax rate to be approximately 36.5%. 
Stericycle continues to be the market leader in multiple services and geographies. We have a strong team and an unmatched infrastructure. We are confident in the long-term outlook of our business. 
As a reminder, Stericycle will be hosting its first Investor Day and webcast on the morning of Thursday, November 10, to share perspectives on Stericycle's strategies, capabilities and plans to drive long-term shareholder value. More details are posted on the Events page of our Investor Relations website. We encourage investors, analysts and the public to join the live webcast or watch the meeting replay.

And listen, that's why we're trying to get away from SQ, LQ, right? Because we've got 20% of our SQ customers that are owned by LQ. So they are not truly SQ, because they're not independently making decisions. But I think we have a good handle on the SQ business and the different buckets. And then as to Brent's point, we'll use data analytics that help us get through how we should look at pricing. Maybe we don't have to discount as much if we're proactive. Maybe we throw in additional services and we can work through that. But obviously, we're going to make some investments to make smart decisions on that SQ business for us."

As far as we did, we did raise guidance, though. For 2016, we raised it to $95 million to $105 million.

So just to be clear, we did -- none of this was from last quarter on the call. This is all new guidance for 2017. And what we did talk about in the $0.19, it's what we would call corporate expenses, and that's made up of really 2 buckets: it's performance compensation, which is roughly about half of that; and this is primarily related to cash flow and this is tied to specific performance goals. This performance compensation was only partially accrued for in 2016 results. And as our practice has been to accrue appropriate levels throughout the year based off real-time performance. As this is our initial guidance in 2017, we historically included a full-performance compensation in our guidance to reflect our expectation of not only achieving but exceeding our goals. The other half of that spend is really in SG&A investments for growth. And these would be in things such as IT to enhance our operational and financial systems as well as continued investments to support growth. Throughout the course of the year, we'll evaluate these projects and we'll adjust and release these funds where best appropriate. I think to your other question, Scott, was really about the $0.17 is purchasing the mandatory preferred convertible. What we've looked at and why we're purchasing that over the common is really it's the best use of cash being. That only gives us the best ability to reduce dilution by being able to buy more shares.

As far as pricing pressure in the LQ side of the business, we're doing great on the LQ side of the business, to be honest with you, just look at just our medical waste services, Brent touched on it early on. We had really large installations in both Sharps and pharmaceutical waste installations from really large health care centers. The team is doing a really good job there.

Factors that could cause such differences include: changes in governmental regulation of the collection, transportation, treatment and disposal of regulated waste or the proper handling and protection of personal and confidential information; increases in transportation and other operating costs; the level of governmental enforcement of regulations governing regulated waste collection and treatment or the proper handling and protection of personal and confidential information; our obligations to service our substantial indebtedness and to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our private placement notes, term loan credit facility and revolving credit facility; our ability to execute our acquisition strategy and to integrate acquired businesses; competition and demand for services in the regulated waste and Secure Information Destruction industries; political, economic and currency risks related to our foreign operations; impairments of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangibles; variability in the demand for services we provide on a project or nonrecurring basis; exposure to environmental liabilities; fluctuations in the price we receive for the sale of paper; disruptions in or attacks on our information technology systems; compliance with existing and future legal and regulatory requirements; as well as other factors described in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K/A.

The results for the third quarter are as follows: Global revenues were $890.1 million, up 23.9% from $718.6 million in Q3 2015; and internal growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and manufacturing and industrial services was up 1.6%; domestic revenues were $664.1 million; excluding the impact of acquisitions and manufacturing and industrial revenues, internal growth was 1.6%. 
For consistency of your models, we're providing the following for the remainder of the year. Domestic revenues were $664.1 million, of which $637.1 million was regulated waste and compliance services revenues and $26.9 million was recall and returns. Domestic internal growth, excluding recalls and returns revenues, was up 1%, consisting of SQ up 1% and LQ flat. As anticipated, growth rates were impacted by SQ pricing pressure, lower hazardous waste volume from our industrial customers and lower fuel surcharges. 
International revenues were $226.1 million or 3% internal growth when adjusted for foreign exchange impact. As anticipated, international growth rates were impacted by the exiting of certain patient transportation contracts. Acquisitions contributed $184.7 million to growth in the quarter. Gross profits were $381 million or 42.8% of revenues. SG&A expense, excluding amortization was $189.3 million or 21.3% of revenues. Adjusted income from operations or EBITA was $191.7 million or 21.5% of revenues. Net interest expense was $24.7 million. Net income attributable to Stericycle was $61.5 million or $0.72 per share on an as-reported basis and $1.24 when adjusted for acquisition-related expenses and other adjustments. 
Now for the balance sheet. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.35 at the end of the quarter. The unused portion of the revolver at the end of the quarter was approximately $607 million. In the quarter, we repurchased 265,000 shares of the mandatory preferred convertible on the open market in the amount of $19.2 million. At the end of the quarter, we have authorization to purchase 3.1 million shares. Our CapEx was $33.8 million or 3.8% of revenues. Our DSO was 65 days. Year-to-date, as-reported, cash from operations was $417.8 million. And when adjusted for recall reimbursement and other items, cash from operations was $467.6 million.

Revenues from the 5 acquisitions were approximately $0.4 million in the quarter and annualized are approximately $4 million. Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust with well over $100 million in annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business. 
The SQ pricing pressure discussed previously continued in the quarter and will remain for the foreseeable future. To address these pressures, we are making incremental strategic investments in sales, marketing and data analytics. These investments will enable us to pinpoint and execute on opportunities to grow our business and improve our overall performance. 
Despite the SQ headwinds, we were able to maintain our operating margin profile as well as deliver positive revenue growth in other services. For example, in our hospital customer base, we successfully completed several large Sharps Management and pharmaceutical compliant installations. We saw strong growth in retail waste services, driven by our high level of service and detailed reporting capabilities. The combination of our customer relationships and our multiple compliance solutions provides a strong foundation for future growth. 
In the Secure Information Destruction Service, we continued to see strong sales resulting from the conversion of unvended customers to ongoing service. In addition, the national accounts team continues to make progress, securing new large customers. 
Our synergies remain on track with recent progress in streamlining back-office processes and implementing new technologies to optimize our inside sales and customer service. 
In closing, we would like to thank all of our worldwide team members for their continued commitment to our customers, our shareholders and our core values.

I would now like to provide insight on our current guidance for 2016 and preliminary guidance for 2017. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements and our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, integration and acquisition-related expenses and other adjusted items. 
As a reminder, our 2016 EPS guidance is adjusted for amortization expense. For 2016, we believe EPS will be in the range of $4.74 to $4.76. This includes the benefit of our ongoing strategy to repurchase our mandatory preferred convertible shares. 
We expect revenue for 2016 will be in the range of $3.56 billion to $3.58 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and the impact of foreign exchange rates. 
Internal growth rates are expected to be: SQ, 3% to 5%; LQ, 2% to 3%; international, 4% to 5%; and recall and returns revenues between $95 million and $105 million. We have estimates for free cash flow in 2016 between $450 million and $470 million. 2016 CapEx is anticipated to be between $130 million to $135 million. We expect the 2016 full year as-reported tax rate to be approximately 36%. 
Now I'd like to provide preliminary guidance for 2017. For 2017, we believe EPS estimates will be in the range of $4.57 to $4.77, using a share count of approximately 91.1 million. This includes the unfavorable impact of approximately $0.19 from the normalization of performance compensation and additional SG&A investments to drive future growth and profitability. This is partially offset by approximately $0.17 of benefit from our ongoing strategy to repurchase the mandatory preferred convertible shares. 
We believe revenues for 2017 will be in the range of $3.54 billion to $3.67 billion, depending on assumptions, on foreign exchange and internal rates of flat to 3%. The worldwide revenue guidance for each of our service lines is as follows: regulated waste and compliance services will be in the range of $2.03 billion to $2.09 billion; Secure Information Destruction Services will be in the range of $780 million to $810 million; communications and related services will be in the range of $340 million to $370 million, depending on recall revenues; and manufacturing and industrial services will be in the range of $380 million to $400 million. 
We have estimates for free cash flow in 2017 between $450 million to $470 million. 2017 CapEx is anticipated to be between $125 million to $150 million. We expect the 2017 full year as-reported tax rate to be approximately 36.5%. 
Stericycle continues to be the market leader in multiple services and geographies. We have a strong team and an unmatched infrastructure. We are confident in the long-term outlook of our business. 
As a reminder, Stericycle will be hosting its first Investor Day and webcast on the morning of Thursday, November 10, to share perspectives on Stericycle's strategies, capabilities and plans to drive long-term shareholder value.

The team actually has had a really busy quarter this quarter as we looked to automate and integrate all of our customer service. So we put them all on a national platform. We're in the process of doing that. This quarter, we're doing the same thing with inside sales. We also have kicked off automation for several of our back-office processes, around collection, cash applications as well as AP.

On the international, I mean, we discussed this previously, I think. What's driving some negative impact in the international markets certainly is the LatAm pricing pressures and our patient transport business, so let me address those separately. On the patient transport business, we continue to exit certain contracts. Once we do that, we'll evaluate the strategic value of this business. We anticipate exiting or contract ending in 2017. So the 2017 revenue for patient transport will be roughly USD 50 million to USD 60 million. And then on the LatAm, certainly, we're facing inflation and pricing pressure on our large government contracts, and we're looking at this on a contract-by-contract basis. So if you just take our sequential Q2 to Q3, we saw a modest increase on the EBITDA line -- EBITA line. So we've made a little progress, but there's more work to be done. Right now, the focus is on Latin America and the patient transport business."

There's been no change in that business. Obviously, there's preferential pricing in there with contract, good contract Ts and Cs. So that really does not impact and, in fact, we're having a great renewal year on our national accounts. And then the remainder would be all of the SQ that are not affiliated with any large group or hospital or national account.

And listen, that's why we're trying to get away from SQ, LQ, right? Because we've got 20% of our SQ customers that are owned by LQ. So they are not truly SQ, because they're not independently making decisions. But I think we have a good handle on the SQ business and the different buckets.

As far as we did, we did raise guidance, though. For 2016, we raised it to $95 million to $105 million. That's simply because we saw a lot of activity towards the end of the quarter and it continued into Q4. So we thought it was best to raise guidance for 2016.

So just to be clear, we did -- none of this was from last quarter on the call. This is all new guidance for 2017. And what we did talk about in the $0.19, it's what we would call corporate expenses, and that's made up of really 2 buckets: it's performance compensation, which is roughly about half of that; and this is primarily related to cash flow and this is tied to specific performance goals. This performance compensation was only partially accrued for in 2016 results. And as our practice has been to accrue appropriate levels throughout the year based off real-time performance. As this is our initial guidance in 2017, we historically included a full-performance compensation in our guidance to reflect our expectation of not only achieving but exceeding our goals. The other half of that spend is really in SG&A investments for growth. And these would be in things such as IT to enhance our operational and financial systems as well as continued investments to support growth. Throughout the course of the year, we'll evaluate these projects and we'll adjust and release these funds where best appropriate. I think to your other question, Scott, was really about the $0.17 is purchasing the mandatory preferred convertible. What we've looked at and why we're purchasing that over the common is really it's the best use of cash being. That only gives us the best ability to reduce dilution by being able to buy more shares. But it also offsets 5.25% dividend rather than hang down 2% interest. We were very successful in doing that in Q3 in the -- you would see that we purchased about $0.07 of that. And so we really built that into our guidance going into next year. And even into Q4, we'll do a marginal amount. We set conservative guidance for next year because it really has to be a balance of how we're going to utilize all of our cash flow."

So I don't think there's been any change to the dynamic there. I think the one thing that has changed and you see it in the press, you see it all over that, health care is faced with reimbursement cuts. So they're getting less fees for their service. And now for the first time, I think they're looking at any way they can save even a little money. So our contracts, I think, fell below the radar, we were getting more attention there and that's why we're seeing the discounting in that marketplace. I think it's -- the competition, though, I will tell you, from a market by market, I would tell you, hasn't changed much in the last couple of years."

Certainly, you have the synergies that will be only partially offsetting the price concessions we'll have next year. So -- and then the growth that doesn't come through at the same percent, that pricing goes out. So you're going to see a little bit of pricing there -- profitability headwind. We're also going to be experiencing some FX, exiting of patient contract that can temporarily affect margins until you're fully out of that. And then we are going to make investments in the business. And that's important that we do that for the things Charlie and Brent talked about. In those investments, we know we'll bring return over the long term. But initially at the beginning of the year, those investments will be really investments to set that infrastructure and that stage to be able to grow the business.
