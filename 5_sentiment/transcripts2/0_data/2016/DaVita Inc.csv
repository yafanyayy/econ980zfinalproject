This will be a pretty high density call, and I'll be covering more topics than normal because of some of the nuances contained therein. As usual, I will first talk about our clinical outcomes because that is what comes first. Second, for each major business unit, I'll talk about the operating performance for the quarter and year-end, provide some thoughts on '16. Third, we'll then step back on each business briefly and on the enterprise overall to try to set the table for our Capital Markets Day coming up on May 18, in New York City. And then lastly, I'll talk about enterprise capital allocation.
So let's launch right in since there's quite a bit to cover. On the clinical outcome front, excellent news once again. Kidney care, 97% of our patients with a Kt/V of 1.2 or greater, 73% of patients with fistula placed for access. And with recently final results announced for the CMS the program for another year period, once again we outperformed the rest of the community with only 1.4% of our facilities facing a penalty compared to 7.1% for the rest of the industry. Of course, no quality rating system is perfect, but in rating tests after rating tests, we come out as clinically differentiated. 
On the HCP front, equally promising results. With respect to HEDIS clinical metrics, the District of Nevada this time, we try to move it around for you geographically. And in terms of subject matter, we once again the Medicare fee-for-service benchmark on all metrics, then have 4 or 5 star across all MA patients on all non-HEDIS metrics. So in both cases, both main sides of the house, our outcomes compared very favorably to national averages. This is good for patients. This is good for the taxpayer.
Now let's move on to the quarter and the year. We'll hit HCP first; international, second; kidney care, third.
HCP operating performance for the quarter, $25 million. That excluded the estimated writedown. This was within our guidance range. On a normalized basis, this was actually about $37 million, if you normalize for a prior period adjustments, et cetera, which actually is about exactly the same amount of profit in Q4 of 2014 normalized.
For the full year, [indiscernible] approved, as you know, from $215 million to $240 million, which is also within our guidance although at the low end. In order to achieve that, the legacy markets were up a bit, the new markets were up a bit. And the combination of those bits was more than enough to make a for the medical cost inflation and some very substantial investments and capability building/G&A, and BJ Cotey, our new HCP CFO, will discuss those investments and capabilities in G&A in more detail in just a few minutes.
But I will certainly move right on our 2016 guidance for HCP. It is $175 million to $225 million. There are 3 primary drivers of that range. Driver number  one, $58 million in reimbursement cuts. This is primarily the result of the new acuity coding RAF model being implementation to final trunk of the way, 100% implemented as of that time. As previously discussed, the HCP was more comprehensive in its coding capture. Complete diagnosis of patient condition is a good thing, but also left the entity far more vulnerable to any coding reimbursement compression. So $58 million from that source, most of it the model and the model's now 100%. And second the driver of that range is our investment in additional capabilities. 
There's 2 components to this $60 million year-over-year increase. Component A is really remedial, with their prior business leadership essentially stopped investing in the company. It was working to maximize profitability for the sale, either knowingly or unknowingly. And as a side note, I just want to remind you that we knew that. That is why we only paid a 6x multiple in a world where there are allegedly comparable assets were going for 9x to 10x than in now much greater than 10x in the market. 
And the second component of that big G&A capability investment is offensive. Meaning investments that we think that are going to create significant competitive advantage for us over time. 
The third primary driver is the positive one, which offsets a big chunk of those 2 negative ones: Solid operating performance. Good old solid operating performance. So if you look at the math, you have a $58 million hit from the -- essentially the completion of the RAF model. You have a $60 million hit from the increased investment in G&A, half remedial, half offensive. That would equal $118 million hit. You then have a $78 million operating performance improvement, which offsets all but $40 million of the 2 negative trends. And that yields the change from the $240 million in 2015 OI [ph] to the midpoint of the guidance $200 million for 2016. We can, of course, take questions on all of that, but those are the 3 primary drivers. 
2017 does look better than 2016. The model will be behind us, and we continue to make steady progress on our capabilities and our contracting. If we put the P&L aside for a moment and look at cash flow and take other scenario, the midpoint of our guidance. In other words, the $200 million for HCP and simultaneously take the midpoint of our guidance for the total enterprise, that $200 million would equal 11% of total enterprise operating income.
However, HCP operating cash flow is projected to be over $400 million, about 25% of total enterprise operating cash flow. This happens because of what we've talked about in the past. The low working capital intensity, low CapEx requirements and $100 million per year hard dollar cash tax benefit.
If we step back for a moment and look back at 3 difficult years, the total reimbursement cuts from the implementation of the new RAF model for us, $165 million. What we had anticipated was a much smaller number than that. In fact, less than half. So about $100 million of incremental P&L harm that we had not expected is due to that single variable, $100 million. Now the fact that it came from that does not make it any less painful than as it came from anything else, but the important message is it did not come from operating problems or operating issues.
Looking forward, instead of backward, we have 6 primary markets: California, Nevada, Florida, New Mexico, Colorado and Washington and more particular, the Seattle area. In those primary markets, we have 6 leading independent medical groups. It is in those places, plus our joint venture, Tandigm in Philadelphia, of course, but that is a horse of a different color. That is where we'll be placing was of our emphasis in the near and perhaps intermediate term. Prices are very high rate that for variable properties. Our bandwidth is pretty stretched given how much we've grown and given how much opportunity we have in those 6 markets, plus with Tandigm.
And then third, we need to prove to you that we can get the right returns and margins in a number of those places before we do too many other significant things. Because of all that, it is unlikely we will do in the other big Everett-like deal, unless it is through a capital-like transaction or is for a very attractive multiple. 
Other good news to take into account and looking forward instead of backward, a list of few of them, each of a different type. First, our legacy markets in 2015 once again outgrew the markets in terms of MA growth. The markets grew 6%. We grew 9%.
Number two, we've dramatically improved patient service metrics since the time of the transaction.
Number three, we've had a number of significant IT advances that it improved our support for our frontline physicians. We have a long journey there, and BJ will talk about that a little more, but we've got some nice early momentum and victories and better supporting our frontline physicians.
Number four, we've had a number of forecasting and prior project period adjustment issues. You now that painful truth as we do. Our finance leadership team is literally 90% new.
And fifth and finally in this case, if you look at our top 22 executives, we have 5 great veterans with immense amounts of valuable ACP experience and 17 new executives that we think are the right people to help take us into that next chapter going forward.
So that's in on HCP for now. Although BJ will come back and talk about some of those capability and G&A investments a little bit later.
Let's move onto international. We underperformed in 2015. $55 million in losses compared to original $40 million of guidance. Why? Well, we had a $5 million AR reserve, which almost entirely came from 1 country where there were 2 fiscal intermediaries that became unsolved. We actually hope to get a bunch of that money back. We also are $10 million behind plan or were $10 million behind plan in 2 countries, where we built new centers and patient growth was behind plan.
In 2016 for international, our guidance is losses of approximately $40 million. This assumes no unusual AR reserves. We are experiencing payment delays with the Saudi government, and that's a watch out but we have done nothing on that front now. We still expect to receive all of the funds. And the good news is the Ministry of Health in Saudi is explicitly very happy with our service and very impressed by the patient feedback they have received. They're words, not ours.
In 2017, we anticipate improvement over '16 on an OI basis. And in 2018, in international dialysis on our current country portfolio, we expect to achieve breakeven. We are, in fact, already in 2015, or we did already in 2015, generate positive aggregate EBITDA at the clinic level in 8 out of our 10 countries as we continue to grow and cover our G&A. In another reference point, that gives you a sense of the per country scale. In 2014, we had an average of $10 million revenue per country. 2015, an increase of 50% or up to $15 [ph] million. 2016, if we hit our plan, we'll be $27 million in revenue per country. So you can see that at reasonable margins, we are making strong progress in covering the fixed amount of a global G&A.
Finally, most of our growth internationally has been through acquisitions. Virtually, every 1 of those acquisitions has been completed for with others. And so these are market-valuable assets that real competition wanted to have. And our competitors continue to invest in growing internationally as well because of the returns they see. Stepping back for a moment with respect to international, we are still very bullish on the long-term opportunity of the kidney care and other healthcare services.
Now onto the kidney care operating performance. Once again, strong quarter, strong year. Operating income, 4 49. And then for the year 1.658. First number was for the quarter. Of course, once again excluding some non-recurring stuff. Jim Hilger will provide more details on the numbers. I'll go right into the guidance. 
We anticipate in 2016 another solid year, 1.625 to 1.725. Of course, there's always risks we'll fall short and there's always hope that we will exceed this guidance for our normal customs does include the international economics and it also includes the unfortunate fact of flat Medicare reimbursement for the third straight year.
The uncertainty in our 2016 performance, as in many recent years, it centers on revenue and revenue per treatment. We anticipate our performance in the first half of the year with respect to RPT to be positive, but we have a lot less visibility into the second half of the year, hence, the broadest of the range. 
And regarding the strategic initiatives, there could be some earnings volatility there. One reason is ESCOs, as you know we have launched, and so we incur those costs particularly those extra startup costs now, and we get the shared savings payment later if we perform and the data is correct. Now the second variable are some RX, the lead RX renewals. All this, of course, is incorporated into our guidance.
Stepping back now with respect to kidney care and looking out 3, 4, 5 years, is one big downside and 3 attractive upsides. The big downside is what will happen to private pay? It is unfortunate that we have a large cost shift in our dialysis industry in America with private patients paying a lot more to subsidize the 80% to 90% of our patients that are Medicare and Medicaid. And when you put that on top of payer consolidation, distributed risk pools, exchanges and other things going on, it will not be prudent to not be nervous about what will happen with private pay.
On the other hand, we do have 3 upsides. One is in the ESA market. For the long term, as many of you know, we spend about $800 million per year on ESAs. We are intensely looking for the light long-term partner or partners in the of the consummate some type of long-term partnership well before the expiration of our current contract at the end of 2018.
Second, integrated kidney care. We are very competent at this. Regardless of who has the risks, we think we will be one of the subcontractors of choice.
And third, finally, the flat Medicare reimbursement is scheduled to go away at the end of 2018. In 2019, we hope to be back to our normal market basket. All in all, our strategic position in U.S. kidney care is strong.
Now let's step back to the enterprise overall. The guidance OI of $1.8 billion to $1.95 billion. OCF, $1.55 billion to $1.75 billion. But on unequally important topic, how are we thinking about capital allocation at the enterprise level? Well, first, with kidney care, we stayed the course. And since there aren't a lot of large properties available out there, that means they will not use all the cash they generate. 
HCP, they will focus on existing markets, unless something that is capital light or very attractive multiple comes along. International, we will continue to invest to grow. Putting all 3 of those together, what does our capital allocation look like if you pick something arbitrary like the next 3-year period? We will generate, in a reasonable scenario, with, of course, downside risks and upside, but in the reasonable scenario, we will generate operating cash flow of approximately $5.5 billion in the next 3 years. If you count normal use, meaning our current operating plans, business plans, et cetera, which of course could change, we will use about $3.5 billion for those purposes. This leaves about $2 billion on the side for us to contemplate what to do with, with, of course, your counsel as well as we compare other growth opportunities to debt repayment opportunities to share repurchase opportunities. 
Now BJ Cotey, our new CFO of Healthcare Partners, will walk through a few more details."

I'll take 2 minutes to provide more detail into the investments we're making into the future. As Kent stated before, we are continuing to make both remedial and offensive investments into the business. The best way to look at these items is to put 2015 and 2016 together. When you do that, we have a total of approximately $80 million in incremental investments over 2014. To provide more context into these investments, I'll put them into 3 primary buckets. 
First, we have information technology. Second, legal and compliance. And third, the next-generation capability and change management.
In the bucket of IT, we plan to spend $40 million more in '16 than we did in 2014. This includes the following areas: First, security; second, application to support population health; third, community portal to enhance munication between patients and providers and enterprise data warehouse, our accounting system conversion and a national IT infrastructure to enable our creation of one company. 
Next, in the legal and compliance bucket, we will invest an additional $10 million to $15 million over 2014. In our final bucket, we're investing approximately $18 million into research and development related to next-generation care management capabilities, a team we call catalysts, with applications to our current markets as well as others.
Now Jim Hilger, our CFO, will walk you through a few more details on the numbers in the quarter."

First, I'd like to point out a couple of non-GAAP items in the quarter. In the fourth quarter, we recorded an estimated accrual of $23 million for potential damages and liabilities in our DaVita RX pharmacy business. We have excluded these numbers from our reported non-GAAP into for Mark continuing operations. 
A few words about this estimated accrual. The reserves relate to the period from 2010 through 2015. As a part of our normal process, last spring, we initiated an internal complaint review of DaVita RX, during which we identified potential billing and operational issues. We notified the government in September of 2015 that we were conducting this review of DaVita RX and began providing regular updates of our review. Upon completion of our review, we filed a self disclosure with the OIG in February -- on February 5, 2016, and we have been working to address and update the practices were identified in the self-disclosure. 
In addition, as disclosed earlier today, on February 5, 2016, DaVita Rx received a civil investigative demand from the U.S. Attorney's office. The information requested has some overlap with the items we self disclosed. And we do not know that the U.S. Attorney new we are already in the process of developing a self-disclosure with the OIG.
At HCP, we took an estimated $206 million impairment charge of non-cash goodwill and an intangible asset of certain healthcare partner operating units. These impairments were driven primarily by the underperformance of the business reporting units in recent quarters as well as changes in other market conditions including government reimbursement cuts and are expected ability to mitigate those cuts.
The final amount of these impairment charges will depend upon the final outcome of this valuation work, which we expect to be completed in the first quarter of 2016. This noncash charge will not impact go forward performance or our cash taxes.
Onto the overall enterprise. Our debt expense was $103 million in the fourth quarter, which is a good run rate for a debt expense in future quarters. Our income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $40 million.
Next, our effective tax rate. For income attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners in the fourth quarter was 36% and for the year was 38.2%. And we expect the full year tax rate for 2016 to be in the range of 40% to 41%.
We have also repurchased $151 million of our common stock in the fourth quarter, and we also repurchased an additional $249 million in the month of January. As a result of these transactions, we now have approximately $259 million remaining under our current board authorization.
As you think about modeling the first quarter, here are a few things that you should keep in mind: In our dialysis business, Q1 2015 contains -- or '16 contains 1 fewer day than this past quarter. So you should expect lower revenues and higher fixed costs per treatment. Second, our payroll tax caps reset at the beginning of the year, which leads to higher cost of $1 to $1.50 per treatment. At HCP, OI fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter due to the seasonal needs of patients and, Q1 and tends to be a bit lighter than the full year average.
Now turning to cash flow. We continue to generate strong cash flows as operating cash flow was $437 million in the fourth quarter and $1.861 billion for all of 2015, excluding the Vainer settlement. The strong cash flows in 2015 are borrowing a bit from 2016 operating cash flow, mostly due to the timing of cash tax payments and other working capital items. But despite that, we still expect 2016 operating cash flow to be $1.55 billion to $1.75 billion, showing that we continue to generate strong cash flows. As always, this guidance range captures a majority of probabilistic outcomes, but we could be above or below this range. 
And with that, operator, let's go ahead and open it up for Q&A."

This will be a pretty high-density call, and I'll be covering more topics than normal because of some of the nuances contained therein. As usual, I will first talk about our clinical outcomes because that is what comes first. Second, for each major business unit, I'll talk about the operating performance for the quarter and year-end, provide some thoughts on '16. Third, we'll then step back on each business briefly, and on the enterprise overall to try to set the table for our Capital Markets Day coming up on May 18, in New York City. And then lastly, I'll talk about enterprise capital allocation.
So let's launch right in since there's quite a bit to cover. On the clinical outcome front, excellent news, once again. Kidney care, 97% of our patients with a Kt/V of 1.2 or greater, 73% of patients with fistula placed for access. And then recently, final results announced for the CMS QUIP program for another year period, once again, we outperformed the rest of the community with only 1.4% of our facilities facing a penalty compared to 7.1% for the rest of the industry. Of course, no quality rating system is perfect, but in rating test after rating tests, we come out as clinically differentiated. 
On the HCP front, equally promising results. With respect to HEDIS clinical metrics, we'll just pick at this time. We try to move it around for you geographically. And in terms of subject matter, we, once again, exceeded the Medicare fee-for-service benchmark on all metrics, then had 4 or 5 star across all MA patients on all non-HEDIS metrics. So in both cases, both main sides of the house, our outcomes compare very favorably to national averages. This is good for patients. This is good for the taxpayer.
Now let's move on to the quarter and the year. We'll hit HCP first; international, second; kidney care, third.
HCP operating performance for the quarter, $25 million. That excluded the estimated write-down. This was within our guidance range. On a normalized basis, this was actually about $37 million, if you normalize for prior period adjustment, et cetera, which actually is about exactly the same amount of profit in Q4 of 2014 normalized.
For the full year, while improved, as you know, from $215 million to $240 million, which is also within our guidance, although at the low end. In order to achieve that, the legacy markets were up a bit. The new markets were up a bit. And the combination of those bits was more than enough to make up for the medical cost inflation and some very substantial investments and capability building/G&A. And Vijay Kotte, our new HCP CFO, will discuss those investments and capabilities in G&A in more detail in just a few minutes.
But I will certainly move right on to 2016 guidance for HCP. It is $175 million to $225 million. There are 3 primary drivers of that range. Driver number  one, $58 million in reimbursement cuts. This is primarily the result of the new acuity coding RAF model being implementation to final trunk of the way, 100% implemented as of that time. As previously discussed, the HCP was more comprehensive in its coding capture. Complete diagnosis of patient conditions is a good thing, but it also left the entity far more vulnerable to any coding reimbursement compression. So $58 million from that source, most of it, the model, and the model is now 100%. And second the driver of that range is our investment in additional capabilities. 
There's 2 components to this $60 million year-over-year increase. Component A is really remedial. Their prior business leadership essentially stopped investing in the company. It was working to maximize profitability for the sale, either knowingly or unknowingly. And as a side note, I just want to remind you that we knew that. That is why we only paid a 6x multiple in a world where there are allegedly comparable assets were going for 9x to 10x than in now much greater than 10x in the market. 
And the second component of that big G&A capability investment is offensive, meaning investments that we think that are going to create significant competitive advantage for us over time. 
The third primary driver is the positive one, which offsets a big chunk of those 2 negative ones: Solid operating performance, good old solid operating performance. So if you look at the math, you have a $58 million hit from the -- essentially the completion of the RAF model. You have a $60 million hit from the increased investment in G&A, half remedial, half offensive. That would equal $118 million hit. You then have a $78 million operating performance improvement, which offsets all but $40 million of the 2 negative trends. And that yields the change from the $240 million in 2015 OI to the midpoint of the guidance, $200 million for 2016. We can, of course, take questions on all of that, but those are the 3 primary drivers. 
2017 does look better than 2016. The model will be behind us, and we continue to make steady progress on our capabilities and our contracting. If we put the P&L aside for a moment and look at cash flow and take as a scenario the midpoint of our guidance, in other words, the $200 million for HCP, and simultaneously take the midpoint of our guidance for the total enterprise, that $200 million would equal 11% of total enterprise operating income.
However, HCP operating cash flow is projected to be over $400 million, about 25% of total enterprise operating cash flow. This happens because of what we've talked about in the past, low working capital intensity, low CapEx requirements and $100 million per year hard dollar cash tax benefit.
If we step back for a moment and look back at 3 difficult years, the total reimbursement cut from the implementation of the new RAF model for us, $165 million. What we had anticipated was a much smaller number than that. In fact, less than half. So about $100 million of incremental P&L harm that we had not expected is due to that single variable, $100 million. Now the fact that it came from that does not make it any less painful than if it came from anything else, but the important message is it did not come from operating problems or operating issues.
Looking forward, instead of backward, we have 6 primary markets: California, Nevada, Florida, New Mexico, Colorado and Washington, and more particular, the Seattle area. In those primary markets, we have 6 leading independent medical groups. It is in those places, plus our joint venture, Tandigm in Philadelphia, of course, but that is a horse of a different color, that is where we'll be placing most of our emphasis in the near and perhaps intermediate term. Prices are very high right now for variable properties. Our bandwidth is pretty stretched given how much we've grown and given how much opportunity we have in those 6 markets, plus with Tandigm.
And then third, we need to prove to you that we can get the right returns and margins in a number of those places before we do too many other significant things. Because of all that, it is unlikely we will do in the other big Everett-like deal, unless it is through a capital-light transaction or is for a very attractive multiple. 
Other good news to take into account, and looking forward instead of backward, a list of few of them, each of a different type. First, our legacy markets in 2015, once again, outgrew the markets in terms of MA growth. The markets grew 6%. We grew 9%.
Number two, we've dramatically improved patient service metrics since the time of the transaction.
Number three, we've had a number of significant IT advances that it improved our support for our frontline physicians. We have a long journey there, and BJ will talk about that a little more, but we've got some nice early momentum and victories in better supporting our frontline physicians.
Number four, we've had a number of forecasting and prior project period adjustment issues. You now that painful truth as we do. Our finance leadership team is literally 90% new.
And fifth, and finally, in this case, if you look at our top 22 executives, we have 5 great veterans with immense amounts of valuable ACP experience and 17 new executives that we think are the right people to help take us into that next chapter going forward.
So that's it on HCP for now, although BJ will come back and talk about some of those capability and G&A investments a little bit later.
Let's move onto international. We underperformed in 2015. $55 million in losses compared to original $40 million of guidance. Why? Well, we had a $5 million AR reserve, which almost entirely came from one country where there were 2 fiscal intermediaries that became insolvent. We actually hope to get a bunch of that money back. We also are $10 million behind plan or were $10 million behind plan in 2 countries where we built new centers and patient growth was behind plan.
In 2016, for international, our guidance is losses of approximately $40 million. This assumes no unusual AR reserves. We are experiencing payment delays with the Saudi government, so that's a watch-out, but we have done nothing on that front now. We still expect to receive all of the funds. And the good news is the Ministry of Health in Saudi is explicitly very happy with our service and very impressed by the patient feedback they have received. Their words, not ours.
In 2017, we anticipate improvement over '16 on an OI basis. And in 2018, in international dialysis, on our current country portfolio, we expect to achieve breakeven. We are, in fact, already in 2015, or we did already in 2015, generate positive aggregate EBITDA at the clinic level in 8 out of our 10 countries as we continue to grow and cover our G&A. In another reference point, that gives you a sense of the per-country scale. In 2014, we had an average of $10 million revenue per country. 2015, an increase of 50% or up to $15 million. 2016, if we hit our plan, we'll be $27 million in revenue per country. So you can see that at reasonable margins, we are making strong progress in covering the fixed amount of global G&A.
Finally, most of our growth internationally has been through acquisition. Virtually, every one of those acquisitions has been competed for with others. And so these are market-valuable assets that real competition wanted to have. And our competitors continue to invest in growing internationally as well because of the returns they see. Stepping back for a moment, with respect to international, we are still very bullish on the long-term opportunity of the kidney care and other healthcare services.
Now onto the kidney care operating performance. Once again, strong quarter, strong year. Operating income, $449 million. And then for the year, $1.658 billion. First number was for the quarter, of course, once again excluding some non-recurring stuff. Jim Hilger will provide more details on the numbers. I'll go right into guidance. 
We anticipate, in 2016, another solid year, $1.625 million to $1.725 billion. Of course, there's always risks we'll fall short and there's always hope that we will exceed. This guidance, for our normal customs, does include the international economics and it also includes the unfortunate fact of flat Medicare reimbursement for the third straight year.
The uncertainty in our 2016 performance, as in many recent years, it centers on revenue and revenue per treatment. We anticipate our performance in the first half of the year with respect to RPT to be positive, but we have a lot less visibility into the second half of the year, hence, the broadest of the range. 
And regarding the strategic initiatives, there could be some earnings volatility there. One reason is ESCOs, as you know we have launched, and so we incur those costs, particularly those extra startup costs now, and we get the shared savings payment later if we perform and the data is correct. Now the second variable are some RX, to be the RX renewals. All of this, of course, is incorporated into our guidance.
Stepping back now with respect to kidney care and looking out 3, 4, 5 years, is one big downside and 3 attractive upsides. The big downside is what will happen to private pay? It is unfortunate that we have a large cost shift in our dialysis industry in America with private patients paying a lot more to subsidize the 80% to 90% of our patients that are Medicare and Medicaid. And when you put that on top of payer consolidation, distributed risk pools, exchanges and other things going on, it would not be prudent to not be nervous about what will happen with private pay.
On the other hand, we do have 3 upsides. One is in the ESA market. For the long term, as many of you know, we spend about $800 million per year on ESAs. We are intensely looking for the right long-term partner or partners in the hope to consummate some type of long-term partnership well before the expiration of our current contract at the end of 2018.
Second, integrated kidney care. We are very competent at this. Regardless of who has the risks, we think we will be one of the subcontractors of choice.
And third, finally, the flat Medicare reimbursement is scheduled to go away at the end of 2018. In 2019, we hope to be back to our normal market basket. All in all, our strategic position in U.S. kidney care is strong.
Now let's step back to the enterprise overall. The guidance OI of $1.8 billion to $1.95 billion. OCF, $1.55 billion to $1.75 billion. But on an unequally important topic, how are we thinking about capital allocation at the enterprise level? Well, first, with kidney care, we stayed the course. And since there aren't a lot of large properties available out there, that means they will not use all the cash they generate. 
HCP, they will focus on existing markets, unless something that is capital-light or very attractive multiple comes along. 
International, we will continue to invest to grow. Putting all 3 of those together, what does our capital allocation look like if you pick something arbitrary like the next 3-year period? We will generate, in a reasonable scenario, with, of course, downside risks and upside, but in the reasonable scenario, we will generate operating cash flow of approximately $5.5 billion in the next 3 years. If you count normal use, meaning our current operating plans, business plans, et cetera, which, of course, could change, we will use about $3.5 billion for those purposes. This leaves about $2 billion on the side for us to contemplate what to do with, with, of course, your counsel as well as we compare other growth opportunities to debt repayment opportunities to share repurchase opportunities. 
Now Vijay Kotte, our new CFO of Healthcare Partners, will walk through a few more details."

I'll take a few minutes to provide more detail into the investments we're making into the future. As Kent stated before, we are continuing to make both remedial and offensive investments into the business. The best way to look at these items is to put 2015 and 2016 together. When you do that, we have a total of approximately $80 million in incremental investments over 2014. To provide more context into these investments, I will put them into 3 primary buckets: First, we have information technology; second, legal and compliance; and third, the next-generation capability and change management.
In the bucket of IT, we plan to spend $40 million more in '16 than we did in 2014. This includes the following areas: First, security; second, application to support population health; third, community portal to enhance munication between patients and providers, an enterprise data warehouse, our accounting system conversion and a national IT infrastructure to enable our creation of one company.
Next, in the legal and compliance bucket, we will invest an additional $10 million to $15 million over 2014. 
In our final bucket, we're investing approximately $18 million into research and development related to next-generation care management capabilities, a team we call catalysts, with applications to our current markets as well as others.
Now Jim Hilger, our CFO, will walk you through a few more details on the numbers in the quarter."

First, I'd like to point out a couple of non-GAAP items in the quarter. In the fourth quarter, we recorded an estimated accrual of $23 million for potential damages and liabilities in our DaVita RX pharmacy business. We have excluded these numbers from our reported non-GAAP income from continuing operations. 
A few words about this estimated accrual. The reserves relate to the period from 2010 through 2015. As a part of our normal process, last spring, we initiated an internal compliance review of DaVita RX, during which, we identified potential billing and operational issues. We notified the government in September of 2015 that we were conducting this review of DaVita RX and began providing regular updates of our review. Upon completion of our review, we filed a self disclosure with the OIG on February 5, 2016, and we have been working to address and update the practices we identified in the self-disclosure. 
In addition, as disclosed earlier today, on February 5, 2016, DaVita Rx received a civil investigative demand from the U.S. Attorney's Office. The information requested has some overlap with the items we self-disclosed. And we do not know that the U.S. Attorney knew we are already in the process of developing a self-disclosure with the OIG.
At HCP, we took an estimated $206 million impairment charge of non-cash goodwill and an intangible asset of certain healthcare partner operating units. These impairments were driven primarily by the underperformance of the business reporting units in recent quarters as well as changes in other market conditions, including government reimbursement cuts and our expected ability to mitigate those cuts.
The final amount of these impairment charges will depend upon the final outcome of this valuation work, which we expect to be completed in the first quarter of 2016. This noncash charge will not impact go-forward performance or our cash taxes.
Onto the overall enterprise. Our debt expense was $103 million in the fourth quarter, which is a good run rate for a debt expense in future quarters. Our income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $40 million.
Next, our effective tax rate. For income attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners in the fourth quarter was 36% and for the year was 38.2%. And we expect the full year tax rate for 2016 to be in the range of 40% to 41%.
We have also repurchased $151 million of our common stock in the fourth quarter, and we also repurchased an additional $249 million in the month of January. As a result of these transactions, we now have approximately $259 million remaining under our current board authorization.
As you think about modeling the first quarter, here are a few things that you should keep in mind: In our dialysis business, Q1 2015 contains -- or '16 contains 1 fewer day than this past quarter. So you should expect lower revenues and higher fixed costs per treatment. 
Second, our payroll tax caps reset at the beginning of the year, which leads to higher cost of $1 to $1.50 per treatment. At HCP, OI fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter due to the seasonal needs of patients, and Q1 and tends to be a bit lighter than the full year average.
Now turning to cash flow. We continue to generate strong cash flows as operating cash flow was $437 million in the fourth quarter and $1.861 billion for all of 2015, excluding the Vainer settlement. The strong cash flows in 2015 are borrowing a bit from 2016 operating cash flow, mostly due to the timing of cash tax payments and other working capital items. But despite that, we still expect 2016 operating cash flows to be $1.55 billion to $1.75 billion, showing that we continue to generate strong cash flows. As always, this guidance range captures a majority of probabilistic outcomes, but we could be above or below this range. 
And with that, operator, let's go ahead and open it up for Q&A."

And then hopefully, through a new partner or the same partner and a new partnership with the SAs, we're getting some integrated care runway that we can start to break out of the current trend. On the HCP side, of course, some of the declines have taken away their kidney care gains. And so if we just stop adding it back to reasonable steady growth in HCP, that, together with the normal growth in kidney care, could start to generate some much more interesting numbers. And then lastly, international is unfortunately just a couple of years away from being able to really help. Although once it starts helping, it could be a long-term big deal."

This will be a pretty high-density call, and I'll be covering more topics than normal because of some of the nuances contained therein. 
As usual, I will first talk about our clinical outcomes because that is what comes first. Second, for each major business unit, I'll talk about the operating performance for the quarter and year and provide some thoughts on '16. Third, we'll then step back on each business briefly, and on the enterprise overall to try to set the table for our Capital Markets Day coming up on May 18, in New York City. And then lastly, I'll talk about enterprise capital allocation.
So let's launch right in since there's quite a bit to cover. On the clinical outcome front, excellent news, once again. Kidney Care, 97% of our patients with a Kt/V of 1.2 or greater, 73% of patients with fistulas placed for access; and very recently, final results announced for the CMS QUIP program for another year period, once again, we outperformed the rest of the community with only 1.4% of our facilities facing a penalty compared to 7.1% for the rest of the industry. Of course, no quality rating system is perfect, but in rating test after rating test, we come out as clinically differentiated. 
On the HCP front, equally promising results. With respect to HEDIS clinical metrics, we'll just pick Nevada this time. We try to move it around for you geographically. And in terms of subject matter, we once again exceeded the Medicare fee-for-service benchmark on all metrics, then had 4 or 5 star across all MA patients on all non-HEDIS metrics. So in both cases, both main sides of the house, our outcomes compare very favorably to national averages. This is good for patients. This is good for the taxpayer.
Now let's move on to the quarter and the year. We'll hit HCP first; international, second; kidney care, third. HCP operating performance for the quarter, $25 million. That excluded the estimated write-down. This was within our guidance range. On a normalized basis, this was actually about $37 million, if you normalize for prior-period adjustments, et cetera, which actually is about exactly the same amount of profit in Q4 of 2014 normalized.
For the full year, OI improved, as you know, from $215 million to $240 million, which is also within our guidance, although at the low end. In order to achieve that, the legacy markets were up a bit. The new markets were up a bit. And the combination of those bits was more than enough to make up for the medical cost inflation and some very substantial investments in capability building/G&A. And Vijay Kotte, our new HCP CFO, will discuss those investments and capabilities in G&A in more detail in just a few minutes.
But I will, as said, move right on to 2016 guidance for HCP. It is $175 million to $225 million. There are 3 primary drivers of that range. Driver number one, $58 million in reimbursement cuts. This is primarily the result of the new acuity coding RAF model being implemented the final trunk of the way, 100% implemented as of that time. As previously discussed, the HCP was more comprehensive in its coding capture. Complete diagnosis of patient conditions is a good thing, but it also left the entity far more vulnerable to any coding reimbursement compression. So $58 million from that source, most of it, the model, and the model is now 100%. 
And second big driver of that range is our investment in additional capabilities. There's 2 components to this $60 million year-over-year increase. Component A is really remedial. Their prior business leadership essentially stopped investing in the company. It was working to maximize profitability for the sale, either knowingly or unknowingly. And as a side note, I just want to remind you that we knew that. That is why we only paid a 6x multiple in a world where other allegedly comparable assets were going for 9x to 10x then and now, much greater than 10x in the market. 
And the second component of that big G&A capability investment is offensive, meaning investments that we think that are going to create significant competitive advantage for us over time. 
The third primary driver is the positive one, which offsets a big chunk of those 2 negative ones: Solid operating performance, good old solid operating performance. So if you look at the math, you have a $58 million hit from the -- essentially the completion of the RAF model. You have a $60 million hit from the increased investment in G&A, half remedial, half offensive. That would equal $118 million hit. You then have a $78 million operating performance improvement, which offsets all but $40 million of the 2 negative trends. And that yields the change from the $240 million in 2015 OI to the midpoint of the guidance, $200 million for 2016. We can, of course, take questions on all of that, but those are the 3 primary drivers. 
2017 does look better than 2016. The model will be behind us, and we continue to make steady progress on our capabilities and our contracting. If we put the P&L aside for a moment and look at cash flow and take as a scenario the midpoint of our guidance, in other words, the $200 million for HCP, and simultaneously take the midpoint of our guidance for the total enterprise, that $200 million would equal 11% of total enterprise operating income.
However, HCP operating cash flow is projected to be over $400 million, about 25% of total enterprise operating cash flow. This happens because of what we've talked about in the past, lower in capital intensity, low CapEx requirements and $100 million per year hard dollar cash tax benefit.
If we step back for a moment and look back at 3 difficult years, the total reimbursement cut from the implementation of the new RAF model for us, $165 million. What we had anticipated was a much smaller number than that. In fact, less than half. So about $100 million of incremental P&L harm that we had not expected is due to that single variable, $100 million. Now the fact that it came from that does not make it any less painful than if it came from anything else, but the important message is it did not come from operating problems or operating issues.
Looking forward, instead of backward, we have 6 primary markets: California, Nevada, Florida, New Mexico, Colorado and Washington, and more particularly, the Seattle area. In those primary markets, we have 6 leading independent medical groups. It is in those places, plus our joint venture, Tandigm in Philadelphia, of course, but that is a horse of a different color, that is where we'll be placing most of our emphasis in the near and perhaps intermediate term. Prices are very high right now for variable properties. Our bandwidth is pretty stretched given how much we've grown and given how much opportunity we have in those 6 markets, plus with Tandigm.
And then third, we need to prove to you that we can get the right returns and margins in a number of those places before we do too many other significant things. Because of all that, it is unlikely we will do any other big Everett-like deal, unless it is through a capital-light transaction or is for a very attractive multiple. 
Other good news to take into account, and looking forward instead of backward, a list of few of them, each of a different type. First, our legacy markets in 2015, once again, outgrew their markets in terms of MA growth. The markets grew 6%. We grew 9%.
Number two, we've dramatically improved patient service metrics since the time of the transaction.
Number three, we've had a number of significant IT advances that have improved our support for our frontline physicians. We have a long journey there, and Vijay will talk about that a little more, but we've got some nice early momentum and victories in better supporting our frontline physicians.
Number four, we've had a number of forecasting and prior period adjustment issues. You know that painful truth as we do. Our finance leadership team is literally 90% new.
And fifth, and finally, in this case, if you look at our top 22 executives, we have 5 great veterans with immense amounts of valuable ACP experience and 17 new executives that we think are the right people to help take us into that next chapter going forward.
So that's it on HCP for now, although Vijay will come back and talk about some of those capability and G&A investments a little bit later.
Let's move onto international. We underperformed in 2015. $55 million in losses compared to original $40 million of guidance. Why? Well, we had a $5 million AR reserve, which almost entirely came from 1 country where there were 2 fiscal intermediaries who became insolvent. We actually hope to get a bunch of that money back. We also are $10 million behind plan or were $10 million behind plan in 2 countries where we built new centers and patient growth was behind plan.
In 2016, for international, our guidance is losses of approximately $40 million. This assumes no unusual AR reserves. We are experiencing payment delays with the Saudi government, so that's a watch-out, but we have done nothing on that front now. We still expect to receive all of the funds. And the good news is the Ministry of Health in Saudi is explicitly very happy with our service and very impressed by the patient feedback they have received. Their words, not ours.
In 2017, we anticipate improvement over '16 on an OI basis. And in 2018, in international dialysis, in our current country portfolio, we expect to achieve breakeven. We are, in fact, already in 2015 -- or we did already in 2015, generate positive aggregate EBITDA at the clinic level in 8 out of our 10 countries as we continue to grow and cover our G&A. 
And another reference point that gives you a sense of the per-country scale. In 2014, we had an average of $10 million revenue per country. 2015, an increase of 50%, up to $15 million. 2016, if we hit our plan, we'll be $27 million in revenue per country. So you can see that, at reasonable margins, we are making strong progress in covering the fixed amount of global G&A.
Finally, most of our growth internationally has been through acquisition. Virtually, every 1 of those acquisitions has been competed for with others. And so these are market-valuable assets that real competition wanted to have. And our competitors continue to invest in growing internationally as well because of the returns they see. 
Stepping back for a moment, with respect to international, we are still very bullish on the long-term opportunity both in kidney care and other health care services.
Now onto the kidney care operating performance. Once again, strong quarter, strong year. Operating income, $449 million. And then for the year, $1.658 billion. First number was for the quarter, of course, once again excluding some nonrecurring stuff. Jim Hilger will provide more details on the numbers. 
I'll go right into guidance. We anticipate, in 2016, another solid year, $1.625 billion to $1.725 billion. Of course, there's always risk we'll fall short and there's always hope that we will exceed. This guidance, for our normal customs, does include the international economics and it also includes the unfortunate fact of flat Medicare reimbursement for the third straight year.
The uncertainty in our 2016 performance, as in many recent years, it centers on revenue and revenue per treatment. We anticipate our performance in the first half of the year with respect to RPT to be positive, but we have a lot less visibility into the second half of the year, hence, the broadness of the range. 
And regarding the strategic initiatives, there could be some earnings volatility there. One reason is ESCOs, as you know we have launched, and so we incur those costs, particularly those extra startup costs now, and we get the shared savings payment later if we perform and the data is correct. And the second variable are some Rx, to be the Rx renewals. All of this, of course, is incorporated into our guidance.
Stepping back now with respect to kidney care and looking out 3, 4 or 5 years, is one big downside and 3 attractive upsides. The big downside is what will happen to private pay? It is unfortunate that we have a large cost shift in our dialysis industry in America with private patients paying a lot more to subsidize the 80% to 90% of our patients that are Medicare and Medicaid. And when you put that on top of payer consolidation, distributed risk pools, exchanges and other things going on, it would not be prudent to not be nervous about what will happen with private pay.
On the other hand, we do have 3 upsides. One is in the ESA market. For the long term, as many of you know, we spend about $800 million per year on ESAs. We are intensely looking for the right long-term partner or partners in the hope to consummate some type of long-term partnership well before the expiration of our current contract at the end of 2018.
Second, integrated kidney care. We are very competent at this. Regardless of who has the risk, we think we will be one of the subcontractors of choice.
And third, finally, the flat Medicare reimbursement is scheduled to go away at the end of 2018. In 2019, we hope to be back to our normal market basket. All in all, our strategic position in U.S. kidney care is strong.
Now let's step back to the enterprise overall. The guidance OI of $1.8 billion to $1.95 billion. OCF, $1.55 billion to $1.75 billion. But on an equally important topic, how are we thinking about capital allocation at the enterprise level? Well, first, with kidney care, we stay the course. And since there aren't a lot of large properties available out there, that means they will not use all the cash they generate. 
HCP, they will focus on existing markets, unless something that is capital-light or at a very attractive multiple comes along. 
International, we will continue to invest to grow. Putting all 3 of those together, what does our capital allocation look like if you pick something arbitrary like the next 3-year period? We will generate, in a reasonable scenario, with, of course, downside risk and upside, but in the reasonable scenario, we will generate operating cash flow of approximately $5.5 billion in the next 3 years. If you count normal use, meaning our current operating plans, business plans, et cetera, which, of course, could change, we will use about $3.5 billion for those purposes. This leaves about $2 billion on the side for us to contemplate what to do with, with, of course, your counsel as well as we compare other growth opportunities to debt repayment opportunities, to share repurchase opportunities. 
Now Vijay Kotte, our new CFO of Healthcare Partners, will walk through a few more details."

I'll take a few minutes to provide more detail into the investments we're making into the future.

When you do that, we have a total of approximately $80 million in incremental investments over 2014. 
To provide more context into these investments, I will put them into 3 primary buckets: First, we have information technology; second, legal and compliance; and third, the next-generation capability and change management.
In the bucket of IT, we plan to spend $40 million more in '16 than we did in 2014. This includes the following areas: First, security; second, applications to support population health; third, a community portal to enhance communication between patients and providers, an enterprise data warehouse, our accounting system conversion and a national IT infrastructure to enable our creation of one company.
Next, in the legal and compliance bucket, we will invest an additional $10 million to $15 million over 2014. 
In our final bucket, we're investing approximately $18 million into research and development related to next-generation care management capabilities, a team we call catalysts, with applications to our current markets as well as others.
Now Jim Hilger, our CFO, will walk you through a few more details on the numbers in the quarter."

First, I'd like to point out a couple of non-GAAP items in the quarter. In the fourth quarter, we recorded an estimated accrual of $23 million for potential damages and liabilities in our DaVita Rx pharmacy business. We have excluded these",654,"Thanks, Vijay. First, I'd like to point out a couple of non-GAAP items in the quarter. In the fourth quarter, we recorded an estimated accrual of $23 million for potential damages and liabilities in our DaVita Rx pharmacy business. We have excluded these numbers from our reported non-GAAP income from continuing operations. 
A few words about this estimated accrual. The reserves relate to the period from 2010 through 2015. As a part of our normal process, last spring, we initiated an internal compliance review of DaVita Rx, during which, we identified potential billing and operational issues. We notified the government in September of 2015 that we were conducting this review of DaVita Rx and began providing regular updates of our review. Upon completion of our review, we filed a self-disclosure with the OIG on February 5, 2016, and we have been working to address and update the practices we identified in the self-disclosure. 
In addition, as disclosed earlier today, on February 5, 2016, DaVita Rx received a civil investigative demand from the U.S. Attorney's Office. The information requested has some overlap with the items we self-disclosed. And we do not know that the U.S. Attorney knew we are already in the process of developing a self-disclosure with the OIG.
At HCP, we took an estimated $206 million impairment charge of noncash goodwill and an intangible asset of certain health care partner operating units. These impairments were driven primarily by underperformance of the business reporting units in recent quarters, as well as changes in other market conditions, including government reimbursement cuts and our expected ability to mitigate those cuts.
The final amount of these impairment charges will depend upon the final outcome of this valuation work, which we expect to be completed in the first quarter of 2016. This noncash charge will not impact go-forward performance or our cash taxes.
Onto the overall enterprise. Our debt expense was $103 million in the fourth quarter, which is a good run rate for a debt expense in future quarters. Our income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $40 million.
Next, our effective tax rate for income attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners in the fourth quarter was 36% and for the year was 38.2%. And we expect the full year tax rate for 2016 to be in the range of 40% to 41%.
We have also repurchased $151 million of our common stock in the fourth quarter, and we also repurchased an additional $249 million in the month of January. As a result of these transactions, we now have approximately $259 million remaining under our current board authorization.
As you think about modeling the first quarter, here are a few things that you should keep in mind. In our dialysis business, Q1 2015 contains -- or '16 contains 1 fewer day than this past quarter. So you should expect lower revenues and higher fixed costs per treatment. 
Second, our payroll tax cap is reset at the beginning of the year, which leads to higher costs of $1 to $1.50 per treatment. At HCP, OI fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter due to the seasonal needs of patients, and Q1 tends to be a bit lighter than the full year average.
Now turning to cash flow. We continue to generate strong cash flows as operating cash flow was $437 million in the fourth quarter and $1.861 billion for all of 2015, excluding the Vainer settlement. The strong cash flows in 2015 are borrowing a bit from 2016 operating cash flow, mostly due to the timing of cash tax payments and other working capital items. But despite that, we still expect 2016 operating cash flows to be $1.55 billion to $1.75 billion, showing that we continue to generate strong cash flows. As always, this guidance range captures a majority of probabilistic outcomes, but we could be above or below this range. 
And with that, operator, let's go ahead and open it up for Q&A."

This will be a pretty high-density call, and I'll be covering more topics than normal because of some of the nuances contained therein. 
As usual, I will first talk about our clinical outcomes because that is what comes first. Second, for each major business unit, I'll talk about the operating performance for the quarter and year and provide some thoughts on '16. Third, we'll then step back on each business briefly, and on the enterprise overall to try to set the table for our Capital Markets Day coming up on May 18, in New York City. And then lastly, I'll talk about enterprise capital allocation.
So let's launch right in since there's quite a bit to cover. On the clinical outcome front, excellent news, once again. Kidney Care, 97% of our patients with a Kt/V of 1.2 or greater, 73% of patients with fistulas placed for access; and very recently, final results announced for the CMS QUIP program for another year period, once again, we outperformed the rest of the community with only 1.4% of our facilities facing a penalty compared to 7.1% for the rest of the industry. Of course, no quality rating system is perfect, but in rating test after rating test, we come out as clinically differentiated. 
On the HCP front, equally promising results. With respect to HEDIS clinical metrics, we'll just pick Nevada this time. We try to move it around for you geographically. And in terms of subject matter, we once again exceeded the Medicare fee-for-service benchmark on all metrics, then had 4 or 5 star across all MA patients on all non-HEDIS metrics. So in both cases, both main sides of the house, our outcomes compare very favorably to national averages. This is good for patients. This is good for the taxpayer.
Now let's move on to the quarter and the year. We'll hit HCP first; international, second; kidney care, third. HCP operating performance for the quarter, $25 million. That excluded the estimated write-down. This was within our guidance range. On a normalized basis, this was actually about $37 million, if you normalize for prior-period adjustments, et cetera, which actually is about exactly the same amount of profit in Q4 of 2014 normalized.
For the full year, OI improved, as you know, from $215 million to $240 million, which is also within our guidance, although at the low end. In order to achieve that, the legacy markets were up a bit. The new markets were up a bit. And the combination of those bits was more than enough to make up for the medical cost inflation and some very substantial investments in capability building/G&A. And Vijay Kotte, our new HCP CFO, will discuss those investments and capabilities in G&A in more detail in just a few minutes.
But I will, as said, move right on to 2016 guidance for HCP. It is $175 million to $225 million. There are 3 primary drivers of that range. Driver number one, $58 million in reimbursement cuts. This is primarily the result of the new acuity coding RAF model being implemented the final trunk of the way, 100% implemented as of that time. As previously discussed, the HCP was more comprehensive in its coding capture. Complete diagnosis of patient conditions is a good thing, but it also left the entity far more vulnerable to any coding reimbursement compression. So $58 million from that source, most of it, the model, and the model is now 100%. 
And second big driver of that range is our investment in additional capabilities. There's 2 components to this $60 million year-over-year increase. Component A is really remedial. Their prior business leadership essentially stopped investing in the company. It was working to maximize profitability for the sale, either knowingly or unknowingly. And as a side note, I just want to remind you that we knew that. That is why we only paid a 6x multiple in a world where other allegedly comparable assets were going for 9x to 10x then and now, much greater than 10x in the market. 
And the second component of that big G&A capability investment is offensive, meaning investments that we think that are going to create significant competitive advantage for us over time. 
The third primary driver is the positive one, which offsets a big chunk of those 2 negative ones: Solid operating performance, good old solid operating performance. So if you look at the math, you have a $58 million hit from the -- essentially the completion of the RAF model. You have a $60 million hit from the increased investment in G&A, half remedial, half offensive. That would equal $118 million hit. You then have a $78 million operating performance improvement, which offsets all but $40 million of the 2 negative trends. And that yields the change from the $240 million in 2015 OI to the midpoint of the guidance, $200 million for 2016. We can, of course, take questions on all of that, but those are the 3 primary drivers. 
2017 does look better than 2016. The model will be behind us, and we continue to make steady progress on our capabilities and our contracting. If we put the P&L aside for a moment and look at cash flow and take as a scenario the midpoint of our guidance, in other words, the $200 million for HCP, and simultaneously take the midpoint of our guidance for the total enterprise, that $200 million would equal 11% of total enterprise operating income.
However, HCP operating cash flow is projected to be over $400 million, about 25% of total enterprise operating cash flow. This happens because of what we've talked about in the past, lower in capital intensity, low CapEx requirements and $100 million per year hard dollar cash tax benefit.
If we step back for a moment and look back at 3 difficult years, the total reimbursement cut from the implementation of the new RAF model for us, $165 million. What we had anticipated was a much smaller number than that. In fact, less than half. So about $100 million of incremental P&L harm that we had not expected is due to that single variable, $100 million. Now the fact that it came from that does not make it any less painful than if it came from anything else, but the important message is it did not come from operating problems or operating issues.
Looking forward, instead of backward, we have 6 primary markets: California, Nevada, Florida, New Mexico, Colorado and Washington, and more particularly, the Seattle area. In those primary markets, we have 6 leading independent medical groups. It is in those places, plus our joint venture, Tandigm in Philadelphia, of course, but that is a horse of a different color, that is where we'll be placing most of our emphasis in the near and perhaps intermediate term. Prices are very high right now for variable properties. Our bandwidth is pretty stretched given how much we've grown and given how much opportunity we have in those 6 markets, plus with Tandigm.
And then third, we need to prove to you that we can get the right returns and margins in a number of those places before we do too many other significant things. Because of all that, it is unlikely we will do any other big Everett-like deal, unless it is through a capital-light transaction or is for a very attractive multiple. 
Other good news to take into account, and looking forward instead of backward, a list of few of them, each of a different type. First, our legacy markets in 2015, once again, outgrew their markets in terms of MA growth. The markets grew 6%. We grew 9%.
Number two, we've dramatically improved patient service metrics since the time of the transaction.
Number three, we've had a number of significant IT advances that have improved our support for our frontline physicians. We have a long journey there, and Vijay will talk about that a little more, but we've got some nice early momentum and victories in better supporting our frontline physicians.
Number four, we've had a number of forecasting and prior period adjustment issues. You know that painful truth as we do. Our finance leadership team is literally 90% new.
And fifth, and finally, in this case, if you look at our top 22 executives, we have 5 great veterans with immense amounts of valuable ACP experience and 17 new executives that we think are the right people to help take us into that next chapter going forward.
So that's it on HCP for now, although Vijay will come back and talk about some of those capability and G&A investments a little bit later.
Let's move onto international. We underperformed in 2015. $55 million in losses compared to original $40 million of guidance. Why? Well, we had a $5 million AR reserve, which almost entirely came from 1 country where there were 2 fiscal intermediaries who became insolvent. We actually hope to get a bunch of that money back. We also are $10 million behind plan or were $10 million behind plan in 2 countries where we built new centers and patient growth was behind plan.
In 2016, for international, our guidance is losses of approximately $40 million. This assumes no unusual AR reserves. We are experiencing payment delays with the Saudi government, so that's a watch-out, but we have done nothing on that front now. We still expect to receive all of the funds. And the good news is the Ministry of Health in Saudi is explicitly very happy with our service and very impressed by the patient feedback they have received. Their words, not ours.
In 2017, we anticipate improvement over '16 on an OI basis. And in 2018, in international dialysis, in our current country portfolio, we expect to achieve breakeven. We are, in fact, already in 2015 -- or we did already in 2015, generate positive aggregate EBITDA at the clinic level in 8 out of our 10 countries as we continue to grow and cover our G&A. 
And another reference point that gives you a sense of the per-country scale. In 2014, we had an average of $10 million revenue per country. 2015, an increase of 50%, up to $15 million. 2016, if we hit our plan, we'll be $27 million in revenue per country. So you can see that, at reasonable margins, we are making strong progress in covering the fixed amount of global G&A.
Finally, most of our growth internationally has been through acquisition. Virtually, every one of those acquisitions has been competed for with others. And so these are market-valuable assets that real competition wanted to have. And our competitors continue to invest in growing internationally as well because of the returns they see. 
Stepping back for a moment, with respect to international, we are still very bullish on the long-term opportunity both in kidney care and other health care services.
Now onto the kidney care operating performance. Once again, strong quarter, strong year. Operating income, $449 million. And then for the year, $1.658 billion. First number was for the quarter, of course, once again excluding some nonrecurring stuff. Jim Hilger will provide more details on the numbers. 
I'll go right into guidance. We anticipate, in 2016, another solid year, $1.625 billion to $1.725 billion. Of course, there's always risk we'll fall short and there's always hope that we will exceed. This guidance, for our normal customs, does include the international economics and it also includes the unfortunate fact of flat Medicare reimbursement for the third straight year.
The uncertainty in our 2016 performance, as in many recent years, it centers on revenue and revenue per treatment. We anticipate our performance in the first half of the year with respect to RPT to be positive, but we have a lot less visibility into the second half of the year, hence, the broadness of the range. 
And regarding the strategic initiatives, there could be some earnings volatility there. One reason is ESCOs, as you know we have launched, and so we incur those costs, particularly those extra startup costs now, and we get the shared savings payment later if we perform and the data is correct. And the second variable are some Rx, to be the Rx renewals. All of this, of course, is incorporated into our guidance.
Stepping back now with respect to kidney care and looking out 3, 4 or 5 years, is one big downside and 3 attractive upsides. The big downside is what will happen to private pay? It is unfortunate that we have a large cost shift in our dialysis industry in America with private patients paying a lot more to subsidize the 80% to 90% of our patients that are Medicare and Medicaid. And when you put that on top of payer consolidation, distributed risk pools, exchanges and other things going on, it would not be prudent to not be nervous about what will happen with private pay.
On the other hand, we do have 3 upsides. One is in the ESA market. For the long term, as many of you know, we spend about $800 million per year on ESAs. We are intensely looking for the right long-term partner or partners in the hope to consummate some type of long-term partnership well before the expiration of our current contract at the end of 2018.
Second, integrated kidney care. We are very competent at this. Regardless of who has the risk, we think we will be one of the subcontractors of choice.
And third, finally, the flat Medicare reimbursement is scheduled to go away at the end of 2018. In 2019, we hope to be back to our normal market basket. All in all, our strategic position in U.S. kidney care is strong.
Now let's step back to the enterprise overall. The guidance OI of $1.8 billion to $1.95 billion. OCF, $1.55 billion to $1.75 billion. But on an equally important topic, how are we thinking about capital allocation at the enterprise level? Well, first, with kidney care, we stay the course. And since there aren't a lot of large properties available out there, that means they will not use all the cash they generate. 
HCP, they will focus on existing markets, unless something that is capital-light or at a very attractive multiple comes along. 
International, we will continue to invest to grow. Putting all 3 of those together, what does our capital allocation look like if you pick something arbitrary like the next 3-year period? We will generate, in a reasonable scenario, with, of course, downside risk and upside, but in the reasonable scenario, we will generate operating cash flow of approximately $5.5 billion in the next 3 years. If you count normal use, meaning our current operating plans, business plans, et cetera, which, of course, could change, we will use about $3.5 billion for those purposes. This leaves about $2 billion on the side for us to contemplate what to do with, with, of course, your counsel as well as we compare other growth opportunities to debt repayment opportunities, to share repurchase opportunities. 
Now Vijay Kotte, our new CFO of Healthcare Partners, will walk through a few more details."

I'll take a few minutes to provide more detail into the investments we're making into the future. As Kent stated before, we are continuing to make both remedial and offensive investments into the business. The best way to look at these items is to put 2015 and 2016 together. When you do that, we have a total of approximately $80 million in incremental investments over 2014. 
To provide more context into these investments, I will put them into 3 primary buckets: First, we have information technology; second, legal and compliance; and third, the next-generation capability and change management.
In the bucket of IT, we plan to spend $40 million more in '16 than we did in 2014. This includes the following areas: First, security; second, applications to support population health; third, a community portal to enhance communication between patients and providers, an enterprise data warehouse, our accounting system conversion and a national IT infrastructure to enable our creation of one company.
Next, in the legal and compliance bucket, we will invest an additional $10 million to $15 million over 2014. 
In our final bucket, we're investing approximately $18 million into research and development related to next-generation care management capabilities, a team we call catalysts, with applications to our current markets as well as others.
Now Jim Hilger, our CFO, will walk you through a few more details on the numbers in the quarter."

First, I'd like to point out a couple of non-GAAP items in the quarter. In the fourth quarter, we recorded an estimated accrual of $23 million for potential damages and liabilities in our DaVita Rx pharmacy business. We have excluded these numbers from our reported non-GAAP income from continuing operations. 
A few words about this estimated accrual. The reserves relate to the period from 2010 through 2015. As a part of our normal process, last spring, we initiated an internal compliance review of DaVita Rx, during which, we identified potential billing and operational issues. We notified the government in September of 2015 that we were conducting this review of DaVita Rx and began providing regular updates of our review. Upon completion of our review, we filed a self-disclosure with the OIG on February 5, 2016, and we have been working to address and update the practices we identified in the self-disclosure. 
In addition, as disclosed earlier today, on February 5, 2016, DaVita Rx received a civil investigative demand from the U.S. Attorney's Office. The information requested has some overlap with the items we self-disclosed. And we do not know that the U.S. Attorney knew we are already in the process of developing a self-disclosure with the OIG.
At HCP, we took an estimated $206 million impairment charge of noncash goodwill and an intangible asset of certain health care partner operating units. These impairments were driven primarily by underperformance of the business reporting units in recent quarters, as well as changes in other market conditions, including government reimbursement cuts and our expected ability to mitigate those cuts.
The final amount of these impairment charges will depend upon the final outcome of this valuation work, which we expect to be completed in the first quarter of 2016. This noncash charge will not impact go-forward performance or our cash taxes.
Onto the overall enterprise. Our debt expense was $103 million in the fourth quarter, which is a good run rate for a debt expense in future quarters. Our income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $40 million.
Next, our effective tax rate for income attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners in the fourth quarter was 36% and for the year was 38.2%. And we expect the full year tax rate for 2016 to be in the range of 40% to 41%.
We have also repurchased $151 million of our common stock in the fourth quarter, and we also repurchased an additional $249 million in the month of January. As a result of these transactions, we now have approximately $259 million remaining under our current board authorization.
As you think about modeling the first quarter, here are a few things that you should keep in mind. In our dialysis business, Q1 2015 contains -- or '16 contains 1 fewer day than this past quarter. So you should expect lower revenues and higher fixed costs per treatment. 
Second, our payroll tax cap is reset at the beginning of the year, which leads to higher costs of $1 to $1.50 per treatment. At HCP, OI fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter due to the seasonal needs of patients, and Q1 tends to be a bit lighter than the full year average.
Now turning to cash flow. We continue to generate strong cash flows as operating cash flow was $437 million in the fourth quarter and $1.861 billion for all of 2015, excluding the Vainer settlement. The strong cash flows in 2015 are borrowing a bit from 2016 operating cash flow, mostly due to the timing of cash tax payments and other working capital items. But despite that, we still expect 2016 operating cash flows to be $1.55 billion to $1.75 billion, showing that we continue to generate strong cash flows. As always, this guidance range captures a majority of probabilistic outcomes, but we could be above or below this range. 
And with that, operator, let's go ahead and open it up for Q&A."

First, I'll cover the quarter, and then secondly, I will cover full year guidance. For the quarter, we had a strong operating income of $422 million, and let me cover some of the highlights. Number one, normalized NAG was 4.1, which represented continued improvement over the prior quarters, and it is consistent with our guidance that we gave last year for our 3 years of 3.5% to 4.5%. Our rate per treatment increased by $2.34 per treatment, and it was mainly driven through higher acute mix and improved commercial mix. These improvements were partially offset by fewer treatment days, which is normal in Q1. And as a reminder, the quarter benefited from an extra date due to a leap year. And seasonally higher cost and treatment, number one, primarily due to higher personnel costs from payroll taxes and higher pharma costs from seasonally higher people utilization due to the delay of the flu. Happy with the quarter. 
Our guidance for Kidney Care remains unchanged at $1.625 billion to $1.75 billion. And as always, arranged in total captures the majority of that probabilistic outcomes. And based on where we are today, we are more likely to be on the top half of the guidance range. 
The primary reason for leaving our guidance unchanged is driven by some economic uncertainties surrounding the exchange plans of the ACA. Let me summarize with 4 points on our experience on the ACA. Number one, it is working for patients. Americans who otherwise would not have insurance are now insured. Number two, many patients are far better insured and have better coverage than they had before, including many of our patients that are benefiting from the insurance coverage. Number three, the regulatory environment around exchanges is still being built. While many pairs are living up to the spirit of the ACA, others are changing their fine print and their plan designs to avoid paying for expensive chronic diseases, either by cost shifting to the patient or by making the plans unattractive for the expensive chronically ill in other ways. It might be helpful to give an example. We had in 1 state a plan that tried to limit dialysis benefits and shifted significant economic responsibility to the patient, which as many of you know, these patients can clearly not afford. Once we alerted the regulatory agencies the plans were instructed to remedy their behavior. That being said, we're seeing more effort by some of the payers to improve their economics in the exchange plan by making it more difficult for dialysis patients to enroll. This is a complicated issue, which will require regulatory environment. As you know, it happened to be a tough year because the election and many are distracted. Therefore, the dynamics around enforcement are hard for us to predict. I'll state the obvious, patients and providers will continue to work with regulators as this unfold. 
Lastly, as you know, not unique to us, there are larger macroeconomics and political risks that are clouding the future of the exchanges. Therefore, it's hard to handicap with certainty how this will play out for us. We'll talk about some of these issues in our longer-term outlook in 2 weeks as we see you in Capital Markets. 
I'll pass it back to you, Kent."

The losses, as you've seen, were $10 million in the quarter year, and this is in line with our guidance of approximately $40 million on the year. The most noteworthy new news on the international front is our definitive agreement to form a joint venture to grow our Kidney Care business in Asia with 2 partners: Kazana and Mitsui. Kazana is a highly respected sovereign wealth fund of the government of Malaysia with an investment portfolio greater than $30 billion. And Mitsui, as many of you know, one of the largest oldest business groups in Japan with about $45 billion in annual revenue. And it recently designated health care as a key strategic domain for themselves corporately going forward. They are both experienced in health care already and are value-added partners for us, not just investors. One of their noteworthy successes in the Asian health care scene is they have a majority stake, approximately 60% stake in IHH HealthCare, which many don't realize, is the second-largest hospital company in the world by market cap. That market cap is about $13 billion at this point, and we're very excited to have them as our partners. 
The financial terms, just to the summary level, each of Kazana and Mitsui will invest $150 million over the next few years, and each will receive in return a 20% ownership stake. We -- well, of course, still majority owner therefore, and we will be running the enterprise with them as our very active partners. 
Just to give you a sense of the current scope of the business, we have 64 clinics that serve about 3,300 patients across 5 countries in that part of the world. The definitive agreement is subject to a few closing conditions, so it could take some time to complete. But all 3 parties are working to make that happen as soon as it's possible. 
And now let's turn to what has historically been called HealthCare Partners, but is now, at least internally, referred to as DaVita Medical Group, Vijay Kotte, the Chief Financial Officer."
35644,332021620,972947,"DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 04, 2016",2016-05-04,"Earnings Calls","DaVita Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Kent. We'll first start with a review of the HCP Q1 performance. Operating income for the quarter, adjusted for the $77 million goodwill impairment and the $16 million Nevada hospice reserve, gets us to $36 million on a non-GAAP basis. Included in",508,"Thanks, Kent. We'll first start with a review of the HCP Q1 performance. Operating income for the quarter, adjusted for the $77 million goodwill impairment and the $16 million Nevada hospice reserve, gets us to $36 million on a non-GAAP basis. Included in the $36 million are approximately $9 million of onetime costs. When adjusted for these onetime costs, we get a normalized operating income of $45 million for the quarter. 
One question you will likely ask is to reconcile this with the first quarter of last year. To do this, we start with 2015 Q1 OI of $60 million, subtract 1/4 of the $58 million in MA and Medicaid rate cuts we had previously disclosed or $15 million and that gets you to $45 million, demonstrating a relatively flat underlying performance year-over-year. 
Now let's break down some of the drivers of performance for the quarter. There's some good things and some bad things. We'll start with the bad things. In addition to the rate cuts, Medicare Advantage enrollment in our legacy geographies grew less than in prior years, and we grew in line with our geographies. Additionally, our commercial membership continues to decline with the market. 
Now let's turn to some good stuff. We continue to close transactions. Earlier in the quarter, we closed on The Everett Clinic, a nationally recognized physician group that adds over 500 clinicians across 20-plus clinics, serving over 300,000 patients with an expected annual revenue of over $400 million. In addition, within our existing geographies, we have a healthy pipeline of opportunities, including a number of small tuck-ins as well as a few larger acquisitions in process. One example is our prior announcement of our intent to combine with Mountainview Medical Group, which has 50 clinicians across 14 clinics, serving over 80,000 patients, which, if closed, will strengthen our already healthy capabilities in Colorado Springs. 
As we have said before, we continue building capabilities. There are a couple of examples, one clinical and one operational. On the clinical side, we're expanding our very successful home care program from other geographies to Nevada, focusing on the needs of our high-risk patients in order to avoid unnecessary hospitalizations and readmissions. On the operational front, we are centralizing national operations and expect to realize savings from scale and vendor consolidation. Just to remind you, there's been a significant transformation of the leadership team, and that group is picking up new momentum every month. The progress in all these activities, we have a good shot at adding approximately $30 million to OI and the remaining 3 quarters of 2016, above the Q1 normalized rate of $170 million, bringing us to approximately $200 million for the year, the midpoint of our guidance range. So we are maintaining our guidance range of $175 million $225 million, although we acknowledge that achieving the high end may be less likely. We'll provide more details on our ongoing investments and operational capabilities and our longer-term outlook at Capital Markets Day in 2 weeks. 
Now I'll turn it over to Jim Hilger."

In regards to the overall enterprise, our debt expense was $103 million in the first quarter, consistent with recent quarters. Next, the effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners was 40% in the quarter when you adjust for the nondeductible goodwill impairment charge in the HCP Nevada Hospice accrual. For the full year, we now expect the 2016 effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners to be in the range of 39.5 to 40.5. 
Now turning to cash flow. We continue to generate strong cash flows. Operating cash flow was $429 million in the first quarter and on an adjusted basis, $1.88 billion for the 12 months. As we've discussed before, over time, Kidney Care contribute about 75% of our operating cash flows. HCP contributes about 25%, notably higher than its contribution percentage to our enterprise operating income. 
Regarding capital deployment. The first quarter -- during the first quarter, we purchased 3.7 million shares for $249 million at an average price of $67.61, but we've not made any additional repurchases since our last earnings call. Please note that we continuously weigh capital deployment opportunities across growth investment, share repurchases, debt repayment and holding cash. 
And now finally on to outlook, I'd just like to restate our outlook. We are still expecting our consolidated operating income for 2016 to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.95 billion. We expect our operating income for Kidney Care to be in the range of $1.625 billion to $1.725 billion, and we expect income for HCP to be in the range of $175 million to $225 million. And our cash flow -- our operating cash flow expectation is in the range of $1.55 billion to $1.75 billion. As always, these guidance ranges capture majority of the probabilistic outcomes that we can foresee. 
And with that, operator, let's go ahead and open it up for Q&A."

As to clinical outcomes, we'll discuss them first as we always do because that is what comes first. We are, first and foremost, a caregiving company. And the Kidney Care side is where we'll focus our clinical comments on this call. We'll probably rotate back and forth between the various parts of the enterprise each quarter. We have about 178,000 dialysis patients now in the U.S. That's about 35% of all the patients in the U.S. And from a vaccination point of view, our outcomes relative to the community are very strong. Pneumonia vaccinations at 92% for patients; influenza vaccinations, 92% for patients; and Team A [ph] influenza vaccinations at 84%. And as many of you know, improving performance in vaccinations also leads to fewer hospitalizations and, as always, in our areas around the enterprise, our improved clinical outcomes are also very good for the taxpayer. For more color on U.S. Kidney Care financial results, let's hear from Javier Rodriguez."

First, I'll cover the quarter, and then secondly, I will cover full year guidance. For the quarter, we had a strong operating income of $422 million, and let me cover some of the highlights: Number one, normalized NAG was 4.1%, which represented continued improvement over the prior quarters, and it is consistent with our guidance that we gave last year for our 3 years of 3.5% to 4.5%. Our rate per treatment increased by $2.34 per treatment, and it was mainly driven through higher acute mix and improved commercial mix. These improvements were partially offset by fewer treatment days, which is normal in Q1. And as a reminder, the quarter benefited from an extra date due to a leap year, and seasonally higher cost and treatment, number one, primarily due to higher personnel costs from payroll taxes and higher pharma costs from seasonally higher EPO utilization due to the delay of the flu. Happy with the quarter. 
Our guidance for Kidney Care remains unchanged at $1.625 billion to $1.725 [ph] billion. And as always, arrange in total captures the majority of the probabilistic outcomes. And based on where we are today, we are more likely to be on the top half of the guidance range. 
The primary reason for leaving our guidance unchanged is driven by some economic uncertainties surrounding the exchange plans of the ACA. Let me summarize with 4 points on our experience on the ACA: Number one, it is working for patients. Americans, who otherwise would not have insurance, are now insured; number two, many people are far better insured and have better coverage than they had before, including many of our patients that are benefiting from the insurance coverage; number three, the regulatory environment around exchanges is still being built. While many pairs are living up to the spirit of the ACA, others are changing their fine print and their plan designs to avoid paying for expensive chronic diseases, either by cost shifting to the patient or by making the plans unattractive for the expensive chronically ill in other ways. It might be helpful to give an example. We had in one state a plan that tried to limit dialysis benefits and shifted significant economic responsibility to the patient, which, as many of you know, these patients can clearly not afford. Once we alerted the regulatory agencies, the plans were instructed to remedy their behavior. That being said, we're seeing more effort by some of the payers to improve their economics in the exchange plan by making it more difficult for dialysis patients to enroll. This is a complicated issue, which will require regulatory environment. As you know, it happens to be a tough year because of the election and many are distracted. Therefore, the dynamics around enforcement are hard for us to predict. I'll state the obvious, patients and providers will continue to work with regulators as this unfolds. 
Lastly, as you know, not unique to us, there are larger macroeconomics and political risks that are clouding the future of the exchanges. Therefore, it's hard to handicap, with certainty, how this will play out for us. We'll talk about some of these issues in our longer-term outlook in 2 weeks, as we see you in Capital Markets. 
I'll pass it back to you, Kent."

The losses, as you've seen, were $10 million in the quarter, and this is in line with our guidance of approximately $40 million on the year. The most noteworthy new news on the international front is our definitive agreement to form a joint venture to grow our Kidney Care business in Asia with 2 partners: Khazanah and Mitsui. Khazanah is a highly respected sovereign wealth fund of the government of Malaysia with an investment portfolio greater than $30 billion. And Mitsui, as many of you know, one of the largest oldest business groups in Japan with about $45 billion in annual revenue, and it recently designated health care as a key strategic domain for themselves corporately going forward. They are both experienced in health care already and are value-added partners for us, not just investors. One of their noteworthy successes in the Asian health care scene is they have a majority stake, approximately 60% stake in IHH Healthcare, which many don't realize, is the second-largest hospital company in the world by market cap. Their market cap is about $13 billion at this point, and we're very excited to have them as our partners. 
The financial terms, just to the summary level, each of Khazanah and Mitsui will invest $150 million over the next few years, and each will receive in return a 20% ownership stake. We will, of course, still be the majority owner therefore, and we will be running the enterprise with them as our very active partners. 
Just to give you a sense of the current scope of the business, we have 64 clinics that serve about 3,300 patients across 5 countries in that part of the world. The definitive agreement is subject to a few closing conditions, so it could take some time to complete, but all 3 parties are working to make that happen as soon as it's possible. 
And now let's turn to what has historically been called HealthCare Partners, but is now, at least internally, referred to as a DaVita Medical Group, Vijay Kotte, the Chief Financial Officer."
35644,332021620,973230,"DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 04, 2016",2016-05-04,"Earnings Calls","DaVita Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Kent. We'll first start with a review of the HCP Q1 performance. Operating income for the quarter, adjusted for the $77 million goodwill impairment and the $16 million Nevada hospice reserve, gets us to $36 million on a non-GAAP basis. Included in",508,"Thanks, Kent. We'll first start with a review of the HCP Q1 performance. Operating income for the quarter, adjusted for the $77 million goodwill impairment and the $16 million Nevada hospice reserve, gets us to $36 million on a non-GAAP basis. Included in the $36 million are approximately $9 million of onetime costs. When adjusted for these onetime costs, we get a normalized operating income of $45 million for the quarter. 
One question you will likely ask is to reconcile this with the first quarter of last year. To do this, we start with 2015 Q1 OI of $60 million, subtract 1/4 of the $58 million in MA and Medicaid rate cuts we had previously disclosed are $15 million and that gets you to $45 million, demonstrating a relatively flat underlying performance year-over-year. 
Now let's break down some of the drivers of performance for the quarter. There's some good things and some bad things. We'll start with the bad things. In addition to the rate cuts, Medicare Advantage enrollment in our legacy geographies grew less than in prior years, and we grew in line with our geographies. Additionally, our commercial membership continues to decline with the market. 
Now let's turn to some good stuff. We continue to close transactions. Earlier in the quarter, we closed on The Everett Clinic, a nationally recognized physician group that adds over 500 clinicians across 20-plus clinics, serving over 300,000 patients with an expected annual revenue of over $400 million. In addition, within our existing geographies, we have a healthy pipeline of opportunities, including a number of small tuck-ins, as well as a few larger acquisitions in process. One example is our prior announcement of our intent to combine with Mountain View Medical Group, which has 50 clinicians across 14 clinics, serving over 80,000 patients, which, if closed, will strengthen our already healthy capabilities in Colorado Springs. 
As we have said before, we continue building capabilities. There are a couple of examples, one clinical and one operational. On the clinical side, we're expanding our very successful Home Care program from other geographies to Nevada, focusing on the needs of our high-risk patients in order to avoid unnecessary hospitalizations and readmissions. On the operational front, we're centralizing national operations and expect to realize savings from scale and vendor consolidation. To remind you, there's been a significant transformation of the leadership team, and that group is picking up new momentum every month. To progress on all these activities, we have a good shot at adding approximately $30 million to OI in the remaining 3 quarters of 2016, above the Q1 normalized rate of $170 million, bringing us to approximately $200 million for the year, the midpoint of our guidance range. So we are maintaining our guidance range of $175 million to $225 million, although we acknowledge that achieving the high end may be less likely. We'll provide more details on our ongoing investments and operational capabilities and a longer-term outlook at Capital Markets Day in 2 weeks. 
Now I'll turn it over to Jim Hilger."

In regards to the overall enterprise, our debt expense was $103 million in the first quarter, consistent with recent quarters. Next, the effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners was 40% in the quarter when you adjust for the nondeductible goodwill impairment charge in the HCP Nevada hospice accrual. For the full year, we now expect the 2016 effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners to be in the range of 39.5% to 40.5%. 
Now turning to cash flow. We continue to generate strong cash flows. Operating cash flow was $429 million in the first quarter and on an adjusted basis, $1.88 billion for the 12 months. As we've discussed before, over time, Kidney Care contributes about 75% of our operating cash flows. HCP contributes about 25%, notably higher than its contribution percentage to our enterprise operating income. 
Regarding capital deployment. The first quarter -- during the first quarter, we purchased 3.7 million shares for $249 million at an average price of $67.61, but we've not made any additional repurchases since our last earnings call. Please note that we continuously weigh capital deployment opportunities across growth investment, share repurchases, debt repayment and holding cash. 
And now, finally, on to outlook. I'd just like to restate our outlook. We are still expecting our consolidated operating income for 2016 to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.95 billion. We expect our operating income for Kidney Care to be in the range of $1.625 billion to $1.725 billion, and we expect income for HCP to be in the range of $175 million to $225 million. And our cash flow -- our operating cash flow expectation is in the range of $1.55 billion to $1.75 billion. As always, these guidance ranges capture majority of the probabilistic outcomes that we can foresee.

As to clinical outcomes, we'll discuss them first as we always do because that is what comes first. We are, first and foremost, a caregiving company. On the Kidney Care side is where we'll focus our clinical comments on this call. We'll probably rotate back and forth between the various parts of the enterprise each quarter. We have about 178,000 dialysis patients now in the U.S. That's about 35% of all the patients in the U.S. And from a vaccination point of view, our outcomes relative to the community are very strong. Pneumonia vaccinations at 92% for patients; influenza vaccinations, 92% for patients; and teammate influenza vaccinations at 84%. And as many of you know, improving performance in vaccinations also leads to fewer hospitalizations and, as always, in our areas around the enterprise, our improved clinical outcomes are also very good for the taxpayer.

First, I'll cover the quarter, and then secondly, I will cover full year guidance. For the quarter, we had a strong operating income of $422 million, and let me cover some of the highlights: Number one, normalized NAG was 4.1%, which represented continued improvement over the prior quarters, and it is consistent with our guidance that we gave last year for our 3 years of 3.5% to 4.5%. Our rate per treatment increased by $2.34 per treatment, and it was mainly driven through higher acute mix and improved commercial mix. These improvements were partially offset by fewer treatment days, which is normal in Q1. And as a reminder, the quarter benefited from an extra day due to a leap year, and seasonally higher cost and treatment, number one, primarily due to higher personnel costs from payroll taxes and higher pharma costs from seasonally higher EPO utilization due to the delay of the flu. Happy with the quarter. 
Our guidance for Kidney Care remains unchanged at $1.625 billion to $1.75 billion. And as always, our range in total captures the majority of the probabilistic outcomes. And based on where we are today, we are more likely to be on the top half of the guidance range. 
The primary reason for leaving our guidance unchanged is driven by some economic uncertainties surrounding the exchange plans of the ACA. Let me summarize with 4 points on our experience on the ACA: Number one, it is working for patients. Americans, who otherwise would not have insurance, are now insured; number two, many people are far better insured and have better coverage than they had before, including many of our patients that are benefiting from the insurance coverage; number three, the regulatory environment around exchanges is still being built. While many payers are living up to the spirit of the ACA, others are changing their fine print in their plan designs to avoid paying for expensive chronic diseases, either by cost shifting to the patient or by making the plans unattractive for the expensive chronically ill in other ways. It might be helpful to give an example. We had in one state a plan that tried to limit dialysis benefits and shifted significant economic responsibility to the patient, which, as many of you know, these patients can clearly not afford. Once we alerted the regulatory agencies, the plans were instructed to remedy their behavior. That being said, we're seeing more effort by some of the payers to improve their economics in the exchange plan by making it more difficult for dialysis patients to enroll. This is a complicated issue, which will require regulatory environment. As you know, it happens to be a tough year because of the election and many are distracted. Therefore, the dynamics around enforcement are hard for us to predict. I'll state the obvious, patients and providers will continue to work with regulators as this unfolds. 
Lastly, as you know, not unique to us, there are larger macroeconomics and political risks that are clouding the future of the exchanges. Therefore, it's hard to handicap, with certainty, how this will play out for us. We'll talk about some of these issues in our longer-term outlook in 2 weeks, as we see you in Capital Markets. 
I'll pass it back to you, Kent."

The losses, as you've seen, were $10 million in the quarter, and this is in line with our guidance of approximately $40 million on the year. The most noteworthy new news on the international front is our definitive agreement to form a joint venture to grow our Kidney Care business in Asia with 2 partners: Khazanah and Mitsui. Khazanah is a highly respected sovereign wealth fund of the government of Malaysia with an investment portfolio greater than $30 billion. And Mitsui, as many of you know, one of the largest oldest business groups in Japan with about $45 billion in annual revenue, and it recently designated health care as a key strategic domain for themselves corporately going forward. They are both experienced in health care already and are value-added partners for us, not just investors. One of their noteworthy successes in the Asian health care scene is they have a majority stake, approximately 60% stake in IHH Healthcare, which many don't realize, is the second-largest hospital company in the world by market cap. Their market cap is about $13 billion at this point, and we're very excited to have them as our partners. 
The financial terms, just at a summary level, each of Khazanah and Mitsui will invest $150 million over the next few years, and each will receive in return a 20% ownership stake. We will, of course, still be the majority owner therefore, and we will be running the enterprise with them as our very active partners. 
Just to give you a sense of the current scope of the business, we have 64 clinics that serve about 3,300 patients across 5 countries in that part of the world. The definitive agreement is subject to a few closing conditions, so it could take some time to complete, but all 3 parties are working to make that happen as soon as is possible. 
And now let's turn to what has historically been called HealthCare Partners, but is now, at least internally, referred to as the DaVita Medical Group, Vijay Kotte, the Chief Financial Officer."
35644,332021620,973357,"DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 04, 2016",2016-05-04,"Earnings Calls","DaVita Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Kent. We'll first start with a review of the HCP Q1 performance. Operating income for the quarter, adjusted for the $77 million goodwill impairment and the $16 million Nevada hospice reserve, gets us to $36 million on a non-GAAP basis. Included in",509,"Thanks, Kent. We'll first start with a review of the HCP Q1 performance. Operating income for the quarter, adjusted for the $77 million goodwill impairment and the $16 million Nevada hospice reserve, gets us to $36 million on a non-GAAP basis. Included in the $36 million are approximately $9 million of onetime costs. When adjusted for these onetime costs, we get a normalized operating income of $45 million for the quarter. 
One question you will likely ask is to reconcile this with the first quarter of last year. To do this, we start with 2015 Q1 OI of $60 million, subtract one quarter of the $58 million in MA and Medicaid rate cuts we had previously disclosed, or $15 million, and that gets you to $45 million, demonstrating a relatively flat underlying performance year-over-year. 
Now let's break down some of the drivers of performance for the quarter. There's some good things and some bad things. We'll start with the bad things. In addition to the rate cuts, Medicare Advantage enrollment in our legacy geographies grew less than in prior years, and we grew in line with our geographies. Additionally, our commercial membership continues to decline with the market. 
Now let's turn to some good stuff. We continue to close transactions. Earlier in the quarter, we closed on The Everett Clinic, a nationally recognized physician group that adds over 500 clinicians across 20-plus clinics, serving over 300,000 patients with an expected annual revenue of over $400 million. In addition, within our existing geographies, we have a healthy pipeline of opportunities, including a number of small tuck-ins, as well as a few larger acquisitions in process. One example is our prior announcement of our intent to combine with Mountain View Medical Group, which has 50 clinicians across 14 clinics, serving over 80,000 patients, which, if closed, will strengthen our already healthy capabilities in Colorado Springs. 
As we have said before, we continue building capabilities. There are a couple of examples, one clinical and one operational. On the clinical side, we're expanding our very successful Home Care program from other geographies to Nevada, focusing on the needs of our high-risk patients in order to avoid unnecessary hospitalizations and readmissions. On the operational front, we're centralizing national operations and expect to realize savings from scale and vendor consolidation. To remind you, there's been a significant transformation of the leadership team, and that group is picking up new momentum every month. To progress on all these activities, we have a good shot at adding approximately $30 million to OI in the remaining 3 quarters of 2016, above the Q1 normalized rate of $170 million, bringing us to approximately $200 million for the year, the midpoint of our guidance range. So we are maintaining our guidance range of $175 million to $225 million, although we acknowledge that achieving the high end may be less likely. We'll provide more details on our ongoing investments and operational capabilities and a longer-term outlook at Capital Markets Day in 2 weeks. 
Now I'll turn it over to Jim Hilger."

In regards to the overall enterprise, our debt expense was $103 million in the first quarter, consistent with recent quarters. Next, the effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners was 40% in the quarter when you adjust for the nondeductible goodwill impairment charge in the HCP Nevada hospice accrual. For the full year, we now expect the 2016 effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners to be in the range of 39.5% to 40.5%. 
Now turning to cash flow. We continue to generate strong cash flows. Operating cash flow was $429 million in the first quarter and on an adjusted basis, $1.88 billion for the 12 months. As we've discussed before, over time, Kidney Care contributes about 75% of our operating cash flows. HCP contributes about 25%, notably higher than its contribution percentage to our enterprise operating income. 
Regarding capital deployment. The first quarter -- during the first quarter, we purchased 3.7 million shares for $249 million at an average price of $67.61, but we have not made any additional repurchases since our last earnings call. Please note that we continuously weigh capital deployment opportunities across growth investment, share repurchases, debt repayment and holding cash. 
And now, finally, on to outlook. I'd just like to restate our outlook. We are still expecting our consolidated operating income for 2016 to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.95 billion. We expect our operating income for Kidney Care to be in the range of $1.625 billion to $1.725 billion, and we expect income for HCP to be in the range of $175 million to $225 million. And our cash flow -- our operating cash flow expectation is in the range of $1.55 billion to $1.75 billion. As always, these guidance ranges capture a majority of the probabilistic outcomes that we can foresee.

We delivered solid adjusted operating income and strong cash flows in this particular quarter. The total adjusted operating income was $475 million, as many of you have already seen, which were driven by the strong Kidney Care results at $431 million and a disappointing DaVita Medical Group trajectory reflected with $44 million on a non-GAAP basis there. Operating cash flow's another bright spot of $517 million as we continue to successfully convert your earnings into your cash.
We'll discuss several topics here before we get into Q&A to. Number 2 is clinical outcomes; number 2 is DMG results; number 3 is U.S. Kidney Care; number 4, a little bit of an update on international; and number 5 is just some additional financial enterprise-level details.
Let's start with clinical outcomes. As we always do, we are first and foremost, a caregiving company and quite good at it. Now about 185,000 patients in the U.S. alone, about 35% of all dialysis patients in America. One of the areas where we've increased our focus is in reducing bloodstream infections, a very big deal to our patients, a very big deal to their families, a very big deal to the taxpayer. It's important because this keeps patients out of the hospital. Bloodstream infections are one of the top 5 causes of hospitalizations for these patients, and this impacts both Quip [ph] and 5-Star [ph]. We are now performing blood-pressure tests on more than 90% of the situations when a patient is present or assigned with symptoms of bloodstream infections. We'll never get to 100, but 90 is remarkably higher than where we were x years ago and where some aid dialysis centers are today.
Despite testing a greater percentage of all the patients, we've actually decreased our blood stream infection rate by 16% over the last 12 months, and we're working both sides of the equation with tenacity and some success. 
On the DMG side, the DaVita Medical Group year-to-date, we've outperformed on the focus HEDIS measures that CMS uses to track medicare advantage clinical quality to compared to the same period last year. And as a result, we are on track to achieve greater than 4 stars in all of our planned relationships. For some more detail on the DaVita Medical Group, I'll turn it over to Vijay Kotte."

Turning to this quarter's performance, operating income was $44 million, excluding non-GAAP items as detailed in our earnings release. Unfortunately, year-to-date, we have financially underperformed relative to plan, and we expect this gap to increase in the second half of this year. As a result, we are lowering our 2016 full year guidance to $110 million to $150 [ph] million. The decrease in guidance has 4 primary drivers: We preserve its growth, Medicare Advantage growth, and rebranding effort. To provide a little more color, let me walk you through those.
First, our fee-for-service revenue growth has not met our expectation. Our target with 6% year-over-year, but we're achieving 3%. Second, we made a mistake forecasting 2016 operating profit by overestimating expected reconciliation payments for prior year Medicare Advantage revenue. Third, while our in-year [ph] Medicare Advantage of growth has been in line with broader enrollment trends in the geographies we operate in, it's lower than we've previously expected. Fourth, as we stated on our last call, we are rebranding from healthcare partners to the DaVita Medical Group. To accomplish this, we expect to spend $5 million to $10 million this year that wasn't previously included in our forecast. In addition, we will need to accelerate the noncash amortization of $110 million worth of existing trademark intangibles associated with the legacy healthcare partners band. This accelerated amortization has been excluded from our revised 2016 and long-term guidance. Despite these disappointments, we are making good progress on the key items we identified at Capital Markets.
In terms of fee-for-service to value conversion, we are progressing and contracting discussions with health plan while developing value-based care capabilities in our newer markets. Additionally, we continue to invest in the business, which we believe will fuel our long-term success. One example is our investment in 7 new DeNovo clinics, which are capital-efficient growth platform similar to what you are used to seeing in Kidney Care.
Finally, as we look towards our long-term outlook, our 2019 OI target remained $250 million.
Now I will turn it over to Javier Rodriguez to speak a little bit more about Kidney Care."
35644,377729485,1030231,"DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 08, 2016",2016-08-08,"Earnings Calls","DaVita Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Vijay, and hello, everyone. Before I talk about the quarter, I'd like to highlight a recent development that we're very excited about. In our Capital Markets Day, we talked about the powerful benefit of integrated care for chronic populations,",436,"Thank you, Vijay, and hello, everyone. Before I talk about the quarter, I'd like to highlight a recent development that we're very excited about. In our Capital Markets Day, we talked about the powerful benefit of integrated care for chronic populations, including our own ESRD patients. Since then, 2 new pieces of legislations that are supported by the dialysis community have been introduced in Congress. 
The first is called the Dialysis Patient Demonstration Act, and that provides for true integrated care model for Kidney Care patients. The second is called the ESRD Choice Act of 2016, and that was finally allowed for ESRD patients to enroll an MA plans. Was of the sex will be a great gift to ESRD patients and play to our long-term strategy of integrated care.
We're hopeful about their prospects in Congress due to the strong bipartisan support, and we will continue to work hard to pursue integrated care for our patients. 
Now on to our quarterly results. Overall, DaVita Kidney Care had a strong and reasonably straightforward quarter, so I won't go into much detail here. As Kent said, we delivered strong operating income of $431 million due to a slight improvement in revenue per treatment over Q1 as well as slight reduction in cost for its treatment. With respect to growth, our normalized non-acquired growth for the quarter was 4.3%, which falls within our long-term target range of 3.5% to 4.5%.
With the first half of the year now behind us, we're raising the bottom end of our 2016 guidance range by $50 million. This is consistent with our comments from last quarter that we're more likely to be in the top half of our original guidance. With this change, our new Kidney Care operating income guidance for 2016 is now $1.675 billion to $1.725 billion. As for next year, we plan to provide 2017 guidance during our fourth quarter earnings call. We made this change last year because ACA plans have become a more meaningful part of our commercial mix. This has added some new drivers of upside and downside to our business and our industry as well as some seasonality. Providing guidance on our fourth quarter call allows us to incorporate the additional visibility we gained during open enrollment period.
Before I turn it back to KT, I want to close by saying we remain excited about the fundamentals of our business, the gradual shift towards integrated care and the fact that our teammates are recognized for providing the best outcomes and quality of life for kidney patients.
Now back to Kent to discuss our international business."

Just to refresh year memory, Khazanah and Mitsui have each subscribed to acquire 20% share of ownership over time. At the closing, each provided $50 million of funding to the JV in return for each receiving a 6.7% stake. We're excited to have them as partners.

In regards to the JV with Khazanah and Mitsui, please note that we expect that this joint venture will be deconsolidated from our financials and thus, future operating results will run through equity investment income for our pro rata share of ownership in the joint venture. Please note that we expect to record a material noncash onetime gain in connection with the formation of this JV, and this gain is excluded from our guidance.
Now onto the overall enterprise. Our debt expense was $103 million in the second quarter, consistent with recent quarters. Next, the effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners was 37.2% in the quarter when adjusted for the nondeductible goodwill impairment charge and recognition of a state tax -- income tax benefit. We expect the full year effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners on our adjusted income for 2016 to be in the range of 39% to 40%.
Now turning to cash flow. We continue to generate strong cash flows. Operating cash flow was $517 million in the quarter and $2.06 billion for the last 12 months. The last 12 months benefited from the timing of tax payments. We expect full year 2016 operating cash flow to be between $1.6 billion and $1.75 billion.
One thing to keep in mind when thinking about the cash flows of our individual operating segments is that DMG generates a disproportionately higher share of our cash flows than its share of our adjusted operating income. While the midpoint of our DMG guidance for adjusted operating income is $130 million, the business has a year-to-date annual run rate of $200 million in noncash depreciation and amortization expense. In addition, as you will recall, there is a cash tax reduction of approximately $100 million per year, which is the equivalent to $167 million improvement in pretax operating income. This cash tax benefit is due to the tax rates of step-up created when we acquired the medical group.
And finally, as the vast majority of GMG's business is capitated care, where we are paid before in current expenses, it has favorable cash flow characteristics with low to negative working capital. Thus, DMG contributes more to our operating cash flows than its first apparent when looking at operating income.
We continue to have a very strong cash balance with $1.68 billion [ph] in cash and short-term investments as of June 30. We continue to weigh capital deployment opportunities across growth investment, share repurchases, debt repayment and holding cash. Additionally, as disclosed in our earnings release, our Board of Directors just increased our share repurchase authorization from the remaining $259 million to now $1.5 billion. 
And with that, I will now turn the call back over to Ken Kent Thiry."

What we have found is that regulators, once they really hear our patients' needs and what they literally need is choice, they're quite sympathetic to the cost, and so it will play out state-by-state. And of course, the patients and ourselves will do the best we can to make sure that they have rights to these products regardless of the fact that they end up being expensive patients."

That's a very fair point. Maybe I'd refer to 4 chapters. Chapter 1 was huge reimbursement cut. $200 [ph] million of OI lost because of HealthCare Partners was more adept than others at capturing acuity codes, which we new going in but didn't anticipate that dramatic change in policy. We knew there would be some softening there and some compression and we knew it wouldn't be small, but we did not expect it would happen so much and so quickly and therefore, we own that. So chapter 1 was breathtaking reimbursement cuts, $200 million annually. Chapter 2 was pretty much total displacement of the leadership. California, Nevada, Florida, the 3 markets essentially at 100% change. And that took time. And of course, while you're doing it at does get in the way of things getting done and it thus create some transitional. Chapter 3 is bring in the new infrastructure. You can buy the house on the best lot with the best architectural bonds, but if it needs new heating, ventilating, air-conditioning, you've got a lot of work to do. That doesn't really start showing up until it's done, but it makes a hell of a difference as to the experience of going inside. And so that's a chapter where in the midst of right now. Chapter 4 is the one we're just starting to feel in some places where we're bringing a new level of operating excellence, a new level of innovation and an enhanced value proposition, new levels of creative activity and contracting, but these are just little. little saplings breaking through the surface right now. The good news is they're there and we're ready to take care of them. So I would divide the world into 4 chapters and then I would offer up my empathy for the fact that so many of the shareholders have had to live through the excruciating burden of chapters 1 through 3."

There's pockets of profitability within healthcare and then you have pockets of loss, for example, for us, about 80% of our patients are Medicare fee-for-service and we lose money on every one of them. It really doesn't make any sense, and so you end up having to think of it as an ecosystem where the plans have what might look like excessive margin somewhere and then have losses elsewhere. Where we take care of some patients, an absolute significant and ambiguous loss and other cases have higher margins than you expect us to, so you sort of have to end up looking at it as an ecosystem and see if anyone part of it is getting out of balance because it's hard to get each individual part of it exactly right."

And then the final part of your question was an international impairment. We did have a small international impairment last year. Well, we did not have 1 this year."

We delivered solid adjusted operating income and strong cash flows in this particular quarter. The total adjusted operating income was $475 million, as many of you have already seen, which were driven by the strong Kidney Care results at $431 million and a disappointing DaVita Medical Group trajectory reflected with $44 million on a non-GAAP basis there. Operating cash flow is another bright spot of $517 million as we continue to successfully convert your earnings into your cash.
We'll discuss several topics here before we get into Q&A. Number one is clinical outcomes; number two is DMG results; number three is U.S. Kidney Care; number four, a little bit of an update on international; and number five is just some additional financial enterprise-level details.
Let's start with clinical outcomes. As we always do, we are, first and foremost, a caregiving company and quite good at it. Now about 185,000 patients in the U.S. alone, about 35% of all dialysis patients in America. One of the areas where we've increased our focus is on reducing bloodstream infections, a very big deal to our patients, a very big deal to their families, a very big deal to the taxpayer. It's important because this keeps patients out of the hospital. Bloodstream infections are one of the top 5 causes of hospitalizations for these patients, and this impacts both QIP and 5-Star. We are now performing blood-culture test on more than 90% of the situations when a patient is present with signs and symptoms of bloodstream infections. We'll never get to 100, but 90 is remarkably higher than where we were x years ago and where so many dialysis centers are today.
Despite testing a greater percentage of eligible patients, we've actually decreased our bloodstream infection rate by 16% over the last 12 months, and we're working both sides of the equation with tenacity and some success. 
On the DMG side, the DaVita Medical Group, year-to-date, we've outperformed on the focused HEDIS measures that CMS uses to track Medicare advantage clinical quality compared to the same period last year. And as a result, we are on track to achieve greater than 4 stars in all of our planned relationships. For some more detail on the DaVita Medical Group, I turn it over to Vijay Kotte."

Turning to this quarter's performance, operating income was $44 million, excluding non-GAAP items as detailed in our earnings release.

Turning to this quarter's performance, operating income was $44 million, excluding non-GAAP items as detailed in our earnings release. Unfortunately, year-to-date, we have financially underperformed relative to plan, and we expect this gap to increase in the second half of the year. As a result, we are lowering our 2016 full year guidance to $110 million to $150 million. The decrease in guidance has 4 primary drivers: We preserve its growth, Medicare Advantage growth, and rebranding effort. To provide a little more color, let me walk you through those.
First, our fee-for-service revenue growth has not met our expectations. Our target with 6% year-over-year, but we're achieving 3%. Second, we made a mistake forecasting 2016 operating profit by overestimating expected reconciliation payments for prior year Medicare Advantage revenue. Third, while our in-year Medicare Advantage membership growth has been in line with broader enrollment trends in the geographies we operate in, it is lower than we've previously expected. Fourth, as we stated on our last call, we are rebranding from healthcare partners to the DaVita Medical Group. To accomplish this, we expect to spend $5 million to $10 million this year that wasn't previously included in our forecast. In addition, we will need to accelerate the noncash amortization of $110 million worth of existing trademark intangibles associated with the legacy healthcare partners brand. This accelerated amortization has been excluded from our revised 2016 and long-term guidance. Despite these disappointments, we are making good progress on the key items we identified at Capital Market.
In terms of fee for service to value conversion, we are progressing and contracting discussions with health plan while developing value-based care capabilities in our newer markets. Additionally, we continue to invest in the business, which we believe will fuel our long-term success. One example is our investment in 7 new de novo clinics, which are capital-efficient growth platform similar to what you are used to seeing in Kidney Care.
Finally, as we look towards our long-term outlook, our 2019 OI target remained $250 million.
Now I will turn it over to Javier Rodriguez to speak a little bit more about Kidney Care."
35644,377729485,1030444,"DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 08, 2016",2016-08-08,"Earnings Calls","DaVita Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Vijay, and hello, everyone. Before I talk about the quarter, I'd like to highlight a recent development that we're very excited about. At our Capital Markets Day, we talked about the powerful benefits of integrated care for chronic populations,",436,"Thank you, Vijay, and hello, everyone. Before I talk about the quarter, I'd like to highlight a recent development that we're very excited about. At our Capital Markets Day, we talked about the powerful benefits of integrated care for chronic populations, including our own ESRD patients. Since then, 2 new pieces of legislation that are supported by the dialysis community have been introduced in Congress. 
The first is called the Dialysis PATIENT Demonstration Act, and that provides for true integrated care model for kidney care patients. The second is called the ESRD Choice Act of 2016, and that would finally allow for ESRD patients to enroll in MA plans. Both of these acts would be a great gift to ESRD patients and play to our long-term strategy of integrated care.
We're hopeful about their prospects in Congress due to the strong bipartisan support, and we will continue to work hard to pursue integrated care for our patients. 
Now on to our quarterly results. Overall, DaVita Kidney Care had a strong and reasonably straightforward quarter, so I won't go into much detail here. As Kent said, we delivered strong operating income of $431 million due to a slight improvement in revenue per treatment over Q1 as well as slight reduction in cost for its treatment. With respect to growth, our normalized Non-Acquired growth for the quarter was 4.3%, which falls within our long-term target range of 3.5% to 4.5%.
With the first half of the year now behind us, we're raising the bottom end of our 2016 guidance range by $50 million. This is consistent with our comments from last quarter that we're more likely to be in the top half of our original guidance. With this change, our new Kidney Care operating income guidance for 2016 is now $1.675 billion to $1.725 billion. As for next year, we plan to provide 2017 guidance during our fourth quarter earnings call. We made this change last year because ACA plans have become a more meaningful part of our commercial mix. This has added some new drivers of upside and downside to our business and our industry as well as some seasonality. Providing guidance on our fourth quarter call allows us to incorporate the additional visibility we gained during open enrollment period.
Before I turn it back to KT, I want to close by saying we remain excited about the fundamentals of our business, the gradual shift toward integrated care, and the fact that our teammates are recognized for providing the best outcomes and quality of life for kidney patients.
Now back to Kent to discuss our international business."

And a number of you probably saw it that we did, in fact, close the transaction that we had to announce 4 to 5 to 6 weeks ago, that being our JV transaction with Khazanah and Mitsui on August 1. 
Just to refresh year memory, Khazanah and Mitsui have each subscribed to acquire 20% share of ownership over time. At the closing, each provided $50 million of funding to the JV in return for each receiving a 6.7% stake. We're excited to have them as partners. We have a very long-term point of view about the opportunity in that part of the world as do they, and we think they're going to help us accelerate and deepen our growth.

In regards to the JV with Khazanah and Mitsui, please note that we expect that this joint venture will be deconsolidated from our financials and thus, future operating results will run through equity investment income for our pro rata share of ownership in the joint venture. Please note that we expect to record a material noncash onetime gain in connection with the formation of this JV, and this gain is excluded from our guidance.
Now onto the overall enterprise. Our debt expense was $103 million in the second quarter, consistent with recent quarters. Next, the effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners was 37.2% in the quarter when adjusted for the nondeductible goodwill impairment charge and recognition of a state income tax benefit. We expect the full year effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners on our adjusted income for 2016 to be in the range of 39% to 40%.
Now turning to cash flow. We continue to generate strong cash flows. Operating cash flow was $517 million in the quarter and $2.06 billion for the last 12 months. The last 12 months benefited from the timing of tax payments. We expect full year 2016 operating cash flow to be between $1.6 billion and $1.75 billion.
One thing to keep in mind when thinking about the cash flows of our individual operating segments is that DMG generates a disproportionately higher share of our cash flows than its share of our adjusted operating income. While the midpoint of our DMG guidance for adjusted operating income is $130 million, the business has a year-to-date annual run rate of $200 million in noncash depreciation and amortization expense. In addition, as you will recall, there is a cash tax reduction of approximately $100 million per year, which is the equivalent to $167 million improvement in pretax operating income. This cash tax benefit is due to the tax rates of step-up created when we acquired the medical group.
And finally, as the vast majority of DMG's business is capitated care, where we are paid before incurring expenses, it has favorable cash flow characteristics with low to negative working capital. Thus, DMG contributes more to our operating cash flows than its first apparent when looking at operating income.
We continue to have a very strong cash balance with $1.68 billion in cash and short-term investments as of June 30. We continue to weigh capital deployment opportunities across growth investment, share repurchases, debt repayment and holding cash. Additionally, as disclosed in our earnings in our release, our Board of Directors just increased our share repurchase authorization from the remaining $259 million to now $1.5 billion. 
And with that, I will now turn the call back over to Kent Thiry."

And in general, we do get paid more for an MA dialysis patient than a Medicare fee-for-service patient.

And so we're feeling pretty darn good. But we also set out to do something that really hasn't been done very often, and so we just don't have a lot of illusions about skipping up the mountain we know we're never going to skin our knees a couple of times on the way."

And so in a world right now where in 2014, the exchanges came into play, we've heard so much about the risk pools and how they're not well-funded. And so a new product comes into market, our dialysis patients and our social workers worked really hard to make sure that they explain and understand their new product. And at that time, the patient and the patient alone makes a decision on what's right for them. As you know, many of the chronic and high-cost disease states have caused these risk pools to be challenging to the payers. I think that they've -- in some instances, have highlighted ESRD expense, but the reality is that it's pretty much all chronic diseases. So CMS is evaluating third-party premium assistance to see what their stance is, but it's complicated around the health care continuum. And so right now, they're evaluating because the last thing they want to do is use a broad brush and then have consequences on one disease state versus another. So right now, what's going on is that in every state, people are trying to lobby to get one thing or another. What we have found is that regulators, once they really hear our patients' needs and what they literally need is choice, they're quite sympathetic to the cost, and so it will play out state by state. And of course, the patients and ourself will do the best we can to make sure that they have rights to these products regardless of the fact that they end up being expensive patients."

Maybe I'd refer to -- for the 4 chapters. Chapter 1 was huge reimbursement cut, $200 million of OI lost because HealthCare Partners was more adept than others at capturing acuity codes, which we new going in but didn't anticipate the dramatic change in policy. We knew there would be some softening there and some compression, and we knew it wouldn't be small, but we did not expect it would happen so much and so quickly, and therefore, we own that. So chapter 1 was breathtaking reimbursement cuts, $200 million annually. Chapter 2 was pretty much total displacement of the leadership. California, Nevada, Florida, the 3 markets essentially at 100% change. And that took time. And of course, while you're doing it, it does get in the way of things getting done, and it does create some transitional trauma. Chapter 3 is bring in the new infrastructure. You can buy the house on the best lot with the best architectural bonds, but if it needs new heating, ventilating, air conditioning, you got a lot of work to do. But that doesn't really start showing up until it's done, but it makes a hell of a difference as to the experience of going inside. And so that's a chapter we're in the midst of right now. Chapter 4 is the one we're just starting to feel in some places where we're bringing a new level of operating excellence, a new level of innovation and an enhanced value proposition, new levels of creativity in contracting, but these are just little saplings breaking through the surface right now. The good news is they're there, and we're ready to take care of them. So I would divide the world into 4 chapters and then I would offer up my empathy for the fact that so many of these shareholders have had to live through the excruciating burden of chapters 1 through 3."

For example, for us, about 80% of our patients are Medicare fee-for-service and we lose money on every one of them. It really doesn't make any sense. And so you end up having to kind of think of it as an ecosystem where the plans have what might look like excessive margin somewhere and then have losses elsewhere, where we take care of some patients, an absolute significant and ambiguous loss, and other cases have higher margins than you expect us to. So you sort of have to end up looking at it as an ecosystem and see if anyone, part of it, is getting out of balance because it's hard to get each individual part of it exactly right."

We delivered solid adjusted operating income and strong cash flows in this particular quarter. The total adjusted operating income was $475 million, as many of you have already seen, which were driven by the strong Kidney Care results at $431 million and a disappointing DaVita Medical Group trajectory reflected with $44 million on a non-GAAP basis there. Operating cash flow is another bright spot of $517 million as we continue to successfully convert your earnings into your cash.
We'll discuss several topics here before we get into Q&A. Number one is clinical outcomes; number two is DMG results; number three is U.S. Kidney Care; number four, a little bit of an update on international; and number five is just some additional financial enterprise-level details.
Let's start with clinical outcomes, as we always do. We are, first and foremost, a caregiving company and quite good at it. Now about 185,000 patients in the U.S. alone, about 35% of all dialysis patients in America. One of the areas where we've increased our focus is on reducing bloodstream infections: a very big deal to our patients, a very big deal to their families, a very big deal to the taxpayer. It's important because this keeps patients out of the hospital. Bloodstream infections are one of the top 5 causes of hospitalizations for these patients, and this impacts both QIP and 5-Star. We are now performing blood-culture tests on more than 90% of the situations when a patient is present with signs and symptoms of bloodstream infections. We'll never get to 100, but 90 is remarkably higher than where we were x years ago and where so many dialysis centers are today.
Despite testing a greater percentage of eligible patients, we've actually decreased our bloodstream infection rate by 16% over the last 12 months, and we're working both sides of the equation with tenacity and some success. 
On the DMG side, the DaVita Medical Group, year-to-date, we've outperformed on the focused HEDIS measures that CMS uses to track Medicare advantage clinical quality compared to the same period last year. And as a result, we are on track to achieve greater than 4 stars in all of our plan relationships. For some more detail on the DaVita Medical Group, I turn it over to Vijay Kotte."

Turning to this quarter's performance, operating income was $44 million, excluding non-GAAP items as detailed in our earnings release. Unfortunately, year-to-date, we have financially underperformed relative to plan, and we expect this gap t",358,"Thanks, Kent. Turning to this quarter's performance, operating income was $44 million, excluding non-GAAP items as detailed in our earnings release. Unfortunately, year-to-date, we have financially underperformed relative to plan, and we expect this gap to increase in the second half of the year. As a result, we are lowering our 2016 full year guidance to $110 million to $150 million. The decrease in guidance has 4 primary drivers: fee for service growth, Medicare Advantage growth, and rebranding effort. To provide a little more color, let me walk you through those.
First, our fee-for-service revenue growth has not met our expectations. Our target was 6% year-over-year, but we're achieving 3%. Second, we made a mistake forecasting 2016 operating profit by overestimating expected reconciliation payments for prior year Medicare Advantage revenue. Third, while our in-year Medicare Advantage membership growth has been in line with broader enrollment trends in the geographies we operate in, it is lower than we've previously expected. Fourth, as we stated on our last call, we are rebranding from Healthcare Partners to the DaVita Medical Group. To accomplish this, we expect to spend $5 million to $10 million this year that wasn't previously included in our forecast. In addition, we will need to accelerate the noncash amortization of $110 million worth of existing trademark intangibles associated with the legacy Healthcare Partners brand. This accelerated amortization has been excluded from our revised 2016 and long-term guidance. Despite these disappointments, we are making good progress on the key items we identified at Capital Markets.
In terms of fee for service to value conversion, we are progressing in contracting discussions with health plan while developing value-based care capabilities in our newer markets. Additionally, we continue to invest in the business, which we believe will fuel our long-term success. One example is our investment in 7 new de novo clinics, which are a capital-efficient growth platform similar to what you are used to seeing in Kidney Care.
Finally, as we look towards our long-term outlook, our 2019 OI target remains $250 million.
Now I will turn it over to Javier Rodriguez to speak a little bit more about Kidney Care."
35644,377729485,1030518,"DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 08, 2016",2016-08-08,"Earnings Calls","DaVita Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Vijay, and hello, everyone. Before I talk about the quarter, I'd like to highlight a recent development that we're very excited about. At our Capital Markets Day, we talked about the powerful benefits of integrated care for chronic populations,",436,"Thank you, Vijay, and hello, everyone. Before I talk about the quarter, I'd like to highlight a recent development that we're very excited about. At our Capital Markets Day, we talked about the powerful benefits of integrated care for chronic populations, including our own ESRD patients. Since then, 2 new pieces of legislation that are supported by the dialysis community have been introduced in Congress. 
The first is called the Dialysis PATIENT Demonstration Act, and that provides for true integrated care model for kidney care patients. The second is called the ESRD Choice Act of 2016, and that would finally allow for ESRD patients to enroll in MA plans. Both of these acts would be a great gift to ESRD patients and play to our long-term strategy of integrated care.
We're hopeful about their prospects in Congress due to the strong bipartisan support, and we will continue to work hard to pursue integrated care for our patients. 
Now on to our quarterly results. Overall, DaVita Kidney Care had a strong and reasonably straightforward quarter, so I won't go into much detail here. As Kent said, we delivered strong operating income of $431 million due to a slight improvement in revenue per treatment over Q1 as well as a slight reduction in costs for treatment. With respect to growth, our normalized Non-Acquired growth for the quarter was 4.3%, which falls within our long-term target range of 3.5% to 4.5%.
With the first half of the year now behind us, we're raising the bottom end of our 2016 guidance range by $50 million. This is consistent with our comments from last quarter that we're more likely to be in the top half of our original guidance. With this change, our new Kidney Care operating income guidance for 2016 is now $1.675 billion to $1.725 billion. As for next year, we plan to provide 2017 guidance during our fourth quarter earnings call. We made this change last year because ACA plans have become a more meaningful part of our commercial mix. This has added some new drivers of upside and downside to our business and our industry as well as some seasonality. Providing guidance on our fourth quarter call allows us to incorporate the additional visibility we gained during open enrollment period.
Before I turn it back to KT, I want to close by saying we remain excited about the fundamentals of our business, the gradual shift toward integrated care, and the fact that our teammates are recognized for providing the best outcomes and quality of life for kidney patients.
Now back to Kent to discuss our international business."

Please note that we expect to record a material noncash onetime gain in connection with the formation of this JV, and this gain is excluded from our guidance.
Now onto the overall enterprise. Our debt expense was $103 million in the second quarter, consistent with recent quarters. Next, the effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners was 37.2% in the quarter when adjusted for the nondeductible goodwill impairment charge and recognition of a state income tax benefit. We expect the full year effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners on our adjusted income for 2016 to be in the range of 39% to 40%.
Now turning to cash flow. We continue to generate strong cash flows. Operating cash flow was $517 million in the quarter and $2.06 billion for the last 12 months. The last 12 months benefited from the timing of tax payments. We expect full year 2016 operating cash flow to be between $1.6 billion and $1.75 billion.
One thing to keep in mind when thinking about the cash flows of our individual operating segments is that DMG generates a disproportionately higher share of our cash flows than its share of our adjusted operating income. While the midpoint of our DMG guidance for adjusted operating income is $130 million, the business has a year-to-date annual run rate of $200 million in noncash depreciation and amortization expense. In addition, as you will recall, there is a cash tax reduction of approximately $100 million per year, which is the equivalent to $167 million improvement in pretax operating income. This cash tax benefit is due to the tax basis step-up created when we acquired the medical group.
And finally, as the vast majority of DMG's business is capitated care, where we are paid before incurring expenses, it has favorable cash flow characteristics with low to negative working capital. Thus, DMG contributes more to our operating cash flows than is first apparent when looking at operating income.
We continue to have a very strong cash balance with $1.68 billion in cash and short-term investments as of June 30. We continue to weigh capital deployment opportunities across growth investment, share repurchases, debt repayment and holding cash. Additionally, as disclosed in our earnings release, our Board of Directors just increased our share repurchase authorization from the remaining $259 million to now $1.5 billion. 
And with that, I will now turn the call back over to Kent Thiry."

Number one, with the DaVita Medical Group, we're certainly sorry that we had to reduce the guidance, and the fact that it will take even more time to get it to where we think we can be regularly growing earnings. And that's what we're intensely intent on doing, but it will take some time. Number two, DaVita Kidney Care, wonderfully solid results yet again, probably even better than that. At the same time, as JR has talked about recently, we could have some choppiness at the high levels. And we are maniacally continuing to invest in becoming even more differentiated than we are today in quality, in service, in physician experience, in IT, et cetera. Third of four is the cash flow. Your cash flow continues to be a powerful weapon to be deployed in your defense and on offense. And lastly, fourth, we continue to have a lot of belief in our overall business platform, everything from our geographic footprint to our capabilities by function, et cetera, et cetera.

And so in a world right now where in 2014, the exchanges came into play, we've heard so much about the risk pools and how they're not well-funded. And so a new product comes into market, our dialysis patients and our social workers work really hard to make sure that they explain and understand their new product. And at that time, the patient and the patient alone makes a decision on what's right for them. As you know, many of the chronic and high-cost disease states have caused these risk pools to be challenging to the payers. I think that they've -- in some instances, have highlighted ESRD expense, but the reality is that it's pretty much all chronic diseases. So CMS is evaluating third-party premium assistance to see what their stance is, but it's complicated around the health care continuum. And so right now, they're evaluating because the last thing they want to do is use a broad brush and then have consequences on one disease state versus another. So right now, what's going on is that in every state, people are trying to lobby to get one thing or another. What we have found is that regulators, once they really hear our patients' needs, and what they literally need is choice, they're quite sympathetic to the cause. And so it will play out state by state. And of course, the patients and ourselves will do the best we can to make sure that they have rights to these products regardless of the fact that they end up being expensive patients."

Maybe I'd refer to sort of 4 chapters. Chapter 1 was huge reimbursement cut: $200 million of OI lost because HealthCare Partners was more adept than others at capturing acuity codes, which we knew going in but didn't anticipate the dramatic change in policy. We knew there would be some softening there and some compression. And we knew it wouldn't be small, but we did not expect it would happen so much and so quickly, and therefore, we own that. So chapter 1 was breathtaking reimbursement cuts, $200 million annually. Chapter 2 was pretty much total displacement of the leadership. California, Nevada, Florida, the 3 markets, essentially, a 100% change. And that took time. And of course, while you're doing it, it does get in the way of things getting done, and it does create some transitional trauma. Chapter 3 is bring in the new infrastructure. You can buy the house on the best lot with the best architectural bones, but if it needs new heating, ventilating, air conditioning, you got a lot of work to do. It doesn't really start showing up until it's done, but it makes a hell of a difference as to the experience of going inside. And so that's the chapter we're in the midst of right now. Chapter 4 is the one we're just starting to feel in some places where we're bringing a new level of operating excellence, a new level of innovation and an enhanced value proposition, new levels of creativity in contracting. But these are just little saplings breaking through the surface right now. The good news is they're there, and we're ready to take care of them. So I would divide the world into 4 chapters, and then I would offer up my empathy for the fact that so many of you shareholders have had to live through the excruciating burden of chapters 1 through 3."

For example, for us, about 80% of our patients are Medicare fee-for-service and we lose money on every one of them. It really doesn't make any sense. And so you end up having to kind of think of it as an ecosystem where the plans have what might look like excessive margin somewhere and then have losses elsewhere, where we take care of some patients at an absolute significant and unambiguous loss and in other cases have higher margins than you expect us to. So you sort of have to end up looking at it as an ecosystem and see if any one part of it is getting out of balance because it's hard to get each individual part of it exactly right."

Additionally, the FASB is looking at changing the rules around accounting for goodwill impairments. When they do that, there may be an effect related to the adoption of those new rules. And then the final part of your question was an international impairment. We did have a small international impairment last year, but we did not have one this year."

We delivered solid adjusted operating income and strong cash flows in this particular quarter. The total adjusted operating income was $475 million, as many of you have already seen, which were driven by the strong Kidney Care results at $431 million and a disappointing DaVita Medical Group trajectory reflected with $44 million on a non-GAAP basis there. Operating cash flow is another bright spot of $517 million as we continue to successfully convert your earnings into your cash.
We'll discuss several topics here before we get into Q&A. Number one is clinical outcomes; number two is DMG results; number three is U.S. Kidney Care; number four, a little bit of an update on international; and number five is just some additional financial enterprise-level details.
Let's start with clinical outcomes, as we always do. We are, first and foremost, a caregiving company and quite good at it. Now about 185,000 patients in the U.S. alone, about 35% of all dialysis patients in America. One of the areas where we've increased our focus is on reducing bloodstream infections: a very big deal to our patients, a very big deal to their families, a very big deal to the taxpayer. It's important because this keeps patients out of the hospital. Bloodstream infections are one of the top 5 causes of hospitalizations for these patients, and this impacts both QIP and 5-Star. We are now performing blood-culture tests on more than 90% of the situations when a patient is present with signs and symptoms of bloodstream infections. We'll never get to 100, but 90 is remarkably higher than where we were x years ago and where so many dialysis centers are today.
Despite testing a greater percentage of eligible patients, we've actually decreased our bloodstream infection rate by 16% over the last 12 months, and we're working both sides of the equation with tenacity and some success. 
On the DMG side, the DaVita Medical Group, year-to-date, we've outperformed on the focused HEDIS measures that CMS uses to track Medicare advantage clinical quality compared to the same period last year. And as a result, we are on track to achieve greater than 4 stars in all of our plan relationships. For some more detail on the DaVita Medical Group, I turn it over to Vijay Kotte."

Turning to this quarter's performance, operating income was $44 million, excluding non-GAAP items as detailed in our earnings release. Unfortunately, year-to-date, we have financially underperformed relative to plan, and we expect this gap t",358,"Thanks, Kent. Turning to this quarter's performance, operating income was $44 million, excluding non-GAAP items as detailed in our earnings release. Unfortunately, year-to-date, we have financially underperformed relative to plan, and we expect this gap to increase in the second half of the year. As a result, we are lowering our 2016 full year guidance to $110 million to $150 million. The decrease in guidance has 4 primary drivers: fee for service growth, Medicare Advantage growth, and rebranding effort. To provide a little more color, let me walk you through those.
First, our fee-for-service revenue growth has not met our expectations. Our target was 6% year-over-year, but we're achieving 3%. Second, we made a mistake forecasting 2016 operating profit by overestimating expected reconciliation payments for prior year Medicare Advantage revenue. Third, while our in-year Medicare Advantage membership growth has been in line with broader enrollment trends in the geographies we operate in, it is lower than we've previously expected. Fourth, as we stated on our last call, we are rebranding from Healthcare Partners to the DaVita Medical Group. To accomplish this, we expect to spend $5 million to $10 million this year that wasn't previously included in our forecast. In addition, we will need to accelerate the noncash amortization of $110 million worth of existing trademark intangibles associated with the legacy Healthcare Partners brand. This accelerated amortization has been excluded from our revised 2016 and long-term guidance. Despite these disappointments, we are making good progress on the key items we identified at Capital Markets.
In terms of fee for service to value conversion, we are progressing in contracting discussions with health plan while developing value-based care capabilities in our newer markets. Additionally, we continue to invest in the business, which we believe will fuel our long-term success. One example is our investment in 7 new de novo clinics, which are a capital-efficient growth platform similar to what you are used to seeing in Kidney Care.
Finally, as we look towards our long-term outlook, our 2019 OI target remains $250 million.
Now I will turn it over to Javier Rodriguez to speak a little bit more about Kidney Care."
35644,377729485,1030678,"DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 08, 2016",2016-08-08,"Earnings Calls","DaVita Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Vijay, and hello, everyone. Before I talk about the quarter, I'd like to highlight a recent development that we're very excited about. At our Capital Markets Day, we talked about the powerful benefits of integrated care for chronic populations,",436,"Thank you, Vijay, and hello, everyone. Before I talk about the quarter, I'd like to highlight a recent development that we're very excited about. At our Capital Markets Day, we talked about the powerful benefits of integrated care for chronic populations, including our own ESRD patients. Since then, 2 new pieces of legislation that are supported by the dialysis community have been introduced in Congress. 
The first is called the Dialysis PATIENT Demonstration Act, and that provides for true integrated care model for kidney care patients. The second is called the ESRD Choice Act of 2016, and that would finally allow for ESRD patients to enroll in MA plans. Both of these acts would be a great gift to ESRD patients and play to our long-term strategy of integrated care.
We're hopeful about their prospects in Congress due to the strong bipartisan support, and we will continue to work hard to pursue integrated care for our patients. 
Now on to our quarterly results. Overall, DaVita Kidney Care had a strong and reasonably straightforward quarter, so I won't go into much detail here. As Kent said, we delivered strong operating income of $431 million due to a slight improvement in revenue per treatment over Q1 as well as a slight reduction in costs for treatment. With respect to growth, our normalized Non-Acquired growth for the quarter was 4.3%, which falls within our long-term target range of 3.5% to 4.5%.
With the first half of the year now behind us, we're raising the bottom end of our 2016 guidance range by $50 million. This is consistent with our comments from last quarter that we're more likely to be in the top half of our original guidance. With this change, our new Kidney Care operating income guidance for 2016 is now $1.675 billion to $1.725 billion. As for next year, we plan to provide 2017 guidance during our fourth quarter earnings call. We made this change last year because ACA plans have become a more meaningful part of our commercial mix. This has added some new drivers of upside and downside to our business and our industry as well as some seasonality. Providing guidance on our fourth quarter call allows us to incorporate the additional visibility we gained during open enrollment period.
Before I turn it back to KT, I want to close by saying we remain excited about the fundamentals of our business, the gradual shift toward integrated care, and the fact that our teammates are recognized for providing the best outcomes and quality of life for kidney patients.
Now back to Kent to discuss our international business."

Just to refresh your memory, Khazanah and Mitsui have each subscribed to acquire 20% share of ownership over time. At the closing, each provided $50 million of funding to the JV in return for each receiving a 6.7% stake. We're excited to have them as partners.

Now I'll turn it over to Jim Hilger to cover some more enterprise financials."
35644,377729485,1030678,"DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 08, 2016",2016-08-08,"Earnings Calls","DaVita Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Kent, and just a little more about our Asia Pacific joint venture.

In regards to the JV with Khazanah and Mitsui, please note that we expect that this joint venture will be deconsolidated from our financials and thus, future operating results will run through equity investment income for our pro rata share of ownership in the joint venture. Please note that we expect to record a material noncash onetime gain in connection with the formation of this JV, and this gain is excluded from our guidance.
Now onto the overall enterprise. Our debt expense was $103 million in the second quarter, consistent with recent quarters. Next, the effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners was 37.2% in the quarter when adjusted for the nondeductible goodwill impairment charge and recognition of a state income tax benefit. We expect the full year effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners on our adjusted income for 2016 to be in the range of 39% to 40%.
Now turning to cash flow. We continue to generate strong cash flows. Operating cash flow was $517 million in the quarter and $2.06 billion for the last 12 months. The last 12 months benefited from the timing of tax payments. We expect full year 2016 operating cash flow to be between $1.6 billion and $1.75 billion.
One thing to keep in mind when thinking about the cash flows of our individual operating segments is that DMG generates a disproportionately higher share of our cash flows than its share of our adjusted operating income. While the midpoint of our DMG guidance for adjusted operating income is $130 million, the business has a year-to-date annual run rate of $200 million in noncash depreciation and amortization expense. In addition, as you will recall, there is a cash tax reduction of approximately $100 million per year, which is the equivalent to $167 million improvement in pretax operating income. This cash tax benefit is due to the tax basis step-up created when we acquired the medical group.
And finally, as the vast majority of DMG's business is capitated care, where we are paid before incurring expenses, it has favorable cash flow characteristics with low to negative working capital. Thus, DMG contributes more to our operating cash flows than is first apparent when looking at operating income.
We continue to have a very strong cash balance with $1.68 billion in cash and short-term investments as of June 30. We continue to weigh capital deployment opportunities across growth investment, share repurchases, debt repayment and holding cash.

Number one, with the DaVita Medical Group, we're certainly sorry that we had to reduce the guidance, and the fact that it will take even more time to get it to where we think we can be regularly growing earnings. And that's what we're intensely intent on doing, but it will take some time. Number two, DaVita Kidney Care, wonderfully solid results yet again, probably even better than that. At the same time, as JR has talked about recently, we could have some choppiness at the high levels. And we are maniacally continuing to invest in becoming even more differentiated than we are today in quality, in service, in physician experience, in IT, et cetera. Third of four is the cash flow.

So CMS is evaluating third-party premium assistance to see what their stance is, but it's complicated around the health care continuum. And so right now, they're evaluating because the last thing they want to do is use a broad brush and then have consequences on one disease state versus another. So right now, what's going on is that in every state, people are trying to lobby to get one thing or another. What we have found is that regulators, once they really hear our patients' needs, and what they literally need is choice, they're quite sympathetic to the cause. And so it will play out state by state. And of course, the patients and ourselves will do the best we can to make sure that they have rights to these products regardless of the fact that they end up being expensive patients."

Maybe I'd refer to sort of 4 chapters. Chapter 1 was huge reimbursement cut: $200 million of OI lost because HealthCare Partners was more adept than others at capturing acuity codes, which we knew going in but didn't anticipate the dramatic change in policy. We knew there would be some softening there and some compression. And we knew it wouldn't be small, but we did not expect it would happen so much and so quickly, and therefore, we own that. So chapter 1 was breathtaking reimbursement cuts, $200 million annually. Chapter 2 was pretty much total displacement of the leadership. California, Nevada, Florida, the 3 markets, essentially, a 100% change. And that took time. And of course, while you're doing it, it does get in the way of things getting done, and it does create some transitional trauma. Chapter 3 is bring in the new infrastructure. You can buy the house on the best lot with the best architectural bones, but if it needs new heating, ventilating, air conditioning, you got a lot of work to do. It doesn't really start showing up until it's done, but it makes a hell of a difference as to the experience of going inside. And so that's the chapter we're in the midst of right now. Chapter 4 is the one we're just starting to feel in some places where we're bringing a new level of operating excellence, a new level of innovation and an enhanced value proposition, new levels of creativity in contracting. But these are just little saplings breaking through the surface right now. The good news is they're there, and we're ready to take care of them. So I would divide the world into 4 chapters, and then I would offer up my empathy for the fact that so many of you shareholders have had to live through the excruciating burden of chapters 1 through 3."

That might be another philosophical question to ask. The fact is it gets so interesting. There's pockets of profitability within health care and then you have pockets of loss. For example, for us, about 80% of our patients are Medicare fee-for-service and we lose money on every one of them. It really doesn't make any sense. And so you end up having to kind of think of it as an ecosystem where the plans have what might look like excessive margin somewhere and then have losses elsewhere, where we take care of some patients at an absolute significant and unambiguous loss and in other cases have higher margins than you expect us to. So you sort of have to end up looking at it as an ecosystem and see if any one part of it is getting out of balance because it's hard to get each individual part of it exactly right."

And so if there is any further deterioration in performance or in our outlook of those markets, we could see a further impairment. Additionally, the FASB is looking at changing the rules around accounting for goodwill impairments. When they do that, there may be an effect related to the adoption of those new rules.

I will cover 3 topics: Number one, Monday's announcement; number two, our Q3 Kidney Care performance; and number three, our outlook. So let's get started.
We hope the release on Monday was helpful. I won't be repetitive here, but we've had a lot of questions, so let me take some and if I miss them, please bring them up in Q&A. As a full warning, I'll go into some technical detail because the subject matter requires it.
First, why did we announced the decision on Monday only 2 days before our earning call? It's a simple answer. This is open enrollment that started yesterday, and we needed to provide clarity to our patients and our teammates.
Second, is this a permanent change in policy? No. We have only temporarily suspended support for applications to the American Kidney Fund for patients enrolled in minimum essential Medicaid coverage. When CMS provides guidance, which we expect will be within a couple of weeks, we will evaluate our future policy.
Third, does our announcement signify a concern over our historical practices? No. Our historical practices were illegal and compliant. That said, the language in RFI may confuse some, so I thought it would be useful to clarify further.
The RFI has primarily 3 concerns. One, were the patient enrolled in Medicare purchased an ACA plan that was duplicative in coverage. None of our patients who were enrolled in Medicare enrolled in the ACA plan. The regulations cited in the RFA, which referred to Medicare supplemental plan is not germane to the ACA Plan.
Number two, whether patients lost their Medicaid coverage as a result of purchasing an ACA Plan and therefore, were exposed to additional costs. Our patient did not lose their Medicaid coverage as a result of purchasing an ACA Plan and as a result, were not exposed to additional costs. Consistent with CMS' own education materials, we educated our patients on the ability to pick -- purchase an ACA Plan while retaining Medicaid coverage as a secondary. This patient did not apply for tax credits and subsidies.
And three, whether patients expensed a disruption in continuum of care as a result of purchasing an ACA Plan. Just a small portion of our Medicaid patients made the choice to purchase an ACA Plan, and they did so for their own personal reasons such as to have access to specialists who do not accept Medicaid or increased chance of qualifying for transplantation or other reasons. We are not aware of any patient experiencing a disruption in care likely because those patients who would have had such a disruption made the choice not to enroll in an ACA Plan.
Lastly, there have been some questions around comparing our disclosure of 5,000 patients versus public information from other providers. I believe that the confusion is around some definitions. When refer to individual market plans or ACA Plan, we refer to the full universe of individual plan, whether they're sold on or off the government-run exchanges. A distinction between these types of plans is not relevant because both affect the same risk pools and are generally subject to the same regulation. If you're trying to compare us to other providers, it is important to clarify definitions to ensure that the comparison is an apples-to-apples line.
Now let's discuss our Q3 performance. Overall, DaVita Kidney Care had a solid quarter. We delivered adjusted operating income of $439 million. For U.S. dialysis, our normalized non-acquired growth for the quarter was 4.4%, which falls within our long-term target range of 3.5% to 4.5%. While we're on the topic of volume, we want to share that we signed an amendment to the agreement of Renal Ventures to acquire 100% interest in their dialysis centers for $360 million, which is $55 million less than previously announced purchase price. We expect the transaction will close in the first quarter of 2017.
Our revenue per treatment was up sequentially by 1.7 -- $1.72 per treatment, primarily driven by an increase in seasonal administration of flu vaccine. Our patient care cost per treatment were up versus Q2 by $2.41 per treatment, driven by 2 primary factors: approximately 60% by an increase in labor benefits costs and 40% by an increase in facility costs. We have seen a tightening in labor markets leading to some increase in our labor costs. In the near term, we may see the labor costs remain at higher levels. We expect that our facility costs to come down over the next couple of quarters.
Now onto our outlook. Since we have now visibility to the end of the year, we're updating our 2016 adjusted operating income guidance for Kidney Care to be in the range of $1.695 billion to $1.725 billion. We will provide you with 2017 guidance on our Q4 earnings call when we expect to have additional clarity on several variables, including open enrollment and policy changes from CMS.
Now I'll turn the call to Vijay Kotte for DMG."
35644,404162533,1070997,"DaVita Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","DaVita Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Javier. First, financial performance. We noted on the Q2 call that we will see accelerated noncash amortization expense for the ACP brand during the transition to DMG, which would impact our reported operating income. This will run for 30 month",340,"Thank you, Javier. First, financial performance. We noted on the Q2 call that we will see accelerated noncash amortization expense for the ACP brand during the transition to DMG, which would impact our reported operating income. This will run for 30 months at an incremental rate of slightly more than $2 million per month or $26 million on an annualized basis beginning September 2016. Including the impact of this accelerated amortization, operating income for the quarter was $33 million.
As we look at the full year, we are narrowing our 2016 adjusted operating income guidance to a range of $115 million to $145 million. This is effectively a slight increase as our guidance now includes the impact of the $9 million in accelerated brand amortization that was previously excluded.
Another question is how to think about 2017. We're still in the midst of our budget process, and open enrollment plays a big part in our outlook. That being said, there are some things we know. First, $40 million in rate cuts, which includes $30 million related to the Medicare model change and $10 million for Medicaid. Second, we have the $26 million of accelerated brand amortization. And third, we are continuing to make incremental investments in the business. Despite these headwinds, the odds are they will be roughly flat year-over-year, but there are reasonable probabilities on the other side of that. We will go into further detail regarding our expectation for 2017 on the Q4 earnings call.
As we continue to look towards our long-term OI, our 2019 target remain $215 million.
Finally, I want to provide a few highlights on the operating progress we're making at DMG. With regard to claims process without the need for manual intervention, 2015 we're at 26%; and in 2016, 79%. With regards to services getting electronic authorizations, 2015 was 24%, 2016 is 47%. And finally, with regards to new tuck inclination, in 2015, we had 18; and in 2016, we're at 44.
Now to Jim Hilger for some financial details on the quarter."

Our international operating income was $368 million in the quarter, which improves the gain on the deconsolidation of the APAC JV of $374 million. We are on track to meet our guidance for app",600,"Thanks, Vijay. I'll first address our international operations. Our international operating income was $368 million in the quarter, which improves the gain on the deconsolidation of the APAC JV of $374 million. We are on track to meet our guidance for approximately $40 million in adjusted losses for 2016.
Our JV transaction with Khazanah and Mitsui closed on August 1. As you will recall, Khazanah and Mitsui have each subscribed to acquire 20% share of ownership of the joint venture. At closing, each partner made their first investment tranche of $50 million in return for a 6.7% ownership in the joint venture. This joint venture has been deconsolidated from our financials. Going forward, our pro rata share of its operating income will run through equity investment income in our income statement. As a result of this deconsolidation, we recorded a onetime noncash gain of $374 million. We are excluding this gain when reporting our adjusted non-GAAP financial results and excluding it from our adjusted operating guidance for 2016. We look forward to continuing our growth in Asia Pacific dialysis with the help of our new partners.
Next. I'd like to talk about a few tax items. In the third quarter, we recorded an adjustment related to tax assets created through the DMG acquisition escrow provisions. This adjustment resulted in a $27 million increase in corporate G&A expense that was offset by an equal reduction in income tax expense and thus, created no change in net earnings or earnings per share. We do not expect any ongoing impact from this adjustment.
Excluding this escrow provision tax adjustment and excluding the gain from the formation of the APAC dialysis joint venture, our tax rate attributable to DaVita was 40% in the quarter and 39% year-to-date. We expect our full year tax rate attributable to DaVita to be approximately 39%, when excluding all non-GAAP items.
Next, our interest expense increased slightly in the quarter to $105 million due to an increase in the interest rate cap amortization as well as the impact of the deconsolidation of the APAC joint venture. This higher level of interest expense reflects our go-forward run rate.
And finally, turning to our continued strong and consistent cash generation. Operating cash flow was $536 million in the third quarter and $1.92 billion for the last 12 months. We expect full year 2016 operating cash flow to be between $1.75 billion and $1.85 billion.
Since our last earnings release, we have repurchased 9.6 million shares for approximately $619 million. And through October, we have repurchased 13.3 million DaVita shares for approximately $868 million, which represents about 6.3% of the outstanding shares at the beginning of the year. Approximately 881 million remains outstanding under our board repurchase authorizations.
We continue to have a strong cash balance with nearly $1.6 billion in cash and short-term investments as of September 30. While $212 million was used in October to repurchase stock, and an additional $360 million will be used in the coming months for the completion of the Renal Venture acquisition, that still leaves us with over $1 billion of cash available before considering our continued strong cash-generating capabilities.
As discussed at our Capital Markets Day earlier this year, we expect to generate well over $5 billion in free cash flow to use for growth and share repurchases from 2016 to 2019. Even assuming a reasonable baseline of $1.5 billion in growth spending for development CapEx and acquisitions, this leaves over $3 billion for additional growth or share repurchase.
And now I'd like to turn it back to Kent for a few closing comments."

Some will be a little bit redundant to what JR said, but it's such an important topic. We think it's worthwhile to in order to achieve good clarity. Allow me 8 different points, please.
Number one. We fulfilled our regulatory responsibility to provide comprehensive education to our patients. This has been an industry requirement for the last 15 to 20 years, and then ACA was added onto that standard and long-standing process and practice.
Number two. A very small percentage of our Medicaid patients determined that an ACA Plan was better for them, and Javier mentioned some of the very significant reasons why some of those plans were way better for them and/or their families. I won't repeat the examples, but important and often beautiful improvements in care.
Number three. Nonetheless, if you look at the benchmark plan in EGHP plan, you see that total ESRD costs, meaning dialysis and hospital-related costs, et cetera, was about 1.3% of the total medical costs. That again is total ESRD costs in the numerator and then total medical costs for the plan in the denominator. In the ACA Plans, we estimate right now that, that percentage is only up to about 1.6%. And so it is a low absolute number and it's a low increase number.
Number four. We were very sensitive to the fact that some of these patients choosing an ACA Plan meant that we would be paid higher rates, commercial rates versus Medicaid rates. And therefore, we created a very intense oversight process to make sure that we did everything possible to live up to the CMS standards around objective presentation and information and absolutely letting the patient choose.
Number five. We, nonetheless, got swept up in the current huge controversies around the sustainability of the exchanges, and you're all sensitive to the huge political forces in play on that subject.
Number six. Why did dialysis, and in part DaVita, become a visible part of that controversy? Well, a, letter a, we're national, and so our numbers get added up nationally unlike a lot of health systems, which are regional or local.
B, our patients stick out. They're very high cost, very easy to identify, very discreet.
C, there have been abuses by providers in other segments and perhaps some abuses even in ESRD, and so upfront, we started to be painted with that brush by some without data to support.
D, some payers did have very large year-over-year increases in dialysis expense, and it was originally assumed that this must be from the process that I described earlier. But in fact, in many, probably most instances, it was driven by other factors. For example, sometimes, a plan had a differentially attractive product and would gain significant market share literally moving from having 50% of the ESRD patients in a market to 80%, thereby guaranteeing at least a 60% increase in your costs, having nothing to do with anything else other than product design. As we all know, this has been a very dynamic period, probably the most dynamic period ever in terms of alternative product design for insurance plans. And also, people have been struck by how smart the consumers are and how much shopping and switching they do. A second explainer in several markets is when there was a bad actor in the payer world, meaning someone who did inappropriate steering of patients away from themselves, leaving one of their competitors with a disproportionate percentage. And again, we're talking about 30%, 40% shifts in market share in some instances. A third driver out of probably a potential list of 7 or 8, but I'll stop after 3, is areas with relatively poor Medicaid coverage because that would naturally mean that there's a higher probability that a Medicaid patient would find an ACA Plan more attractive. This is just to give you a sense of what kind of things actually drove a lot of those year-over-year increases for particular plans because as we mentioned earlier, the aggregate reality only moved from 1.3 to 1.6.
But letter e, those high examples were taken to CMS and positioned as being reasonably representative of a broader movement. And at that point, CMS did not have the data of the 1.3 and the 1.6.
On to number 7 of 8. CMS is now starting to realize, contrary to initial impressions that, a, some of the numbers were misleading. That's not to say they were inaccurate if they were from a particular plan. They were just misleading. And as you start to stare at a number like a 0.3 increase, and again this is our estimate, but as you compare that to 22% rate increases on average, you can see that we were not a material source of the problem, nor are we a material source of the solution. 
Letter b, our patients made sensible choices, and we provided lots of examples to CMS as have other providers.
C, the fact that enrollment of dialysis patients within the ACA plans looks to be flat or down even without any change in Medicaid access in 2017 and '18, and of course, would be down even more with any restriction on the Medicaid front.
Letter d, CMS now is starting to see some of the reasons for the dramatic disparities in year-over-year dialysis expense increases and seeing how they have to do with product design, competition, et cetera.
And lastly, e, they also have a better sense of how charitable premium assistance has been embedded in the ESRD economic in clinical ecosystem for 20 years with a lot of guardrails and with the OIG's blessing, including blessing the aspect of provider funding.
So number 8 and final comment is, of course, the big question on everyone's mind, including ours, is what exactly is CMS going to decide with respect to this portfolio of decisions. And we don't know. No one knows. I think to their credit, they don't know right now because they're continuing to absorb information, and we are incredibly grateful and respectful that they are doing that.
Moving on to DMG. Just one happy announcement, and that is that Chuck Berg is joining our leadership team as Executive Chair of DaVita Medical Group. He'll report to me in my role as CEO of the enterprise. Chuck's been on our board since 2007. He has a wealth of experience in the health plan world, including having been the very successful executive chair of WealthCare Health Plans and prior to that, the CEO of Oxford Health Plans, where I was his nonexecutive chair. This experience, combined with his brain, makes him uniquely suited to help us evaluate our long-term strategic alternatives at DMG. And he will remain in our board in the meantime, and I and others look forward to working with him.

But looking ahead and just thinking about the changes, looks like the -- from USRDS data, there hasn't really been much incidence growth in the pre-65 [ph] population over the last 10 years. And when we couple that with the aging of the baby boomers and the Medicare from kind of commercial years, there's the indication that it could put a fair amount of pressure on commercial mix over time. So I guess my question is can you tell me whether this is a reasonable view? And if so, how should we think about this factor in relation to your typical kind of mid-single-digit long-term growth algorithm for the dialysis?"

And I think if you wanted to identify other worrisome long-term trends, you would also look at improved treatment regimens for diabetics and hypertensives. And commercial patients are more likely to benefit from improved treatment regimens. On the other hand, there's also things pushing in the other direction. We continue to be quite successful with our Non-Acquired Growth, and some of these hard times could lead a lot more small providers to sell or even shut down. In addition, we're very hopeful that Medicare Advantage continues to grow because we radically prefer a customer who cares about total value. And we tend to do much better in terms of both adding value to the system and getting reimbursed for it. In addition, as you know better than most, to the extent that the mix ever starts to put too much pressure on all the independent centers, the government has the easy option of doing that, which it's done 3 or 4 times before, and that's extending the MSP provision from originally 0 to 12 and 12 to 18 and 18 to 30. And so that's a safety valve that's never far away. Justin?"

I think that was very helpful. I think I understand those parameters. But I guess the question that I'm still struggling with is what the real growth rate the company has been over the past 3 years in the dialysis business because if I look at operating income growth over the last 3 years, it's been about 5% per year. But if I were to say that this 1 40 [ph] was either not sustainable or onetime in nature, then I'm getting like a 2% type growth in the dialysis business over the past 3 years. So how do we think about that? And that's the low end of what you guys think you're going to do over the next 3 years going forward. And when I think about the next 3 years versus the last 3 years, Medicare rates have been under pressure and likely will be in the same range. So why is the right way to think about growth over the next 3 years not the low end of that 3 to 7? Like what would cause you to do better than the low end of that range?

And so for the system, there's no increase in costs from their emergence in the second bucket of ACA plans. And then third, the third bucket, which is substantial, are people who are on private plans before. Before ACA existed, they had individual health insurance plans.

So let's get started.We hope the release o",843,"Thank you, Kent, and good afternoon. Since we spoke last, a lot has happened. I will cover 3 topics: number one, Monday's announcement; number two, our Q3 Kidney Care performance; and number three, our outlook. So let's get started.
We hope the release on Monday was helpful. I won't be repetitive here, but we've had a lot of questions. So let me take some, and if I miss them, please bring them up in Q&A. As a full warning, I'll go into some technical detail because the subject matter requires it.
First, why did we announce the decision on Monday, only 2 days before our earning call? It's a simple answer. This is open enrollment that started yesterday, and we needed to provide clarity to our patients and our teammates.
Second, is this a permanent change in policy? No. We have only temporarily suspended support for applications to the American Kidney Fund for patients enrolled in minimum essential Medicaid coverage. When CMS provides guidance, which we expect will be within a couple of weeks, we will evaluate our future policy.
Third, does our announcement signify a concern over our historical practices? No. Our historical practices were legal and compliant. That said, the language in RFI may confuse some, so I thought it would be useful to clarify further.
The RFI had primarily 3 concerns. One, whether patients enrolled in Medicare purchased an ACA Plan that was duplicative in coverage. None of our patients who were enrolled in Medicare enrolled in the ACA Plan. The regulations cited in the RFA, which referred to Medicare supplemental plan is not germane to the ACA Plan.
Number two, whether patients lost their Medicaid coverage as a result of purchasing an ACA Plan and therefore, were exposed to additional costs. Our patients did not lose their Medicaid coverage as a result of purchasing an ACA Plan and as a result, were not exposed to additional costs. Consistent with CMS' own education materials, we educated our patients on the ability to pick -- purchase an ACA Plan while retaining Medicaid coverage as a secondary. This patient did not apply for tax credits and subsidies.
And three, whether patients expensed a disruption in continuum of care as a result of purchasing an ACA Plan. Just a small portion of our Medicaid patients made the choice to purchase an ACA Plan, and they did so for their own personal reasons such as to have access to specialists who do not accept Medicaid or increased chance of qualifying for transplantation or other reasons. We are not aware of any patient experiencing a disruption in care likely because those patients who would have had such a disruption made the choice not to enroll in an ACA Plan.
Lastly, there have been some questions around comparing our disclosure of 5,000 patients versus public information from other providers. I believe that the confusion is around some definitions. When refer to individual market plans or ACA Plan, we refer to the full universe of individual plan, whether they're sold on or off the government-run exchanges. A distinction between these types of plans is not relevant because both affect the same risk pools and are generally subject to the same regulation. If you're trying to compare us to other providers, it is important to clarify definitions to ensure that the comparison is an apples-to-apples line.
Now let's discuss our Q3 performance. Overall, DaVita Kidney Care had a solid quarter. We delivered adjusted operating income of $439 million. For U.S. dialysis, our normalized non-acquired growth for the quarter was 4.4%, which falls within our long-term target range of 3.5% to 4.5%. While we're on the topic of volume, we want to share that we signed an amendment to the agreement of Renal Ventures to acquire 100% interest in their dialysis centers for $360 million, which is $55 million less than previously announced purchase price. We expect the transaction will close in the first quarter of 2017.
Our revenue per treatment was up sequentially by 1.7 -- $1.72 per treatment, primarily driven by an increase in seasonal administration of flu vaccine. Our patient care cost per treatment were up versus Q2 by $2.41 per treatment, driven by 2 primary factors: approximately 60% by an increase in labor benefits costs and 40% by an increase in facility costs. We have seen a tightening in labor markets leading to some increase in our labor costs. In the near term, we may see the labor costs remain at higher levels. We expect that our facility costs to come down over the next couple of quarters.
Now onto our outlook. Since we have now visibility to the end of the year, we're updating our 2016 adjusted operating income guidance for Kidney Care to be in the range of $1.695 billion to $1.725 billion. We will provide you with 2017 guidance on our Q4 earnings call when we expect to have additional clarity on several variables, including open enrollment and policy changes from CMS.
Now I'll turn the call to Vijay Kotte for DMG."

We noted on the Q2 call that we will see accelerated noncash amortization expense for the ACP brand during the transition to DMG, which would impact our reported operating income. This will run for 30 month",341,"Thank you, Javier. First, financial performance. We noted on the Q2 call that we will see accelerated noncash amortization expense for the ACP brand during the transition to DMG, which would impact our reported operating income. This will run for 30 months at an incremental rate of slightly more than $2 million per month or $26 million on an annualized basis beginning September 2016. Including the impact of this accelerated amortization, operating income for the quarter was $33 million.
As we look at the full year, we are narrowing our 2016 adjusted operating income guidance to a range of $115 million to $145 million. This is effectively a slight increase as our guidance now includes the impact of the $9 million in accelerated brand amortization that was previously excluded.
Another question is how to think about 2017. We're still in the midst of our budget process, and open enrollment plays a big part in our outlook. That being said, there are some things we know. First, $40 million in rate cuts, which includes $30 million related to the Medicare model change and $10 million for Medicaid. Second, we have the $26 million of accelerated brand amortization. And third, we are continuing to make incremental investments in the business. Despite these headwinds, the odds are they will be roughly flat year-over-year, but there are reasonable probabilities on the other side of that. We will go into further detail regarding our expectation for 2017 on the Q4 earnings call.
As we continue to look towards our long-term OI, our 2019 target remain $215 million.
Finally, I want to provide a few highlights on the operating progress we're making at DMG. With regard to claims process without the need for manual intervention, 2015 we're at 26%; and in 2016, 79%. With regards to services getting electronic authorizations, 2015 was 24%, 2016 is 47%. And finally, with regards to new tuck-in [ph] clinician, in 2015, we had 18; and in 2016, we're at 44.

We are on track to meet our guidance for app",600,"Thanks, Vijay. I'll first address our international operations. Our international operating income was $368 million in the quarter, which improves the gain on the deconsolidation of the APAC JV of $374 million. We are on track to meet our guidance for approximately $40 million in adjusted losses for 2016.
Our JV transaction with Khazanah and Mitsui closed on August 1. As you will recall, Khazanah and Mitsui have each subscribed to acquire 20% share of ownership of the joint venture. At closing, each partner made their first investment tranche of $50 million in return for a 6.7% ownership in the joint venture. This joint venture has been deconsolidated from our financials. Going forward, our pro rata share of its operating income will run through equity investment income in our income statement. As a result of this deconsolidation, we recorded a onetime noncash gain of $374 million. We are excluding this gain when reporting our adjusted non-GAAP financial results and excluding it from our adjusted operating guidance for 2016. We look forward to continuing our growth in Asia Pacific dialysis with the help of our new partners.
Next. I'd like to talk about a few tax items. In the third quarter, we recorded an adjustment related to tax assets created through the DMG acquisition escrow provisions. This adjustment resulted in a $27 million increase in corporate G&A expense that was offset by an equal reduction in income tax expense and thus, created no change in net earnings or earnings per share. We do not expect any ongoing impact from this adjustment.
Excluding this escrow provision tax adjustment and excluding the gain from the formation of the APAC dialysis joint venture, our tax rate attributable to DaVita was 40% in the quarter and 39% year-to-date. We expect our full year tax rate attributable to DaVita to be approximately 39%, when excluding all non-GAAP items.
Next, our interest expense increased slightly in the quarter to $105 million due to an increase in the interest rate cap amortization as well as the impact of the deconsolidation of the APAC joint venture. This higher level of interest expense reflects our go-forward run rate.
And finally, turning to our continued strong and consistent cash generation. Operating cash flow was $536 million in the third quarter and $1.92 billion for the last 12 months. We expect full year 2016 operating cash flow to be between $1.75 billion and $1.85 billion.
Since our last earnings release, we have repurchased 9.6 million shares for approximately $619 million. And through October, we have repurchased 13.3 million DaVita shares for approximately $868 million, which represents about 6.3% of the outstanding shares at the beginning of the year. Approximately 881 million remains outstanding under our board repurchase authorizations.
We continue to have a strong cash balance with nearly $1.6 billion in cash and short-term investments as of September 30. While $212 million was used in October to repurchase stock, and an additional $360 million will be used in the coming months for the completion of the Renal Venture acquisition, that still leaves us with over $1 billion of cash available before considering our continued strong cash-generating capabilities.
As discussed at our Capital Markets Day earlier this year, we expect to generate well over $5 billion in free cash flow to use for growth and share repurchases from 2016 to 2019. Even assuming a reasonable baseline of $1.5 billion in growth spending for development CapEx and acquisitions, this leaves over $3 billion for additional growth or share repurchase.
And now I'd like to turn it back to Kent for a few closing comments."

Allow me 8 different points, pleas",1162,"Thanks, Jim, and I'd actually like to make several additional comments. Some will be a little bit redundant to what JR said, but it's such an important topic. We think it's worthwhile to in order to achieve good clarity. Allow me 8 different points, please.
Number one. We fulfilled our regulatory responsibility to provide comprehensive education to our patients. This has been an industry requirement for the last 15 to 20 years, and then ACA was added onto that standard and long-standing process and practice.
Number two. A very small percentage of our Medicaid patients determined that an ACA Plan was better for them, and Javier mentioned some of the very significant reasons why some of those plans were way better for them and/or their families. I won't repeat the examples, but important and often beautiful improvements in care.
Number three. Nonetheless, if you look at the benchmark plan in EGHP plan, you see that total ESRD costs, meaning dialysis and hospital-related costs, et cetera, was about 1.3% of the total medical costs. That again is total ESRD costs in the numerator and then total medical costs for the plan in the denominator. In the ACA Plans, we estimate right now that, that percentage is only up to about 1.6%. And so it is a low absolute number and it's a low increase number.
Number four. We were very sensitive to the fact that some of these patients choosing an ACA Plan meant that we would be paid higher rates, commercial rates versus Medicaid rates. And therefore, we created a very intense oversight process to make sure that we did everything possible to live up to the CMS standards around objective presentation and information and absolutely letting the patient choose.
Number five. We, nonetheless, got swept up in the current huge controversies around the sustainability of the exchanges, and you're all sensitive to the huge political forces in play on that subject.
Number six. Why did dialysis, and in part DaVita, become a visible part of that controversy? Well, a, letter a, we're national, and so our numbers get added up nationally unlike a lot of health systems, which are regional or local.
B, our patients stick out. They're very high cost, very easy to identify, very discreet.
C, there have been abuses by providers in other segments and perhaps some abuses even in ESRD, and so upfront, we started to be painted with that brush by some without data to support.
D, some payers did have very large year-over-year increases in dialysis expense, and it was originally assumed that this must be from the process that I described earlier. But in fact, in many, probably most instances, it was driven by other factors. For example, sometimes, a plan had a differentially attractive product and would gain significant market share literally moving from having 50% of the ESRD patients in a market to 80%, thereby guaranteeing at least a 60% increase in your costs, having nothing to do with anything else other than product design. As we all know, this has been a very dynamic period, probably the most dynamic period ever in terms of alternative product design for insurance plans. And also, people have been struck by how smart the consumers are and how much shopping and switching they do. A second explainer in several markets is when there was a bad actor in the payer world, meaning someone who did inappropriate steering of patients away from themselves, leaving one of their competitors with a disproportionate percentage. And again, we're talking about 30%, 40% shifts in market share in some instances. A third driver out of probably a potential list of 7 or 8, but I'll stop after 3, is areas with relatively poor Medicaid coverage because that would naturally mean that there's a higher probability that a Medicaid patient would find an ACA Plan more attractive. This is just to give you a sense of what kind of things actually drove a lot of those year-over-year increases for particular plans because as we mentioned earlier, the aggregate reality only moved from 1.3 to 1.6.
But letter e, those high examples were taken to CMS and positioned as being reasonably representative of a broader movement. And at that point, CMS did not have the data of the 1.3 and the 1.6.
On to number 7 of 8. CMS is now starting to realize, contrary to initial impressions that, a, some of the numbers were misleading. That's not to say they were inaccurate if they were from a particular plan. They were just misleading. And as you start to stare at a number like a 0.3 increase, and again this is our estimate, but as you compare that to 22% rate increases on average, you can see that we were not a material source of the problem, nor are we a material source of the solution. 
Letter b, our patients made sensible choices, and we provided lots of examples to CMS as have other providers.
C, the fact that enrollment of dialysis patients within the ACA plans looks to be flat or down even without any change in Medicaid access in 2017 and '18, and of course, would be down even more with any restriction on the Medicaid front.
Letter d, CMS now is starting to see some of the reasons for the dramatic disparities in year-over-year dialysis expense increases and seeing how they have to do with product design, competition, et cetera.
And lastly, e, they also have a better sense of how charitable premium assistance has been embedded in the ESRD economic in clinical ecosystem for 20 years with a lot of guardrails and with the OIG's blessing, including blessing the aspect of provider funding.
So number 8 and final comment is, of course, the big question on everyone's mind, including ours, is what exactly is CMS going to decide with respect to this portfolio of decisions. And we don't know. No one knows. I think to their credit, they don't know right now because they're continuing to absorb information, and we are incredibly grateful and respectful that they are doing that.
Moving on to DMG. Just one happy announcement, and that is that Chuck Berg is joining our leadership team as Executive Chair of DaVita Medical Group. He'll report to me in my role as CEO of the enterprise. Chuck's been on our board since 2007. He has a wealth of experience in the health plan world, including having been the very successful executive chair of WealthCare Health Plans and prior to that, the CEO of Oxford Health Plans, where I was his nonexecutive chair. This experience, combined with his brain, makes him uniquely suited to help us evaluate our long-term strategic alternatives at DMG. And he will remain in our board in the meantime, and I and others look forward to working with him.

We look at the changes and the growth and -- in the commercial mix, and if we back out these 2,000 patients, it looks like it's been flat over the last several years. But looking ahead and just thinking about the changes, looks like the -- from USRDS data, there hasn't really been much incidence growth in the pre-65 population over the last 10 years. And when we couple that with the aging of the baby boomers and the Medicare from kind of commercial years, there's the indication that it could put a fair amount of pressure on commercial mix over time. So I guess my question is can you tell me whether this is a reasonable view? And if so, how should we think about this factor in relation to your typical kind of mid-single-digit long-term growth algorithm for the dialysis?"

And I think if you wanted to identify other worrisome long-term trends, you would also look at improved treatment regimens for diabetics and hypertensives. And commercial patients are more likely to benefit from improved treatment regimens. On the other hand, there's also things pushing in the other direction. We continue to be quite successful with our Non-Acquired Growth, and some of these hard times could lead a lot more small providers to sell or even shut down. In addition, we're very hopeful that Medicare Advantage continues to grow because we radically prefer a customer who cares about total value. And we tend to do much better in terms of both adding value to the system and getting reimbursed for it. In addition, as you know better than most, to the extent that the mix ever starts to put too much pressure on all the independent centers, the government has the easy option of doing that, which it's done 3 or 4 times before, and that's extending the MSP provision from originally 0 to 12 and 12 to 18 and 18 to 30. And so that's a safety valve that's never far away. Justin?"

I think that was very helpful. I think I understand those parameters. But I guess the question that I'm still struggling with is what the real growth rate the company has been over the past 3 years in the dialysis business because if I look at operating income growth over the last 3 years, it's been about 5% per year. But if I were to say that this 140 was either not sustainable or onetime in nature, then I'm getting like a 2% type growth in the dialysis business over the past 3 years. So how do we think about that? And that's the low end of what you guys think you're going to do over the next 3 years going forward.

So while they didn't have classic insurance, they were funded and they were typically funded at rates more like commercial than Medicare or Medicaid. And so for the system, there's no increase in cost from their emergence in the second bucket of ACA Plans. And then third, the third bucket, which is substantial, are people who are on private plans before. Before ACA existed, they had individual health insurance plans. And once ACA was there, they switched over. And so these are people who've been buying insurance for -- in the same way that everyone now on this call buys insurance where they're doing it individually as opposed through their employers.

I will cover 3 topics: number one, Monday's announcement; number two, our Q3 Kidney Care performance; and number three, our outlook. So let's get started.
We hope the release on Monday was helpful. I won't be repetitive here, but we've had a lot of questions. So let me take some, and if I miss them, please bring them up in Q&A. As a full warning, I'll go into some technical detail because the subject matter requires it.
First, why did we announce the decision on Monday, only 2 days before our earning call? It's a simple answer. This is open enrollment that started yesterday, and we needed to provide clarity to our patients and our teammates.
Second, is this a permanent change in policy? No. We have only temporarily suspended support for applications to the American Kidney Fund for patients enrolled in minimum essential Medicaid coverage. When CMS provides guidance, which we expect will be within a couple of weeks, we will evaluate our future policy.
Third, does our announcement signify a concern over our historical practices? No. Our historical practices were legal and compliant. That said, the language in the RFI may confuse some, so I thought it would be useful to clarify further.
The RFI had primarily 3 concerns. One, whether patients enrolled in Medicare purchased an ACA Plan that was duplicative in coverage. None of our patients who were enrolled in Medicare enrolled in the ACA Plan. The regulations cited in the RFI, which referred to Medicare supplemental plans is not germane to the ACA Plans.
Number two, whether patients lost their Medicaid coverage as a result of purchasing an ACA Plan and therefore, were exposed to additional costs. Our patients did not lose their Medicaid coverage as a result of purchasing an ACA Plan and as a result, were not exposed to additional costs. Consistent with CMS' own education materials, we educated our patients on the ability to pick -- purchase an ACA Plan while retaining Medicaid coverage as a secondary. These patients did not apply for tax credits and subsidies.
And three, whether patients experienced a disruption in continuity of care as a result of purchasing an ACA Plan. Just a small portion of our Medicaid patients made the choice to purchase an ACA Plan, and they did so for their own personal reasons such as to have access to specialists who do not accept Medicaid or increased chance of qualifying for transplantation or other reasons. We are not aware of any patient experiencing a disruption in care likely because those patients who would have had such a disruption, made the choice not to enroll in an ACA Plan.
Lastly, there have been some questions around comparing our disclosure of 5,000 patients versus public information from other providers. I believe that the confusion is around some definitions. When we refer to individual market plans or ACA Plans, we refer to the full universe of individual plans, whether they're sold on or off the government-run exchanges. A distinction between these types of plans is not relevant because both affect the same risk pools and are generally subject to the same regulations. If you're trying to compare us to other providers, it is important to clarify definitions to ensure that the comparison is an apples-to-apples line.
Now let's discuss our Q3 performance. Overall, DaVita Kidney Care had a solid quarter. We delivered adjusted operating income of $439 million. For U.S. dialysis, our normalized non-acquired growth for the quarter was 4.4%, which falls within our long-term target range of 3.5% to 4.5%. While we're on the topic of volume, we want to share that we signed an amendment to the agreement of Renal Ventures to acquire 100% interest in their dialysis centers for $360 million, which is $55 million less than previously announced purchase price. We expect the transaction will close in the first quarter of 2017.
Our revenue per treatment was up sequentially by 1.7 -- $1.72 per treatment, primarily driven by an increase in seasonal administration of flu vaccine. Our patient care cost per treatment were up versus Q2 by $2.41 per treatment, driven by 2 primary factors: approximately 60% by an increase in labor and benefits costs and 40% by an increase in facility costs. We have seen a tightening in labor markets leading to some increase in our labor costs. In the near term, we may see these labor costs remain at higher levels. We expect that our facility costs to come down over the next couple of quarters.
Now onto our outlook. Since we have now visibility to the end of the year, we're updating our 2016 adjusted operating income guidance for Kidney Care to be in the range of $1.695 billion to $1.725 billion. We will provide you with 2017 guidance on our Q4 earnings call when we expect to have additional clarity on several variables, including open enrollment and policy changes from CMS.
Now I'll turn the call to Vijay Kotte for DMG."

We noted on the Q2 call that we would see accelerated noncash amortization expense for the ACP brand during the transition to DMG, which would impact our reported operating income. This will run for 30 mont",341,"Thank you, Javier. First, financial performance. We noted on the Q2 call that we would see accelerated noncash amortization expense for the ACP brand during the transition to DMG, which would impact our reported operating income. This will run for 30 months at an incremental rate of slightly more than $2 million per month or $26 million on an annualized basis beginning September 2016. Including the impact of this accelerated amortization, operating income for the quarter was $33 million.
As we look at the full year, we are narrowing our 2016 adjusted operating income guidance to a range of $115 million to $145 million. This is effectively a slight increase as our guidance now includes the impact of the $9 million in accelerated brand amortization that was previously excluded.
A natural question is how to think about 2017. We're still in the midst of our budget process, and open enrollment plays a big part in our outlook. That being said, there are some things we know. First, $40 million in rate cuts, which includes $30 million related to the Medicare model change and $10 million for Medicaid. Second, we have the $26 million of accelerated brand amortization. And third, we are continuing to make incremental investments in the business. Despite these headwinds, the odds are they will be roughly flat year-over-year, but there are reasonable probabilities on the other side of that. We will go into further detail regarding our expectation for 2017 on the Q4 earnings call.
As we continue to look towards our long-term OI, our 2019 target remains $215 million.
Finally, I want to provide a few highlights on the operating progress we're making at DMG. With regard to claims process without the need for manual intervention, 2015 we're at 26%; and in 2016, 79%. With regards to services getting electronic authorizations, 2015 was 24%, 2016 is 47%. And finally, with regards to new tuck-in clinicians, in 2015, we had 18; and in 2016, we're at 44.
Now to Jim Hilger for some financial details on the quarter."

Our international operating income was $368 million in the quarter, which includes the gain on the deconsolidation of the APAC JV of $374 million.

Our international operating income was $368 million in the quarter, which includes the gain on the deconsolidation of the APAC JV of $374 million. We are on track to meet our guidance for approximately $40 million in adjusted losses for 2016.
Our JV transaction with Khazanah and Mitsui closed on August 1. As you will recall, Khazanah and Mitsui have each subscribed to acquire 20% share of ownership of the joint venture. At closing, each partner made their first investment tranche of $50 million in return for a 6.7% ownership in the joint venture. This joint venture has been deconsolidated from our financials. Going forward, our pro rata share of its operating income will run through equity investment income in our income statement. As a result of this deconsolidation, we recorded a onetime noncash gain of $374 million. We are excluding this gain when reporting our adjusted non-GAAP financial results and excluding it from our adjusted operating guidance for 2016. We look forward to continuing our growth in Asia Pacific dialysis with the help of our new partners.
Next. I'd like to talk about a few tax items. In the third quarter, we recorded an adjustment related to tax assets created through the DMG acquisition escrow provisions. This adjustment resulted in a $27 million increase in corporate G&A expense that was offset by an equal reduction in income tax expense and thus, created no change in net earnings or earnings per share. We do not expect any ongoing impact from this adjustment.
Excluding this escrow provision tax adjustment and excluding the gain from the formation of the APAC dialysis joint venture, our tax rate attributable to DaVita was 40% in the quarter and 39% year-to-date. We expect our full year tax rate attributable to DaVita to be approximately 39%, when excluding all non-GAAP items.
Next, our interest expense increased slightly in the quarter to $105 million due to an increase in the interest rate cap amortization as well as the impact of the deconsolidation of the APAC joint venture. This higher level of interest expense reflects our go-forward run rate.
And finally, turning to our continued strong and consistent cash generation. Operating cash flow was $536 million in the third quarter and $1.92 billion for the last 12 months. We expect full year 2016 operating cash flow to be between $1.75 billion and $1.85 billion.
Since our last earnings release, we have repurchased 9.6 million shares for approximately $619 million. And through October, we have repurchased 13.3 million DaVita shares for approximately $868 million, which represents about 6.3% of the outstanding shares at the beginning of the year. Approximately 881 million remains outstanding under our board repurchase authorizations.
We continue to have a strong cash balance with nearly $1.6 billion in cash and short-term investments as of September 30. While $212 million was used in October to repurchase stock, and an additional $360 million will be used in the coming months for the completion of the Renal Venture acquisition, that still leaves us with over $1 billion of cash available before considering our continued strong cash-generating capabilities.
As discussed at our Capital Markets Day earlier this year, we expect to generate well over $5 billion in free cash flow to use for growth and share repurchases from 2016 to 2019. Even assuming a reasonable baseline of $1.5 billion in growth spending for development CapEx and acquisitions, this leaves over $3 billion for additional growth or share repurchase.
And now I'd like to turn it back to Kent for a few closing comments."

Allow me 8 different points, please.",1161,"Thanks, Jim, and I'd actually like to make several additional comments. Some will be a little bit redundant to what JR said, but it's such an important topic, we think it's worthwhile in order to achieve good clarity. Allow me 8 different points, please.
Number one. We fulfilled our regulatory responsibility to provide comprehensive education to our patients. This has been an industry requirement for the last 15 to 20 years, and then ACA was added onto that standard and long-standing process and practice.
Number two. A very small percentage of our Medicaid patients determined that an ACA Plan was better for them, and Javier mentioned some of the very significant reasons why some of those plans were way better for them and/or their families. I won't repeat the examples, but important and often beautiful improvements in care.
Number three. Nonetheless, if you look at the benchmark plan, an EGHP plan, you see that total ESRD costs, meaning dialysis and hospital-related costs, et cetera, was about 1.3% of the total medical costs. That again is total ESRD costs in the numerator and then total medical costs for the plan in the denominator. In the ACA Plans, we estimate right now that, that percentage is only up to about 1.6%. And so it is a low absolute number and it's a low increase number.
Number four. We were very sensitive to the fact that some of these patients choosing an ACA Plan meant that we would be paid higher rates, commercial rates versus Medicaid rates. And therefore, we created a very intense oversight process to make sure that we did everything possible to live up to the CMS standards around objective presentation of information and absolutely letting the patient choose.
Number five. We, nonetheless, got swept up in the current huge controversies around the sustainability of the exchanges, and you're all sensitive to the huge political forces in play on that subject.
Number six. Why did dialysis, and in part DaVita, become a visible part of that controversy? Well, a, letter a, we're national, and so our numbers get added up nationally unlike a lot of health systems which are regional or local; b, our patients stick out, they're very high cost, very easy to identify, very discreet; c, there have been abuses by providers in other segments and perhaps some abuses even in ESRD, and so upfront, we started to be painted with that brush by some without data to support; d, some payers did have very large year-over-year increases in dialysis expense, and it was originally assumed that this must be from the process that I described earlier. But in fact, in many, probably most instances, it was driven by other factors. For example, sometimes, a plan had a differentially attractive product and would gain significant market share literally moving from having 50% of the ESRD patients in a market to 80%, thereby guaranteeing at least a 60% increase in your cost, having nothing to do with anything else other than product design. As we all know, this has been a very dynamic period, probably the most dynamic period ever in terms of alternative product design for insurance plans. And also, people have been struck by how smart the consumers are and how much shopping and switching they do. A second explainer in several markets is when there was a bad actor in the payer world, meaning someone who did inappropriate steering of patients away from themselves, leaving one of their competitors with a disproportionate percentage. And again, we're talking about 30%, 40% shifts in market share in some instances. A third driver out of probably a potential list of 7 or 8, but I'll stop after 3, is areas with relatively poor Medicaid coverage because that would naturally mean that there's a higher probability that a Medicaid patient would find an ACA Plan more attractive. This is just to give you a sense of what kind of things actually drove a lot of those year-over-year increases for particular plans because as we mentioned earlier, the aggregate reality only moved from 1.3 to 1.6.
But letter e, those high examples were taken to CMS and positioned as being reasonably representative of a broader movement. And at that point, CMS did not have the data of the 1.3 and the 1.6.
On to number 7 of 8. CMS is now starting to realize, contrary to initial impressions that, a, some of the numbers were misleading. That's not to say they were inaccurate if they were from a particular plan. They were just misleading. And as you start to stare at a number like a 0.3 increase, and again this is our estimate, but as you compare that to 22% rate increases on average, you can see that we were not a material source of the problem, nor are we a material source of the solution. 
Letter b, our patients made sensible choices, and we provided lots of examples to CMS as have other providers.
C, the fact that enrollment of dialysis patients within the ACA plans looks to be flat or down even without any change in Medicaid access in 2017 and '18, and of course, would be down even more with any restriction on the Medicaid front.
Letter d, CMS now is starting to see some of the reasons for the dramatic disparities in year-over-year dialysis expense increases and seeing how they have to do with product design, competition, et cetera.
And lastly, e, they also have a better sense of how charitable premium assistance has been embedded in the ESRD economic and clinical ecosystem for 20 years with a lot of guardrails and with the OIG's blessing, including blessing the aspect of provider funding.
So number 8 and final comment is, of course, the big question on everyone's mind, including ours, is what exactly is CMS going to decide with respect to this portfolio of decisions. And we don't know. No one knows. I think to their credit, they don't know right now because they're continuing to absorb information, and we are incredibly grateful and respectful that they are doing that.
Moving on to DMG. Just one happy announcement, and that is that Chuck Berg is joining our leadership team as Executive Chair of DaVita Medical Group. He'll report to me in my role as CEO of the enterprise. Chuck's been on our board since 2007. He has a wealth of experience in the health plan world, including having been the very successful executive chair of WellCare Health Plans and prior to that, the CEO of Oxford Health Plans, where I was his nonexecutive chair. This experience, combined with his brain, makes him uniquely suited to help us evaluate our long-term strategic alternatives at DMG. And he will remain in our board in the meantime, and I and others look forward to working with him.

But looking ahead and just thinking about the changes, looks like the -- from USRDS data, there hasn't really been much incidence growth in the pre-65 population over the last 10 years. And when we couple that with the aging of the baby boomers and the Medicare from kind of commercial years, there's the indication that it could put a fair amount of pressure on commercial mix over time. So I guess my question is can you tell me whether this is a reasonable view?

And I think if you wanted to identify other worrisome long-term trends, you would also look at improved treatment regimens for diabetics and hypertensives. And commercial patients are more likely to benefit from improved treatment regimens. On the other hand, there's also things pushing in the other direction. We continue to be quite successful with our Non-Acquired Growth, and some of these hard times could lead a lot more small providers to sell or even shut down. In addition, we're very hopeful that Medicare Advantage continues to grow because we radically prefer a customer who cares about total value. And we tend to do much better in terms of both adding value to the system and getting reimbursed for it. In addition, as you know better than most, to the extent that the mix ever starts to put too much pressure on all the independent centers, the government has the easy option of doing that, which it's done 3 or 4 times before, and that's extending the MSP provision from originally 0 to 12 and 12 to 18 and 18 to 30.

And so for the system, there's no increase in cost from their emergence in the second bucket of ACA Plans. And then third, the third bucket, which is substantial, are people who are on private plans before. Before ACA existed, they had individual health insurance plans.

Within the DaVita Medical Group, we mentioned during our Q2 call that we outperformed in clinical quality compared to the same period in the prior year. Our strong performance has continued, and we remain on track to achieve 4 Stars or greater for our patients within each of our major health plan relationships.
Within Kidney Care, we continue to focus on vascular access where strong performance significantly improves survival and prevents unnecessary hospitalizations. The publicly reported government data released just this October shows that we have significantly outperformed the industry in this important clinical area.
Let's now move on to the nonclinical subjects, and I'll turn it over to Javier Rodriguez."

So let's get started.We hope the release o",846,"Thank you, Kent, and good afternoon. Since we spoke last, a lot has happened. I will cover 3 topics: number one, Monday's announcement; number two, our Q3 Kidney Care performance; and number three, our outlook. So let's get started.
We hope the release on Monday was helpful. I won't be repetitive here, but we've had a lot of questions. So let me take some, and if I miss them, please bring them up in Q&A. As a full warning, I'll go into some technical detail because the subject matter requires it.
First, why did we announce the decision on Monday, only 2 days before our earning call? It's a simple answer. This is open enrollment that started yesterday, and we needed to provide clarity to our patients and our teammates.
Second, is this a permanent change in policy? No. We have only temporarily suspended support for applications to the American Kidney Fund for patients enrolled in minimum essential Medicaid coverage. When CMS provides guidance, which we expect will be within a couple of weeks, we will evaluate our future policy.
Third, does our announcement signify a concern over our historical practices? No. Our historical practices were legal and compliant. That said, the language in the RFI may confuse some, so I thought it would be useful to clarify further.
The RFI had primarily 3 concerns. One, whether patients enrolled in Medicare purchased an ACA Plan that was duplicative in coverage. None of our patients who were enrolled in Medicare enrolled in the ACA Plan. The regulations cited in the RFI, which referred to Medicare supplemental plans is not germane to the ACA Plans.
Number two, whether patients lost their Medicaid coverage as a result of purchasing an ACA Plan and therefore, were exposed to additional costs. Our patients did not lose their Medicaid coverage as a result of purchasing an ACA Plan and as a result, were not exposed to additional costs. Consistent with CMS' own education materials, we educated our patients on the ability to pick -- purchase an ACA Plan while retaining Medicaid coverage as a secondary. These patients did not apply for tax credits and subsidies.
And three, whether patients experienced a disruption in continuity of care as a result of purchasing an ACA Plan. Just a small portion of our Medicaid patients made the choice to purchase an ACA Plan, and they did so for their own personal reasons such as to have access to specialists who do not accept Medicaid or increased chance of qualifying for transplantation or other reasons. We are not aware of any patient experiencing a disruption in care likely because those patients who would have had such a disruption, made the choice not to enroll in an ACA Plan.
Lastly, there have been some questions around comparing our disclosure of 5,000 patients versus public information from other providers. I believe that the confusion is around some definitions. When we refer to individual market plans or ACA Plans, we refer to the full universe of individual plans, whether they're sold on or off the government-run exchanges. A distinction between these types of plans is not relevant because both affect the same risk pools and are generally subject to the same regulations. If you're trying to compare us to other providers, it is important to clarify definitions to ensure that the comparison is an apples-to-apples line.
Now let's discuss our Q3 performance. Overall, DaVita Kidney Care had a solid quarter. We delivered adjusted operating income of $439 million. For U.S. dialysis, our normalized non-acquired growth for the quarter was 4.4%, which falls within our long-term target range of 3.5% to 4.5%. While we're on the topic of volume, we want to share that we signed an amendment to the agreement of Renal Ventures to acquire 100% interest in their dialysis centers for $360 million, which is $55 million less than previously announced purchase price. We expect the transaction will close in the first quarter of 2017.
Our revenue per treatment was up sequentially by 1.7 -- $1.72 per treatment, primarily driven by an increase in seasonal administration of flu vaccine. Our patient care cost per treatment were up versus Q2 by $2.41 per treatment, driven by 2 primary factors: approximately 60% by an increase in labor and benefits costs and 40% by an increase in facility costs. We have seen a tightening in labor markets leading to some increase in our labor costs. In the near term, we may see these labor costs remain at higher levels. We expect that our facility costs to come down over the next couple of quarters.
Now onto our outlook. Since we have now visibility to the end of the year, we're updating our 2016 adjusted operating income guidance for Kidney Care to be in the range of $1.695 billion to $1.725 billion. We will provide you with 2017 guidance on our Q4 earnings call when we expect to have additional clarity on several variables, including open enrollment and policy changes from CMS.
Now I'll turn the call to Vijay Kotte for DMG."
35644,404162533,1073218,"DaVita Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","DaVita Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Javier. First, financial performance. We noted on the Q2 call that we would see accelerated noncash amortization expense for the ACP brand during the transition to DMG, which would impact our reported operating income. This will run for 30 mont",341,"Thank you, Javier. First, financial performance. We noted on the Q2 call that we would see accelerated noncash amortization expense for the ACP brand during the transition to DMG, which would impact our reported operating income. This will run for 30 months at an incremental rate of slightly more than $2 million per month or $26 million on an annualized basis beginning September 2016. Including the impact of this accelerated amortization, operating income for the quarter was $33 million.
As we look at the full year, we are narrowing our 2016 adjusted operating income guidance to a range of $115 million to $145 million. This is effectively a slight increase as our guidance now includes the impact of the $9 million in accelerated brand amortization that was previously excluded.
A natural question is how to think about 2017. We're still in the midst of our budget process, and open enrollment plays a big part in our outlook. That being said, there are some things we know. First, $40 million in rate cuts, which includes $30 million related to the Medicare model change and $10 million for Medicaid. Second, we have the $26 million of accelerated brand amortization. And third, we are continuing to make incremental investments in the business. Despite these headwinds, the odds are they will be roughly flat year-over-year, but there are reasonable probabilities on the other side of that. We will go into further detail regarding our expectation for 2017 on the Q4 earnings call.
As we continue to look towards our long-term OI, our 2019 target remains $215 million.
Finally, I want to provide a few highlights on the operating progress we're making at DMG. With regard to claims process without the need for manual intervention, 2015 we're at 26%; and in 2016, 79%. With regards to services getting electronic authorizations, 2015 was 24%, 2016 is 47%. And finally, with regards to new tuck-in clinicians, in 2015, we had 18; and in 2016, we're at 44.
Now to Jim Hilger for some financial details on the quarter."

Our international operating income was $368 million in the quarter, which includes the gain on the deconsolidation of the APAC JV of $374 million. We are on track to meet our guidance for approximately $40 million in adjusted losses for 2016.
Our JV transaction with Khazanah and Mitsui closed on August 1. As you will recall, Khazanah and Mitsui have each subscribed to acquire 20% share of ownership of the joint venture. At closing, each partner made their first investment tranche of $50 million in return for a 6.7% ownership in the joint venture. This joint venture has been deconsolidated from our financials. Going forward, our pro rata share of its operating income will run through equity investment income in our income statement. As a result of this deconsolidation, we recorded a onetime noncash gain of $374 million. We are excluding this gain when reporting our adjusted non-GAAP financial results and excluding it from our adjusted operating guidance for 2016. We look forward to continuing our growth in Asia Pacific dialysis with the help of our new partners.
Next. I'd like to talk about a few tax items. In the third quarter, we recorded an adjustment related to tax assets created through the DMG acquisition escrow provisions. This adjustment resulted in a $27 million increase in corporate G&A expense that was offset by an equal reduction in income tax expense and thus, created no change in net earnings or earnings per share. We do not expect any ongoing impact from this adjustment.
Excluding this escrow provision tax adjustment and excluding the gain from the formation of the APAC dialysis joint venture, our tax rate attributable to DaVita was 40% in the quarter and 39% year-to-date. We expect our full year tax rate attributable to DaVita to be approximately 39%, when excluding all non-GAAP items.
Next, our interest expense increased slightly in the quarter to $105 million due to an increase in the interest rate cap amortization as well as the impact of the deconsolidation of the APAC joint venture. This higher level of interest expense reflects our go-forward run rate.
And finally, turning to our continued strong and consistent cash generation. Operating cash flow was $536 million in the third quarter and $1.92 billion for the last 12 months. We expect full year 2016 operating cash flow to be between $1.75 billion and $1.85 billion.
Since our last earnings release, we have repurchased 9.6 million shares for approximately $619 million. And through October, we have repurchased 13.3 million DaVita shares for approximately $868 million, which represents about 6.3% of the outstanding shares at the beginning of the year. Approximately 881 million remains outstanding under our board repurchase authorizations.
We continue to have a strong cash balance with nearly $1.6 billion in cash and short-term investments as of September 30. While $212 million was used in October to repurchase stock, and an additional $360 million will be used in the coming months for the completion of the Renal Venture acquisition, that still leaves us with over $1 billion of cash available before considering our continued strong cash-generating capabilities.
As discussed at our Capital Markets Day earlier this year, we expect to generate well over $5 billion in free cash flow to use for growth and share repurchases from 2016 to 2019. Even assuming a reasonable baseline of $1.5 billion in growth spending for development CapEx and acquisitions, this leaves over $3 billion for additional growth or share repurchase.
And now I'd like to turn it back to Kent for a few closing comments."

Allow me 8 different points, please.",1161,"Thanks, Jim, and I'd actually like to make several additional comments. Some will be a little bit redundant to what JR said, but it's such an important topic, we think it's worthwhile in order to achieve good clarity. Allow me 8 different points, please.
Number one. We fulfilled our regulatory responsibility to provide comprehensive education to our patients. This has been an industry requirement for the last 15 to 20 years, and then ACA was added onto that standard and long-standing process and practice.
Number two. A very small percentage of our Medicaid patients determined that an ACA Plan was better for them, and Javier mentioned some of the very significant reasons why some of those plans were way better for them and/or their families. I won't repeat the examples, but important and often beautiful improvements in care.
Number three. Nonetheless, if you look at the benchmark plan, an EGHP plan, you see that total ESRD costs, meaning dialysis and hospital-related costs, et cetera, was about 1.3% of the total medical costs. That again is total ESRD costs in the numerator and then total medical costs for the plan in the denominator. In the ACA Plans, we estimate right now that, that percentage is only up to about 1.6%. And so it is a low absolute number and it's a low increase number.
Number four. We were very sensitive to the fact that some of these patients choosing an ACA Plan meant that we would be paid higher rates, commercial rates versus Medicaid rates. And therefore, we created a very intense oversight process to make sure that we did everything possible to live up to the CMS standards around objective presentation of information and absolutely letting the patient choose.
Number five. We, nonetheless, got swept up in the current huge controversies around the sustainability of the exchanges, and you're all sensitive to the huge political forces in play on that subject.
Number six. Why did dialysis, and in part DaVita, become a visible part of that controversy? Well, a, letter a, we're national, and so our numbers get added up nationally unlike a lot of health systems which are regional or local; b, our patients stick out, they're very high cost, very easy to identify, very discreet; c, there have been abuses by providers in other segments and perhaps some abuses even in ESRD, and so upfront, we started to be painted with that brush by some without data to support; d, some payers did have very large year-over-year increases in dialysis expense, and it was originally assumed that this must be from the process that I described earlier. But in fact, in many, probably most instances, it was driven by other factors. For example, sometimes, a plan had a differentially attractive product and would gain significant market share literally moving from having 50% of the ESRD patients in a market to 80%, thereby guaranteeing at least a 60% increase in your cost, having nothing to do with anything else other than product design. As we all know, this has been a very dynamic period, probably the most dynamic period ever in terms of alternative product design for insurance plans. And also, people have been struck by how smart the consumers are and how much shopping and switching they do. A second explainer in several markets is when there was a bad actor in the payer world, meaning someone who did inappropriate steering of patients away from themselves, leaving one of their competitors with a disproportionate percentage. And again, we're talking about 30%, 40% shifts in market share in some instances. A third driver out of probably a potential list of 7 or 8, but I'll stop after 3, is areas with relatively poor Medicaid coverage because that would naturally mean that there's a higher probability that a Medicaid patient would find an ACA Plan more attractive. This is just to give you a sense of what kind of things actually drove a lot of those year-over-year increases for particular plans because as we mentioned earlier, the aggregate reality only moved from 1.3 to 1.6.
But letter e, those high examples were taken to CMS and positioned as being reasonably representative of a broader movement. And at that point, CMS did not have the data of the 1.3 and the 1.6.
On to number 7 of 8. CMS is now starting to realize, contrary to initial impressions that, a, some of the numbers were misleading. That's not to say they were inaccurate if they were from a particular plan. They were just misleading. And as you start to stare at a number like a 0.3 increase, and again this is our estimate, but as you compare that to 22% rate increases on average, you can see that we were not a material source of the problem, nor are we a material source of the solution. 
Letter b, our patients made sensible choices, and we provided lots of examples to CMS as have other providers.
C, the fact that enrollment of dialysis patients within the ACA plans looks to be flat or down even without any change in Medicaid access in 2017 and '18, and of course, would be down even more with any restriction on the Medicaid front.
Letter d, CMS now is starting to see some of the reasons for the dramatic disparities in year-over-year dialysis expense increases and seeing how they have to do with product design, competition, et cetera.
And lastly, e, they also have a better sense of how charitable premium assistance has been embedded in the ESRD economic and clinical ecosystem for 20 years with a lot of guardrails and with the OIG's blessing, including blessing the aspect of provider funding.
So number 8 and final comment is, of course, the big question on everyone's mind, including ours, is what exactly is CMS going to decide with respect to this portfolio of decisions. And we don't know. No one knows. I think to their credit, they don't know right now because they're continuing to absorb information, and we are incredibly grateful and respectful that they are doing that.
Moving on to DMG. Just one happy announcement, and that is that Chuck Berg is joining our leadership team as Executive Chair of DaVita Medical Group. He'll report to me in my role as CEO of the enterprise. Chuck's been on our board since 2007. He has a wealth of experience in the health plan world, including having been the very successful executive chair of WellCare Health Plans and prior to that, the CEO of Oxford Health Plans, where I was his nonexecutive chair. This experience, combined with his brain, makes him uniquely suited to help us evaluate our long-term strategic alternatives at DMG. And he will remain in our board in the meantime, and I and others look forward to working with him.

But looking ahead and just thinking about the changes, looks like the -- from USRDS data, there hasn't really been much incidence growth in the pre-65 population over the last 10 years. And when we couple that with the aging of the baby boomers and the Medicare from kind of commercial years, there's the indication that it could put a fair amount of pressure on commercial mix over time. So I guess my question is can you tell me whether this is a reasonable view? And if so, how should we think about this factor in relation to your typical kind of mid-single-digit long-term growth algorithm for the dialysis?"

And I think if you wanted to identify other worrisome long-term trends, you would also look at improved treatment regimens for diabetics and hypertensives. And commercial patients are more likely to benefit from improved treatment regimens. On the other hand, there's also things pushing in the other direction. We continue to be quite successful with our Non-Acquired Growth, and some of these hard times could lead a lot more small providers to sell or even shut down. In addition, we're very hopeful that Medicare Advantage continues to grow because we radically prefer a customer who cares about total value. And we tend to do much better in terms of both adding value to the system and getting reimbursed for it. In addition, as you know better than most, to the extent that the mix ever starts to put too much pressure on all the independent centers, the government has the easy option of doing that, which it's done 3 or 4 times before, and that's extending the MSP provision from originally 0 to 12 and 12 to 18 and 18 to 30.

In a more austere scenario, and I'll just make up a number, let's say revenue per treatment is $340 to $345 for a bunch of reasons. How should we think about the likely reaction of the company? What levers would be likely to be pulled? And again, CapEx is one that would appear to be one where you have a lot of discretion over. And again, I ask this because there's a debate on the Street about should we look at DaVita on earnings per share? Or should we look at it on free cash flow? And free cash flow requires the assumption that CapEx is closer to maintenance than it is to actual."
