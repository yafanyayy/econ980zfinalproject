Thank you for joining us, and welcome to PayPal Holdings earnings release conference call for the fourth quarter and full year 2015. Joining me today on the call are Dan Schulman, our President and CEO; and John Rainey, our Chief Financial Officer. We're providing a slide presentation to accompany the commentary during the call. All growth rates mentioned in each prepared remarks represent year-over-year comparisons unless they clarify otherwise and all segments' results are adjusted for the effect of foreign currency exchange. In the discussion of year-over-year comparisons, including guidance growth rates for the first quarter and full year 2016, we have chosen to present non-GAAP pro forma metrics, which reflect items that are factually supportable directly attributable to the separation of the company from eBay Inc. on July 17, 2015, and expected to have a continuing impact on the company's results of operations, because we believe that these metrics provide investors a consistent basis for reviewing the company's performance across different periods. 
This conference call is also being broadcast on the Internet. And both the presentation and the call are available through the Investor Relations section of the PayPal website at investor.paypal-corp.com. You can visit our Investor Relations website for the latest company news and updates. In addition, an archive of the webcast will be accessible for 90 days through the same link. 
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about our company's performance, including the non-GAAP pro forma metrics mentioned above. You can find a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. In addition, management will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include, but are not limited to, future performance of PayPal, including expected financial results for the first quarter and full year 2016, our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in this call for a variety of reasons. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our operating results in our Registration Statement on our Form 10, as amended, and in subsequent annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q available at our IR site, investor.paypal-corp.com.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. I'm pleased to report that PayPal had a very strong Q4 topping off a solid year. We delivered every one of our 2015 commitments to shareholders: driving payment volume, revenue growth",2162,"Thanks, Tom. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. I'm pleased to report that PayPal had a very strong Q4 topping off a solid year. We delivered every one of our 2015 commitments to shareholders: driving payment volume, revenue growth, operating margin and free cash flow above or at the high-end of our guidance range, despite considerable pressure from foreign currency headwinds. And we exited the year with considerable momentum.
In Q4, we acquired more customers than in any other quarter in PayPal's history and further accelerated our payment volume and revenue growth rates. 
Payment volume increased 29% and revenue grew 21% on an FX-neutral basis. And our merchant services payment volume accelerated this 36% FX-neutral growth, substantially greater than the rate of e-commerce, leading to another quarter of increased market share gains.
For the full year, we delivered $282 billion in payment volume, up 27% and an FX-neutral revenue growth of 19%. We also continue to strengthen our lead in mobile payments. In 2015, almost 30% of the payments made in our platform were from a mobile device. 
We operate a complex global business. PayPal is a full services-technology platform where we acquire both consumers and merchants and perform all payments processing. This includes risk and fraud prevention, customer service and new products like international remittances across online, in-app and in-store environments.
Despite that complexity, our business model success can be reduced to 4 key metrics: our top line growth, our net active customer base, the engagement of that base and our ability to produce strong free cash flow. In 2015, in the face of a constant stream of competitive announcements, PayPal accelerated the strength of our business across every key metrics. We grew our top line, posting full year revenue of $9.24 billion. As I mentioned, this was up 19% on an FX-neutral basis, which was above the high end of the 15% to 18% full year guidance we communicated during our roadshow. And Q4 revenues accelerated to 21% to $2.56 billion. 
We expanded our customer base Q4 with a record-breaking 6.6 million new accounts, including 1.6 million from Xoom. As a result, we ended the year with 179 million active accounts, adding over 17 million net new accounts this year. Our continually expanding customer base strengthens our competitive position and makes our platform deeply relevant to merchants and partners around the world.
In addition to attracting more customers to our platform, we increased the level of customer engagement by significantly enhancing our consumer value proposition. We measure consumer or customer engagement by the number of transactions per account and I'm pleased with our progress on this front. We ended the year at over 27 transactions per account, driving nearly 5 billion transactions across our platform for the full year, and we continue to generate strong free cash flow.
In 2015, we generated $1.8 billion in cash and over $1 billion of that in the second half of the year alone. This cash flow provides us the flexibility to pursue multiple options and opportunities. Our accelerating performance, combined with our increasing ability to execute and innovate, provide us a high degree of confidence in our future. 
As a result today, we are announcing a $2 billion share buyback program which John Rainey will discuss in more detail.
There are 2 massive changes underway in the world: the digitization of cash and the mass adoption of mobile phones. This dynamic is creating a seismic shift that's transforming money and the very nature of commerce. PayPal is playing a leading role in this transformation, and we feel our assets are well suited to drive further differentiation. These trends present us with the opportunity to be at the center of people's daily financial lives and position PayPal to become the go-to platform for digital payments globally. 
We are in the lead because no other payments technology platform offers the combination of advantages that PayPal does. We benefit from our unmatched and growing global scale, our rapidly expanding customer base, our trusted brands, our unique 2-sided network, our open platform and technology-agnostic offerings, our risk management and our global customer service capabilities. All of these assets drive the success we witnessed in the quarter and throughout 2015.
While many others are attempting to play in this space, PayPal continues to gain market share quarter after quarter, attracting new customers and increasing the engagement of our existing base. It's becoming increasingly evident that payments is a hard business to crack. 
The combination of strong secular tailwinds and our increasing ability to execute across multiple fronts provides as a long runway for growth. And we are working hard to greatly expand the value of our technology platform, for consumers and merchants around the world.
For consumers, we're focused on using our technology platform to facilitate the movement and management of money. That means more than simply enabling commerce. It means we are reimagining what basic consumer financial transactions can be in a world dominated by mobile and software. We want to leverage our globally trusted brands and define digital money. This allows us to extend our platform to reach underserved markets and expand our value proposition to include international remittances, bill payment, person-to-person payments and charitable giving.
We made a significant step forward in the expansion of our platform with the close of our Xoom acquisition. Xoom is the latest example of PayPal adding new capabilities to acquire new customers and increase engagement. It is a mobile technology leader that enables customers in the United States to send money to and pay bills for family and friends in 41 countries around the world. The cross-border T-to-P opportunity is significant and Xoom will accelerate our growth in that market.
Of course, we continue to be a preferred way to enable consumers to shop online. This year, Cyber Monday was our biggest online shopping day in PayPal's history, with our platform processing almost 450 payments per second in our peak hour. However, the power of the PayPal platform is also demonstrated in other ways such as our ability to help consumers drive social impact. 
Throughout this year's holiday season, $857 million was raised globally for charity through our platform. This unprecedented level of year-end charitable giving was driven by the generosity of more than 7 million people from 183 countries we supported more than 1/4 million charities. These are amazing stats and they demonstrate the power of our platform in helping them make a real difference in the world.
The growth of Venmo clearly conveys our ability of our platform to connect people to each other by offering simple and engaging ways to move money. This past year, Venmo processed 7.5 billion in payments, up 213%, with 2.5 billion of this volume being processed in the fourth quarter alone. 
We made good progress in setting up the technical infrastructure to allow customers to pay online merchants with the Venmo app. This new feature became available to select merchants for pilot implementation in December, and we are now live with 2 merchants, Gametime and Munchery. We plan a robust rollout of pay with Venmo throughout 2016. And we will continue to introduce and expand features that will allow us to monetize our Venmo asset, providing our customers the ability to use Venmo to pay friends, shop and eventually access a host of other basic financial services.
We also made progress expanding the ability of consumers to use PayPal in-store, by making it easier for merchants to accept PayPal's tokenized payments. PayPal signed a strategic agreement with First Data to enable the acceptance of PayPal tokens in-store for First Data's acquiring clients and businesses. This is an important step-forward in driving availability of PayPal at the point-of-sale as First Data is the largest U.S. merchant processor. 
We believe the shift towards tokenization is an opportunity that will significantly help our business, enabling PayPal to expand and grow our ubiquity. PayPal was the first company to introduce tokenization and has always tokenized customer data to make payments safer for our customers and simpler for merchants to accept. PayPal's tokenization capabilities allow portability of tokens with greater safety and security than most solutions today.
We also handle more payment types than just credit cards. This means merchants don't have to process a different set of parameters for credit cards, PayPal or any other new payment method introduced, it can all be done with one token. And with more than 1 billion tokenized payment instruments and a 17-year head start to tokenization, we intend to leverage our expertise and scale to further enhance our growth across multiple channels. 
For our merchant customers, PayPal has evolved beyond being just a button on their website. We are slowly but surely being recognized as providing a full suite of payment solutions to help their businesses grow. And by doing so, we continue to further differentiate our value proposition from other competitors. This includes a robust set of APIs from our platform that allows a merchant to easily integrate across multiple payment types, as well as rewards and offers module into their own app. We are providing our merchant base the options they need to propel their business forward, to connect with their customers in new and powerful ways, that go well beyond substituting the tap of a mobile phone or a card swipe. We are providing the tools and platforms to help power new and engaging value propositions.
One Touch has been a driving force in helping merchants and consumers to interact in a frictionless manner. In just over 6 months, more than 15 million consumers have optioned [ph] in to use One Touch. And today, PayPal is processing millions of One Touch transactions each month, showing true innovation at scale. More than 50% of the Internet Retailer 500 and more than 1 million merchants in 23 countries have One Touch enabled to make it easier for their customers to check out, quickly and securely. And we expect that number to grow significantly throughout the year. We will roll out to an additional 100 countries in the next 6 months. Importantly, we continue to see a significant lift in conversion when One Touch is used and we see increased consumer engagement.
Braintree's v.zero platform, now fully integrated with PayPal's merchant and consumer technology stacks, continues to make substantial strides in the market. As we enter 2016, the backlog of merchants that are waiting to go live to site has never been stronger. To put that into perspective, the implementation pipeline is equal to 100% of the merchants that went live to site in 2015. 
We are also seeing strong growth in our PayPal Credit products. PayPal Credit is available at millions of online stores as a funding option to the PayPal wallet, giving consumers enhanced flexibility for how the pay, while often boosting basket sizes for merchants. In addition, we have tripled the originations for our PayPal Working Capital product and help to boost the Net Promoter Score for merchants who use PayPal Working Capital to almost 80%.
In the past few months, we have made great strides to broaden our universe of strategic partners, which now includes some of the world's leading social media networks, mobile carriers, commerce platforms and financial networks like First Data. In Q4, PayPal continued to expand our business relationship with Alibaba, launching a pilot program for select vendors who sell on wholesaler with B2B section of Alibaba's website to accept PayPal.
In December, PayPal announced Braintree is powering a commerce experience for Facebook's Messenger platform with Uber. With this new feature, users can request a ride from the car service without ever needing to leave a conversation or provide new payment information. The service uses Braintree's tokenization to process the payments regardless of whether the consumer has an Uber account. Increasingly we're enabling merchants and consumers to connect and transact on demand, virtually anywhere, anytime and within any context.
2015 was a foundational year for PayPal. We completed our separation from eBay. We are now largely complete with the re-platforming of our technology stack, allowing us to innovate and bring new experiences to the market with major product releases every 2 weeks. We established our vision and mission to redefine the new PayPal. And most importantly, we are aligned as one team and executing against our game plan and our results demonstrate that 
As much as we accomplished in 2015, I believe that 2016 will be the year in which our new value propositions and experiences begin to demonstrate how PayPal can widen its lead in a world rapidly moving towards digital and mobile payments. It will take us time to fully execute against our full potential, but I firmly believe we are strengthening our set of assets, capabilities and value proposition for both consumers and merchants, and we look forward to demonstrating that in the year ahead.
And with that, let me turn it over to John"

Growth in active accounts, payment volume and revenue all a",1585,"Thanks, Dan. I also want to thank all of PayPal's customers and our 17,000 employees worldwide for making 2015 a great year. We had a strong fourth quarter and exited the year with good momentum. Growth in active accounts, payment volume and revenue all accelerated from the previous quarter. We grew faster than the market and gained market share. 
Total payment volume for the year was $282 billion, an increase of 27% on a currency-neutral basis, which accelerated 1 point over 2014. Our share gain demonstrates that our strategy is working, as we focus on being the customer champion and move from being a payment button to an end-to-end payment solution for merchants of all sizes.
In the quarter, we added 6.6 million new active accounts, including the acquisition of Xoom. This was our highest increase ever. Excluding the acquisition of Xoom, we added over 5 million new accounts in the quarter which was a high watermark for the year. At the end of the quarter, 56% of the total active accounts were outside of the U.S, demonstrating our global reach. 
By adding capabilities and services like credit and remittances, we are becoming more relevant in our customers' daily lives. As a result, the number of payment transactions per active account increased to 27, up 12% from a year ago.
We expanded our merchant footprint and simplified some checkout experience for our customers through the continued rollout of our One Touch product. We extended our reach in the quarter to 75 of the 100 largest North American Internet retailers and continue to add important retailers internationally like IKEA. We continue to drive the growth of mobile payments. During the year, we processed 1.4 billion mobile transactions and $66 billion of mobile payment volume, which was up 44%. 
Turning to our quarterly results. For the fourth quarter, PayPal generated $2.6 billion in revenue, up 21% on a currency-neutral basis. Xoom contributed approximately 1 point of growth or $26 million. Transaction revenue increased 20%, while other value-added services grew 31%. Transaction revenue benefited to ripened [ph] engagement as reflected by the increase in the number of payment transactions per active customer account. This increase reflects the growing relevancy of Braintree's unbranded products and the evolution from a payment button or a tender type to a payment partner where we capture all of the merchant's processing volumes. Other value-added services benefited from the growing penetration of PayPal Credit, as well as the amended contracts with Synchrony Financial in the previous quarter. The number of payment transactions in the quarter increased 25% year-over-year, driven by Braintree and growth in the media and travel verticals. Total payment volume was $82 billion in the quarter, up 29% on a currency-neutral basis. Of that, U.S. payment volume grew 29% while international growth was 28%.
We continue to demonstrate good control of our expenses. Total expenses were $2 billion, up 15%, less than the 17% growth in revenue. Our volume-based variable expenses, which are transaction expense and transaction and loan losses, were up 25%. However, we gained economies of scale on our other expenses which grew less than half of revenue growth. 
As we continue to execute on our strategy to expand our presence with large merchants, which increases our relevance with consumers, the revenue benefit we received from those such merchants is partially offset by a lower take rate due to volume-based pricing. We also experienced a higher mix of credit card payments by our fast growing Braintree platform, which increases our transactional expense. Because of this, our overall transaction volume for the quarter declined 250 basis points. While large merchants and Braintree contribute to a lower overall transaction margin, it dragged increased utilization of our PayPal-branded products and increased the overall bottom line. 
In the quarter, we expanded our operating margin 90 basis points from the same quarter a year ago. This demonstrates our ability to maintain and even grow our margins with the economies of scale that we have in our business, as well as this management team's discipline around controlling costs.
And as the mix of our business shifts, we will continue to achieve expense leverage. When looking at our full year results, total expenses per transaction declined 8%. However, our nonvolume related expenses declined 12%. With CapEx coming in at 6% of our revenue, free cash flow in the quarter was $564 million, representing $0.22 of free cash for every dollar of revenue. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $5.7 billion, including approximately $1.5 billion in the U.S. And now to guidance.
Our business is performing great and we are executing on our strategy and delivering on our commitments. Our strong performance in 2015 only reinforces our conviction in the opportunity that we have. Let me give you some context with how we're thinking about the business moving forward. We are investing to expand our footprint and grow relevancy. Areas of investment include product, brand, global reach, Xoom integration and security. We expect this to translate into an acceleration of volume growth in 2016. As I stated earlier, this will result in a decline in our take rates but not on operating margin. We expect that the lower take rate will be driven by our strategic initiatives as we look to gain market share and integrate Xoom.
In 2016, based on current exchange rates, we will experience less impact from currency than last year, net of hedging gains. We expect it to be at a 3-point headwind to revenue growth this year versus the 4-point headwind in 2015. We expect Xoom to contribute approximately $200 million in revenue, but it will be dilutive to operating margin as we integrate it to the platform. We will continue to gain economies of scale and achieve cost efficiencies and customer support, technology and other areas of our business. 
At the time of our spin, we provided guidance for 2016 and guidance over the medium term. We met or exceeded our guidance in every aspect for 2015, and our performance last year only increases our conviction in the medium-term guidance of mid-20s growth in payment volume, 15% constant currency revenue growth, stable to growing operating margins and free cash flow that grows in line with revenue.
For the full year 2016, we expect revenue between $10.5 billion to $10.7 billion, representing currency-neutral growth of 16% to 19%, with the currency translation impact on the full year revenue to be approximately 3 points, resulting in spot revenue growth of 14% to 16%. 
I'd like to provide a little color on the shape of revenue for the year ago. We expect our revenue growth to be very similar to the first half of 2016 versus the second half of 2016. For the first quarter of 2016, we expect revenue growth on a currency-neutral basis to be between 19% and 21%. However, we expect to have some lumpiness in our second quarter revenue growth as a result of the sale of our credit receivables and amended Synchrony agreement last year. Because of these items, we expect a 6-point decline in revenue growth from the first quarter to the second quarter. We expect to return to a more normalized growth rate in the third quarter, however.
We expect our full year 2016 non-GAAP EPS to be between $1.45 and $1.50 representing growth of 14% to 18%, and we expect full year free cash flow to grow faster than revenue growth for the year coming in above $2.1 billion. We expect our CapEx as a percent of revenue to decline 1 to 2 points from 2015 to approximately 6% to 7% of revenue, and the non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 18% and 19%. 
For the first quarter, we expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.34 and $0.36, representing growth of 18% to 25% year-over-year. As I mentioned on our last earnings call, there are a few companies of our size with our balance sheet and growth rate that are generating the free cash flow of PayPal. We have a tremendous operating to increase shareholder value with the deployment of that cash flow. Today, we announced a $2 billion share repurchase program. I want to be clear about our cash flow priorities. They are in order: to invest in organic growth, grow through strategic acquisitions and then to return capital to shareholders. With our balance sheet and cash flow generation, we can address all 3 of these to maximize shareholder return. The share buyback program will enable us to offset dilution from stock-based compensation, which we expect to be 1% to 1.5% of our shares outstanding, but we will also be good capital allocators and have the flexibility to be more aggressive with repurchases when we see the opportunity to purchase our stock at a level that's well below its intrinsic value.
In closing, I'm very excited about the opportunity we have at PayPal to grow as the leading payments platform worldwide. Our trusted brand, global breadth and growing installed base of engaged customers are driving the digitization of payments and the transformation to a connected mobile world. We are laser focused on executing on our business plan. We have created a leading technology platform with a sustainable financial model that allows us to keep innovating and growing at scale. Our unparalleled combination of scale, growth and cash generation provides us with a tremendous opportunity to increase shareholder value.
With that, let me turn it back to the operator for questions."

Second thing on the margin. We said this on our roadshow, I'll repeat it here. Margins in our business want to move up. That is kind of the tendency of the margin structure in our business. We just bought on $200 million of approximately -- of revenue from Xoom coming into this year that basically is dilutive to that. If you normalize for some of the one-time events that came in, you see margin continuing to grow this year like it did last year. And so you've got some one-time moving things coming through the income statement this year, but we are very confident in the medium-term guidance of flat to growing margins. And we have and are experiencing those economies of scale in the 50% of our cost base that's fixed, that we can affect on that. So we feel good about that medium-term guidance and you should understand kind of the one-time nature of some high revenue things, margin revenue that's leaving us that were onetime last year and Xoom.

Yes, we've been averaging about 4 million over the last couple of years. And we, in the last 2 quarters, have seen an increase in the organic growth on new accounts coming in. And I would put that to basically 2 or 3 things that are happening. First of all, our value proposition is definitely getting stronger. Things like One Touch are increasing the engagement. We have a large chunk of our base right now that's quite engaged and therefore our churn is going down, that's one thing. Number two, the PayPal brand is beginning to resonate even more so across the world. And we're seeing a higher number of people coming into the top of the funnel. And because we really made substantial strides on the technology infrastructure, we are able to do a tremendous amount of A-B testing right now to increase the top of the funnel going all the way through to making their first transaction. Truthfully, I think we're at the beginning stages of all of that. And I still think it's wise to model in around 4 million or so, but if you had to ask me where my bias is, my bias is that probably we'll be slightly higher than that given the trends that we're seeing. So it's not seasonality. It is the trends that we're seeing through kind of the strength of the business."

And in terms of where we fit in with the ecosystem, we clearly have quite a number of conversations across a number of partners through the financial systems ecosystem. I believe that we are getting closer with all of those participants as we look at how we can be great partners. Craig, we drive tremendous amount of volume for our network partners. We have over 13 million merchants on our platform. The vast majority of them, overwhelming majority of those, are the long tail and we enable card acceptance at all of those small to midsized merchants. And so we drive a large number of incremental transaction volume over the networks. We also are beginning to do a lot more in terms of things like One Touch where, once you default to a payment type, you stay defaulted to that payment type. And we increasingly believe that a customer should have a choice of their payment option. We want to be a customer champion on that. If they choose to use whatever form of payment they want, that's fine with us. And so consequently, I think our relationships are improving with everybody across the financial services ecosystem. Obviously, anything can happen at anytime on these things, but we're in lots of conversations with lots of partners, including Visa."

We have over 1 billion tokenized payments credentials on our platform. And we view that to make payments safer for customers, make it easier and simpler for merchants to accept.

But I would expect to start to see financial impact in 2017 and 2018 as we go at it. First of all, I'd like to say a couple of things. First, Venmo is not just another buy button. You've seen some of those commentary out there, it is the most beloved way to pay for millennials. It is a highly desirable demographic for merchants and there is large demand for it, outside of NexGen merchants. You already are seeing like Papa John's use it as a splitting mechanism. And there's tremendous demand for merchants for pay with Venmo. Through the v.zero, which is where we'll initially integrate this, the integration of any payment type is easy. It's really a small effort. And quite frankly, quite soon we expect 0 coding required for merchants to integrate with the pay with Venmo button. But as we go into the third quarter, just like we did in fourth quarter, just like we did with One Touch, we started to expand pay with Venmo into the PayPal merchant base. And there, basically somebody with Venmo will be able to click on a PayPal button and just pay with Venmo. Not actually have to put another button onto their site. Many merchants want the Venmo button because it is the way millennials think about managing and moving their money. But many merchants may just want to keep the PayPal button. And we'll interview that user base of PayPal -- of Venmo users right into that. And to your -- and one other thing. We started in-app, but obviously like One Touch we're going to go it on a mobile web and other web-based pieces of this quite quickly. We've got a very engaged Venmo base, and they have been asking to expand that -- to move into the shop. You're exactly right, that is going to be a large amount of TPV, a reasonable amount of TPV right now, that is 0 take rate. And that take rate will obviously go up overtime. And that will be a counter pressure to take rate decline over time. It won't completely eclipse it obviously, but it will be a counter to it, absolutely. And we think this is just the beginning of the ways that we can start to monetize what is a rapidly growing segment of the market that really thinks of Venmo as the way they manage moving of money. I'll let John talk about the other part of your question."

Like the day that I came here to PayPal was the day that Apple Pay was an announced, so those 2 things are etched in my mind. It's been 18 months, right? And in the last 18 months, what's happened? We've added 25 million-plus net new active accounts. We have more engagements than we've ever in our base. We have accelerating TPV, accelerating revenue. It came up -- and why is that? Honestly, it's because payments is really hard. And it is hard to crack. And the other thing is that there value propositions out there that focus on a piece of payments, and we have a very comprehensive value proposition. And I will say this, we are not standing still. I have operational reviews every single month with my team, and the last thing that I said to them -- to the consumer and the merchant team is, I truly believe that what they've done and where those teams are going will widen the distance in terms of our value prop. And I hope to be able to do that. I think you could see some of that with One Touch. I hope you'll see other things as we move forward. We basically -- this has not been an easy journey for PayPal. We've had to fully upgrade our technology platform. But we've done most of that. And because of that, really for the first time, the innovation that's always been here, we're just not able to get through our pipeline, is now actually coming into the market and innovating at scale. You've seen the backlog of sales that we have right now, that's because of demand, and demand for the value proposition that we have on the Braintree side. One other thing I'll just say, at this point, the more announcements that come out actually the better off I think it is for us. It is so confusing out there for a customer. You have another announcement coming out, there's a lot of Balkanization going on, a lot of confusion. You can only use this pay in this retailer, this pay with this technology, this pay with this device. And we've got a real trusted brand. We've got a base of almost 180 million customers right now. And I think that the more confusing it is out there, the more people turn to brands that they can trust and that work across any OS, any device, any POS technology out there, I actually think at this point, although I respect every one of those competitors greatly and we watch everything carefully, our biggest competition is our ability to execute against our game plan right now. We have a good game plan, we have a really good road map to increase our value proposition for the merchants and consumers and we just need to stay focused on that and get those things out into the market and our results. Hopefully we'll continue the same thing that we've done over the last 18 months."

Modest, you're starting to see some of that already with what we've been able to do on Pinterest, what we've been able to do with Facebook, what we've been able to do with contextual commerce, and stay tuned on that front. We've got a lot more coming out on that piece of it. Xoom just closed. We're obviously moving to integrate that -- with that onto the PayPal platform. And when we're able to do that is that of it just being U.S. send-out, we'll start to integrate other countries, other corridors, cross-sell, so there's a tremendous leveraging of that we can do on the Xoom side. Paydiant, we've spent a bunch of time now innovating Paydiant into the PayPal and Braintree stacks. And I just had a review again last month, we're largely complete with Phase 1 of that. And what that really allows us to do was take a platform that -- a white label platform. Just think about it, a lot of our off-line movement is to provide a white label platform to allow merchants to write their own apps, right? And because merchants understand their consumers better than we will ever do that. And they know their consumers, they know the value prop that a consumer will respond to, they drive people to that value prop, like Subway is a great example, right? They can customize their sandwich, they can defined the pickup time, they can come in, skip the line, get immediate rewards, then decide to pay with those rewards right at the time of the sale or split tender that. All of that is powered through our unbranded platform. So it's not just payment types, but rewards and offers this pay. This is sort of the ultimate way that we're thinking about it. And we are really -- I think we are going where the trends are going. We're not trying to react to, oh, let's NFC over here, or whatever it may be. it doesn't mean that we won't have NFC on, it's part of our wealth. And we don't think that that's a winning strategies, just substituting tapping a phone for swiping a card. What we think is a winning strategy is allowing merchants to use the power of mobile to get closer to their customers, and we want to help power the difficult plumbing of that. All the payment processing of any payment type, rewards, offers, et cetera. And we are having substantially different conversations with our merchant base as a result of that platform, much more strategic in nature, much more about where the industry and the nature of commerce is going. As opposed to, as John said in his remarks, as opposed to just being a tender type, a part of checkout in which really that's really a commodity -- or an increasing commodity element versus kind of the digitization of commerce going forward. And so I couldn't be happier actually with that Paydiant acquisition. It is the engine piece of that in-store element. You connect that, which I think is sort of the leading in-store platform player, with us, PayPal traditional which I think was a leading player in online and Braintree which is the leading mobile player. Combine those together, it's a very powerful -- and combine then 100 -- almost 180 million consumers that we can bring to light up that platform by doing credentialization of identification, et cetera, to take friction out of the sign-up process. And it's a pretty strong set of assets that we bring to the off-line market. That's a tremendously large opportunity for us but we are just starting here. So I don't want to oversell it at all. I love the set of assets we bring to it but it's a very, very early innings on that."

You can visit our Investor Relations website for the latest company news and updates. In addition, an archive of the webcast will be accessible for 90 days through the same link.
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about our company's performance, including the non-GAAP pro forma metrics mentioned above. You can find a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. In addition, management will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include, but are not limited to, future performance of PayPal, including expected financial results for the first quarter and full year 2016.

112732,323433962,921934,"PayPal Holdings, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,"Earnings Calls","PayPal Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom.

I'm pleased to report that PayPal had a very strong Q4 topping off with solid year. We delivered every one of our 2015 commitments to shareholders: driving payment volume, revenue growth, operating margin and free cash flow above or at the high end of our guidance range, despite considerable pressure from foreign currency headwinds. And we exited the year with considerable momentum.
In Q4, we acquired more customers than in any other quarter in PayPal's history and further accelerated our payment volume and revenue growth rates.
Payment volume increased 29% and revenue grew 21% on an FX-neutral basis. And our merchant services payment volume accelerated to 36% FX-neutral growth, substantially greater than the rate of e-commerce, leading to another quarter of increased market share gains.
For the full year, we delivered $282 billion in payment volume, up 27% and an FX-neutral revenue growth of 19%. We also continue to strengthen our lead in mobile payments. In 2015, almost 30% of the payments made on our platform were from a mobile device.
We operate a complex global business. PayPal is a full services technology platform, where we acquire both consumers and merchants and perform all payments processing. This includes risk and fraud prevention, customer service and new products, like international remittances across online, in-app and in-store environments.
Despite that complexity, our business model success can be reduced to 4 key metrics: our top line growth, our net active customer base, the engagement of that base and our ability to produce strong free cash flow. In 2015, in the face of a constant stream of competitive announcements, PayPal accelerated the strength of our business across every key metrics. We grew our top line, posting full year revenue of $9.24 billion. As I mentioned, this was up 19% on an FX-neutral basis, which was above the high end of the 15% to 18% full year guidance we communicated during our roadshow. And Q4 revenues accelerated to 21% to $2.56 billion.
We expanded our customer base in Q4 with a record-breaking 6.6 million new accounts, including 1.6 million from Xoom. As a result, we ended the year with 179 million active accounts, adding over 17 million net new accounts this year. Our continually expanding customer base strengthens our competitive position and makes our platform deeply relevant to merchants and partners around the world.
In addition to attracting more customers to our platform, we increased the level of customer engagement by significantly enhancing our consumer value proposition. We measure consumer or customer engagement by the number of transactions per account, and I'm pleased with our progress on this front. We ended the year at over 27 transactions per account, driving nearly 5 billion transactions across our platform for the full year. And we continue to generate strong free cash flow.
In 2015, we generated $1.8 billion in cash and over $1 billion of that in the second half of the year alone. This cash flow provides us the flexibility to pursue multiple options and opportunities. Our accelerating performance, combined with our increasing ability to execute and innovate, provide us a high degree of confidence in our future.
As a result, today, we are announcing a $2 billion share buyback program, which John Rainey will discuss in more detail.
There are 2 massive changes underway in the world: the digitization of cash and the mass adoption of mobile phones. This dynamic is creating a seismic shift that's transforming money in the very nature of commerce. PayPal is playing a leading role in this transformation. And we feel our assets are well suited to drive further differentiation. These trends present us with the opportunity to be at the center of people's daily financial lives and position PayPal to become the go-to platform for digital payments globally.
We are in the lead because no other payments technology platform offers the combination of advantages that PayPal does. We benefit from our unmatched and growing global scale, our rapidly expanding customer base, our trusted brands, our unique 2-sided network, our open platform and technology-agnostic offerings, our risk management and our global customer service capabilities. All of these assets drive the success we witnessed in the quarter and throughout 2015.
While many others are attempting to play in this space, PayPal continues to gain market share quarter after quarter, attracting new customers and increasing the engagement of our existing base. It's becoming increasingly evident that payments is a hard business to crack.
The combination of strong secular tailwinds and our increasing ability to execute across multiple fronts provides us a long runway for growth. And we are working hard to greatly expand the value of our technology platform for consumers and merchants around the world.
For consumers, we're focused on using our technology platform to facilitate the movement and management of money. That means more than simply enabling commerce. It means we are reimagining what basic consumer financial transactions can be in a world dominated by mobile and software. We want to leverage our globally trusted brands and define digital money. This allows us to extend our platform to reach underserved markets and expand our value proposition to include international remittances, bill payment, person-to-person payments and charitable giving.
We made a significant step forward in the expansion of our platform with the close of our Xoom acquisition. Xoom is the latest example of PayPal adding new capabilities to acquire new customers and increase engagements. It is a mobile technology leader that enables customers in the United States to send money to and pay bills for family and friends in 41 countries around the world. The cross-border P-to-P opportunity is significant and Xoom will accelerate our growth in that market.
Of course, we continue to be a preferred way to enable consumers to shop online. This year, Cyber Monday was our biggest online shopping day in PayPal's history, with our platform processing almost 450 payments per second in our peak hour. However, the power of the PayPal platform is also demonstrated in other ways such as our ability to help consumers drive social impact.
Throughout this year's holiday season, $857 million was raised globally for charity through our platform. This unprecedented level of year-end charitable giving was driven by the generosity of more than 7 million people from 183 countries who supported more than quarter of a million charities. These are amazing stats and they demonstrate the power of our platform in helping to make a real difference in the world.
The growth of Venmo clearly conveys our ability of our platform to connect people to each other by offering simple and engaging ways to move money. This past year, Venmo processed $7.5 billion in payments, up 213%, with $2.5 billion of this volume being processed in the fourth quarter alone.
We made good progress in setting up the technical infrastructure to allow customers to pay online merchants with the Venmo app. This new feature became available to select merchants for pilot implementation in December, and we are now live with 2 merchants, GameTime and Munchery. We plan a robust rollout of Pay with Venmo throughout 2016. And we will continue to introduce and expand features that will allow us to monetize our Venmo assets, providing our customers the ability to use Venmo to pay friends, shop and eventually access a host of other basic financial services.
We also made progress expanding the ability of consumers to use PayPal in-store, by making it easier for merchants to accept PayPal's tokenized payments. PayPal signed a strategic agreement with First Data to enable the acceptance of PayPal tokens in-store for First Data's acquiring clients and businesses. This is an important step forward in driving availability of PayPal at the point-of-sale, as First Data is the largest U.S. merchant processor.
We believe the shift towards tokenization is an opportunity that will significantly help our business, enabling PayPal to expand and grow our ubiquity. PayPal was the first company to introduce tokenization and has always tokenized customer data to make payments safer for customers and simpler for merchants to accept. PayPal's tokenization capabilities allow portability of tokens with greater safety and security than most solutions today.
We also handle more payment types than just credit cards. This means merchants don't have to process a different set of parameters for credit cards, PayPal or any other new payment method introduced, it can all be done with one token. And with more than 1 billion tokenized payment instruments and a 17-year head start of tokenization, we intend to leverage our expertise and scale to further enhance our growth across multiple channels.
For our merchant customers, PayPal has evolved beyond being just a button on their website. We are slowly but surely being recognized as providing a full suite of payment solutions to help their businesses grow. And by doing so, we continue to further differentiate our value proposition from other competitors. This includes a robust set of APIs from our platform that allows a merchant to easily integrate across multiple payment types as well as rewards and offers module into their own app. We are providing our merchant base the options they need to propel their business forward to connect with their customers in new and powerful ways, that go well beyond substituting the tap of a mobile phone or a card swipe. We are providing the tools and platforms to help power new and engaging value propositions.
One Touch has been a driving force in helping merchants and consumers to interact in a frictionless manner. In just over 6 months, more than 15 million consumers have opted in to use One Touch. And today, PayPal is processing millions of One Touch transactions each month, showing true innovation at scale. More than 50% of the Internet Retailer 500 and more than 1 million merchants in 23 countries have One Touch enabled to make it easier for their customers to check out quickly and securely. And we expect that number to grow significantly throughout the year. We will roll out to an additional 100 countries in the next 6 months. Importantly, we continue to see a significant lift in conversion when One Touch is used and we see increased consumer engagement.
Braintree's v.zero platform, now fully integrated with PayPal's merchant and consumer technology stacks, continues to make substantial strides in the market. As we enter 2016, the backlog of merchants that are waiting to go live to site has never been stronger. To put that into perspective, the implementation pipeline is equal to 100% of the merchants that went live to site in 2015.
We are also seeing strong growth in our PayPal Credit products. PayPal Credit is available at millions of online stores as a funding option through the PayPal wallet, giving consumers enhanced flexibility for how the pay, while often boosting basket sizes for merchants. In addition, we have tripled the originations for our PayPal Working Capital product and help to boost the Net Promoter Score for merchants who use PayPal Working Capital to almost 80%.
In the past few months, we've made great strides to broaden our universe of strategic partners, which now includes some of the world's leading social media networks, mobile carriers, commerce platforms and financial networks like First Data. In Q4, PayPal continue to expand our business relationship with Alibaba, launching a pilot program for select vendors who sell on wholesaler with B2B section of Alibaba's website to accept PayPal.
In December, PayPal announced Braintree is powering the commerce experience for Facebook's Messenger platform with Uber. With this new feature, users can request a ride from the car service without ever needing to leave a conversation or provide new payment information. The service uses Braintree's tokenization to process the payments regardless of whether the consumer has an Uber account. Increasingly, we're enabling merchants and consumers to connect and transact on demand, virtually anywhere, anytime and within any context.
2015 was a foundational year for PayPal. We completed our separation from eBay. We are now largely complete with the re-platforming of our technology stack, allowing us to innovate and bring new experiences to the market, with major product releases every 2 weeks. We established our vision and mission to redefine the new PayPal. And most importantly, we are aligned as one team and executing against our game plan and our results demonstrate that.
As much as we accomplished in 2015, I believe that 2016 will be the year in which our new value propositions and experiences begin to demonstrate how PayPal can widen its lead in a world rapidly moving towards digital and mobile payments. It will take us time to fully execute against our full potential, but I firmly believe we are strengthening our set of assets, capabilities and value proposition for both consumers and merchants, and we look forward to demonstrating that in the year ahead.
And with that, let me turn it over to John."
112732,323433962,921934,"PayPal Holdings, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,"Earnings Calls","PayPal Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dan.

We had a strong fourth quarter and exited the year with good momentum. Growth in active accounts, payment volume and revenue all accelerated from the previous quarter. We grew faster than the market and gained market share.
Total payment volume for the year was $282 billion, an increase of 27% on a currency-neutral basis, which accelerated 1 point over 2014. Our share gain demonstrates that our strategy is working, as we focused on being the customer champion and move from being a payment button to an end-to-end payment solution for merchants of all sizes.
In the quarter, we added 6.6 million new active accounts, including the acquisition of Xoom. This was our highest increase ever. Excluding the acquisition of Xoom, we added over 5 million new accounts in the quarter which was a high watermark for the year. At the end of the quarter, 56% of the total active accounts were outside of the U.S, demonstrating our global reach.
By adding capabilities and services like credit and remittances, we are becoming more relevant in our customers' daily lives. As a result, the number of payment transactions per active account increased to 27, up 12% from a year ago.
We expanded our merchant footprint and simplified from checkout experience for our customers through the continued rollout of our One Touch product. We extended our reach in the quarter to 75 of the 100 largest North American Internet retailers and continue to add important retailers internationally like IKEA. We continue to drive the growth of mobile payments. During the year, we processed 1.4 billion mobile transactions and $66 billion of mobile payment volume, which was up 44%.
Turning to our quarterly results. For the fourth quarter, PayPal generated $2.6 billion in revenue, up 21% on a currency-neutral basis. Xoom contributed approximately one point of growth or $26 million. Transaction revenue increased 20%, while other value-added services grew 31%. Transaction revenue benefited from rising engagement as reflected by the increase in the number of payment transactions per active customer account. This increase reflects the growing relevancy of Braintree's unbranded products and the evolution from a payment button or tender type to payment partner, where we capture all of the merchant's processing volumes.
Other value-added services benefited from the growing penetration of PayPal Credit, as well as the amended contracts with Synchrony Financial in the previous quarter. The number of payment transactions in the quarter increased 25% year-over-year, driven by Braintree and growth in the media and travel verticals. Total payment volume was $82 billion in the quarter, up 29% on a currency-neutral basis. Of that, U.S. payment volume grew 29% while international growth was 28%.
We continue to demonstrate good control of our expenses. Total expenses were $2 billion, up 15%, less than the 17% growth in revenue. Our volume-based variable expenses, which are transaction expense and transaction and loan losses, were up 25%. However, we gained economies of scale on our other expenses, which grew less than half of revenue growth.
As we continue to execute on our strategy to expand our presence with large merchants, which increases our relevance with consumers, the revenue benefit we received from those large merchants is partially offset by a lower take rate due to volume-based pricing. We also experienced a higher mix of credit card payments by our fast-growing Braintree platform, which increases our transaction expense. Because of this, our overall transaction volume for the quarter declined 250 basis points. While large merchants and Braintree contribute to a lower overall transaction margin, it dragged increased utilization of our PayPal-branded products and increased the overall bottom line.
In the quarter, we expanded our operating margin 90 basis points from the same quarter a year ago. This demonstrates our ability to maintain and even grow our margins with the economies of scale that we have in our business as well as this management team's discipline around controlling costs.
As the mix of our business shifts, we will continue to achieve expense leverage. When looking at our full year results, total expenses per transaction declined 8%. However, our nonvolume-related expenses declined 12%. With CapEx coming in at 6% of our revenue, free cash flow in the quarter was $564 million, representing $0.22 of free cash for every dollar of revenue. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $5.7 billion, including approximately $1.5 billion in the U.S. 
And now to guidance.  Our business is performing great and we are executing on our strategy and delivering on our commitments. Our strong performance in 2015 only reinforces our conviction in the opportunity that we have. Let me give you some context with how we're thinking about the business looking forward. We are investing to expand our footprint and grow relevancy. Areas of investment include product, brand, global reach, Xoom integration and security. We expect this to translate into an acceleration of volume growth in 2016. As I stated earlier, this will result in a decline in our take rate, but not on operating margin. We expect that the lower take rate will be driven by our strategic initiatives as we look to gain market share and integrate Xoom.
In 2016, based on current exchange rates, we will experience less impact from currency than last year, net of hedging gains. We expect it to be a 3-point headwind to revenue growth this year versus the 4-point headwind in 2015. We expect Xoom to contribute approximately $200 million in revenue, but it will be dilutive to operating margin as we integrate it into the platform. We will continue to gain economies of scale and achieve cost efficiencies and customer support, technology and other areas of our business.
At the time of our spin, we provided guidance for 2015 and guidance over the medium term. We met or exceeded our guidance in every aspect for 2015. And our performance last year only increases our conviction in the medium-term guidance of mid-20s growth in payment volume, 15% constant currency revenue growth, stable to growing operating margins and free cash flow that grows in line with revenue.
For the full year 2016, we expect revenue between $10.5 billion to $10.7 billion, representing currency-neutral growth of 16% to 19%, with the currency translation impact on the full year revenue to be approximately 3 points, resulting in spot revenue growth of 14% to 16%.
I'd like to provide a little color on the shape of revenue for the year ago. We expect our revenue growth to be very similar in the first half of 2016 versus the second half of 2016. For the first quarter of 2016, we expect revenue growth on a currency-neutral basis to be between 19% and 21%. However, we expect to have some lumpiness in our second quarter revenue growth as a result of the sale of our credit receivables and amended Synchrony agreement last year. Because of these items, we expect a 6-point decline in revenue growth from the first quarter to the second quarter. We expect to return to a more normalized growth rate in the third quarter, however.
We expect our full year 2016 non-GAAP EPS to be between $1.45 and $1.50 representing growth of 14% to 18%. And we expect full year free cash flow to grow faster than revenue growth for the year coming in above $2.1 billion. We expect our CapEx as a percent of revenue to decline 1 to 2 points from 2015 to approximately 6% to 7% of revenue, and the non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 18% and 19%.
For the first quarter, we expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.34 and $0.36, representing growth of 18% to 25% year-over-year. As I mentioned on our last earnings call, there are few companies of our size with our balance sheet and growth rate that are generating the free cash flow of PayPal. We have a tremendous opportunity to increase shareholder value with the deployment of that cash flow. Today, we announced a $2 billion share repurchase program. I want to be clear about our cash flow priorities. They are in order: to invest in organic growth, grow through strategic acquisitions and then to return capital to shareholders. With our balance sheet and cash flow generation, we can address all 3 of these to maximize shareholder return. The share buyback program will enable us to offset dilution from stock-based compensation, which we expect to be 1% to 1.5% of our shares outstanding, but we will also be good capital allocators and have the flexibility to be more aggressive with repurchases when we see the opportunity to purchase our stock at a level that is well below its intrinsic value.
In closing, I'm very excited about the opportunity we have at PayPal to grow as the leading payments platform worldwide. Our trusted brand, global breadth and growing installed base of engaged customers are driving the digitization of payments and the transformation to a connected mobile world. We are laser focused on executing on our business plan. We have created a leading technology platform with a sustainable financial model that allows us to keep innovating and growing at scale. Our unparalleled combination of scale, growth and cash generation provides us with a tremendous opportunity to increase shareholder value.
With that, let me turn it back to the operator for questions."

As we continue to demonstrate the ability to achieve operating leverage in our business, we still are going to invest in areas of growth like Xoom and that's a great example. And at that time, we expect -- for 2016, we expect Xoom to be a little bit of a drag on our margin. But we're extremely excited about the capability that it provides and how it dovetails into the overall PayPal platform and expect it to be accretive in the not-too-distant future.

And honestly, as I look at the growth trajectory for the business, whether it'd be more net new actives that we're bringing in, increasing the engagement of those actives, these things like One Touch in which we're seeing a lot more engagement and the growth of that, whether it'd be to new partners, new markets, new adjacencies like international remittances, just honestly secular tailwinds for the first time ever, on Black Friday, more people shopped online than in-store. You've got a tremendous amount of growth levers. And our value proposition is growing in both a sophistication and what we're able to offer both the merchants and consumers. And so I do expect the engagement per customer to continue to grow nicely. Second thing on the margin. We said this on our roadshow, I'll repeat it here. Margins in our business want to move up. That is kind of the tendency of the margin structure in our business. We just bought on $200 million of approximately -- of revenue from Xoom coming into this year that basically is dilutive to that. If you normalize for some of the one-time events that came in, you see margin continuing to grow this year like it did last year. And so you've got some one-time moving things coming through the income statement this year, but we are very confident in the medium-term guidance of flat to growing margins. And we have and are experiencing those economies of scale in the 50% of our cost base that's fixed, that we can affect on that. So we feel good about that medium-term guidance and you should understand kind of the one-time nature of some higher revenue things, margin revenue that's leaving us that were onetime last year and Xoom. And we expect Xoom margins to grow over time and to be in line with our margin structure as well."

And I would put that to basically 2 or 3 things that are happening. First of all, our value proposition is definitely getting stronger. Things like One Touch are increasing the engagement. We have a large chunk of our base right now that's quite engaged and therefore, our churn is going down. That's one thing. Number two, the PayPal brand is beginning to resonate even more so across the world. And we're seeing a higher number of people coming into the top of the funnel. And because we really made substantial strides on the technology infrastructure, we are able to do a tremendous amount of A, B testing right now to increase the top of the funnel going all the way through to making their first transaction. Truthfully, I think we're at the beginning stages of all of that. And I still think it's wise to model in around 4 million or so, but if you had to ask me where my bias is, my bias is that will probably be slightly higher than that given the trends that we're seeing.

We don't break out kind of where that is from a Venmo perspective, but Venmo is still a smaller -- much smaller part of our overall base. And in terms of where we fit in with the ecosystem, we clearly have quite a number of conversations across a number of partners through the financial systems ecosystem. I believe that we are getting closer with all of those participants as we look at how we could be great partners. Craig, we drive tremendous amount of volume for our network partners. We have over 13 million merchants on our platform. The vast majority of them, overwhelming majority of those, are the long tail and we enable card acceptance at all of those small to midsized merchants. And so we drive a large number of incremental transaction volume over the networks. We also are beginning to do a lot more in terms of things like One Touch, where once you default to a payment type, you stay defaulted to that payment type. And we are increasingly believe that a customer should have choice of their payment option. We want to be the customer champion on that. If they choose to use whatever form of payment they want, that's fine with us. And so consequently, I think our relationships are improving with everybody across the financial services ecosystem. Obviously, anything can happen at any time on these things, but we're in lots of conversations with lots of partners, including Visa."

But in general, we think that the shift towards tokenization is only going to help our business. It enables us to expand and grow our ubiquity, as I mentioned. And we were a pioneer in tokenization in the payments industry, so we have a tremendous amount of tokenized payments instruments. We have over 1 billion tokenized payments credentials on our platform. And we use that to make payments safer for customers, make it easier and simpler for merchants to accept. And the rest of the payments industry right now is beginning to adopt tokenization, but it opens up a bunch of new opportunities for us. And we believe that we can leverage the expertise we have, the embedded credentials we have, some of the advantages we have to enhance our growth.

But I would expect to start to see financial impact in 2017 and 2018 as we go out. First of all, I'd say a couple of things. First, Venmo is not just another buy button. You've seen some of those commentary out there, it is the most beloved way to pay for millennials. It is a highly desirable demographic for merchants and there is large demand for it, outside of NexGen merchants. You already have seen like Papa John use it as a splitting mechanism. And there's tremendous demand for merchants for Pay with Venmo. Through v.zero, which is where we'll initially integrate this, the integration of any payment type is easy. It's really a small effort. And quite frankly, quite soon, we expect 0 zero coding required for merchants to integrate with the Pay with Venmo button. But as we go into the third quarter, just like we did in fourth quarter, just like we did with One Touch, we started to expand Pay with Venmo into the PayPal merchant base. And there, basically somebody with Venmo will be able to click on a PayPal button and just Pay with Venmo. Not actually have to put another button onto their site. Many merchants want the Venmo button because it is the way millennials think about managing and moving their money. But many merchants may just want to keep the PayPal button and we'll integrate that user base of PayPal -- of Venmo users right into that. And to your -- and one other thing. We started in-app, but obviously like One Touch, we're going to grow it on mobile, web and other web-based pieces of this quite quickly. We've got a very engaged Venmo base, and they have been asking to expand that to move into shop. You're exactly right. That is going to be a large amount of TPV, a reasonable amount of TPV right now, that is 0 take rate. And that take rate will obviously go up over time. And that will be a counter pressure to take rate decline over time. It won't completely eclipse it obviously, but it will be a counter to it, absolutely. And we think this is just the beginning of the ways that we can start to monetize what is a rapidly growing segment of the market that really thinks of Venmo as a way they manage and move money. I'll let John talk about the other part of your question."

Like the day that I came here to PayPal was the day that Apple Pay was announced, so those 2 things are etched in my mind. It's been 18 months, right? And in the last 18 months, what's happened? We've added 25 million-plus net new active accounts. We have more engagement than we've ever had in our base. We have accelerating TPV, accelerating revenue. It came up -- and why is that? Honestly, it's because payments is really hard. And it is hard to crack. And the other thing is that there are value propositions out there to focus on a piece of payments, and we have a very comprehensive value proposition. And I will say this, we are not standing still. I have operational reviews every single month with my team. And the last thing that I said to the consumer and the merchant team is, I truly believe that what they've done and where those teams are going will widen the distance in terms of our value prop. And I hope to be able to -- I think you can see some of that with One Touch. I hope you'll see other things as we move forward. We basically -- this has not been an easy journey for PayPal. We've had to fully upgrade our technology platform. But we've done most of that. And because of that, really for the first time, the innovation that's always been here, we're just not able to get through our pipeline, is now actually coming into the market and innovating at scale. You've seen the backlog of sales that we have right now, that's because of demand, and demand for the value proposition that we have on the Braintree side. One other thing I'll just say, at this point, the more announcements that come out actually the better off I think it is for us. It is so confusing out there for a customer. You have another announcement coming out. There's a lot of tokenization going on, a lot of confusion. You can only use this pay in this retailer, this pay with this technology, this pay with this device. And we've got a real-trusted brand. We've a base of almost 180 million customers right now. And I think that the more confusing it is out there, the more people turn to brands that they can trust and that work across any OS, any device, any POS technology out there. I actually think at this point, although I respect every one of those competitors greatly and we watch everything carefully, our biggest competition is our ability to execute against our game plan right now. We have a good game plan, we have a really good road map to increase our value proposition for the merchants and consumers, and we just need to stay focused on that and get those things out into the market and our results. Hopefully we'll continue to do the same thing that we've done over the last 18 months."

Modest, you're starting to see some of that already with what we've been able to do on Pinterest, what we've been able to do with Facebook, what we've been able to do with contextual commerce, and stay tuned on that front. We've got a lot more coming out on that piece of it. Xoom just closed. We're obviously moving to integrate that -- with that onto the PayPal platform. And when we're able to do that, instead of it just being U.S. and out, we started to integrate other countries, other corridors, cross-sell. So I think there's a tremendous leveraging of that we can do on the Xoom side. Paydiant, we've spent a bunch of time now integrating Paydiant into the PayPal and Braintree stacks. And I just had a review again last month. We're largely complete with Phase 1 of that. And what that really allows us to do is take a platform that -- a white label platform. Just think about it, a lot of our off-line movement is to provide a white label platform to allow merchants to write their own apps, right? And because merchants understand their consumers better than we will ever do that. And they know their consumers, they know the value prop that a consumer will respond to, they drive people to that value prop, like Subway is a great example, right? They can customize their sandwich, they can define the pickup time, they can come in, skip the line, get immediate rewards, then decide to pay with those rewards right at the time of the sale or split tender that. All of that is powered through our unbranded platform. So it's not just payment types, but rewards and offers this pay. That sort of the ultimate way that we're thinking about it. And we are really -- I think we are going where the trends are going. We're not trying to react to, oh, let's NFC over here, or whatever it may be. It doesn't mean that we won't have NFC on, it's part of our [indiscernible]. We don't think that that's a winning strategy, just substituting tapping a phone for swiping a card. What we think is a winning strategy is allowing merchants to use the power of mobile to get closer to their customers. And we want to help power the difficult plumbing of that, all the payment processing of any payment type, rewards, offers, et cetera. And we are having substantially different conversations with our merchant base as a result of that platform, much more strategic in nature, much more about where the industry and the nature of commerce is going as opposed to, as John said in his remarks, as opposed to just being a tender type, a part of checkout in which really that's really a commodity or an increasing commodity element versus kind of the digitization of commerce going forward. And so I couldn't be happier actually with that Paydiant acquisition. It is the engine piece of that in-store element. You connect that, which I think really is a leading in-store platform player with us, PayPal traditional, which I think was like a leading player in online and Braintree, which is a leading mobile player. Combine those together, it's a very powerful -- and combine then 100 -- almost 180 million consumers that we can bring to light up that platform by doing credentialization of identification, et cetera, to take friction out of sign-up process. And it's a pretty strong set of assets that we bring to the off-line market. That's a tremendously large opportunity for us, but we are just starting here. So I don't want to oversell it at all. I love the set of assets we bring to it, but it's a very, very early innings on that."

We're providing a slide presentation to accompany the commentary during the call. All growth rates mentioned in these prepared remarks represent year-over-year comparisons unless they clarify otherwise and all segments' results are adjusted for the effects of foreign currency exchange. 
In the discussion of year-over-year comparisons, including guidance growth rates for the first quarter and full year 2016, we have chosen to present non-GAAP pro forma metrics, which reflect items that are factually supportable, directly attributable to the separation of the company from eBay Inc. on July 17, 2015, and expected to have a continuing impact on the company's results of operations, because we believe that these metrics provide investors a consistent basis for reviewing the company's performance across different periods.
This conference call is also being broadcast on the Internet. And both the presentation and the call are available through the Investor Relations section of the PayPal website at investor.paypal-corp.com. You can visit our Investor Relations website for the latest company news and updates. In addition, an archive of the webcast will be accessible for 90 days through the same link.
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about our company's performance, including the non-GAAP pro forma metrics mentioned above. You can find a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. 
In addition, management will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include, but are not limited to, the future performance of PayPal, including expected financial results for the first quarter and full year 2016. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in this call for a variety of reasons. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our operating results in our Registration Statement on our Form 10 as amended, and our subsequent annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q available at our IR site, investor.paypal-corp.com. You should not rely on any forward-looking statements.

I'm pleased to report that PayPal had a very strong Q4, topping off a solid year. We delivered every one of our 2015 commitments to shareholders: driving payment volume; revenue growth; operating margin and free cash flow above or at the high end of our guidance range, despite considerable pressure from foreign currency headwinds. And we exited the year with considerable momentum.
In Q4, we acquired more customers than in any other quarter in PayPal's history and further accelerated our payment volume and revenue growth rates. Payment volume increased 29% and revenue grew 21% on an FX-neutral basis. And our merchant services payment volume accelerated to 36% FX-neutral growth, substantially greater than the rate of e-commerce, leading to another quarter of increased market share gains.
For the full year, we delivered $282 billion in payment volume, up 27% and an FX-neutral revenue growth of 19%. We also continued to strengthen our lead in mobile payments. In 2015, almost 30% of the payments made on our platform were from a mobile device.
We operate a complex global business. PayPal is a full services technology platform, where we acquire both consumers and merchants and perform all payments processing. This includes risk and fraud prevention, customer service and new products, like international remittances across online, in-app and in-store environments.
Despite that complexity, our business model success can be reduced to 4 key metrics: our top line growth; our net active customer base; the engagement of that base and our ability to produce strong free cash flow. In 2015, in the face of a constant stream of competitive announcements, PayPal accelerated the strength of our business across every key metric. We grew our top line, posting full year revenue of $9.24 billion. As I mentioned, this was up 19% on an FX-neutral basis, which was above the high end of the 15% to 18% full year guidance we communicated during our roadshow. And Q4 revenues accelerated to 21% to $2.56 billion.
We expanded our customer base in Q4 with a record-breaking 6.6 million new accounts, including 1.6 million from Xoom. As a result, we ended the year with 179 million active accounts, adding over 17 million net new accounts this year. Our continually expanding customer base strengthens our competitive position and makes our platform deeply relevant to merchants and partners around the world.
In addition to attracting more customers to our platform, we increased the level of customer engagement by significantly enhancing our consumer value proposition. We measure consumer or customer engagement by the number of transactions per account, and I'm pleased with our progress on this front. We ended the year at over 27 transactions per account, driving nearly 5 billion transactions across our platform for the full year. And we continued to generate strong free cash flow.
In 2015, we generated $1.8 billion in cash and over $1 billion of that in the second half of the year alone. This cash flow provides us the flexibility to pursue multiple options and opportunities. Our accelerating performance, combined with our increasing ability to execute and innovate, provide us a high degree of confidence in our future.
As a result, today, we are announcing a $2 billion share buyback program, which John Rainey will discuss in more detail.
There are 2 massive changes underway in the world: the digitization of cash and the mass adoption of mobile phones. This dynamic is creating a seismic shift that's transforming money and the very nature of commerce. PayPal is playing a leading role in this transformation. And we feel our assets are well-suited to drive further differentiation. These trends present us with the opportunity to be at the center of people's daily financial lives and position PayPal to become the go-to platform for digital payments globally.
We are in the lead because no other payments technology platform offers the combination of advantages that PayPal does. We benefit from our unmatched and growing global scale, our rapidly expanding customer base, our trusted brands, our unique 2-sided network, our open platform and technology-agnostic offerings, our risk management and our global customer service capabilities. All of these assets drive the success we witnessed in the quarter and throughout 2015.
While many others are attempting to play in this space, PayPal continues to gain market share quarter after quarter, attracting new customers and increasing the engagement of our existing base. It's becoming increasingly evident that payments is a hard business to crack.
The combination of strong, secular tailwinds and our increasing ability to execute across multiple fronts provides us a long runway for growth. And we are working hard to greatly expand the value of our technology platform for consumers and merchants around the world.
For consumers, we're focused on using our technology platform to facilitate the movement and management of money. That means more than simply enabling commerce. It means we are reimagining what basic consumer financial transactions can be in a world dominated by mobile and software. We want to leverage our globally trusted brand and define digital money. This allows us to extend our platform to reach underserved markets and expand our value proposition to include international remittances, bill payment, person-to-person payments and charitable giving.
We made a significant step forward in the expansion of our platform with the close of our Xoom acquisition. Xoom is the latest example of PayPal adding new capabilities to acquire new customers and increase engagements. It is a mobile technology leader that enables customers in the United States to send money to and pay bills for family and friends in 41 countries around the world. The cross-border P-to-P opportunity is significant and Xoom will accelerate our growth in that market.
Of course, we continue to be a preferred way to enable consumers to shop online. This year, Cyber Monday was our biggest online shopping day in PayPal's history, with our platform processing almost 450 payments per second in our peak hour. However, the power of the PayPal platform is also demonstrated in other ways such as our ability to help consumers drive social impact.
Throughout this year's holiday season, $857 million was raised globally for charities through our platform. This unprecedented level of year-end charitable giving was driven by the generosity of more than 7 million people from 183 countries who supported more than 0.25 million charities. These are amazing stats and they demonstrate the power of our platform in helping to make a real difference in the world.
The growth of Venmo clearly conveys our ability of our platform to connect people to each other by offering simple and engaging ways to move money. This past year, Venmo processed $7.5 billion in payments, up 213%, with $2.5 billion of this volume being processed in the fourth quarter alone.
We made good progress in setting up the technical infrastructure to allow customers to pay online merchants with the Venmo app. This new feature became available to select merchants for pilot implementation in December, and we are now live with 2 merchants, Gametime and Munchery. 
We plan a robust rollout of Pay with Venmo throughout 2016. And we will continue to introduce and expand features that will allow us to monetize our Venmo assets, providing our customers the ability to use Venmo to pay friends, shop and eventually access a host of other basic financial services.
We also made progress expanding the ability of consumers to use PayPal in-store, by making it easier for merchants to accept PayPal's tokenized payments. PayPal signed a strategic agreement with First Data to enable the acceptance of PayPal tokens in-store for First Data's acquiring clients and businesses. This is an important step forward in driving availability of PayPal at the point-of-sale, as First Data is the largest U.S. merchant processor.
We believe the shift towards tokenization is an opportunity that will significantly help our business, enabling PayPal to expand and grow our ubiquity. PayPal was the first company to introduce tokenization and has always tokenized customer data to make payments safer for customers and simpler for merchants to accept. PayPal's tokenization capabilities allow portability of tokens with greater safety and security than most solutions today.
We also handle more payment types than just credit cards. This means merchants don't have to process a different set of parameters for credit cards, PayPal or any other new payment method introduced, it can all be done with one token. And with more than 1 billion tokenized payment instruments and a 17-year head start of tokenization, we intend to leverage our expertise and scale to further enhance our growth across multiple channels.
For our merchant customers, PayPal has evolved beyond being just a button on their website. We are slowly, but surely being recognized as providing a full suite of payment solutions to help their businesses grow. And by doing so, we continue to further differentiate our value proposition from other competitors. This includes a robust set of APIs from our platform that allows a merchant to easily integrate across multiple payment types as well as rewards and offers module into their own app. We are providing our merchant base the options they need to propel their business forward, to connect with their customers in new and powerful ways, that go well beyond substituting the tap of a mobile phone or a card swipe. We are providing the tools and platforms to help power new and engaging value propositions.
One Touch has been a driving force in helping merchants and consumers to interact in a frictionless manner. In just over 6 months, more than 15 million consumers have opted in to use One Touch. And today, PayPal is processing millions of One Touch transactions each month, showing true innovation at scale. More than 50% of the Internet Retailer 500 and more than 1 million merchants in 23 countries have One Touch enabled to make it easier for their customers to check out quickly and securely. And we expect that number to grow significantly throughout the year. We will roll out to an additional 100 countries in the next 6 months. Importantly, we continue to see a significant lift in conversion when One Touch is used and we see increased consumer engagement.
Braintree's v.zero platform, now fully integrated with PayPal's merchant and consumer technology stacks, continues to make substantial strides in the market. As we enter 2016, the backlog of merchants that are waiting to go live to site has never been stronger. To put that into perspective, the implementation pipeline is equal to 100% of the merchants that went live to site in 2015.
We are also seeing strong growth in our PayPal Credit products. PayPal Credit is available at millions of online stores as a funding option through the PayPal wallet, giving consumers enhanced flexibility for how they pay, while often boosting basket sizes for merchants. In addition, we have tripled the originations for our PayPal Working Capital product and help to boost the Net Promoter Score for merchants who use PayPal Working Capital to almost 80%.
In the past few months, we've made great strides to broaden our universe of strategic partners, which now includes some of the world's leading social media networks, mobile carriers, commerce platforms and financial networks like First Data. In Q4, PayPal continued to expand our business relationship with Alibaba, launching a pilot program for select vendors who sell on Wholesaler, the B2B section of Alibaba's website, to accept PayPal.
In December, PayPal announced Braintree is powering the commerce experience for Facebook's Messenger platform with Uber. With this new feature, users can request a ride from the car service without ever needing to leave a conversation or provide new payment information. The service uses Braintree's tokenization to process the payments regardless of whether the consumer has an Uber account. Increasingly, we're enabling merchants and consumers to connect and transact on-demand, virtually anywhere, anytime and within any context.
2015 was a foundational year for PayPal. We completed our separation from eBay. We are now largely complete with the re-platforming of our technology stack, allowing us to innovate and bring new experiences to the market, with major product releases every 2 weeks. We established our vision and mission to redefine the new PayPal. And most importantly, we are aligned as one team and executing against our game plan and our results demonstrate that.
As much as we accomplished in 2015, I believe that 2016 will be the year in which our new value propositions and experiences begin to demonstrate how PayPal can widen its lead in a world rapidly moving towards digital and mobile payments. It will take us time to fully execute against our full potential, but I firmly believe we are strengthening our set of assets, capabilities and value propositions for both consumers and merchants, and we look forward to demonstrating that in the year ahead.
And with that, let me turn it over to John."

Growth in active accounts, payment volume and revenue all a",1577,"Thanks, Dan. I also want to thank all of PayPal's customers and our 17,000 employees worldwide for making 2015 a great year. We had a strong fourth quarter and exited the year with good momentum. Growth in active accounts, payment volume and revenue all accelerated from the previous quarter. We grew faster than the market and gained market share.
Total payment volume for the year was $282 billion, an increase of 27% on a currency-neutral basis, which accelerated 1 point over 2014. Our share gain demonstrates that our strategy is working, as we focused on being the customer champion and moved from being a payment button to an end-to-end payment solution for merchants of all sizes.
In the quarter, we added 6.6 million new active accounts, including the acquisition of Xoom. This was our highest increase ever. Excluding the acquisition of Xoom, we added over 5 million new accounts in the quarter which was a high watermark for the year. At the end of the quarter, 56% of the total active accounts were outside of the U.S, demonstrating our global reach.
By adding capabilities and services like credit and remittances, we are becoming more relevant in our customers' daily lives. As a result, the number of payment transactions per active account increased to 27, up 12% from a year ago.
We expanded our merchant footprint and simplified the checkout experience for our customers through the continued rollout of our One Touch product. We extended our reach in the quarter to 75 of the 100 largest North American Internet retailers and continue to add important retailers internationally like IKEA. We continue to drive the growth of mobile payments. During the year, we processed 1.4 billion mobile transactions and $66 billion of mobile payment volume, which was up 44%.
Turning to our quarterly results. For the fourth quarter, PayPal generated $2.6 billion in revenue, up 21% on a currency-neutral basis. Xoom contributed approximately 1 point of growth or $26 million. Transaction revenue increased 20%, while other value-added services grew 31%. Transaction revenue benefited from rising engagement as reflected by the increase in the number of payment transactions per active customer account. This increase reflects the growing relevancy of Braintree's unbranded products and the evolution from a payment button or tender type to payment partner, where we capture all of the merchant's processing volumes.
Other value-added services benefited from the growing penetration of PayPal Credit, as well as the amended contracts with Synchrony Financial in the previous quarter. The number of payment transactions in the quarter increased 25% year-over-year, driven by Braintree and growth in the media and travel verticals. Total payment volume was $82 billion in the quarter, up 29% on a currency-neutral basis. Of that, U.S. payment volume grew 29% while international growth was 28%.
We continue to demonstrate good control of our expenses. Total expenses were $2 billion, up 15%, less than the 17% growth in revenue. Our volume-based variable expenses, which are transaction expense and transaction and loan losses, were up 25%. However, we gained economies of scale on our other expenses, which grew less than half of revenue growth.
As we continue to execute on our strategy to expand our presence with large merchants, which increases our relevance with consumers, the revenue benefit we received from those large merchants is partially offset by a lower take rate due to volume-based pricing. We also experienced a higher mix of credit card payments by our fast-growing Braintree platform, which increases our transaction expense. Because of this, our overall transaction volume for the quarter declined 250 basis points. While large merchants and Braintree contribute to a lower overall transaction margin, they drive increased utilization of our PayPal-branded products and increase the overall bottom line.
In the quarter, we expanded our operating margin 90 basis points from the same quarter a year ago. This demonstrates our ability to maintain and even grow our margins with the economies of scale that we have in our business as well as this management team's discipline around controlling cost.
As the mix of our business shifts, we will continue to achieve expense leverage. When looking at our full year results, total expenses per transaction declined 8%. However, our nonvolume-related expenses declined 12%. With CapEx coming in at 6% of revenue, free cash flow in the quarter was $564 million, representing $0.22 of free cash for every dollar of revenue. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $5.7 billion, including approximately $1.5 billion in the U.S. 
And now to guidance. Our business is performing great and we are executing on our strategy and delivering on our commitments. Our strong performance in 2015 only reinforces our conviction in the opportunity that we have. Let me give you some context with how we're thinking about the business looking forward. We are investing to expand our footprint and grow relevancy. Areas of investment include product, brand, global reach, Xoom integration and security. We expect this to translate into an acceleration of volume growth in 2016. As I stated earlier, this will result in a decline in our take rate, but not our operating margin. We expect that the lower take rate will be driven by our strategic initiatives as we look to gain market share and integrate Xoom.
In 2016, based on current exchange rates, we would experience less impact from currency than last year, net of hedging gains. We expect it to be a 3-point headwind to revenue growth this year versus the 4-point headwind in 2015. We expect Xoom to contribute approximately $200 million in revenue, but it will be dilutive to operating margin as we integrate it into the platform. We will continue to gain economies of scale and achieve cost efficiencies and customer support, technology and other areas of our business.
At the time of our spin, we provided guidance for 2015 and guidance over the medium term. We met or exceeded our guidance in every aspect for 2015. And our performance last year only increases our conviction in the medium-term guidance of mid-20s growth in payment volume, 15% constant currency revenue growth, stable to growing operating margins and free cash flow that grows in line with revenue.
For the full year 2016, we expect revenue between $10.5 billion to $10.7 billion, representing currency-neutral growth of 16% to 19%, with the currency translation impact on the full year revenue to be approximately 3 points, resulting in spot revenue growth of 14% to 16%.
I'd like to provide a little color on the shape of revenue for the year though. We expect our revenue growth to be very similar in the first half of 2016 versus the second half of 2016. For the first quarter of 2016, we expect revenue growth on a currency-neutral basis to be between 19% and 21%. However, we expect to have some lumpiness in our second quarter revenue growth as a result of the sale of our credit receivables and amended Synchrony agreement last year. Because of these items, we expect a 6-point decline in revenue growth from the first quarter to the second quarter. We expect to return to a more normalized growth rate in the third quarter, however.
We expect our full year 2016 non-GAAP EPS to be between $1.45 and $1.50, representing growth of 14% to 18%. And we expect full year free cash flow to grow faster than revenue growth for the year coming in above $2.1 billion. We expect our CapEx, as a percent of revenue, to decline 1 to 2 points from 2015 to approximately 6% to 7% of revenue, and the non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 18% and 19%.
For the first quarter, we expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.34 and $0.36, representing growth of 18% to 25% year-over-year. As I mentioned on our last earnings call, there are few companies of our size with our balance sheet and growth rate that are generating the free cash flow of PayPal. We have a tremendous opportunity to increase shareholder value with the deployment of that cash flow. Today, we announced a $2 billion share repurchase program. I want to be clear about our cash flow priorities. They are in order: to invest in organic growth; grow through strategic acquisitions and then to return capital to shareholders. With our balance sheet and cash flow generation, we can address all 3 of these to maximize shareholder return. The share buyback program will enable us to offset dilution from stock-based compensation, which we expect to be 1% to 1.5% of our shares outstanding, but we will also be good capital allocators and have the flexibility to be more aggressive with repurchases when we see the opportunity to purchase our stock at a level that is well below its intrinsic value.
In closing, I'm very excited about the opportunity we have at PayPal to grow as the leading payments platform worldwide. Our trusted brand, global breadth and growing installed base of engaged customers are driving the digitization of payments and the transformation to a connected mobile world. We are laser focused on executing on our business plan. We have created a leading technology platform with a sustainable financial model that allows us to keep innovating and growing at scale. Our unparalleled combination of scale, growth and cash generation provides us with a tremendous opportunity to increase shareholder value.
With that, let me turn it back to the operator for questions."

As we continue to demonstrate the ability to achieve operating leverage in our business, we still are going to invest in areas of growth like Xoom and that's a great example. And at the time, we expect -- for 2016, we expect Xoom to be a little bit of a drag on our margin. But we're extremely excited about the capability that it provides and how it dovetails into the overall PayPal platform and expect it to be accretive in the not-too-distant future.

And honestly, as I look at the growth trajectory for the business, whether it'd be more net new actives that we're bringing in, increasing the engagement of those actives, through things like One Touch in which we're seeing a lot more engagement and the growth of that, whether it'd be to new partners, new markets, new adjacencies like international remittances, just honestly secular tailwinds. For the first time ever, on Black Friday, more people shopped online than in-store. You've got a tremendous amount of growth levers. And our value proposition is growing in both its sophistication and what we're able to offer both merchants and consumers. And so I do expect the engagement per customer to continue to grow nicely. Second thing on the margin. We said this on our roadshow, I'll repeat it here. The margins in our business want to move up. That is kind of the tendency of the margin structure in our business. We just bought on $200 million of approximately -- of revenue from Xoom coming into this year that basically is dilutive to that. If you normalize for some of the one-time events that came in, you see margin continuing to grow this year like it did last year. And so you've got some one-time moving things coming through the income statement this year, but we are very confident in the medium-term guidance of flat to growing margins. And we have and are experiencing those economies of scale in the 50% of our cost base that's fixed, that we can affect on that. So we feel good about that medium-term guidance and you should understand kind of the one-time nature of some high revenue things -- margin revenue that's leaving us that were onetime last year and Xoom. And we expect Xoom margins to grow over time and to be in line with our margin structure as well."

We have a large chunk of our base right now that's quite engaged and therefore, our churn is going down. That's one thing. Number two, the PayPal brand is beginning to resonate even more so across the world. And we're seeing a higher number of people coming into the top of the funnel. And because we've really made substantial strides on the technology infrastructure, we are able to do a tremendous amount of A, B testing right now to increase the top of the funnel going all the way through to making their first transaction. Truthfully, I think we're at the beginning stages of all of that. And I still think it's wise to model-in around 4 million or so, but if you had to ask me where my bias is, my bias is that will probably be slightly higher than that given the trends that we're seeing.

If they choose to use whatever form of payment they want, that's fine with us. And so consequently, I think our relationships are improving with everybody across the financial services ecosystem.

And we were a pioneer in tokenization in the payments industry, so we have a tremendous amount of tokenized payments instruments. We have over 1 billion tokenized payments credentials on our platform. And we use that to make payments safer for customers, make it easier and simpler for merchants to accept. And the rest of the payments industry right now is beginning to adopt tokenization, but it opens up a bunch of new opportunities for us. And we believe that we can leverage the expertise we have, the embedded credentials we have, some of the advantages we have to enhance our growth. And we will, as we move into this, we'll begin to provide a lot more details around that for you to basically be able to see that. So that's all I'm going to talk about right now on the tokenization front, but you'll see a lot more details to come forward. But suffice to to say, we think it's a growth opportunity for us."

I'm wondering what kind of assumptions you're making in your guidance for your take rate to decline, given the fact that you're -- you said you're going to be aggressively rolling out this Pay with Venmo? So I don't expect it to be a big may be driver of revenue, but it should offset some of the take rate degradation. And then the other part of the question I have is, you noted in your slide deck European regulation doesn't -- I think it's going to be negligible as an impact to you guys for your transaction expense line. And I'm wondering why that would be if U.K. is like 13% of your revenues. You've been operating under those levels already or do you just not expect to pass it through to margins."

First of all, Pay with Venmo. So we're just beginning on that and I expect a little financial impact in 2016. But I would expect to start to see financial impact in 2017 and 2018 as we go out. First of all,",439,"Yes, great questions. So thanks for those, Dan. First of all, Pay with Venmo. So we're just beginning on that and I expect a little financial impact in 2016. But I would expect to start to see financial impact in 2017 and 2018 as we go out. First of all, I'd say a couple of things. First, Venmo is not just another buy button. You've seen some of those commentary out there, it is the most beloved way to pay for millennials. It is a highly desirable demographic for merchants and there is large demand for it, outside of NexGen merchants. You already have seen like Papa John use it as a splitting mechanism. And there's tremendous demand for merchants for Pay with Venmo. Through v.zero, which is where we'll initially integrate this, the integration of any payment type is easy. It's really a small effort. And quite frankly, quite soon, we expect 0 coding required for merchants to integrate with the Pay with Venmo button. But as we go into the third quarter, just like we did in fourth quarter, just like we did with One Touch, we started to expand Pay with Venmo into the PayPal merchant base. And there, basically somebody with Venmo will be able to click on a PayPal button and just Pay with Venmo. Not actually have to put another button onto their site. Many merchants want the Venmo button because it is the way millennials think about managing and moving their money. But many merchants may just want to keep the PayPal button and we'll integrate that user base of PayPal -- of Venmo users right into that. And to your -- and one other thing. We started in-app, but obviously like One Touch, we're going to grow it on mobile, web and other web-based pieces of this quite quickly. We've got a very engaged Venmo base, and they have been asking to expand that to move into a shop. You're exactly right. That is going to be a large amount of TPV, a reasonable amount of TPV right now, that is 0 take rate. And that take rate will obviously go up over time. And that will be a counter-pressure to take rate decline over time. It won't completely eclipse it obviously, but it will be a counter to it, absolutely. And we think this is just the beginning of the ways that we can start to monetize what is a rapidly growing segment of the market that really thinks of Venmo as a way they manage and move money. I'll let John talk about the other part of your question."

Like the day that I came here to PayPal was the day that Apple Pay was announced, so those 2 things are etched in my mind. It's been 18 months, right? And in the last 18 months, what's happened? We've added 25 million-plus net new active accounts. We have more engagement than we've ever had in our base. We have accelerating TPV, accelerating revenue. It came up -- and why is that? Honestly, it's because payments is really hard. And it is hard to crack. And the other thing is that there are value propositions out there to focus on a piece of payments, and we have a very comprehensive value proposition. And I will say this, we are not standing still. I have operational reviews every single month with my team. And the last thing that I said to the consumer and the merchant team is, I truly believe that what they've done and where those teams are going will widen the distance in terms of our value prop. And I hope to be able to -- I think you can see some of that with One Touch. I hope you'll see other things as we move forward. We basically -- this has not been an easy journey for PayPal. We've had to fully upgrade our technology platform. But we've done most of that. And because of that, really for the first time, the innovation that's always been here, but just not able to get through our pipeline, is now actually coming into the market and innovating at scale. You've seen the backlog of sales that we have right now, that's because of demand, and demand for the value proposition that we have on the Braintree side. One other thing I'd just say, at this point, the more announcements that come out actually the better off I think it is for us. It is so confusing out there for a customer. You have another announcement coming out. There's a lot of balkanization going on, a lot of confusion. You can only use this pay in this retailer, this pay with this technology, this pay with this device. And we've got a real-trusted brand. We've a base of almost 180 million customers right now. And I think that the more confusing it is out there, the more people turn to brands that they can trust and that work across any OS, any device, any POS technology out there. I actually think at this point, although I respect every one of those competitors greatly and we watch everything carefully, our biggest competition is our ability to execute against our game plan right now. We have a good game plan, we have a really good road map to increase our value proposition for the merchants and consumers, and we just need to stay focused on that and get those things out into the market and our results. Hopefully we'll continue to do the same thing that we've done over the last 18 months."

Modest, you're starting to see some of that already with what we've been able to do on Pinterest, what we've been able to do with Facebook, what we've been able to do with contextual commerce, and stay tuned on that front. We've got a lot more coming out on that piece of it. Xoom just closed. We're obviously moving to integrate that -- put that onto the PayPal platform. And when we're able to do that, instead of it just being U.S. send out, we'll start to integrate other countries, other corridors, cross-sell. So we think there's a tremendous leveraging that we can do on the Xoom side. Paydiant, we've spent a bunch of time now integrating Paydiant into the PayPal and Braintree stacks. And I just had a review again last month. We're largely complete with Phase 1 of that. And what that really allows us to do is take a platform that -- a white label platform. Just think about it, a lot of our off-line movement is to provide a white label platform to allow merchants to write their own apps, right? And because merchants understand their consumers better than we will ever do that. And they know their consumers, they know the value prop that a consumer will respond to, they drive people to that value prop, like Subway is a great example, right? They can customize their sandwich, they can define the pickup time, they can come in, skip the line, get immediate rewards, then decide to pay with those rewards right at the time of the sale or split tender that. All of that is powered through our unbranded platform. So it's not just payment types, but rewards and offers is paid. That's sort of the ultimate way that we're thinking about it. And we are really -- I think we are going where the trends are going. We're not trying to react to, oh, let's NFC over here, or whatever it may be. It doesn't mean that we won't have NFC on, it's part of our wallet. We don't think that that's a winning strategy, just substituting tapping a phone for swiping a card. What we think is a winning strategy is allowing merchants to use the power of mobile to get closer to their customers. And we want to help power the difficult plumbing of that, all the payment processing of any payment type, rewards, offers, et cetera. And we are having substantially different conversations with our merchant base as a result of that platform, much more strategic in nature, much more about where the industry and the nature of commerce is going as opposed to, as John said in his remarks, as opposed to just being a tender type, a part of checkout in which really that's really a commodity or an increasing commodity element versus kind of the digitization of commerce going forward. And so I couldn't be happier actually with that Paydiant acquisition. It is the engine piece of that in-store element. You connect that, which I think was really the leading in-store platform player with us, PayPal traditional, which I think was like a leading player in online and Braintree, which is a leading mobile player. Combine those together, it's a very powerful -- and combine then 100 -- almost 180 million consumers that we can bring to light up that platform by doing credentialization of identification, et cetera, to take friction out of the sign-up process. And it's a pretty strong set of assets that we bring to the off-line market. That's a tremendously large opportunity for us, but we are just starting here. So I don't want to oversell it at all. I love the set of assets we bring to it, but it's a very, very early innings on that."

We're providing a slide presentation to accompany the commentary during the call. All growth rates mentioned in these prepared remarks represent year-over-year comparisons unless they clarify otherwise and all segments' results are adjusted for the effects of foreign currency exchange. 
In the discussion of year-over-year comparisons, including guidance growth rates for the first quarter and full year 2016, we have chosen to present non-GAAP pro forma metrics, which reflect items that are factually supportable, directly attributable to the separation of the company from eBay Inc. on July 17, 2015, and expected to have a continuing impact on the company's results of operations, because we believe that these metrics provide investors a consistent basis for reviewing the company's performance across different periods.
This conference call is also being broadcast on the Internet. And both the presentation and the call are available through the Investor Relations section of the PayPal website at investor.paypal-corp.com. You can visit our Investor Relations website for the latest company news and updates. In addition, an archive of the webcast will be accessible for 90 days through the same link.
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about our company's performance, including the non-GAAP pro forma metrics mentioned above. You can find a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. 
In addition, management will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include, but are not limited to, the future performance of PayPal, including expected financial results for the first quarter and full year 2016. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in this call for a variety of reasons. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our operating results in our Registration Statement on our Form 10 as amended, and our subsequent annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q available at our IR site, investor.paypal-corp.com.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. I'm pleased to report that PayPal had a very strong Q4, topping off a solid year. We delivered every one of our 2015 commitments to shareholders: driving payment volume; revenue growt",2161,"Thanks, Tom. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. I'm pleased to report that PayPal had a very strong Q4, topping off a solid year. We delivered every one of our 2015 commitments to shareholders: driving payment volume; revenue growth; operating margin and free cash flow above or at the high end of our guidance range, despite considerable pressure from foreign currency headwinds. And we exited the year with considerable momentum.
In Q4, we acquired more customers than in any other quarter in PayPal's history and further accelerated our payment volume and revenue growth rates. Payment volume increased 29% and revenue grew 21% on an FX-neutral basis. And our merchant services payment volume accelerated to 36% FX-neutral growth, substantially greater than the rate of e-commerce, leading to another quarter of increased market share gains.
For the full year, we delivered $282 billion in payment volume, up 27% and an FX-neutral revenue growth of 19%. We also continued to strengthen our lead in mobile payments. In 2015, almost 30% of the payments made on our platform were from a mobile device.
We operate a complex global business. PayPal is a full services technology platform, where we acquire both consumers and merchants and perform all payments processing. This includes risk and fraud prevention, customer service and new products, like international remittances across online, in-app and in-store environments.
Despite that complexity, our business model success can be reduced to 4 key metrics: our top line growth; our net active customer base; the engagement of that base and our ability to produce strong free cash flow. In 2015, in the face of a constant stream of competitive announcements, PayPal accelerated the strength of our business across every key metric. We grew our top line, posting full year revenue of $9.24 billion. As I mentioned, this was up 19% on an FX-neutral basis, which was above the high end of the 15% to 18% full year guidance we communicated during our roadshow. And Q4 revenues accelerated to 21% to $2.56 billion.
We expanded our customer base in Q4 with a record-breaking 6.6 million new accounts, including 1.6 million from Xoom. As a result, we ended the year with 179 million active accounts, adding over 17 million net new accounts this year. Our continually expanding customer base strengthens our competitive position and makes our platform deeply relevant to merchants and partners around the world.
In addition to attracting more customers to our platform, we increased the level of customer engagement by significantly enhancing our consumer value proposition. We measure consumer or customer engagement by the number of transactions per account, and I'm pleased with our progress on this front. We ended the year at over 27 transactions per account, driving nearly 5 billion transactions across our platform for the full year. And we continued to generate strong free cash flow.
In 2015, we generated $1.8 billion in cash and over $1 billion of that in the second half of the year alone. This cash flow provides us the flexibility to pursue multiple options and opportunities. Our accelerating performance, combined with our increasing ability to execute and innovate, provide us a high degree of confidence in our future.
As a result, today, we are announcing a $2 billion share buyback program, which John Rainey will discuss in more detail.
There are 2 massive changes underway in the world: the digitization of cash and the mass adoption of mobile phones. This dynamic is creating a seismic shift that's transforming money and the very nature of commerce. PayPal is playing a leading role in this transformation. And we feel our assets are well-suited to drive further differentiation. These trends present us with the opportunity to be at the center of people's daily financial lives and position PayPal to become the go-to platform for digital payments globally.
We are in the lead because no other payments technology platform offers the combination of advantages that PayPal does. We benefit from our unmatched and growing global scale, our rapidly expanding customer base, our trusted brands, our unique 2-sided network, our open platform and technology-agnostic offerings, our risk management and our global customer service capabilities. All of these assets drive the success we witnessed in the quarter and throughout 2015.
While many others are attempting to play in this space, PayPal continues to gain market share quarter after quarter, attracting new customers and increasing the engagement of our existing base. It's becoming increasingly evident that payments is a hard business to crack.
The combination of strong, secular tailwinds and our increasing ability to execute across multiple fronts provides us a long runway for growth. And we are working hard to greatly expand the value of our technology platform for consumers and merchants around the world.
For consumers, we're focused on using our technology platform to facilitate the movement and management of money. That means more than simply enabling commerce. It means we are reimagining what basic consumer financial transactions can be in a world dominated by mobile and software. We want to leverage our globally trusted brand and define digital money. This allows us to extend our platform to reach underserved markets and expand our value proposition to include international remittances, bill payment, person-to-person payments and charitable giving.
We made a significant step forward in the expansion of our platform with the close of our Xoom acquisition. Xoom is the latest example of PayPal adding new capabilities to acquire new customers and increase engagements. It is a mobile technology leader that enables customers in the United States to send money to and pay bills for family and friends in 41 countries around the world. The cross-border P-to-P opportunity is significant and Xoom will accelerate our growth in that market.
Of course, we continue to be a preferred way to enable consumers to shop online. This year, Cyber Monday was our biggest online shopping day in PayPal's history, with our platform processing almost 450 payments per second in our peak hour. However, the power of the PayPal platform is also demonstrated in other ways such as our ability to help consumers drive social impact.
Throughout this year's holiday season, $857 million was raised globally for charities through our platform. This unprecedented level of year-end charitable giving was driven by the generosity of more than 7 million people from 183 countries who supported more than 0.25 million charities. These are amazing stats and they demonstrate the power of our platform in helping to make a real difference in the world.
The growth of Venmo clearly conveys our ability of our platform to connect people to each other by offering simple and engaging ways to move money. This past year, Venmo processed $7.5 billion in payments, up 213%, with $2.5 billion of this volume being processed in the fourth quarter alone.
We made good progress in setting up the technical infrastructure to allow customers to pay online merchants with the Venmo app. This new feature became available to select merchants for pilot implementation in December, and we are now live with 2 merchants, Gametime and Munchery. 
We plan a robust rollout of Pay with Venmo throughout 2016. And we will continue to introduce and expand features that will allow us to monetize our Venmo assets, providing our customers the ability to use Venmo to pay friends, shop and eventually access a host of other basic financial services.
We also made progress expanding the ability of consumers to use PayPal in-store, by making it easier for merchants to accept PayPal's tokenized payments. PayPal signed a strategic agreement with First Data to enable the acceptance of PayPal tokens in-store for First Data's acquiring clients and businesses. This is an important step forward in driving availability of PayPal at the point-of-sale, as First Data is the largest U.S. merchant processor.
We believe the shift towards tokenization is an opportunity that will significantly help our business, enabling PayPal to expand and grow our ubiquity. PayPal was the first company to introduce tokenization and has always tokenized customer data to make payments safer for customers and simpler for merchants to accept. PayPal's tokenization capabilities allow portability of tokens with greater safety and security than most solutions today.
We also handle more payment types than just credit cards. This means merchants don't have to process a different set of parameters for credit cards, PayPal or any other new payment method introduced, it can all be done with one token. And with more than 1 billion tokenized payment instruments and a 17-year head start of tokenization, we intend to leverage our expertise and scale to further enhance our growth across multiple channels.
For our merchant customers, PayPal has evolved beyond being just a button on their website. We are slowly, but surely being recognized as providing a full suite of payment solutions to help their businesses grow. And by doing so, we continue to further differentiate our value proposition from other competitors. This includes a robust set of APIs from our platform that allows a merchant to easily integrate across multiple payment types as well as rewards and offers module into their own app. We are providing our merchant base the options they need to propel their business forward, to connect with their customers in new and powerful ways, that go well beyond substituting the tap of a mobile phone or a card swipe. We are providing the tools and platforms to help power new and engaging value propositions.
One Touch has been a driving force in helping merchants and consumers to interact in a frictionless manner. In just over 6 months, more than 15 million consumers have opted in to use One Touch. And today, PayPal is processing millions of One Touch transactions each month, showing true innovation at scale. More than 50% of the Internet Retailer 500 and more than 1 million merchants in 23 countries have One Touch enabled to make it easier for their customers to check out quickly and securely. And we expect that number to grow significantly throughout the year. We will roll out to an additional 100 countries in the next 6 months. Importantly, we continue to see a significant lift in conversion when One Touch is used and we see increased consumer engagement.
Braintree's v.zero platform, now fully integrated with PayPal's merchant and consumer technology stacks, continues to make substantial strides in the market. As we enter 2016, the backlog of merchants that are waiting to go live to site has never been stronger. To put that into perspective, the implementation pipeline is equal to 100% of the merchants that went live to site in 2015.
We are also seeing strong growth in our PayPal Credit products. PayPal Credit is available at millions of online stores as a funding option through the PayPal wallet, giving consumers enhanced flexibility for how they pay, while often boosting basket sizes for merchants. In addition, we have tripled the originations for our PayPal Working Capital product and help to boost the Net Promoter Score for merchants who use PayPal Working Capital to almost 80%.
In the past few months, we've made great strides to broaden our universe of strategic partners, which now includes some of the world's leading social media networks, mobile carriers, commerce platforms and financial networks like First Data. In Q4, PayPal continued to expand our business relationship with Alibaba, launching a pilot program for select vendors who sell on Wholesaler, the B2B section of Alibaba's website, to accept PayPal.
In December, PayPal announced Braintree is powering the commerce experience for Facebook's Messenger platform with Uber. With this new feature, users can request a ride from the car service without ever needing to leave a conversation or provide new payment information. The service uses Braintree's tokenization to process the payments regardless of whether the consumer has an Uber account. Increasingly, we're enabling merchants and consumers to connect and transact on-demand, virtually anywhere, anytime and within any context.
2015 was a foundational year for PayPal. We completed our separation from eBay. We are now largely complete with the re-platforming of our technology stack, allowing us to innovate and bring new experiences to the market, with major product releases every 2 weeks. We established our vision and mission to redefine the new PayPal. And most importantly, we are aligned as one team and executing against our game plan and our results demonstrate that.
As much as we accomplished in 2015, I believe that 2016 will be the year in which our new value propositions and experiences begin to demonstrate how PayPal can widen its lead in a world rapidly moving towards digital and mobile payments. It will take us time to fully execute against our full potential, but I firmly believe we are strengthening our set of assets, capabilities and value propositions for both consumers and merchants, and we look forward to demonstrating that in the year ahead.
And with that, let me turn it over to John."

Growth in active accounts, payment volume and revenue all a",1577,"Thanks, Dan. I also want to thank all of PayPal's customers and our 17,000 employees worldwide for making 2015 a great year. We had a strong fourth quarter and exited the year with good momentum. Growth in active accounts, payment volume and revenue all accelerated from the previous quarter. We grew faster than the market and gained market share.
Total payment volume for the year was $282 billion, an increase of 27% on a currency-neutral basis, which accelerated 1 point over 2014. Our share gain demonstrates that our strategy is working, as we focused on being the customer champion and moved from being a payment button to an end-to-end payment solution for merchants of all sizes.
In the quarter, we added 6.6 million new active accounts, including the acquisition of Xoom. This was our highest increase ever. Excluding the acquisition of Xoom, we added over 5 million new accounts in the quarter which was a high watermark for the year. At the end of the quarter, 56% of the total active accounts were outside of the U.S, demonstrating our global reach.
By adding capabilities and services like credit and remittances, we are becoming more relevant in our customers' daily lives. As a result, the number of payment transactions per active account increased to 27, up 12% from a year ago.
We expanded our merchant footprint and simplified the checkout experience for our customers through the continued rollout of our One Touch product. We extended our reach in the quarter to 75 of the 100 largest North American Internet retailers and continue to add important retailers internationally like IKEA. We continue to drive the growth of mobile payments. During the year, we processed 1.4 billion mobile transactions and $66 billion of mobile payment volume, which was up 44%.
Turning to our quarterly results. For the fourth quarter, PayPal generated $2.6 billion in revenue, up 21% on a currency-neutral basis. Xoom contributed approximately 1 point of growth or $26 million. Transaction revenue increased 20%, while other value-added services grew 31%. Transaction revenue benefited from rising engagement as reflected by the increase in the number of payment transactions per active customer account. This increase reflects the growing relevancy of Braintree's unbranded products and the evolution from a payment button or tender type to payment partner, where we capture all of the merchant's processing volumes.
Other value-added services benefited from the growing penetration of PayPal Credit, as well as the amended contracts with Synchrony Financial in the previous quarter. The number of payment transactions in the quarter increased 25% year-over-year, driven by Braintree and growth in the media and travel verticals. Total payment volume was $82 billion in the quarter, up 29% on a currency-neutral basis. Of that, U.S. payment volume grew 29% while international growth was 28%.
We continue to demonstrate good control of our expenses. Total expenses were $2 billion, up 15%, less than the 17% growth in revenue. Our volume-based variable expenses, which are transaction expense and transaction and loan losses, were up 25%. However, we gained economies of scale on our other expenses, which grew less than half of revenue growth.
As we continue to execute on our strategy to expand our presence with large merchants, which increases our relevance with consumers, the revenue benefit we received from those large merchants is partially offset by a lower take rate due to volume-based pricing. We also experienced a higher mix of credit card payments by our fast-growing Braintree platform, which increases our transaction expense. Because of this, our overall transaction volume for the quarter declined 250 basis points. While large merchants and Braintree contribute to a lower overall transaction margin, they drive increased utilization of our PayPal-branded products and increase the overall bottom line.
In the quarter, we expanded our operating margin 90 basis points from the same quarter a year ago. This demonstrates our ability to maintain and even grow our margins with the economies of scale that we have in our business as well as this management team's discipline around controlling cost.
As the mix of our business shifts, we will continue to achieve expense leverage. When looking at our full year results, total expenses per transaction declined 8%. However, our nonvolume-related expenses declined 12%. With CapEx coming in at 6% of revenue, free cash flow in the quarter was $564 million, representing $0.22 of free cash for every dollar of revenue. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $5.7 billion, including approximately $1.5 billion in the U.S. 
And now to guidance. Our business is performing great and we are executing on our strategy and delivering on our commitments. Our strong performance in 2015 only reinforces our conviction in the opportunity that we have. Let me give you some context with how we're thinking about the business looking forward. We are investing to expand our footprint and grow relevancy. Areas of investment include product, brand, global reach, Xoom integration and security. We expect this to translate into an acceleration of volume growth in 2016. As I stated earlier, this will result in a decline in our take rate, but not our operating margin. We expect that the lower take rate will be driven by our strategic initiatives as we look to gain market share and integrate Xoom.
In 2016, based on current exchange rates, we would experience less impact from currency than last year, net of hedging gains. We expect it to be a 3-point headwind to revenue growth this year versus the 4-point headwind in 2015. We expect Xoom to contribute approximately $200 million in revenue, but it will be dilutive to operating margin as we integrate it into the platform. We will continue to gain economies of scale and achieve cost efficiencies and customer support, technology and other areas of our business.
At the time of our spin, we provided guidance for 2015 and guidance over the medium term. We met or exceeded our guidance in every aspect for 2015. And our performance last year only increases our conviction in the medium-term guidance of mid-20s growth in payment volume, 15% constant currency revenue growth, stable to growing operating margins and free cash flow that grows in line with revenue.
For the full year 2016, we expect revenue between $10.5 billion to $10.7 billion, representing currency-neutral growth of 16% to 19%, with the currency translation impact on the full year revenue to be approximately 3 points, resulting in spot revenue growth of 14% to 16%.
I'd like to provide a little color on the shape of revenue for the year though. We expect our revenue growth to be very similar in the first half of 2016 versus the second half of 2016. For the first quarter of 2016, we expect revenue growth on a currency-neutral basis to be between 19% and 21%. However, we expect to have some lumpiness in our second quarter revenue growth as a result of the sale of our credit receivables and amended Synchrony agreement last year. Because of these items, we expect a 6-point decline in revenue growth from the first quarter to the second quarter. We expect to return to a more normalized growth rate in the third quarter, however.
We expect our full year 2016 non-GAAP EPS to be between $1.45 and $1.50, representing growth of 14% to 18%. And we expect full year free cash flow to grow faster than revenue growth for the year coming in above $2.1 billion. We expect our CapEx, as a percent of revenue, to decline 1 to 2 points from 2015 to approximately 6% to 7% of revenue, and the non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 18% and 19%.
For the first quarter, we expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.34 and $0.36, representing growth of 18% to 25% year-over-year. As I mentioned on our last earnings call, there are few companies of our size with our balance sheet and growth rate that are generating the free cash flow of PayPal. We have a tremendous opportunity to increase shareholder value with the deployment of that cash flow. Today, we announced a $2 billion share repurchase program. I want to be clear about our cash flow priorities. They are in order: to invest in organic growth; grow through strategic acquisitions and then to return capital to shareholders. With our balance sheet and cash flow generation, we can address all 3 of these to maximize shareholder return. The share buyback program will enable us to offset dilution from stock-based compensation, which we expect to be 1% to 1.5% of our shares outstanding, but we will also be good capital allocators and have the flexibility to be more aggressive with repurchases when we see the opportunity to purchase our stock at a level that is well below its intrinsic value.
In closing, I'm very excited about the opportunity we have at PayPal to grow as the leading payments platform worldwide. Our trusted brand, global breadth and growing installed base of engaged customers are driving the digitization of payments and the transformation to a connected mobile world. We are laser focused on executing on our business plan. We have created a leading technology platform with a sustainable financial model that allows us to keep innovating and growing at scale. Our unparalleled combination of scale, growth and cash generation provides us with a tremendous opportunity to increase shareholder value.
With that, let me turn it back to the operator for questions."

If you look at the last 3 years, we've demonstrated very consistent operating margin performance and we're very excited that we expanded that 90 basis points in the fourth quarter this year. From one quarter to the next, it's fair to assume some lumpiness in the margin trajectory. And to your point, I think Xoom is a great example of that. As we continue to demonstrate the ability to achieve operating leverage in our business, we still are going to invest in areas of growth like Xoom and that's a great example. And at the time, we expect -- for 2016, we expect Xoom to be a little bit of a drag on our margin. But we're extremely excited about the capability that it provides and how it dovetails into the overall PayPal platform and expect it to be accretive in the not-too-distant future. And of course, as with any management team, our hope is that we can continue to execute on all of the initiatives that we have and deliver the kind of performance, where we can continue to expand those margins."

First of all, I do expect that our transactions per active account will continue to grow. That is a part of our value proposition. And honestly, as I look at the growth trajectory for the business, whether it'd be more net new actives that we're bringing in, increasing the engagement of those actives, through things like One Touch in which we're seeing a lot more engagement and the growth of that, whether it'd be to new partners, new markets, new adjacencies like international remittances, just honestly secular tailwinds. For the first time ever, on Black Friday, more people shopped online than in-store. You've got a tremendous amount of growth levers. And our value proposition is growing in both its sophistication and what we're able to offer both merchants and consumers. And so I do expect the engagement per customer to continue to grow nicely. Second thing on the margin. We said this on our roadshow, I'll repeat it here. The margins in our business want to move up. That is kind of the tendency of the margin structure in our business. We just bought on $200 million of approximately -- of revenue from Xoom coming into this year that basically is dilutive to that. If you normalize for some of the one-time events that came in, you see margin continuing to grow this year like it did last year. And so you've got some one-time moving things coming through the income statement this year, but we are very confident in the medium-term guidance of flat to growing margins. And we have and are experiencing those economies of scale in the 50% of our cost base that's fixed, that we can effect on that. So we feel good about that medium-term guidance and you should understand kind of the one-time nature of some high revenue things -- margin revenue that's leaving us that were onetime last year and Xoom. And we expect Xoom margins to grow over time and to be in line with our margin structure as well."

And I would put that to basically 2 or 3 things that are happening. First of all, our value proposition is definitely getting stronger. Things like One Touch are increasing engagement. We have a large chunk of our base right now that's quite engaged and therefore, our churn is going down. That's one thing. Number two, the PayPal brand is beginning to resonate even more so across the world. And we're seeing a higher number of people coming into the top of the funnel. And because we've really made substantial strides on the technology infrastructure, we are able to do a tremendous amount of A, B testing right now to increase the top of the funnel going all the way through to making their first transaction. Truthfully, I think we're at the beginning stages of all of that. And I still think it's wise to model-in around 4 million or so, but if you had to ask me where my bias is, my bias is that will probably be slightly higher than that given the trends that we're seeing. So it's not seasonality. It is the trends that we're seeing through kind of the strength of the business."

It is a highly desirable demographic for merchants and there is large demand for it, outside of NexGen merchants. You already have seen like Papa John use it as a splitting mechanism. And there's tremendous demand for merchants for Pay with Venmo. Through v.zero, which is where we'll initially integrate this, the integration of any payment type is easy. It's really a small effort. And quite frankly, quite soon, we expect 0 coding required for merchants to integrate with the Pay with Venmo button. But as we go into the third quarter, just like we did in fourth quarter, just like we did with One Touch, we started to expand Pay with Venmo into the PayPal merchant base. And there, basically somebody with Venmo will be able to click on a PayPal button and just Pay with Venmo. Not actually have to put another button onto their site. Many merchants want the Venmo button because it is the way millennials think about managing and moving their money. But many merchants may just want to keep the PayPal button and we'll integrate that user base of PayPal -- of Venmo users right into that. And to your -- and one other thing. We started in-app, but obviously like One Touch, we're going to grow it on mobile, web and other web-based pieces of this quite quickly. We've got a very engaged Venmo base, and they have been asking to expand that to move into a shop. You're exactly right. That is going to be a large amount of TPV, a reasonable amount of TPV right now, that is 0 take rate. And that take rate will obviously go up over time. And that will be a counter-pressure to take rate decline over time. It won't completely eclipse it obviously, but it will be a counter to it, absolutely. And we think this is just the beginning of the ways that we can start to monetize what is a rapidly growing segment of the market that really thinks of Venmo as a way they manage and move money. I'll let John talk about the other part of your question."

Like the day that I came here to PayPal was the day that Apple Pay was announced, so those 2 things are etched in my mind. It's been 18 months, right? And in the last 18 months, what's happened? We've added 25 million-plus net new active accounts. We have more engagement than we've ever had in our base. We have accelerating TPV, accelerating revenue. It came up -- and why is that? Honestly, it's because payments is really hard. And it is hard to crack. And the other thing is that there are value propositions out there to focus on a piece of payments, and we have a very comprehensive value proposition. And I will say this, we are not standing still. I have operational reviews every single month with my team. And the last thing that I said to the consumer and the merchant team is, I truly believe that what they've done and where those teams are going will widen the distance in terms of our value prop. And I hope to be able to -- I think you can see some of that with One Touch. I hope you'll see other things as we move forward. We basically -- this has not been an easy journey for PayPal. We've had to fully upgrade our technology platform. But we've done most of that. And because of that, really for the first time, the innovation that's always been here, but just not able to get through our pipeline, is now actually coming into the market and innovating at scale. You've seen the backlog of sales that we have right now, that's because of demand, and demand for the value proposition that we have on the Braintree side. One other thing I'd just say, at this point, the more announcements that come out actually the better off I think it is for us. It is so confusing out there for a customer. You have another announcement coming out. There's a lot of balkanization going on, a lot of confusion. You can only use this pay in this retailer, this pay with this technology, this pay with this device. And we've got a real-trusted brand. We've a base of almost 180 million customers right now. And I think that the more confusing it is out there, the more people turn to brands that they can trust and that work across any OS, any device, any POS technology out there. I actually think at this point, although I respect every one of those competitors greatly and we watch everything carefully, our biggest competition is our ability to execute against our game plan right now. We have a good game plan, we have a really good road map to increase our value proposition for the merchants and consumers, and we just need to stay focused on that and get those things out into the market and our results. Hopefully we'll continue to do the same thing that we've done over the last 18 months."

Modest, you're starting to see some of that already with what we've been able to do on Pinterest, what we've been able to do with Facebook, what we've been able to do with contextual commerce, and stay tuned on that front. We've got a lot more coming out on that piece of it. Xoom just closed. We're obviously moving to integrate that -- put that onto the PayPal platform. And when we're able to do that, instead of it just being U.S. send out, we'll start to integrate other countries, other corridors, cross-sell. So we think there's a tremendous leveraging that we can do on the Xoom side. Paydiant, we've spent a bunch of time now integrating Paydiant into the PayPal and Braintree stacks. And I just had a review again last month. We're largely complete with Phase 1 of that. And what that really allows us to do is take a platform that -- a white label platform. Just think about it, a lot of our off-line movement is to provide a white label platform to allow merchants to write their own apps, right? And because merchants understand their consumers better than we will ever do that. And they know their consumers, they know the value prop that a consumer will respond to, they drive people to that value prop, like Subway is a great example, right? They can customize their sandwich, they can define the pickup time, they can come in, skip the line, get immediate rewards, then decide to pay with those rewards right at the time of the sale or split tender that. All of that is powered through our unbranded platform. So it's not just payment types, but rewards and offers is paid. That's sort of the ultimate way that we're thinking about it. And we are really -- I think we are going where the trends are going. We're not trying to react to, oh, let's NFC over here, or whatever it may be. It doesn't mean that we won't have NFC on, it's part of our wallet. We don't think that that's a winning strategy, just substituting tapping a phone for swiping a card. What we think is a winning strategy is allowing merchants to use the power of mobile to get closer to their customers. And we want to help power the difficult plumbing of that, all the payment processing of any payment type, rewards, offers, et cetera. And we are having substantially different conversations with our merchant base as a result of that platform, much more strategic in nature, much more about where the industry and the nature of commerce is going as opposed to, as John said in his remarks, as opposed to just being a tender type, a part of checkout in which really that's really a commodity or an increasing commodity element versus kind of the digitization of commerce going forward. And so I couldn't be happier actually with that Paydiant acquisition. It is the engine piece of that in-store element. You connect that, which I think was really the leading in-store platform player with us, PayPal traditional, which I think was like a leading player in online and Braintree, which is a leading mobile player. Combine those together, it's a very powerful -- and combine then 100 -- almost 180 million consumers that we can bring to light up that platform by doing credentialization of identification, et cetera, to take friction out of the sign-up process. And it's a pretty strong set of assets that we bring to the off-line market. That's a tremendously large opportunity for us, but we are just starting here. So I don't want to oversell it at all. I love the set of assets we bring to it, but it's a very, very early innings on that."

And I want to thank all of you on the call for joining us. We know how busy your schedules are, so we appreciate your time.
I'm very pleased to report that PayPal delivered strong financial results for the first quarter of 2016. In many ways, this was our best quarter in the time since I joined PayPal and it's gratifying to see the company execute against its goals. The mission of PayPal is clear. We want to become an everyday essential financial service for consumers and provide a full-service solution and a platform that enables digital commerce for merchants around the globe. And we continue to make tangible and consistent progress towards that vision.
We are showing strong growth across all of our operational metrics. We ended the quarter with 184 million active accounts, up from 179 million last quarter. Our enhanced value proposition is attracting new users at an accelerating rate and in turn, attracting new partners and new merchants. The larger our scale, the more important and relevant we become in the ecosystem, as our network effect becomes ever stronger.
Our increased scale, combined with continued growing engagement, resulted in some of the strongest payment volume and revenue growth rates in our recent history and clearly demonstrate our leadership in digital and mobile payments around the world. Our total payment volume growth, or TPD, accelerated to 31% on an FX-neutral basis, and our merchant services volume grew a record 39%, leading to revenue growth of 23% on an FX-neutral basis. We ended the quarter with over 14 million merchant accounts. I'll just pause on that number for a moment. Our 2-sided network with 14 million merchants on one side and over 170 million buyers on the other is one of our key competitive advantages and extremely difficult to replicate. We are proud to have added this quarter popular and influential brands like Crate and Barrel, Sephora, Air France, Fresh Direct, Panera Bread and Woolworths, which is the largest grocery chain in Australia serving more than 28 million customers each week. These brands joined the growing list of companies that are choosing PayPal.
As I mentioned, merchant services payment volume grew 39% on an FX-neutral basis, significantly higher than the rate of e-commerce growth. Our increasing ability to innovate and lead transformative change for merchants and consumers is not only accelerating our competitive differentiation but enabling us to, once again, increase our share in a dynamic and competitive environment.
Each quarter, we measure the success of our business against 4 key metrics: our top line growth; our net active customer base; our customer engagement; and our ability to generate strong free cash flow. I'm pleased to report we delivered strong performance against each of these metrics. Let me start with revenue.
We grew our top line to $2.54 billion, up 23% on an FX-neutral basis or 19% on a spot basis. This was our strongest quarter for revenue growth in the last 5 quarters. As I mentioned, we ended the quarter with 184 million active accounts, demonstrating another strong quarter of customer acquisition. All of you know by now that our long-term aspiration is to position PayPal as an everyday part of our customers' financial lives. And increasing the level of customer engagement is one of our primary measures of success to that goal. And despite an ever increasing account base, I'm pleased to say we grew the annual transactions per active account from 25 in Q1 a year ago to 28 this quarter, which resulted in PayPal processing 1.4 billion transactions for our customers during the quarter, up 26% year-over-year.
Customer engagements was driven by significant enhancements to our value proposition and by the debut of PayPal's first Super Bowl ad, which drove significant increases in the perception of PayPal in the weeks that follow the commercial's first airing. And last but certainly not least, we generated strong free cash flow of $605 million in Q1, up over 70% year-over-year.
I'm obviously pleased with the quarter's results but we still have much to execute throughout these rest of the year. We need to continually innovate if we are to widen the distance between our value proposition and that of our competition. And in keeping with that focus, Q1 saw the introduction of several strong new product experiences across our global customer base. We launched a new fundamentally redesigned PayPal mobile app in 145 markets simultaneously, in 17 languages across both iOS and Android operating systems. The app is built on an iterative platform so that we can now easily customize and localize new features across all the markets where it's live. The new experiences driving increased consumer engagement, increased send and request money transactions and will enable our consumers to use their mobile phone online, in-app or in-store with both NFC and QR capabilities.
Venmo continues to grow from strength to strength, processing nearly $3.2 billion in payment volume in Q1, up over 150% from last year. And its subscriber base continues to grow at an ever accelerating rate. We made good progress with our Payment Venmo pilot. Early customer results and feedback have provided strong validation around the demand for Venmo as a way to pay in-app. This feedback has helped us to fine-tune our processes, procedures and value proposition, and we have now widened our pilot to do include approximately 550,000 Venmo users. We are on track to expand to more merchants and open this service to our full Venmo customer base in the second half of this year.
We introduced PayPal Commerce, a set of tools and APIs which are currently in beta that make it easier for merchants to securely sell across multiple contexts: e-mail, social shares, blogs, articles, ads, in-app and anywhere consumers are online or on their mobile devices. This new offering is the result of the rapid integration of the technology and the team we gain through the acquisition of Modest in August 2015. It is a critical element of the full-service suite of capabilities we are building into our merchant platform as we help retailers move fully into digital commerce.
Our increased pace and global scale of innovation is fueled by the investments we have made in our core infrastructure and platform. They are designed to drive agility and innovation across our entire software stack. We run one of the largest private cloud environments in the world. We follow industry best practices of agile software development, continuous integration and deliberate using open source technologies. These investments have enabled our developers to push codes several times a day, allowing them to iterate new features faster and get instant customer feedback. To drive that point home, the number of production deployments has increased by 200% compared to last year.
Our increased ability to innovate on a global scale and deliver on our commitments, is a primary reason why PayPal is becoming the partner of choice for companies around the world, including some of the leading tech companies and the largest wireless carriers in Mexico, Latin America and Europe. Telcel and Claro [ph] are implementing our platform to help their 140 million consumers manage their money to make everyday purchases to use their mobile devices. These digital wallet offerings are now in trial and we expect a full rollout in the second half of the year, starting in Mexico and Brazil. The app will be available for downloads for both Android and iOS and consumers will be able to easily create and manage a new PayPal account using only their smartphones, and will be able to pay for basic services including topping up their prepaid phones and buying related data plans. Eventually, they'll be able to conveniently pay for services from other merchants, as well as being bills and sending money. Our partnership with Vodafone in Europe will have tens of billions of European customers who use PayPal as a preferred way to fund their payments. And for the first time, consumers with Android smartphones at Visa contactless terminals will be able to tap to pay in-store. We are now live in our first market in Spain, and we anticipate expanding across Europe throughout the back half of 2016. Our partnership with Vodafone delivers what consumers, businesses and European regulators want: better products, more choice and greater transparency.
In the quarter, we also extended our relationships with both Alibaba and Facebook. Our pilot with Alibaba Wholesaler has been extended and we will now do a full rollout to include new countries and merchants. And our partnership with Facebook continues to expand nicely, both in the Messenger and Facebook Shop applications, and as a key partner across a wide range of their core payments experiences.
Q1 also saw us deepen and expand our relationships with commerce platforms  -- excelling online and on mobile simpler for businesses around the world. We signed an agreement with WooCommerce to make PayPal their preferred payment extension for their platform. We also extended our relationship with Shopify, one the largest commerce platform, which powers 243,000 businesses in approximately 150 countries to provide all new Shopify merchants with PayPal as their default payment experience.
One Touch expanded to merchants in an additional 121 markets across Asia, Europe and Central America, making it available to merchants in 144 markets, and is now available to consumers in all 203 markets in which we operate. One Touch is the most rapidly adopted product PayPal has ever launched. It now has some 21 million consumers who have proactively opted in, and we anticipate well over 2 million merchants will have One Touch enabled by year-end. We continue to see meaningful engagement and conversion lift with the use of One Touch, enabling both consumers and merchants to having a more seamless and friction-free checkout experience.
In fact, a recent ComScore study rated PayPal's conversion rate for merchants at 87%, with the next highest service at 51%. Clearly, for merchants and consumers, PayPal is a far superior choice.
I'm also very pleased with the performance of our Xoom acquisition and our integration efforts. Global expansion meaningfully accelerated in the first months following the close of the acquisition. So far this year, Xoom has expanded its service to 11 new countries with 2 more countries coming very shortly. These include Haiti, Nigeria and Slovakia and we also announced an integration with M-Pesa in Kenya. Xoom continues to be a market leader in mobile, with some 70% of transactions in the quarter happening on a mobile device. And Q1 was a record activation quarter, with net new actives up over 70% year-over-year as we begin to see some of the synergies we expected come to fruition.
Being a leading global payments provider requires exceptional effort and continued investment in our risk and compliance functions across all of our markets and all of our product areas. There are many reasons to do this. We live in a time where global terrorism and cyber crime are on the rise, and as a result, increasing our focus on compliance is obviously the right thing to do. But we are also investing in these areas because we know that a strong risk and compliance infrastructure is a deep competitive advantage. And the more advanced our capabilities in these areas, the greater the trust our customers will have in PayPal and in our ever-expanding value proposition.
A great example of this is the relationship we have built with our regulators as it relates to our PayPal Credit offerings. We have seen our Net Promoter Score for PayPal Credit jump to over 70% in March, a clear demonstration that what regulators want and what we want are truly aligned around delighting and protecting our customers.
I'll end my remarks with the following work reflections. Although Q1 was clearly a strong start into 2016, we still have a lot of work ahead of us in order to deliver on our product road map and expand our leadership position. We have an expansive and an important mission and I can assure you, our team is focused on executing, partnering within our ecosystem in driving new, innovative and meaningful value to our merchants and consumers.
And with that, let me hand it over to John."

Transactions, payment volume and revenue growth all accelerated from the previous quarter. Total payment volume was $81 billion, an increase of 31% on a currency neutral basis. Of that, U.S. payment volume grew 30%, while international growth was 32%. We grew faster than e-commerce market and continued to gain market share. Our share gain demonstrates that our strategy is working as we focus on being the customer champion and moved from being a payment button to an end-to-end payment solution for merchants of all sizes.
We added 4.5 million new active accounts, ending the quarter with 184 million. We continue to extend our global reach with 56% of the total active accounts outside of the U.S..
The number of payment transactions in the quarter increased 26% year-over-year, driven predominantly by the increasing relevance and ubiquity of our platform as we continue to have strong growth in our core business and Braintree. In addition, PayPal is driving the growth of mobile payments and an increasing amount of our business is conducted on mobile devices.
During the quarter, we processed $21 billion of mobile payment volume, which was up 54%. With capabilities and services like peer-to-peer, credit and remittances, as well as strong mobile growth, we are becoming more relevant in our customers daily lives. As a result, the number of payment transactions per active account increased to 28, up 12% from a year ago.
We generated more than $2.5 billion in revenue in the first quarter, up 23% on a currency neutral basis. Of that, transaction revenue increased 21%, which benefited from rising engagement as reflected by the increase in the number of payment transactions per active customer account. This increase also reflects the growing relevancy of Braintree as we move from a payment button to a full services payment partner where we capture all of the merchant's processing volumes.
Revenue from other value-added services grew 38% on a currency neutral basis, driven by the growth of PayPal Credit as well as the amended contracts with Synchrony Financial last year. We continue to demonstrate good control of our expenses. Total expenses were $2 billion, up 20%. Our volume-based expenses, which are transaction expense and transaction and loan losses, were up 32%, in line with payment volume. Other expenses grew at approximately half the rate of revenue growth as we gained economies of scale. Excluding Xoom, which was not in our results in the first quarter last year, our other expenses increased only 6%.
As we stated in the past, our strategy is to expand our presence with large merchants, which increases our relevance with consumers that results in a lower take rate from volume-based pricing. The strategy has driven accelerated volume and revenue growth as well as market share gains.
Our fast-growing Braintree platform also provide solutions for large and next-generation merchants and brings with it a higher mix of card payments. As a result, our overall transaction margin for the quarter declined 380 basis points. While large merchants and Braintree contribute to the lower overall transaction margin, they increased our overall operating income dollars. In the quarter, operating margin declined 70 basis points from the same quarter a year ago. Excluding Xoom, however, our margin increased demonstrating that our core business is performing well and we are doing a good job controlling costs. We are one quarter in after completing the acquisition of Xoom and we are even more excited about what it brings to the platform. But as I previously stated, Xoom will be dilutive to operating margin in 2016.
In the quarter, our capital expenditures were $133 million or approximately 5% of revenue. Free cash flow in the quarter was $605 million, representing $0.24 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue. This was higher than we expected from better operating results as well as the timing of certain working capital items. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $6.4 billion, including approximately $1.4 billion in the U.S. And now to guidance.
Our business is performing great and we are executing on our strategy and delivering on our commitments. Our strong performance in Q1 reinforces our conviction in our strategy and the opportunity before us. We still have 3 quarters to execute against for the year and we are off to a good start. As a result, we are affirming our full year guidance ranges for 2016. However, I'd like to provide you with some context for how we're thinking about the year.
The retail landscape continues to be mixed, and we still face pressure from the movement of currencies relative to the dollar on our international business. We continue to see volume accelerate across our platform, driven in part by strong growth of our newer businesses. The mix shift to these new were businesses where we are investing puts pressure on our transaction margin, which good cost control will help offset. There is still much with the year to play out but our first quarter performance provides us with increased confidence in achieving our goals.
As I stated on the call last quarter, we have some lumpiness in our revenue growth due to several onetime items in 2015. Consistent with our guidance last quarter, we expect and approximately 6-point deceleration in year-over-year revenue growth from the first quarter to the second, primarily due to the sale of a portion of our credit receivables and the impact of the amended synchrony agreement last year, both of which were virtually 100% margin. For the second quarter, we expect revenue growth on a currency neutral basis to be between 16% and 18%. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.34 and $0.36. We plan to return to a more normalized growth rate in the back half of the year.
Our business model of strong top line growth, expense control and low capital intensity gives us the ability to consistently generate strong free cash flow. We have a tremendous opportunity to increase shareholder value with the deployment of that cash flow. We initiated the share buyback program that was announced on our last earnings call and repurchased 17 million shares at an average price of $35 per share.
I'd like to take a moment to talk about our credit product, which complements our digital payments platform. Credit represents approximately 2% of TPV and has been a relatively consistent at that level over the last couple of years. Credit is a flywheel for PayPal which benefits both our consumers as well as our merchants. It drives payment volume growth and increases choice for our customers by providing them with flexible payment options and allowing customers to pay over time. But credit benefits PayPal in many ways beyond just the payment transaction. Credit reduces card abandonment, leading to increased conversion for merchants and an increase in basket size on purchases where the average purchase of a credit customer is 20% to 30% larger.
Additionally, our working capital product continues to gain momentum and helps to deepen our relationship with merchants while helping them grow. We typically see merchant sales increase after receiving their working capital loans. Satisfaction rates are very high and we experience reduced merchant churn.
Beginning this quarter, we designated $800 million of European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to be used to extend credit to our European customers, which would have previously been funded with our own cash. The use of the full amount of these funds will depend upon the growth of our European credit business. This is a highly efficient source of funding to support our credit business and we continue to explore alternatives to pursue an asset-light model.
In closing, we are off to a strong start to the year. As a technology platform leader operating globally at scale, we are driving the digitization of payments in a large, dynamic and growing industry. We're focused on delivering shareholder value with our strong revenue growth and cash generation. We're excited about the opportunity ahead and look forward to sharing more at our Analyst Day next month.
With that, let me turn it back to the operator for questions."

As we've seen for a couple of quarters now, there's definitely pressure there. But I would remind you that's a deliberate part of our strategy as we're trying to increase the ubiquity of PayPal and allow our customers to use PayPal at larger merchants, where we're going to see pressure on take rate. Fortunately for us we have the ability to offset that with the operating leverage in our business. And as a management team, we're focused on our margins, our generation of free cash flow and growing EPS and not getting so focused on just one aspect of the P&L being the transaction margin. So you'll continue to see us demonstrate the ability to offset some of that decline. With respect to this, as we said before, we expected the impact of that 2016 to be relatively de minimis and our first quarter results actually validated that. It was fairly negligible in the quarter. Again we would expect, to your question, a similar impact for the balance of the year."

First of all, as we've said all along, the margins in this business tend to want to go up. In fact, if you excluded Xoom from our results this quarter, our margins would have gone up year-over-year. The take rate is a direct result of the strategy that we're implementing. First thing is we want more ubiquity for PayPal consumers. The more ubiquity there is for them to shop, the more they use us, the more engagements they have, the more satisfied they are of the service and it gives us a flywheel effect. And as John mentioned, every one of the dollars that come in from our merchants are obviously profitable dollars for us but large merchants have lower take rates. That's just the way of the world. More volume, more pricing leverage. The second piece is we are trying to become a full services platform to enable merchants to move into digital commerce. That means we want to do 100% share of their payment processing. We want to be a strategic partner with them. We want to enable their business strategy. And the more we do that, the closer we get to our merchant, the better off that is for us. Churn goes down, more branded business comes towards us. But, of course, as we go -- move more towards that product mix, you also see some margin because that mix of product has a lower margin set as well. But overall -- I mean, for the branded on that, that's a net positive for us. So we're really comfortable with the strategy. It inevitably leads to, at least for now because we are penetrating a lot of that larger merchant base and we'll start to see more normalized stuff come out of that, but for now, that is the right strategy for us and it is paying off in all sorts of benefits for us. In terms of net new account growth, we are seeing that throughout the world right now, as John mentioned, over half of our actives are outside of the U.S. We're seeing good growth across the world. We're obviously seeing very good growth in our core PayPal acquisition as well as in Venmo. So I would basically say we've got good, consistent growth that spans from our newer services to our core business. I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that our value proposition has significantly improved over the course of the last year, 1.5 years or so and consumers are beginning to see that."

Engagement is growing because our value proposition is getting better. One Touch is increasing engagement, our new mobile app is increasing engagement and conversion is also going up because of these value propositions. We obviously are also expanding partnerships right now. All the investment that we've done in the text back over the course of the last 3-plus years is really paying off in our ability to work with the most technically savvy and sophisticated partners and be able to deliver a digital and mobile payment experience that we think is best-in-class. So those new partnerships are helping. And the more consumers we get, the more merchants want to come on board and you saw some of those in my remarks. But we're now over 14 million merchants. So it's a combination of a better value proposition, more partnerships, expanded merchants and then really driving our net new consumers and engagement for per consumer.

So we see a lot of benefit in the overall PayPal ecosystem. So we can do this and will continue to do this in an asset-light manner. Credit is a small part of our overall business. It will likely remain a small part of our overall business in ways of figuring out how to do that in asset-light and capital efficient manners are a goal of ours. Synchrony, the partnership we have with them, is a good example of that. And I think you can expect us to be looking at those kind of things to become increasingly asset light. We don't need to do all of this or even a great portion of this necessarily on our own balance sheet. We can work with partners because the important thing to us is the flywheel effect."

So we're in good and meaningful discussions across the entire ecosystem right now, and I'm hopeful that, that leads to a win-win for a number of parties. Just to take a step back and give a little bit of context. One of the things that we talked about inside PayPal all the time now is how do we become the ultimate customer champion company. And being a customer champion company means providing the very best experience to our customers. And when we think about the very best experience, that means giving our customers full choice and optionality about where they want to pay and how they want to pay. And to us, that just makes a ton of sense. And we've done a lot of work around this as you can imagine and a lot of research and a lot of experimentation. And here is what we see. When we do that, we drive a heck of a lot more net adds than we have in our traditional sign-up process, and engagement and conversion go up meaningfully. So that obviously drives increased revenues and volumes for us. Funding mix may shift slightly but the difference between ACH and debit has narrowed substantially. Over the last couple of years, different regulatory environments have narrowed a lot of the payment options, right? And so we would also expect some trade-off with incremental volumes that we could drive on to networks and pricing that we would receive from potential partners. In addition, we are very willing to share data back with issuers and the networks. That really is a legacy of the past as best I can see. And the sort of new model of customer choice, of data sharing and all of us having a common goal in cash transactions, we want we all want to electronify more and more payments and that's all attractive and additive to the entire ecosystem. So that eliminates a lot of the previous perceived friction that might have been out in the ecosystem. And furthermore, we want a partner. We think that's the right thing to go and do. And so we'll see where all this goes. But as I said, it has the opportunity to be a win for all of us in the ecosystem."

We're improving our capabilities as rapidly as we can to onboard live to site that pipeline of sales that we have for Braintree and in our core business, so that's improved quite a bit. But I will say despite the improvement, we are still seeing a large demand and pipeline of additional sales coming in for our platform. I'd say it's a high-class problem to have and the value proposition of Braintree is -- I think the whole team there is doing a great job at driving that. The core propositions to PayPal are getting better. We're really starting to execute against this idea of being full services platform really being the, almost the underlying operating system for digital commerce. And then that is -- it's resonating with the merchant population. So we still have a very strong pipeline waiting to go live to site and a strong pipeline of merchants that we're talking to in the middle of the sales process with them as well. In terms of One Touch, we've said from the very beginning that we see meaningful lift in not just conversion vis-à-vis our other products but also engagement in terms of how often a consumer uses PayPal. Because really, as you can imagine taking friction out of the checkout experience is just a really positive thing. It's really positive for consumers, it's really positive for merchants. And seeing that ComScore study that basically has our nearest alternative service at 51% and us at 87% can give you an idea of the lift in conversion. The other place that I would point to is you could see kind of where PayPal conversion was before One Touch, and then the ComScore study and where it is now give a sense of some of the lift for that by looking in some of those external studies. But you'll see it's a meaningful lift in conversion overall. That's obviously beginning to help us in our results. And hopefully as we continue to onboard more and more consumers on that, we'll continue to help drive some of our future growth."

It doesn't clutter it up. It's simple, easy. As I mentioned, it's driving increased consumer engagement. And it also enables us for consumers to now be able to use their mobile phone in-store, whether that be through NFC or QR code. And the way I think about in-store is really in-store, online, in-app, they're all coming together. It's just commerce is the way to think about it. It's all moving towards mobile and we basically want to be able to utilize for merchant, kind of this underlying platform so we can be their OS do 100% share of checkout, enable merchants to create their own applications, tie in their rewards into our platform, use things like split tender at checkout and create a real value proposition change for consumers so that merchants can use mobile to get closer to their customers. And we're trying to power that experience there. We want to be OS agnostic, we want to be POS, point of sale, agnostic as well. And then we want to use our PayPal wallet which, as we mentioned now, is growing quite quickly to basically light up that merchant app. Part of the issue with merchant apps is when -- they can create a good value proposition they need somebody help power that, but then they need volume on that application. And with things like our One Touch technology, our new re-platforming, as long as a consumer opts in, we can prudentialize their ideas and make that signing up for that app much more friction-free than previously. And so not only can it provide the underlying infrastructure for that merchant but we can then light up that application with our consumer base. We've had great success with Shell in the U.K. They're doing a trial now in Brazil with Subway, with Burger King, with Dollar General, with Macy's, with Papa Johns. We have thousands of retailers that now are part of our order hand order ahead application on our mobile app where you can just order ahead, pay with PayPal and then pick up in-store. And so this is what I mean. Basically, you have mobile bridging the gap between online, in-app and in-store. And we're really pleased with the initial results. It's obviously early on but a lot of potential for us there. So thank you for that  question. And thank you, everybody, for joining us today. We appreciate your time."

And I want to thank all of you on the call for joining us. We know how busy your schedules are, so we appreciate your time.
I'm very pleased to report that PayPal delivered strong financial results for the first quarter of 2016. In many ways, this was our best quarter in the time since I joined PayPal, and it's gratifying to see the company execute against our goals. The mission of PayPal is clear. We want to become an every day essential financial service for consumers and provide a full-service solution and platform that enables digital commerce for merchants around the globe, and we continue to make tangible and consistent progress towards that vision.
We are showing strong growth across all of our operational metrics. We ended the quarter with 184 million active accounts, up from 179 million last quarter. Our enhanced value proposition is attracting new users at an accelerating rate and in turn, attracting new partners and new merchants. The larger our scale, the more important and relevant we become in the ecosystem as our network effect becomes ever stronger.
Our increased scale combined with continued growing engagement resulted in some of the strongest payment volume and revenue growth rates in our recent history and clearly demonstrate our leadership in digital and mobile payments around the world. Our total payment volume growth, or TPV, accelerated to 31% on an FX-neutral basis, and our merchant services volume grew a record 39%, leading to revenue growth of 23% on an FX-neutral basis. We ended the quarter with over 14 million merchant accounts.
I'd just pause on that number for a moment. Our 2-sided network with 14 million merchants on one side and over 170 million buyers on the other is one of our key competitive advantages and extremely difficult to replicate. We are proud to have added this quarter popular and influential brands like Crate and Barrel; Sephora; Air France; Fresh Direct; Panera Bread; and Woolworths, which is the largest grocery chain in Australia, serving more than 28 million customers each week. These brands joined the growing list of companies that are choosing PayPal.
As I mentioned, merchant services payment volume grew 39% on an FX-neutral basis, significantly higher than the rate of e-commerce growth. Our increasing ability to innovate and lead transformative change for merchants and consumers is not only accelerating our competitive differentiation but enabling us to, once again, increase our share in a dynamic and competitive environment.
Each quarter, we measure the success of our business against 4 key metrics: our top line growth, our net active customer base, our customer engagement and our ability to generate strong free cash flow. I'm pleased to report we delivered strong performance against each of these metrics.
Let me start with revenue. We grew our top line to $2.54 billion, up 23% on an FX-neutral basis or 19% on a spot basis. This was our strongest quarter for revenue growth in the last 5 quarters. As I mentioned, we ended the quarter with 184 million active accounts, demonstrating another strong quarter of customer acquisition. All of you know by now that our long-term aspiration is to position PayPal as an every day part of our customers' financial lives, and increasing the level of customer engagement is one of our primary measures of success in that goal. And despite an ever increasing account base, I'm pleased to say we grew the annual transactions per active account from 25 in Q1 a year ago to 28 this quarter, which resulted in PayPal processing 1.4 billion transactions for our customers during the quarter, up 26% year-over-year.
Customer engagement was driven by significant enhancements to our value proposition and by the debut of PayPal's first Super Bowl ad, which drove significant increases in the perception of PayPal in the weeks that follow the commercial's first airing. And last but certainly not least, we generated strong free cash flow of $605 million in Q1, up over 70% year-over-year.
I'm obviously pleased with the quarter's results, but we still have much to execute throughout the rest of the year. We need to continually innovate if we are to widen the distance between our value proposition and that of our competition. And in keeping with that focus, Q1 saw the introduction of several strong new product experiences across our global customer base.
We launched a new fundamentally redesigned PayPal mobile app in 145 markets simultaneously in 17 languages across both iOS and Android operating systems. The app is built on an iterative platform so that we can now easily customize and localize new features across all the markets where it's live. The new experience is driving increased consumer engagement, increased send and request money transactions and will enable our consumers to use their mobile phone online, in-app or in-store with both NFC and QR capabilities.
Venmo continues to go from strength to strength, processing nearly $3.2 billion in payment volume in Q1, up over 150% from last year, and its subscriber base continues to grow at an ever accelerating rate. We made good progress with our Pay with Venmo pilot. Early customer results and feedback have provided strong validation around the demand for Venmo as a way to pay in-app. This feedback has helped us to fine-tune our processes, procedures and value proposition, and we have now widened our pilot to include approximately 550,000 Venmo users. We are on track to expand to more merchants and open the service to our full Venmo customer base in the second half of this year.
We introduced PayPal Commerce, a set of tools and APIs, which are currently in beta, that make it easier for merchants to securely sell across multiple contexts: e-mail, social shares, blogs, articles, ads, in-app and anywhere consumers are online or on their mobile devices. This new offering is the result of the rapid integration of the technology and the team we gained through the acquisition of Modest in August 2015. It is a critical element of the full-service suite of capabilities we are building into our merchant platform as we help retailers move fully into digital commerce.
Our increased pace and global scale of innovation is fueled by the investments we have made in our core infrastructure and platform. They are designed to drive agility and innovation across our entire software stack. We run one of the largest private cloud environments in the world. We follow industry best practices of agile software development, continuous integration and deliberate using open source technologies. These investments have enabled our developers to push codes several times a day, allowing them to iterate new features faster and get instant customer feedback. To drive that point home, the number of production deployments has increased by 200% compared to last year.
Our increased ability to innovate on a global scale and deliver on our commitments is a primary reason why PayPal is becoming the partner of choice for companies around the world, including some of the leading tech companies and the largest wireless carriers in Mexico, Latin America and Europe. Telcel and Claro are implementing our platform to help their 140 million consumers manage their money and make everyday purchases via their mobile devices. These digital wallet offerings are now in trial, and we expect a full rollout in the second half of the year starting in Mexico and Brazil. The app will be available for download for both Android and iOS, and consumers will be able to easily create and manage a new PayPal account using only their smartphone and will be able to pay for basic telco services, including topping up their prepaid phones and buying related data plans. Eventually, they will be able to conveniently pay for services from other merchants as well as paying bills and sending money.
Our partnership with Vodafone in Europe will have tens of billions of European customers to use PayPal as the preferred way to fund their payments. And for the first time, consumers with Android smartphones and Visa contactless terminals will be able to tap to pay in-store. We are now live in our first market, Spain, and we anticipate expanding across Europe throughout the back half of 2016. Our partnership with Vodafone delivers what consumers, businesses and European regulators want: better products, more choice and greater transparency.
In the quarter, we also extended our relationships with both Alibaba and Facebook. Our pilot with Alibaba Wholesaler has been extended, and we will now do a full rollout to include new countries and merchants. And our partnership with Facebook continues to expand nicely, both in the Messenger and Facebook shop applications and as a key partner across a wide range of their core payments experiences.
Q1 also saw us deepen and expand our relationships with commerce platforms that make selling online and on mobile simpler for businesses around the world. We signed an agreement with WooCommerce to make PayPal their preferred payment extension for their platform. We also extended our relationship with Shopify, one the largest commerce platforms, which powers 243,000 businesses in approximately 150 countries to provide all new Shopify merchants with PayPal as their default payment experience.
One Touch expanded to merchants in an additional 121 markets across Asia, Europe and Central America, making it available to merchants in 144 markets and is now available to consumers in all 203 markets in which we operate. One Touch is the most rapidly adopted product PayPal has ever launched. It now has some 21 million consumers who have proactively opted in, and we anticipate well over 2 million merchants will have One Touch enabled by year-end. We continue to see meaningful engagement and conversion lift with the use of One Touch, enabling both consumers and merchants to have a more seamless and friction-free checkout experience. In fact, a recent comScore study rated PayPal's conversion rate for merchants at 87%, with the next highest service at 51%. Clearly, for merchants and consumers, PayPal is a far superior choice.
I'm also very pleased with the performance of our Xoom acquisition and our integration efforts. Global expansion meaningfully accelerated in the first months following the close of the acquisition. So far this year, Xoom has expanded its service to 11 new countries with 2 more countries coming very shortly. These include Haiti, Nigeria and Slovakia, and we also announced an integration with M-Pesa in Kenya. Xoom continues to be a market leader in mobile with some 70% of transactions in the quarter happening on a mobile device, and Q1 was a record activation quarter with net new actives up over 70% year-over-year as we begin to see some of the synergies we expected come to fruition.
Being a leading global payments provider requires exceptional effort and continued investment in our risk and compliance functions across all of our markets and all of our product areas. There are many reasons to do this. We live in a time where global terrorism and cyber crime are on the rise and as a result, increasing our focus on compliance is obviously the right thing to do. But we are also investing in these areas because we know that a strong risk and compliance infrastructure is a deep competitive advantage. And the more advanced our capabilities in these areas, the greater the trust our customers will have in PayPal and in our ever-expanding value proposition.
A great example of this is the relationship we have built with our regulators as it relates to our PayPal Credit offerings. We have seen our Net Promoter Score for PayPal Credit jump to over 70% in March, a clear demonstration that what regulators want and what we want are truly aligned around delighting and protecting our customers.
I'll end my remarks with the following reflections. Although Q1 was clearly a strong start to 2016, we still have a lot of work ahead of us in order to deliver on our product road map and expand our leadership position. We have an expansive and an important mission and I can assure you, our team is focused on executing, partnering within our ecosystem in driving new, innovative and meaningful value to our merchants and consumers.
And with that, let me hand it over to John."
112732,331404039,965182,"PayPal Holdings, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","PayPal Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dan. I also want to thank all of PayPal's customers and our 17,000 employees worldwide for making this another great quarter.Transactions, payment volume and revenue growth all accelerated from the previous quarter. Total payment volume was $81",1380,"Thanks, Dan. I also want to thank all of PayPal's customers and our 17,000 employees worldwide for making this another great quarter.
Transactions, payment volume and revenue growth all accelerated from the previous quarter. Total payment volume was $81 billion, an increase of 31% on a currency neutral basis. Of that, U.S. payment volume grew 30%, while international growth was 32%. We grew faster than e-commerce market and continued to gain market share. Our share gain demonstrates that our strategy is working as we focus on being the customer champion and moved from being a payment button to an end-to-end payment solution for merchants of all sizes.
We added 4.5 million new active accounts, ending the quarter with 184 million. We continue to extend our global reach with 56% of the total active accounts outside of the U.S. The number of payment transactions in the quarter increased 26% year-over-year driven predominantly by the increasing relevance and ubiquity of our platform as we continue to have strong growth in our core business and Braintree. In addition, PayPal is driving the growth of mobile payments, and an increasing amount of our business is conducted on mobile devices.
During the quarter, we processed $21 billion of mobile payment volume, which was up 54%. With capabilities and services like peer-to-peer, credit and remittances as well as strong mobile growth, we are becoming more relevant in our customers' daily lives. As a result, the number of payment transactions per active account increased to 28, up 12% from a year ago.
We generated more than $2.5 billion of revenue in the first quarter, up 23% on a currency neutral basis. Of that, transaction revenue increased 21%, which benefited from rising engagement as reflected by the increase in the number of payment transactions per active customer account. This increase also reflects the growing relevancy of Braintree as we move from a payment button to a full services payment partner where we capture all of the merchant's processing volumes. Revenue from other value-added services grew 38% on a currency neutral basis driven by the growth of PayPal Credit as well as the amended contract with Synchrony Financial last year.
We continue to demonstrate good control of our expenses. Total expenses were $2 billion, up 20%. Our volume-based expenses, which are transaction expense and transaction and loan losses, were up 32%, in line with payment volume. Other expenses grew at approximately half the rate of revenue growth as we gained economies of scale. Excluding Xoom, which was not in our results in the first quarter last year, our other expenses increased only 6%.
As we stated in the past, our strategy is to expand our presence with large merchants, which increases our relevance with consumers but results in a lower take rate from volume-based pricing. The strategy has driven accelerated volume and revenue growth as well as market share gains. Our fast-growing Braintree platform also provide solutions for large and next-generation merchants and brings with it a higher mix of card payments. As a result, our overall transaction margin for the quarter declined 380 basis points.
While large merchants and Braintree contribute to the lower overall transaction margin, they increased our overall operating income dollars. In the quarter, operating margin declined 70 basis points from the same quarter a year ago. Excluding Xoom, however, our margin increased, demonstrating that our core business is performing well and we are doing a good job controlling cost. We are one quarter in after completing the acquisition of Xoom, and we are even more excited about what it brings to the platform. But as I previously stated, Xoom will be dilutive to operating margin in 2016.
In the quarter, our capital expenditures were $133 million or approximately 5% of revenue. Free cash flow in the quarter was $605 million, representing $0.24 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue. This was higher than we expected from better operating results as well as the timing of certain working capital items. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $6.4 billion, including approximately $1.4 billion in the U.S.
And now to guidance. Our business is performing great, and we are executing on our strategy and delivering on our commitments. Our strong performance in Q1 reinforces our conviction in our strategy and the opportunity before us. We still have 3 quarters to execute against for the year, but we are off to a good start. As a result, we are affirming our full year guidance ranges for 2016. However, I'd like to provide you with some context for how we're thinking about the year.
The retail landscape continues to be mixed, and we still face pressure from the movement of currencies relative to the dollar on our international business. We continue to see volume accelerate across our platform driven in part by strong growth of our newer businesses. The mix shift to these newer businesses where we are investing puts pressure on our transaction margin, which good cost control will help offset. There is still much in the year to play out, but our first quarter performance provides us with increased confidence in achieving our goals.
As I stated on the call last quarter, we have some lumpiness in our revenue growth due to several onetime items in 2015. Consistent with our guidance last quarter, we expect an approximate 6-point deceleration in year-over-year revenue growth from the first quarter to the second, primarily due to the sale of a portion of our credit receivables and the impact of the amended Synchrony agreement last year, both of which were virtually 100% margin. For the second quarter, we expect revenue growth on a currency neutral basis to be between 16% and 18%. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.34 and $0.36. We plan to return to a more normalized growth rate in the back half of the year.
Our business model of strong top line growth, expense control and low capital intensity gives us the ability to consistently generate strong free cash flow. We have a tremendous opportunity to increase shareholder value with the deployment of that cash flow. We initiated the share buyback program that was announced on our last earnings call and repurchased 17 million shares at an average price of $35 per share.
I'd like to take a moment to talk about our credit products, which complement our digital payments platform. Credit represents approximately 2% of TPV and has been relatively consistent at that level over the last couple of years. Credit is a flywheel for PayPal, which benefits both our consumers as well as our merchants. It drives payment volume growth and increases choice for our customers by providing them with flexible payment options and allowing customers to pay over time. But credit benefits PayPal in many ways beyond just the payment transaction. Credit reduces card abandonment, leading to increased conversion for merchants and an increase in basket size on purchases where the average purchase of a credit customer is 20% to 30% larger.
Additionally, our working capital product continues to gain momentum and helps to deepen our relationship with merchants while helping them grow. We typically see merchant sales increase after receiving our working capital loan. The satisfaction rates are very high, and we experienced reduced merchant churn.
Beginning this quarter, we designated $800 million of European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to be used to extend credit to our European customers, which would have previously been funded with our own cash. The use of the full amount of these funds will depend upon the growth of our European credit business. This is a highly efficient source of funding to support our credit business, and we continue to explore alternatives to pursue an asset-light model.
In closing, we are off to a strong start to the year. As a technology platform leader operating globally at scale, we are driving the digitization of payments in a large, dynamic and growing industry. We are focused on delivering shareholder value with our strong revenue growth and cash generation. We're excited about the opportunity ahead and look forward to sharing more at our Analyst Day next month.
With that, let me turn it back to the operator for questions."

As we've seen for a couple quarters now, there's definitely pressure there. But I would remind you, that's a deliberate part of our strategy as we're trying to increase the ubiquity of PayPal and allow our customers to use PayPal at larger merchants where we're going to see pressure on take rate. Fortunately for us, we have the ability to offset that with the operating leverage in our business. And as a management team, we're focused on our margins, our generation of free cash flow and growing EPS and not getting so focused on just one aspect of the P&L, being the transaction margin. So you'll continue to see us demonstrate the ability to offset some of that decline. With respect to mix, as we said before, we expected the impact of that 2016 to be relatively de minimis, and our first quarter results actually validated that. It was fairly negligible in the quarter and we would expect, to your question, a similar impact for the balance of the year."

First of all, as we've said all along, the margins in this business tend to want to go up. In fact, if you excluded Xoom from our results in the quarter, our margins would have gone up year-over-year. The take rate is a direct result of the strategies that we're implementing. First thing is we want more ubiquity for PayPal consumers. The more ubiquity there is for them to shop, the more they use us, the more engagements they have, the more satisfied they are of the service and it gives us a flywheel effect. And as John mentioned, every one of the dollars that come in from our merchants are obviously profitable dollars for us, but large merchants have lower take rates. That's just the way of the world: more volume, more pricing leverage. The second piece is we are trying to become a full services platform to enable merchants to move into digital commerce. That means we want to do 100% share of their payment processing. We want to be a strategic partner with them. We want to enable their business strategy. And the more we do that, the closer we get to our merchants, the better off that is for us. Churn goes down, more branded business comes towards us. But of course, as we go -- move more towards that product mix, you also see some margin because that mix of product has a lower margin set as well. But overall, when we include our branded on that, that's a net positive for us. So we're really comfortable with the strategy. It inevitably leads to -- at least for now because we are penetrating a lot of that larger merchant base and we'll start to see more normalized stuff come out of that, but for now that is the right strategy for us and it is paying off in all sorts of benefits for us. In terms of net new account growth, you're seeing that throughout the world right now. As John mentioned, over half of our actives are outside of the U.S. So we're seeing good growth across the world. We're obviously seeing very good growth in our core PayPal acquisitions as well as in Venmo. So I would basically say we've got good, consistent growth that spans from our newer services to our core business. I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that our value proposition has significantly improved over the course of the last year, 1.5 years or so and consumers are beginning to see that."

Engagement is growing because our value proposition is getting better. One Touch is increasing engagement. Our new mobile app is increasing engagement, and conversion is also going up because of these value propositions. We obviously are also expanding partnerships right now. All the investment that we've done in the tech spec over the course of the last 3-plus years is really paying off in our ability to work with the most technically savvy and sophisticated partners and be able to deliver a digital and mobile payment experience that we think is best-in-class. So those new partnerships are helping. And the more consumers we get, the more merchants want to come on board and you saw some of those in my remarks. But we're now over 14 million merchants. So it's a combination of a better value proposition, more partnerships, expanded merchants and then really driving our net new consumers and engagement per consumer.

So as we've said pretty consistently, we are not in credit for credit's sake. We are in credit because it drives both consumer benefits and merchant benefits and drives the overall flywheel for PayPal any which way you look at it. It drives increased basket size, increased conversion. Working capital significantly increases the volume that we see coming on to PayPal, significantly increases the NPS scores. So we see a lot of benefit in the overall PayPal ecosystem. So we can do this and will continue to do this in an asset-light manner. Credit is a small part of our overall business. It will likely remain a small part of our overall business, and ways of figuring out how to do that in asset-light and capital-efficient manners are a goal of ours. Synchrony, the partnership we have with them is a good example of that. And I think you can expect us to be looking at those kinds of things to become increasingly asset light. We don't need to do all of this or even a great portion of this necessarily on our own balance sheet. We can work with partners because the important thing to us is the flywheel effect."

So we're in good and meaningful discussions across the entire ecosystem right now, and I'm hopeful that, that leads to a win-win for a number of parties. Just to take a step back and give a little bit of context. One of the things that we talk about inside PayPal all the time now is how do we become the ultimate customer champion company, and being a customer champion company means providing the very best experience to our customers. And when we think about the very best experience, that means giving our customers full choice and optionality about where they want to pay and how they want to pay. And to us that just makes a ton of sense, and we've done a lot of work around this, as you can imagine, and a lot of research and a lot of experimentation. And here is what we see. When we do that, we drive a heck of a lot more net adds than we have in our traditional sign-up process, and engagement and conversion go up meaningfully. So that obviously drives increased revenues and volumes for us. Funding mix may shift slightly, but the difference between ACH and debit has narrowed substantially. Over the last couple of years, different regulatory environments have narrowed a lot of the payment option sites. And so -- and we would also expect some trade-off with incremental volumes that we could drive on to networks and pricing that we would receive from potential partners. In addition, we are very willing to share data back with issuers and the networks. That really is a legacy of the past as best I can see. And this sort of new model of customer choice, of data sharing and all of us having a common foe in cash transactions, we all want to electronify more and more payments and that's all attractive and additive to the entire ecosystem. And so that eliminates a lot of the previous perceived friction that might have been out in the ecosystem. And furthermore, we want a partner. We think that's the right thing to go and do. And so we'll see where all this goes, but as I've said, it has the opportunity to be a win for all of us in the ecosystem."

So first thing in terms of pipeline, we're improving our capabilities as rapidly as we can to on-board live to site that pipeline of sales that we have for Braintree and in our core business. So that's improved quite a bit. But I will say despite the improvement, we are still seeing a large demand and pipeline of additional sales coming in for our platform. I'd say it's a high-class problem to have, and the value proposition of Braintree is -- I think the whole team there is doing a great job in driving that. The core propositions of PayPal are getting better. We're really starting to execute against this idea of being a full services platform, really being the almost the underlying operating system for digital commerce, and then that is -- it's resonating with the merchant population. And so we still have a very strong pipeline waiting to go live to site and a strong pipeline of merchants that we're talking to in the middle of the sales process with them as well. In terms of One Touch, we've said from the very beginning that we see meaningful lift in not just conversion vis-à-vis our other products, but also engagement in terms of how often a consumer uses PayPal because really as you can imagine, taking friction out of the checkout experience is just a really positive thing. It's really positive for consumers, and it's really positive for merchants. And seeing that comScore study that basically has our nearest alternative service at 51% and us at 87% can give you an idea of the lift in conversion. The other place that I would point to is you can see kind of where PayPal conversion was before One Touch and of the comScore study than where it is now, and you can get a sense of some of the lift for that by looking at some of those external studies. But you'll see it's a meaningful lift in conversion overall. That's obviously beginning to help us in our results. And hopefully as we continue to on-board more and more consumers on that, we'll continue to help drive some of our future growth."

And so as we look at the environment and we look at the differences in mix shift, we look at the advantages of choice, we look at the partnering with the ecosystem, we think this is a net positive not just for us but for other players in the ecosystem as well. And that's what has us cautiously optimistic about this. Any time that you can find solutions that actually provide a win for all players in the system, that's a real positive, and I think that's what we're finding in our conversations. It doesn't mean that things lead to one thing or another, but it does mean that there's a lot more understanding and a lot more commonality in what we're trying to do than before."

Well, first of all, the mobile app is a fundamentally redesigned app. I mean, it really brings us into the mobile world. It puts upfront the things that customers want to go and do. It doesn't clutter it up. It's simple, easy. As I mentioned, it's driving increased consumer engagement, and it also enables us for consumers to now be able to use their mobile phone in-store whether that be through NFC or QR codes. And the way that I think about in-store is really in-store, online, in-app, they're all coming together. It's just commerce is the way to think about it. It's all moving towards mobile, and we basically want to be able to utilize for merchants kind of this underlying platform so that we can be their OS, do 100% share of checkout, enable merchants to create their own application, tie in their rewards into our platform, do things like split tender at checkout and create a real value proposition change for consumers so that merchants can use mobile to get closer to their customers. And we're trying to power that experience there. We want to be OS agnostic. We want to be POS, point of sale, agnostic as well. And then we want to use our PayPal wallet which, as we mentioned now, is growing quite quickly to basically light up that merchant app. Part of the issue with merchant apps is when -- they can create a good value proposition, they need somebody to help power that, but then they need volume on that application. And with things like our One Touch technology, our new re-platforming, as long as a consumer opts in, we can credentialize their ideas and make that signing up for that app much more friction-free than previously. And so not only can we provide the underlying infrastructure for that merchant, but we can then light up that application with our consumer base. We've had great success with Shell in the U.K. They're doing a trial now in Brazil with Subway, with Burger King, with Dollar General, with Macy's, with Papa Johns. We have thousands of retailers that now are part of our order ahead application on our mobile app where you can just order ahead, pay with PayPal and then pick up in-store. And so this is what I mean. Basically, you have mobile bridging the gap between online, in-app and in-store, and we're really pleased with the initial results. It's obviously early on, but a lot of potential for us there. So thank you for that  question, and thank you everybody for joining us today. We appreciate your time."

And I want to thank all of you on the call for joining us. We know how busy your schedules are, so we appreciate your time.
I'm very pleased to report that PayPal delivered strong financial results for the first quarter of 2016. In many ways, this was our best quarter in the time since I joined PayPal, and it's gratifying to see the company execute against our goals. The mission of PayPal is clear. We want to become an everyday essential financial service for consumers and provide a full-service solution and platform that enables digital commerce for merchants around the globe, and we continue to make tangible and consistent progress towards that vision.
We are showing strong growth across all of our operational metrics. We ended the quarter with 184 million active accounts, up from 179 million last quarter. Our enhanced value proposition is attracting new users at an accelerating rate and in turn, attracting new partners and new merchants. The larger our scale, the more important and relevant we become in the ecosystem as our network effect becomes ever stronger.
Our increased scale combined with continued growing engagement resulted in some of the strongest payment volume and revenue growth rates in our recent history and clearly demonstrate our leadership in digital and mobile payments around the world. Our total payment volume growth, or TPV, accelerated to 31% on an FX-neutral basis, and our merchant services volume grew a record 39%, leading to revenue growth of 23% on an FX-neutral basis. We ended the quarter with over 14 million merchant accounts.
I'd just pause on that number for a moment. Our 2-sided network with 14 million merchants on one side and over 170 million buyers on the other is one of our key competitive advantages and extremely difficult to replicate. We are proud to have added this quarter popular and influential brands like Crate and Barrel; Sephora; Air France; Fresh Direct; Panera Bread; and Woolworths, which is the largest grocery chain in Australia, serving more than 28 million customers each week. These brands joined the growing list of companies that are choosing PayPal.
As I mentioned, merchant services payment volume grew 39% on an FX-neutral basis, significantly higher than the rate of e-commerce growth. Our increasing ability to innovate and lead transformative change for merchants and consumers is not only accelerating our competitive differentiation but enabling us to, once again, increase our share in a dynamic and competitive environment.
Each quarter, we measure the success of our business against 4 key metrics: our top line growth, our net active customer base, our customer engagement and our ability to generate strong free cash flow. I'm pleased to report we delivered strong performance against each of these metrics.
Let me start with revenue. We grew our top line to $2.54 billion, up 23% on an FX-neutral basis or 19% on a spot basis. This was our strongest quarter for revenue growth in the last 5 quarters. As I mentioned, we ended the quarter with 184 million active accounts, demonstrating another strong quarter of customer acquisition. All of you know by now that our long-term aspiration is to position PayPal as an everyday part of our customers' financial lives, and increasing the level of customer engagement is one of our primary measures of success in that goal. And despite an ever increasing account base, I'm pleased to say we grew the annual transactions per active account from 25 in Q1 a year ago to 28 this quarter, which resulted in PayPal processing 1.4 billion transactions for our customers during the quarter, up 26% year-over-year.
Customer engagement was driven by significant enhancements to our value proposition and by the debut of PayPal's first Super Bowl ad, which drove significant increases in the perception of PayPal in the weeks that follow the commercial's first airing. And last but certainly not least, we generated strong free cash flow of $605 million in Q1, up over 70% year-over-year.
I'm obviously pleased with the quarter's results, but we still have much to execute throughout the rest of the year. We need to continually innovate if we are to widen the distance between our value proposition and that of our competition. And in keeping with that focus, Q1 saw the introduction of several strong new product experiences across our global customer base.
We launched a new fundamentally redesigned PayPal mobile app in 145 markets simultaneously in 17 languages across both iOS and Android operating systems. The app is built on an iterative platform so that we can now easily customize and localize new features across all the markets where it's live. The new experience is driving increased consumer engagement, increased send and request money transactions and will enable our consumers to use their mobile phone online, in-app or in-store with both NFC and QR capabilities.
Venmo continues to go from strength to strength, processing nearly $3.2 billion in payment volume in Q1, up over 150% from last year, and its subscriber base continues to grow at an ever accelerating rate. We made good progress with our Pay with Venmo pilot. Early customer results and feedback have provided strong validation around the demand for Venmo as a way to pay in-app. This feedback has helped us to fine-tune our processes, procedures and value proposition, and we have now widened our pilot to include approximately 550,000 Venmo users. We are on track to expand to more merchants and open the service to our full Venmo customer base in the second half of this year.
We introduced PayPal Commerce, a set of tools and APIs, which are currently in beta, that make it easier for merchants to securely sell across multiple contexts: e-mail, social shares, blogs, articles, ads, in-app and anywhere consumers are online or on their mobile devices. This new offering is the result of the rapid integration of the technology and the team we gained through the acquisition of Modest in August 2015. It is a critical element of the full-service suite of capabilities we are building into our merchant platform as we help retailers move fully into digital commerce.
Our increased pace and global scale of innovation is fueled by the investments we have made in our core infrastructure and platform. They are designed to drive agility and innovation across our entire software stack. We run one of the largest private cloud environments in the world. We follow industry best practices of agile software development, continuous integration and deliberate using open source technologies. These investments have enabled our developers to push code several times a day, allowing them to iterate new features faster and get instant customer feedback. To drive that point home, the number of production deployments has increased by 200% compared to last year.
Our increased ability to innovate on a global scale and deliver on our commitments is a primary reason why PayPal is becoming the partner of choice for companies around the world, including some of the leading tech companies and the largest wireless carriers in Mexico, Latin America and Europe. Telcel and Claro are implementing our platform to help their 140 million consumers manage their money and make everyday purchases via their mobile devices. These digital wallet offerings are now in trial, and we expect a full rollout in the second half of the year starting in Mexico and Brazil. The app will be available for download for both Android and iOS, and consumers will be able to easily create and manage a new PayPal account using only their smartphone and will be able to pay for basic telco services, including topping off their prepaid phones and buying related data plans. Eventually, they will be able to conveniently pay for services from other merchants as well as paying bills and sending money.
Our partnership with Vodafone in Europe will have tens of billions of European customers to use PayPal as the preferred way to fund their payments. And for the first time, consumers with Android smartphones at Visa contactless terminals will be able to tap to pay in-store. We are now live in our first market, Spain, and we anticipate expanding across Europe throughout the back half of 2016. Our partnership with Vodafone delivers what consumers, businesses and European regulators want: better products, more choice and greater transparency.
In the quarter, we also extended our relationships with both Alibaba and Facebook. Our pilot with Alibaba Wholesaler has been extended, and we will now do a full rollout to include new countries and merchants. And our partnership with Facebook continues to expand nicely, both in the Messenger and Facebook shop applications and as a key partner across a wide range of their core payments experiences.
Q1 also saw us deepen and expand our relationships with commerce platforms that make selling online and on mobile simpler for businesses around the world. We signed an agreement with WooCommerce to make PayPal their preferred payment extension for their platform. We also extended our relationship with Shopify, one the largest commerce platforms, which powers 243,000 businesses in approximately 150 countries to provide all new Shopify merchants with PayPal as their default payment experience.
One Touch expanded to merchants in an additional 121 markets across Asia, Europe and Central America, making it available to merchants in 144 markets and is now available to consumers in all 203 markets in which we operate. One Touch is the most rapidly adopted product PayPal has ever launched. It now has some 21 million consumers who have proactively opted in, and we anticipate well over 2 million merchants will have One Touch enabled by year-end. We continue to see meaningful engagement and conversion lift with the use of One Touch, enabling both consumers and merchants to have a more seamless and friction-free checkout experience. In fact, a recent comScore study rated PayPal's conversion rate for merchants at 87%, with the next highest service at 51%. Clearly, for merchants and consumers, PayPal is a far superior choice.
I'm also very pleased with the performance of our Xoom acquisition and our integration efforts. Global expansion meaningfully accelerated in the first months following the close of the acquisition. So far this year, Xoom has expanded its service to 11 new countries with 2 more countries coming very shortly. These include Haiti, Nigeria and Slovakia, and we also announced an integration with M-Pesa in Kenya. Xoom continues to be a market leader in mobile with some 70% of transactions in the quarter happening on a mobile device, and Q1 was a record activation quarter with net new actives up over 70% year-over-year as we begin to see some of the synergies we expected come to fruition.
Being a leading global payments provider requires exceptional effort and continued investment in our risk and compliance functions across all of our markets and all of our product areas. There are many reasons to do this. We live in a time where global terrorism and cybercrime are on the rise and as a result, increasing our focus on compliance is obviously the right thing to do. But we are also investing in these areas because we know that a strong risk and compliance infrastructure is a deep competitive advantage. And the more advanced our capabilities in these areas, the greater the trust our customers will have in PayPal and in our ever-expanding value proposition.
A great example of this is the relationship we have built with our regulators as it relates to our PayPal Credit offerings. We have seen our Net Promoter Score for PayPal Credit jump to over 70% in March, a clear demonstration that what regulators want and what we want are truly aligned around delighting and protecting our customers.
I'd end my remarks with the following reflections. Although Q1 was clearly a strong start to 2016, we still have a lot of work ahead of us in order to deliver on our product road map and expand our leadership position. We have an expansive and an important mission and I can assure you, our team is focused on executing, partnering within our ecosystem in driving new, innovative and meaningful value to our merchants and consumers.
And with that, let me hand it over to John."

I also want to thank all of PayPal's customers and our 17,000 employees worldwide for making this another great quarter.Transactions, payment volume and revenue growth all accelerated from the previous quarter. Total payment volume was $81",1380,"Thanks, Dan. I also want to thank all of PayPal's customers and our 17,000 employees worldwide for making this another great quarter.
Transactions, payment volume and revenue growth all accelerated from the previous quarter. Total payment volume was $81 billion, an increase of 31% on a currency neutral basis. Of that, U.S. payment volume grew 30%, while international growth was 32%. We grew faster than e-commerce market and continued to gain market share. Our share gain demonstrates that our strategy is working as we focus on being the customer champion and moved from being a payment button to an end-to-end payment solution for merchants of all sizes.
We added 4.5 million new active accounts, ending the quarter with 184 million. We continue to extend our global reach with 56% of the total active accounts outside of the U.S. The number of payment transactions in the quarter increased 26% year-over-year driven predominantly by the increasing relevance and ubiquity of our platform as we continue to have strong growth in our core business and Braintree. In addition, PayPal is driving the growth of mobile payments, and an increasing amount of our business is conducted on mobile devices.
During the quarter, we processed $21 billion of mobile payment volume, which was up 54%. With capabilities and services like peer-to-peer, credit and remittances as well as strong mobile growth, we are becoming more relevant in our customers' daily lives. As a result, the number of payment transactions per active account increased to 28, up 12% from a year ago.
We generated more than $2.5 billion of revenue in the first quarter, up 23% on a currency neutral basis. Of that, transaction revenue increased 21%, which benefited from rising engagement as reflected by the increase in the number of payment transactions per active customer account. This increase also reflects the growing relevancy of Braintree as we move from a payment button to a full services payment partner where we capture all of the merchant's processing volumes. Revenue from other value-added services grew 38% on a currency neutral basis driven by the growth of PayPal Credit as well as the amended contract with Synchrony Financial last year.
We continue to demonstrate good control of our expenses. Total expenses were $2 billion, up 20%. Our volume-based expenses, which are transaction expense and transaction and loan losses, were up 32%, in line with payment volume. Other expenses grew at approximately half the rate of revenue growth as we gained economies of scale. Excluding Xoom, which was not in our results in the first quarter last year, our other expenses increased only 6%.
As we stated in the past, our strategy is to expand our presence with large merchants, which increases our relevance with consumers but results in a lower take rate from volume-based pricing. This strategy has driven accelerated volume and revenue growth as well as market share gains. Our fast-growing Braintree platform also provide solutions for large and next-generation merchants and brings with it a higher mix of card payments. As a result, our overall transaction margin for the quarter declined 380 basis points.
While large merchants and Braintree contribute to the lower overall transaction margin, they increased our overall operating income dollars. In the quarter, operating margin declined 70 basis points from the same quarter a year ago. Excluding Xoom, however, our margin increased, demonstrating that our core business is performing well and we are doing a good job controlling cost. We are one quarter in after completing the acquisition of Xoom, and we are even more excited about what it brings to the platform. But as I previously stated, Xoom will be dilutive to operating margin in 2016.
In the quarter, our capital expenditures were $133 million or approximately 5% of revenue. Free cash flow in the quarter was $605 million, representing $0.24 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue. This was higher than we expected from better operating results as well as the timing of certain working capital items. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $6.4 billion, including approximately $1.4 billion in the U.S.
And now to guidance. Our business is performing great, and we are executing on our strategy and delivering on our commitments. Our strong performance in Q1 reinforces our conviction in our strategy and the opportunity before us. We still have 3 quarters to execute against for the year, but we are off to a good start. As a result, we are affirming our full year guidance ranges for 2016. However, I'd like to provide you with some context for how we're thinking about the year.
The retail landscape continues to be mixed, and we still face pressure from the movement of currencies relative to the dollar on our international business. We continue to see volume accelerate across our platform driven in part by strong growth of our newer businesses. The mix shift to these newer businesses where we are investing puts pressure on our transaction margin, which good cost control will help offset. There is still much in the year to play out, but our first quarter performance provides us with increased confidence in achieving our goals.
As I stated on the call last quarter, we had some lumpiness in our revenue growth due to several onetime items in 2015. Consistent with our guidance last quarter, we expect an approximate 6-point deceleration in year-over-year revenue growth from the first quarter to the second, primarily due to the sale of a portion of our credit receivables and the impact of the amended Synchrony agreement last year, both of which were virtually 100% margin. For the second quarter, we expect revenue growth on a currency neutral basis to be between 16% and 18%. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.34 and $0.36. We plan to return to a more normalized growth rate in the back half of the year.
Our business model of strong top line growth, expense control and low capital intensity gives us the ability to consistently generate strong free cash flow. We have a tremendous opportunity to increase shareholder value with the deployment of that cash flow. We initiated the share buyback program that was announced on our last earnings call and repurchased 17 million shares at an average price of $35 per share.
I'd like to take a moment to talk about our credit products, which complement our digital payments platform. Credit represents approximately 2% of TPV and has been relatively consistent at that level over the last couple of years. Credit is a flywheel for PayPal, which benefits both our consumers as well as our merchants. It drives payment volume growth and increases choice for our customers by providing them with flexible payment options and allowing customers to pay over time. But credit benefits PayPal in many ways beyond just the payment transaction. Credit reduces cart abandonment, leading to increased conversion for merchants and an increase in basket size on purchases where the average purchase of a credit customer is 20% to 30% larger.
Additionally, our working capital product continues to gain momentum and helps to deepen our relationship with merchants while helping them grow. We typically see merchant sales increase after receiving our working capital loan. The satisfaction rates are very high, and we experienced reduced merchant churn.
Beginning this quarter, we designated $800 million of European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to be used to extend credit to our European customers, which would have previously been funded with our own cash. The use of the full amount of these funds will depend upon the growth of our European credit business. This is a highly efficient source of funding to support our credit business, and we continue to explore alternatives to pursue an asset-light model.
In closing, we are off to a strong start to the year. As a technology platform leader operating globally at scale, we are driving the digitization of payments in a large, dynamic and growing industry. We are focused on delivering shareholder value with our strong revenue growth and cash generation. We're excited about the opportunity ahead and look forward to sharing more at our Analyst Day next month.
With that, let me turn it back to the operator for questions."

And as John mentioned, every one of the dollars that come in from our merchants are obviously profitable dollars for us, but large merchants have lower take rates. That's just the way of the world: more volume, more pricing leverage. The second piece is we are trying to become a full services platform to enable merchants to move into digital commerce. That means we want to do 100% share of their payment processing. We want to be a strategic partner with them. We want to enable their business strategy. And the more we do that, the closer we get to our merchants, the better off that is for us. Churn goes down, more branded business comes towards us. But of course, as we go -- move more towards that product mix, you also see some margin because that mix of product has a lower margin set as well. But overall, when we include our branded on that, that's a net positive for us. So we're really comfortable with the strategy. It inevitably leads to -- at least for now because we are penetrating a lot of that larger merchant base and we'll start to see more normalized stuff come out of that, but for now that is the right strategy for us and it is paying off in all sorts of benefits for us. In terms of net new account growth, you're seeing that throughout the world right now. As John mentioned, over half of our actives are outside of the U.S. So we're seeing good growth across the world. We're obviously seeing very good growth in our core PayPal acquisitions as well as in Venmo. So I would basically say we've got good, consistent growth that spans from our newer services to our core business. I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that our value proposition has significantly improved over the course of the last year, 1.5 years or so and consumers are beginning to see that."

Over the last 2 quarters, you've seen acceleration in the number of net new adds that we put on to the business. Engagement is growing. Engagement is growing because our value proposition is getting better. One Touch is increasing engagement. Our new mobile app is increasing engagement, and conversion is also going up because of those value propositions. We obviously are also expanding partnerships right now. All the investment that we've done in the tech stack over the course of the last 3-plus years is really paying off in our ability to work with the most technically savvy and sophisticated partners and be able to deliver a digital and mobile payment experience that we think is best-in-class. So those new partnerships are helping. And the more consumers we get, the more merchants want to come on board and you saw some of those in my remarks. But we're now over 14 million merchants. So it's a combination of a better value proposition, more partnerships, expanded merchants and then really driving our net new consumers and engagement per consumer. All of that is adding up to very strong volume growth."

You made it clear that credit is important because it helps fuel growth and it has the flywheel effects that you described. But how much do you worry about the lower valuation multiple that the market ascribes to businesses that face credit risk? And is that really the reason why you're exploring asset light, basically identify a partner with a strong balance sheet so that they could help you retain all the benefits of the credit product without taking on the credit risk?"

So as we've said pretty consistently, we are not in credit for credit's sake. We are in credit because it drives both consumer benefits and merchant benefits and drives the overall flywheel for PayPal any which way you look at it. It drives increased basket size, increased conversion. PayPal working capital significantly increases the volume that we see coming on to PayPal, significantly increases the NPS scores. So we see a lot of benefit in the overall PayPal ecosystem. So we can do this and will continue to do this in an asset-light manner. Credit is a small part of our overall business. It will likely remain a small part of our overall business, and ways of figuring out how to do that in asset-light and capital-efficient manners are a goal of ours. Synchrony, the partnership we have with them is a good example of that. And I think you can expect us to be looking at those kinds of things to become increasingly asset light. We don't need to do all of this or even a great portion of this necessarily on our own balance sheet. We can work with partners because the important thing to us is the flywheel effect."

And I think it's important that you understand that we have a lot of ways that we can manage any volatility irrespective of whether it comes from credit or other aspects of our business. But to Dan's point, credit's about 2% of our volume today. And if you were to just take 2015 growth rates of credit and the rest of our business, it would take a couple decades before credit even got to 20% to 25% of our overall revenue. So this is something that, to Dan's point, we want to utilize it because it complements our platform. But I'd like to allay some of the concerns that are out there right now around this because it's not something that I think is going to have any kind of dramatic impact in terms of the volatility to us."

So we're in good and meaningful discussions across the entire ecosystem right now, and I'm hopeful that, that leads to a win-win for a number of parties. Just to take a step back and give a little bit of context. One of the things that we talk about inside PayPal all the time now is how do we become the ultimate customer champion company, and being a customer champion company means providing the very best experience to our customers. And when we think about the very best experience, that means giving our customers full choice and optionality about where they want to pay and how they want to pay. And to us that just makes a ton of sense, and we've done a lot of work around this, as you can imagine, and a lot of research and a lot of experimentation. And here is what we see. When we do that, we drive a heck of a lot more net adds than we have in our traditional sign-up process, and engagement and conversion go up meaningfully. So that obviously drives increased revenues and volumes for us. Funding mix may shift slightly, but the difference between ACH and debit has narrowed substantially. Over the last couple of years, different regulatory environments have narrowed a lot of the payment options, right? And so -- and we would also expect some trade-off with incremental volumes that we could drive on to networks and pricing that we would receive from potential partners. In addition, we are very willing to share data back with issuers and the networks. That really is a legacy of the past as best I can see. And this sort of new model of customer choice, of data sharing and all of us having a common foe in cash transactions, we all want to electronify more and more payments and that's all attractive and additive to the entire ecosystem. And so that eliminates a lot of the previous perceived friction that might have been out in the ecosystem. And furthermore, we want a partner. We think that's the right thing to go and do. And so we'll see where all this goes, but as I've said, it has the opportunity to be a win for all of us in the ecosystem."

So first thing in terms of pipeline, we're improving our capabilities as rapidly as we can to on-board live to site that pipeline of sales that we have for Braintree and in our core business. So that's improved quite a bit. But I will say despite the improvement, we are still seeing a large demand and pipeline of additional sales coming in for our platform. I'd say it's a high-class problem to have, and the value proposition of Braintree is -- I think the whole team there is doing a great job in driving that. The core propositions of PayPal are getting better. We're really starting to execute against this idea of being a full services platform, really being the almost the underlying operating system for digital commerce, and then that is -- it's resonating with the merchant population. And so we still have a very strong pipeline waiting to go live to site and a strong pipeline of merchants that we're talking to in the middle of the sales process with them as well. In terms of One Touch, we've said from the very beginning that we see meaningful lift in not just conversion vis-à-vis our other products, but also engagement in terms of how often a consumer uses PayPal because really as you can imagine, taking friction out of the checkout experience is just a really positive thing. It's really positive for consumers, and it's really positive for merchants. And seeing that comScore study that basically has our nearest alternative service at 51% and us at 87% can give you an idea of the lift in conversion. The other place that I would point to is you can see kind of where PayPal conversion was before One Touch and other comScore study than where it is now, and you can get a sense of some of the lift for that by looking at some of those external studies. But you'll see it's a meaningful lift in conversion overall. That's obviously beginning to help us in our results. And hopefully as we continue to on-board more and more consumers on that, we'll continue to help drive some of our future growth."

It doesn't clutter it up. It's simple, easy. As I mentioned, it's driving increased consumer engagement, and it also enables us for consumers to now be able to use their mobile phone in-store whether that be through NFC or QR codes. And the way that I think about in-store is really in-store, online, in-app, they're all coming together. It's just commerce is the way to think about it. It's all moving towards mobile, and we basically want to be able to utilize for merchants kind of this underlying platform so that we can be their OS, do 100% share of checkout, enable merchants to create their own application, tie in their rewards into our platform, do things like split tender at checkout and create a real value proposition change for consumers so that merchants can use mobile to get closer to their customers. And we're trying to power that experience there. We want to be OS agnostic. We want to be POS, point of sale, agnostic as well. And then we want to use our PayPal wallet which, as we mentioned now, is growing quite quickly to basically light up that merchant app. Part of the issue with merchant apps is when -- they can create a good value proposition, they need somebody to help power that, but then they need volume on that application. And with things like our One Touch technology, our new re-platforming, as long as a consumer opts in, we can credentialize their ideas and make that signing up for that app much more friction-free than previously. And so not only can we provide the underlying infrastructure for that merchant, but we can then light up that application with our consumer base. We've had great success with Shell in the U.K. They're doing a trial now in Brazil with Subway, with Burger King, with Dollar General, with Macy's, with Papa Johns. We have thousands of retailers that now are part of our order ahead application on our mobile app where you can just order ahead, pay with PayPal and then pick up in-store. And so this is what I mean. Basically, you have mobile bridging the gap between online, in-app and in-store, and we're really pleased with the initial results. It's obviously early on, but a lot of potential for us there. So thank you for that question, and thank you everybody for joining us today. We appreciate your time."

Welcome to PayPal Holdings earnings release conference call for the first quarter 2016. Joining me today on the call are Dan Schulman, our President and CEO; and John Rainey, our Chief Financial Officer. We're providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary.
This conference call is also being broadcast on the Internet, and both the presentation and call are available through the Investor Relations section of our website. In discussing year-over-year comparisons, including guidance growth rates for the second quarter and full year 2016, we've chosen to present non-GAAP pro forma metrics. We believe that these metrics provide investors a consistent basis for reviewing the company's performance across different periods. We will also discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about our company's performance, including the non-GAAP pro forma metrics mentioned above. You can find a reconciliation of these metrics to the most directly comparable GAAP metrics in the presentation accompanying this conference call.
In addition, management will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include our guidance for second quarter and full year 2016. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in this call. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our operating results in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and available on the Investor Relations section of our website. You should not rely on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of today's date, April 27, 2016. We disclaim any obligation to update the information.

Before I start my remarks, I want to take a quick moment to officially welcome you. We're thrilled to have you join PayPal as our new Head of IR. And I want to thank all of you on the call for joining us. We know how busy your schedules are, so we appreciate your time.
I'm very pleased to report that PayPal delivered strong financial results for the first quarter of 2016. In many ways, this was our best quarter in the time since I joined PayPal, and it's gratifying to see the company execute against our goals. The mission of PayPal is clear: We want to become an everyday essential financial service for consumers and provide a full-service solution and platform that enables digital commerce for merchants around the globe, and we continue to make tangible and consistent progress towards that vision.
We are showing strong growth across all of our operational metrics. We ended the quarter with 184 million active accounts, up from 179 million last quarter. Our enhanced value proposition is attracting new users at an accelerating rate and in turn, attracting new partners and new merchants. The larger our scale, the more important and relevant we become in the ecosystem as our network effect becomes ever stronger.
Our increased scale combined with continued growing engagement resulted in some of the strongest payment volume and revenue growth rates in our recent history and clearly demonstrate our leadership in digital and mobile payments around the world. Our total payment volume growth, or TPV, accelerated to 31% on an FX-neutral basis, and our merchant services volume grew a record 39%, leading to revenue growth of 23% on an FX-neutral basis. We ended the quarter with over 14 million merchant accounts.
I'd just pause on that number for a moment. Our 2-sided network, with 14 million merchants on one side and over 170 million buyers on the other, is one of our key competitive advantages and extremely difficult to replicate. We are proud to have added this quarter popular and influential brands like Crate and Barrel; Sephora; Air France; Fresh Direct; Panera Bread; and Woolworths, which is the largest grocery chain in Australia, serving more than 28 million customers each week. These brands joined the growing list of companies that are choosing PayPal.
As I mentioned, merchant services payment volume grew 39% on an FX-neutral basis, significantly higher than the rate of e-commerce growth. Our increasing ability to innovate and lead transformative change for merchants and consumers is not only accelerating our competitive differentiation but enabling us to once again increase our share in a dynamic and competitive environment.
Each quarter, we measure the success of our business against 4 key metrics: our top line growth, our net active customer base, our customer engagement and our ability to generate strong free cash flow. I'm pleased to report we delivered strong performance against each of these metrics.
Let me start with revenue. We grew our top line to $2.54 billion, up 23% on an FX-neutral basis or 19% on a spot basis. This was our strongest quarter for revenue growth in the last 5 quarters. As I mentioned, we ended the quarter with 184 million active accounts, demonstrating another strong quarter of customer acquisition. All of you know by now that our long-term aspiration is to position PayPal as an everyday part of our customers' financial lives, and increasing the level of customer engagement is one of our primary measures of success in that goal. And despite an ever-increasing account base, I'm pleased to say we grew the annual transactions per active account from 25 in Q1 a year ago to 28 this quarter, which resulted in PayPal processing 1.4 billion transactions for our customers during the quarter, up 26% year-over-year.
Customer engagement was driven by significant enhancements to our value proposition and by the debut of PayPal's first Super Bowl ad, which drove significant increases in the perception of PayPal in the weeks that follow the commercial's first airing. And last but certainly not least, we generated strong free cash flow of $605 million in Q1, up over 70% year-over-year.
I'm obviously pleased with the quarter's results, but we still have much to execute throughout the rest of the year. We need to continually innovate if we are to widen the distance between our value proposition and that of our competition. And in keeping with that focus, Q1 saw the introduction of several strong new product experiences across our global customer base.
We launched a new fundamentally redesigned PayPal mobile app in 145 markets simultaneously in 17 languages across both iOS and Android operating systems. The app is built on an iterative platform so that we can now easily customize and localize new features across all the markets where it's live. The new experience is driving increased consumer engagement, increased send and request money transactions and will enable our consumers to use their mobile phone online, in-app or in-store with both NFC and QR capabilities.
Venmo continues to go from strength to strength, processing nearly $3.2 billion in payment volume in Q1, up over 150% from last year, and its subscriber base continues to grow at an ever-accelerating rate. We made good progress with our Pay with Venmo pilot. Early customer results and feedback have provided strong validation around the demand for Venmo as a way to pay in-app. This feedback has helped us to fine-tune our processes, procedures and value proposition, and we have now widened our pilot to include approximately 550,000 Venmo users. We are on track to expand to more merchants and open the service to our full Venmo customer base in the second half of this year.
We introduced PayPal Commerce, a set of tools and APIs, which are currently in beta, that make it easier for merchants to securely sell across multiple contexts: e-mail, social shares, blogs, articles, ads, in-app and anywhere consumers are online or on their mobile devices. This new offering is the result of the rapid integration of the technology and the team we gained through the acquisition of Modest in August 2015. It is a critical element of the full-service suite of capabilities we are building into our merchant platform as we help retailers move fully into digital commerce.
Our increased pace and global scale of innovation is fueled by the investments we have made in our core infrastructure and platform. They are designed to drive agility and innovation across our entire software stack. We run one of the largest private cloud environments in the world. We follow industry best practices of agile software development, continuous integration and deliberate using open-source technologies. These investments have enabled our developers to push code several times a day, allowing them to iterate new features faster and get instant customer feedback. To drive that point home, the number of production deployments has increased by 200% compared to last year.
Our increased ability to innovate on a global scale and deliver on our commitments is a primary reason why PayPal is becoming the partner of choice for companies around the world, including some of the leading tech companies and the largest wireless carriers in Mexico, Latin America and Europe. Telcel and Claro are implementing our platform to help their 140 million consumers manage their money and make everyday purchases via their mobile devices. These digital wallet offerings are now in trial, and we expect a full rollout in the second half of the year starting in Mexico and Brazil. The app will be available for download for both Android and iOS, and consumers will be able to easily create and manage a new PayPal account using only their smartphone and will be able to pay for basic telco services, including topping up their prepaid phones and buying related data plans. Eventually, they will be able to conveniently pay for services from other merchants as well as paying bills and sending money.
Our partnership with Vodafone in Europe will have tens of millions of European customers to use PayPal as the preferred way to fund their payments. And for the first time, consumers with Android smartphones at Visa contactless terminals will be able to tap to pay in-store. We are now live in our first market, Spain, and we anticipate expanding across Europe throughout the back half of 2016. Our partnership with Vodafone delivers what consumers, businesses and European regulators want: better products, more choice and greater transparency.
In the quarter, we also extended our relationships with both Alibaba and Facebook. Our pilot with Alibaba Wholesaler has been extended, and we will now do a full rollout to include new countries and merchants. And our partnership with Facebook continues to expand nicely, both in the Messenger and Facebook shop applications and as a key partner across a wide range of their core payments experiences.
Q1 also saw us deepen and expand our relationships with commerce platforms that make selling online and on mobile simpler for businesses around the world. We signed an agreement with WooCommerce to make PayPal their preferred payment extension for their platform. We also extended our relationship with Shopify, one of the largest commerce platforms, which powers 243,000 businesses in approximately 150 countries, to provide all new Shopify merchants with PayPal as their default payment experience.
One Touch expanded to merchants in an additional 121 markets across Asia, Europe and Central America, making it available to merchants in 144 markets, and it's now available to consumers in all 203 markets in which we operate. One Touch is the most rapidly adopted product PayPal has ever launched. It now has some 21 million consumers who have proactively opted in, and we anticipate well over 2 million merchants will have One Touch enabled by year-end. We continue to see meaningful engagement and conversion lift with the use of One Touch, enabling both consumers and merchants to have a more seamless and friction-free checkout experience. In fact, a recent comScore study rated PayPal's conversion rate for merchants at 87%, with the next highest service at 51%. Clearly, for merchants and consumers, PayPal is a far superior choice.
I'm also very pleased with the performance of our Xoom acquisitions and our integration efforts. Global expansion meaningfully accelerated in the first months following the close of the acquisition. So far this year, Xoom has expanded its service to 11 new countries with 2 more countries coming very shortly. These include Haiti, Nigeria and Slovakia, and we also announced an integration with M-Pesa in Kenya. Xoom continues to be a market leader in mobile with some 70% of transactions in the quarter happening on a mobile device, and Q1 was a record activation quarter with net new actives up over 70% year-over-year as we begin to see some of the synergies we expected come to fruition.
Being a leading global payments provider requires exceptional effort and continued investment in our risk and compliance functions across all of our markets and all of our product areas. There are many reasons to do this. We live in a time where global terrorism and cybercrime are on the rise and as a result, increasing our focus on compliance is obviously the right thing to do. But we are also investing in these areas because we know that a strong risk and compliance infrastructure is a deep competitive advantage. And the more advanced our capabilities in these areas, the greater the trust our customers will have in PayPal and in our ever-expanding value proposition.
A great example of this is the relationship we have built with our regulators as it relates to our PayPal Credit offerings. We have seen our Net Promoter Score for PayPal Credit jump to over 70% in March, a clear demonstration that what regulators want and what we want are truly aligned around delighting and protecting our customers.
I'd end my remarks with the following reflection: Although Q1 was clearly a strong start to 2016, we still have a lot of work ahead of us in order to deliver on our product road map and expand our leadership position. We have an expansive and an important mission, and I can assure you, our team is focused on executing, partnering within our ecosystem and driving new, innovative and meaningful value to our merchants and consumers.
And with that, let me hand it over to John."
112732,331404039,1007350,"PayPal Holdings, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","PayPal Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dan. I also want to thank all of PayPal's customers and our 17,000 employees worldwide for making this another great quarter.Transactions, payment volume and revenue growth all accelerated from the previous quarter. Total payment volume was $81",1378,"Thanks, Dan. I also want to thank all of PayPal's customers and our 17,000 employees worldwide for making this another great quarter.
Transactions, payment volume and revenue growth all accelerated from the previous quarter. Total payment volume was $81 billion, an increase of 31% on a currency neutral basis. Of that, U.S. payment volume grew 30%, while international growth was 32%. We grew faster than e-commerce market and continued to gain market share. Our share gain demonstrates that our strategy is working as we focus on being the customer champion and move from being a payment button to an end-to-end payment solution for merchants of all sizes.
We added 4.5 million new active accounts, ending the quarter with 184 million. We continue to extend our global reach with 56% of the total active accounts outside of the U.S. The number of payment transactions in the quarter increased 26% year-over-year driven predominantly by the increasing relevance and ubiquity of our platform as we continue to have strong growth in our core business and Braintree. In addition, PayPal is driving the growth of mobile payments, and an increasing amount of our business is conducted on mobile devices.
During the quarter, we processed $21 billion of mobile payment volume, which was up 54%. With capabilities and services like peer-to-peer, credit and remittances as well as strong mobile growth, we are becoming more relevant in our customers' daily lives. As a result, the number of payment transactions per active account increased to 28, up 12% from a year ago.
We generated more than $2.5 billion of revenue in the first quarter, up 23% on a currency neutral basis. Of that, transaction revenue increased 21%, which benefited from rising engagement as reflected by the increase in the number of payment transactions per active customer account. This increase also reflects the growing relevancy of Braintree as we move from a payment button to a full-services payment partner where we capture all of the merchant's processing volumes. Revenue from other value-added services grew 38% on a currency neutral basis driven by the growth of PayPal Credit as well as the amended contract with Synchrony Financial last year.
We continue to demonstrate good control of our expenses. Total expenses were $2 billion, up 20%. Our volume-based expenses, which are transaction expense and transaction and loan losses, were up 32%, in line with payment volume. Other expenses grew at approximately half the rate of revenue growth as we gained economies of scale. Excluding Xoom, which was not in our results in the first quarter last year, our other expenses increased only 6%.
As we stated in the past, our strategy is to expand our presence with large merchants, which increases our relevance with consumers but results in a lower take rate from volume-based pricing. This strategy has driven accelerated volume and revenue growth as well as market share gains. Our fast-growing Braintree platform also provide solutions for large and next-generation merchants and brings with it a higher mix of card payments. As a result, our overall transaction margin for the quarter declined 380 basis points.
While large merchants and Braintree contribute to a lower overall transaction margin, they increase our overall operating income dollars. In the quarter, operating margin declined 70 basis points from the same quarter a year ago. Excluding Xoom, however, our margin increased, demonstrating that our core business is performing well and we are doing a good job controlling cost. We are one quarter in after completing the acquisition of Xoom, and we are even more excited about what it brings to the platform. But as I previously stated, Xoom will be dilutive to operating margin in 2016.
In the quarter, our capital expenditures were $133 million or approximately 5% of revenue. Free cash flow in the quarter was $605 million, representing $0.24 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue. This was higher than we expected from better operating results as well as the timing of certain working capital items. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $6.4 billion, including approximately $1.4 billion in the U.S.
And now to guidance. Our business is performing great, and we are executing on our strategy and delivering on our commitments. Our strong performance in Q1 reinforces our conviction in our strategy and the opportunity before us. We still have 3 quarters to execute against for the year, but we are off to a good start. As a result, we are affirming our full year guidance ranges for 2016. However, I'd like to provide you with some context for how we're thinking about the year.
The retail landscape continues to be mixed, and we still face pressure from the movement of currencies relative to the dollar on our international business. We continue to see volume accelerate across our platform driven in part by strong growth of our newer businesses. The mix shift to these newer businesses where we are investing puts pressure on our transaction margin, which good cost control will help offset. There's still much of the year to play out, but our first quarter performance provides us with increased confidence in achieving our goals.
As I stated on the call last quarter, we had some lumpiness in our revenue growth due to several onetime items in 2015. Consistent with our guidance last quarter, we expect an approximate 6-point deceleration in year-over-year revenue growth from the first quarter to the second, primarily due to the sale of a portion of our credit receivables and the impact of the amended Synchrony agreement last year, both of which were virtually 100% margin. For the second quarter, we expect revenue growth on a currency neutral basis to be between 16% and 18%. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.34 and $0.36. We plan to return to a more normalized growth rate in the back half of the year.
Our business model of strong top line growth, expense control and low capital intensity gives us the ability to consistently generate strong free cash flow. We have a tremendous opportunity to increase shareholder value with the deployment of that cash flow. We initiated the share buyback program that was announced on our last earnings call and repurchased 17 million shares at an average price of $35 per share.
I'd like to take a moment to talk about our credit products, which complement our digital payments platform. Credit represents approximately 2% of TPV and has been relatively consistent at that level over the last couple of years. Credit is a flywheel for PayPal, which benefits both our consumers as well as our merchants. It drives payment volume growth and increases choice for our customers by providing them with flexible payment options and allowing customers to pay over time. But credit benefits PayPal in many ways beyond just the payment transaction. Credit reduces cart abandonment, leading to increased conversion for merchants and an increase in basket size on purchases where the average purchase of a credit customer is 20% to 30% larger.
Additionally, our working capital product continues to gain momentum and helps to deepen our relationship with merchants while helping them grow. We typically see merchant sales increase after receiving a working capital loan. The satisfaction rates are very high, and we experience reduced merchant churn.
Beginning this quarter, we designated $800 million of European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to be used to extend credit to our European customers, which would have previously been funded with our own cash. The use of the full amount of these funds will depend upon the growth of our European credit business. This is a highly efficient source of funding to support our credit business, and we continue to explore alternatives to pursue an asset-light model.
In closing, we are off to a strong start to the year. As a technology platform leader operating globally at scale, we are driving the digitization of payments in a large, dynamic and growing industry. We are focused on delivering shareholder value with our strong revenue growth and cash generation. We're excited about the opportunity ahead and look forward to sharing more at our Analyst Day next month.
With that, let me turn it back to the operator for questions."

But I would remind you, that's a deliberate part of our strategy as we're trying to increase the ubiquity of PayPal and allow our customers to use PayPal at larger merchants where we're going to see pressure on take rate. Fortunately for us, we have the ability to offset that with the operating leverage in our business. And as a management team, we're focused on our margins, our generation of free cash flow and growing EPS and not getting so focused on just one aspect of the P&L, being the transaction margin. So you'll continue to see us demonstrate the ability to offset some of that decline. With respect to mix, as we said before, we expected the impact of that 2016 to be relatively de minimis, and our first quarter results actually validated that. It was fairly negligible in the quarter and we would expect, to your question, a similar impact for the balance of the year."

First of all, as we've said all along, the margins in this business tend to want to go up. In fact, if you excluded Xoom from our results in the quarter, our margins would have gone up year-over-year. The take rate is a direct result of the strategies that we're implementing. First thing is we want more ubiquity for PayPal consumers. The more ubiquity there is for them to shop, the more they use us, the more engagements they have, the more satisfied they are of the service, and it gives us a flywheel effect. And as John mentioned, every one of those dollars that come in from our merchants are obviously profitable dollars for us, but large merchants have lower take rates. That's just the way of the world: more volume, more pricing leverage. The second piece is we are trying to become a full-services platform to enable merchants to move into digital commerce. That means we want to do 100% share of their payment processing. We want to be a strategic partner with them. We want to enable their business strategy. And the more we do that, the closer we get to our merchants, the better off that is for us. Churn goes down, more branded business comes towards us. But of course, as we go -- move more towards that product mix, you also see some margin because that mix of product has a lower margin set as well. But overall, when we include our branded on that, that's a net positive for us. So we're really comfortable with the strategy. It inevitably leads to -- at least for now because we are penetrating a lot of that larger merchant base and we'll start to see more normalized stuff come out of that, but for now that is the right strategy for us and it is paying off in all sorts of benefits for us. In terms of net new account growth, you're seeing that throughout the world right now. As John mentioned, over half of our actives are outside of the U.S. So we're seeing good growth across the world. We're obviously seeing very good growth in our core PayPal acquisition as well as in Venmo. So I would basically say we've got good, consistent growth that spans from our newer services to our core business. I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that our value proposition has significantly improved over the course of the last year, 1.5 years or so, and consumers are beginning to see that."

All the investment that we've done in the tech stack over the course of the last 3-plus years is really paying off in our ability to work with the most technically savvy and sophisticated partners and be able to deliver a digital and mobile payment experience that we think is best-in-class. So those new partnerships are helping. And the more consumers we get, the more merchants want to come on board, and you saw some of those in my remarks. But we're now over 14 million merchants.

You made it clear that credit is important because it helps fuel growth and it has the flywheel effects that you described. But how much do you worry about the lower valuation multiple that the market ascribes to businesses that face credit risk? And is that really the reason why you're exploring asset light, to basically identify a partner with a strong balance sheet so that they could help you retain all the benefits of the credit product without taking on the credit risk?"

So as we've said pretty consistently, we are not in credit for credit's sake. We are in credit because it drives both consumer benefits and merchant benefits and drives the overall flywheel for PayPal any which way you look at it. It drives increased basket size, increased conversion, PayPal working capital, significantly increases the volume that we see coming on to PayPal and significantly increases the NPS scores. So we see a lot of benefit in the overall PayPal ecosystem. So we can do this and will continue to do this in an asset-light manner. Credit is a small part of our overall business. It will likely remain a small part of our overall business, and ways of figuring out how to do that in asset-light and capital-efficient manners are a goal of ours. Synchrony, the partnership we have with them is a good example of that. And I think you can expect us to be looking at those kinds of things to become increasingly asset light. We don't need to do all of this or even a great portion of this necessarily on our own balance sheet. We can work with partners because the important thing to us is the flywheel effect."

And I think it's important that you understand that we have a lot of ways that we can manage any volatility irrespective of whether it comes from credit or other aspects of our business. But to Dan's point, credit's about 2% of our volume today. And if you were to just take 2015 growth rates of credit and the rest of our business, it would take a couple decades before credit even got to 20% to 25% of our overall revenue. So this is something that, to Dan's point, we want to utilize it because it complements our platform. But I'd like to allay some of the concerns that are out there right now around this because it's not something that I think is going to have any kind of dramatic impact in terms of the volatility to us."

Maybe could you talk about whether there've been any changes in philosophy around how you think about the sharing of data and perhaps any commentary around the steering issue?

So we're in good and meaningful discussions across the entire ecosystem right now, and I'm hopeful that, that leads to a win-win for a number of parties. Just to take a step back and give a little bit of context. One of the things that we talk about inside PayPal all the time now is how do we become the ultimate customer champion company, and being a customer champion company means providing the very best experience to our customers. And when we think about the very best experience, that means giving our customers full choice and optionality about where they want to pay and how they want to pay. And to us that just makes a ton of sense, and we've done a lot of work around this, as you can imagine, and a lot of research and a lot of experimentation. And here's what we see: when we do that, we drive a heck of a lot more net adds than we have in our traditional sign-up process, and engagement and conversion go up meaningfully. So that obviously drives increased revenues and volumes for us. Funding mix may shift slightly, but the difference between ACH and debit has narrowed substantially. Over the last couple of years, different regulatory environments have narrowed a lot of the payment options type. And so -- and we would also expect some trade-off with incremental volumes that we could drive on to networks and pricing that we would receive from potential partners. In addition, we are very willing to share data back with the issuers and the networks. That really is a legacy of the past as best I can see. And this sort of new model of customer choice, of data sharing and all of us having a common foe in cash transactions. We all want to electronify more and more payments, and that's all attractive and additive to the entire ecosystem. And so that eliminates a lot of the previous perceived friction that might have been out in the ecosystem. And furthermore, we want to partner. We think that's the right thing to go and do. And so we'll see where all this goes, but as I've said, it has the opportunity to be a win for all of us in the ecosystem."

We're improving our capabilities as rapidly as we can to on-board live to site that pipeline of sales that we have for Braintree and in our core business. So that's improved quite a bit. But I will say despite the improvement, we are still seeing a large demand and pipeline of additional sales coming in for our platform. I'd say it's a high-class problem to have, and the value proposition of Braintree is -- I think the whole team there is doing a great job in driving that. The core propositions of PayPal are getting better. We're really starting to execute against this idea of being a full-services platform, really being the almost the underlying operating system for digital commerce, and then that is -- it's resonating with the merchant population. And so we still have a very strong pipeline being -- waiting to go live to site and a strong pipeline of merchants that we're talking to and -- in the middle of the sales process with them as well. In terms of One Touch, we've said from the very beginning that we see meaningful lift in not just conversion vis-à-vis our other products but also engagement in terms of how often a consumer uses PayPal. Because really, Heath, as you can imagine, taking friction out of the checkout experience is just a really positive thing. It's really positive for consumers, and it's really positive for merchants. And seeing that comScore study that basically has our nearest alternative service at 51% and us at 87% can give you an idea of the lift in conversion. The other place that I would point to is you can see kind of where PayPal conversion was before One Touch in other comScore study than where it is now, and you can get a sense of some of the lift for that by looking at some of those external studies. But you'll see it's a meaningful lift in conversion overall that's obviously beginning to help us in our results. And hopefully, as we continue to on-board more and more consumers on that, we'll continue to help drive some of our future growth."

It doesn't clutter it up. It's simple, easy. As I mentioned, it's driving increased consumer engagement, and it also enables us for consumers to now be able to use their mobile phone in-store whether that be through NFC or QR codes. And the way that I think about in-store is really in-store, online, in-app, they're all coming together. It's just commerce is the way to think about it. It's all moving towards mobile, and we basically want to be able to utilize for merchants kind of this underlying platform so that we can be their OS, do 100% share of checkout, enable merchants to create their own application, tie in their rewards into our platform, do things like split tender at checkout and create a real value proposition change for consumers so that merchants can use mobile to get closer to their customers. And we're trying to power that experience there. We want to be OS agnostic. We want to be POS, point of sale, agnostic as well. And then we want to use our PayPal wallet which, as we mentioned now, is growing quite quickly to basically light up that merchant app. Part of the issue with merchant apps is when -- they can create a good value proposition, they need somebody to help power that, but then they need volume on that application. And with things like our One Touch technology, our new re-platforming, as long as a consumer opts in, we can credentialize their IDs and make that signing up for that app much more friction-free than previously. And so not only can we provide the underlying infrastructure for that merchant, but we can then light up that application with our consumer base. We've had great success with Shell in the U.K. They're doing a trial now in Brazil with Subway, with Burger King, with Dollar General, with Macy's, with Papa Johns. We have thousands of retailers that now are part of our order-ahead application on our mobile app where you can just order ahead, pay with PayPal and then pick up in-store. And so this is what I mean. Basically, you have mobile bridging the gap between online, in-app and in-store, and though we're really pleased with the initial results, it's obviously early on, but a lot of potential for us there.

In discussing year-over-year comparisons, including guidance, growth rates for the full year 2016, we have chosen to present non-GAAP pro forma metrics because we believe that these metrics provide investors a consistent basis for reviewing the company's performance across different periods. We will also discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about our company's performance, including the non-GAAP pro forma metrics mentioned above. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP metrics to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the presentation accompanying this conference call.
In addition, management will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include our guidance for third quarter and full year 2016. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in this call.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. I'm pleased to say we had another strong quarter, with our financial results at the high end of our guidance and, in many cases, exceeding our own expectations. And, of course, we announced earlier a multiyear partnership with Visa. But before I discuss our results, I'd like to point out that it's been one year since PayPal became a publicly traded company for the second time. In many ways, our listing last year was a full circle moment for PayPal. It allowed us to return to the core mission of our founders, the mission they were pursuing when they took PayPal public in 2002. Even with the Internet in its infancy, they saw the opportunity for technology to democratize money.
Today, our purpose is the same, but our opportunity is much greater with the digitization of money accelerating and the adoption of mobile devices continuing its rapid pace globally. PayPal's total addressable market has grown to include all of digital commerce and digital money, a $100 trillion opportunity. Today's announcement with Visa brings us closer to capitalizing on that opportunity.
The mission of PayPal is clear, we're striving to become an everyday essential financial service for underserved customers to go. And for our merchants, we want to provide a full-service solution and platform that enables digital commerce.
We are making tangible and consistent progress towards achieving these twin goals while consistently delivering strong financial performance. I'm proud that Q2 was another strong quarter for PayPal, both financially and strategically. Our partnership with Visa will help drive consumer choice and provide enhanced value to the larger payment ecosystem. But first, let's look at the financial metrics we delivered this quarter.
We grew revenue at 19.5%, delivering $2.65 billion on the top line. Given the challenging comps from Q2 last year, this exceeded our internal forecast and guidance. We processed $86.2 billion in total payment volume, an increase of 29%; and our merchant services volume expanded 36%; our mobile payments volumes continues to accelerate, up 56% this quarter, accelerating for the third straight quarter; and we had a record of over $24 billion in mobile TPV in the quarter.
In the last 12 months, we've added 19 million net active accounts finishing the quarter with 188 million customer accounts transacting on the PayPal platform. And even as we add new active accounts, our transactions per account continue to expand, reaching 29 this quarter, up from 26 a year ago. We generated $495 million of free cash flow in the quarter, giving our business tremendous flexibility to continue to reinvest in our growth.
In the first 6 months of 2016, we produced $1.1 billion of free cash flow, on track to meet our guidance of more than $2.1 billion for the year. And finally, we delivered $0.36 of non-GAAP EPS versus our guidance of $0.34 to $0.36. I'm proud of the PayPal team and they worked hard to deliver these strong results.
I'd like to now spend some time talking about the partnership announcement we made today with Visa and the progress we are making towards enabling our strategy of being a true customer champion. Being a customer champion company is not just words for us. In order to be a great company over the long term, we need to provide the very best experience for our customers. We believe that means giving our customers both choice and optionality in where they want to pay and how they want to pay. This change in our business model positions us to better serve our customers, and it's fundamental to the long-term growth and success of PayPal.
While we expect this to drive incremental expense, we now have evidence to support the assertion that customer choice will benefit both our business model and our customers over the medium term. Our improved onboarding experience, which we began rolling out last quarter, gives customers more choice when opening a PayPal account and has already resulted in lifting our activations. In the coming quarters, we will be rolling out account settings and checkout experiences that also deliver enhanced customer choice. We believe these new experiences will result in improved engagement and a reduction in customer churn, all very good things for both our customers and for PayPal.
But we are already seeing another significant benefit. By making customer choice a priority for PayPal, we are opening up new opportunities for partnerships within our ecosystem. Today, PayPal and Visa announced a strategic partnership to further expand our long-standing relationship. This agreement will allow both companies to offer greater choice to merchants and consumers and increase the value to Visa issuers and PayPal customers. The benefits of this partnership include our ability to gain access to Visa's tokenization services starting in the United States for in-store PayPal transactions. This will allow customers to pay with their Visa instruments in the PayPal wallet at the millions of retail locations where they see the Visa contactless logo. Importantly, retailers can expect to pay fees that are consistent with other contactless transactions they accept today. We will provide greater accessibility for Visa payment instruments in the PayPal digital wallet. PayPal will also provide Visa, their issuers and their cardholders additional visibility into each Visa funded transaction, providing greater transparency and enhancing payment system security.
The agreement affords PayPal certain economic incentives, including Visa incentives for increased volume and greater long-term Visa fee certainty and removes the threat of any targeted pricing actions. This deal has the potential to be transformative for PayPal, Visa and the industry. We believe it provides us the flexibility and the capability to execute against our customer champion vision, to partner with issuers and others who share our vision and to accelerate PayPal's in-store access in new and profitable ways.
We also believe it provides more options for growth and the ability to partner with others to mutually cross-sell our various current and projected services to consumers and merchants around the world. All of these will take some time to come to fruition but this agreement opens up a new chapter for PayPal.
Giving customers choice in how and where they want to pay provides a pathway over the long term from our goal of 2 transactions a week from our current engagement of just over 2 per month. It's also important to say that we welcome the opportunity to work with more partners like Visa who share our vision, and we are in discussions with a variety of players in our ecosystem.
This is a new PayPal, one that this actively partnering across the digital image landscape. For example, in the quarter, we also expanded the European rollout of the Vodafone wallet we talked about last quarter. Consumers in Spain and Italy can now tap in paying in stores with PayPal and Visa, another example of how PayPal is opening our platform to a slew of new partnerships. Our partnership with Facebook continues to expand, as to our efforts with Google, Pinterest, Alibaba and eBay.
I'm pleased with the quarter's results but we still have much to execute through the back half of the year. We need to continually innovate and deepen customer engagement in order to maintain and further widen the distance between our value proposition and that of our competition.
And in keeping with that focus, Q2 saw a significant progress in consumer and merchant engagement on the PayPal platform. We are making steady strides in our efforts to become an everyday essential financial service for underserved customers.
In the second quarter, transactions per account increased to 29, and we processed 1.4 trillion transactions, a new milestone for PayPal and an increase of 25% from the same period last year. 
Deepening consumer engagement is no accident. It is driven by our innovative products and an increasingly robust platform, designed with our customers and their needs in mind. Our aim is to deliver transformative products that make payments easier, faster, more reliable and more secure online, in-mobile, in-app and in-store. One Touch, our contextual commerce services; Venmo; and Xoom are all perfect examples of this.
One Touch is the most rapidly adopted product in PayPal's history. As of the second quarter, over 25 million consumers have opted into One Touch, and I'm pleased to say that we now have over 2 million merchants offering this innovative way to pay. With a market-leading 87% conversion rate, we continue to see increased engagement and conversion with the use of One Touch.
We are continuing to invest and innovate in contextual commerce. Last year, Pinterest launched its first foray into buyable buttons. Braintree powered 80% of the Pinterest-launched merchants. Building on this infrastructure, we are now powering Pinterest new shopping bag functionality that lets shoppers pick items from across the web, collect them in a shopping cart and make a single purchase. This brings over 10 million unique products to Pinterest for an richer and more convenient in-context shopping experience.
And Venmo continued its rapid growth. In the quarter, Venmo processed almost $4 billion in P2P payments, an increase of 141% year-over-year. We are very focused in making steady progress with our Pay with Venmo product. We have added 8 more next-generation apps beyond Munchery and Gametime. These include Parking Panda, Priv, Wish, Boxed, Hop Market and Poshmark. We have also further expanded the Venmo pilot from 1 million to 3.5 million Venmo users. We expect to add many more merchants in all of the Venmo consumer base later this year.
Xoom's U.S. customers can now send money to loved ones in 53 countries and it continues to redefine global remittances through mobile technology, ending the quarter with more than 70% of transactions originating on a mobile device. We continue to see the benefits of our integration efforts with Xoom adding more than double the number of net new actives this quarter versus a year ago. I'm pleased to say we are executing on our acquisition business case, and I have high hopes to what Xoom can offer to PayPal consumers in the years ahead.
All of these innovative new experiences are driving PayPal's leadership in mobile payments. As I mentioned, PayPal processed over 24 billion in mobile payment volume, an increase of 56% year-over-year and mobile now represents 28% of our total payment volume, up from 26% in the first quarter.
Mobile is arguably the most competitive arena in the digital payment ecosystem and PayPal continues to widen its suite and gain share. 2 quarters ago, We grew our mobile volumes 45% year-over-year. Last quarter, 54%. And despite a substantially increased base of mobile transactions, we grew 56% this quarter. We also continue to make substantial progress in acquiring new merchants and now have more than 14.5 million merchants transacting on our platform. Our increasing ability to providing suites of innovative services for merchants is not only accelerating our competitive differentiation but enabling us a enabling us to be seen as a true, full services payments partner.
PayPal's merchant services payment volume was $71.3 billion in the quarter, increasing 36%. Leading merchants continue to choose PayPal, including IKEA in multiple countries, the world's leading cruise brand of Carnival Corporation, including Carnival Cruise Lines, Princess Cruises, -- American Line and Seaborne; Russia's VKontakte, Europe's largest social media network with 360 million users; women's fashion brand, Talbot's; Cathay Pacific; and Eventbrite, the world's largest self-service ticketing platform has now launched with Braintree full-stack processing. And Braintree continues to gain momentum rapidly adding new merchants, ending the quarter with 309 million cards on file, an increase of 101% from the same period a year ago.
Finally, PayPal Working Capital continues to be an important way we engage our small business merchants to support their growth. In Q2, we exceeded 2 billion in originations since our launch. We've now funded more than 90,000 small business merchants in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Our working capital merchants see an almost $0.50 increase in payment volume for every dollar of working capital extended to them by PayPal. Clearly, a powerful tool for our merchants.
Finally, I'd like to mention a few accolades we've recently received that highlight the strong progress we've made in the past year as an independent company. First, our financial performance has earned us a place on the Fortune 500 list at #307. Importantly, we are now being recognized for our leadership in innovation. Recently, InformationWeek named PayPal the #11 company in the country in terms of technology innovation. And the value of our brand is also on the rise. The Financial Times recently came out with the Brands -- listing of the top 100 most valuable global brands. PayPal was one of the top 10 brands that increased its value the most in 2016, gaining 35% and rising from #88 to the 65th most valuable brand across the globe. And finally, and perhaps most meaningfully to many of us, consumers in the United States recently ranked 180 top brands across the world in terms of social impact and doing the most good in the world. PayPal was ranked among the top 5 companies across the globe.
We've made strong progress in the 12 months since becoming public. We have a lot of work ahead of us but the opportunities are coming into sharper focus and are now clearly within our reach. We remain focused on executing with both discipline and excellence for our customers and for our shareholders.
I'd like to now turn the call over to John. John?"

I also want to thank all of PayPal's customers and our employees worldwide for making this another great quarter. Q2 marks another quarter where we advanced our goal of becoming a central part of our customers' daily financial lives, strength",1792,"Thanks, Dan. I also want to thank all of PayPal's customers and our employees worldwide for making this another great quarter. Q2 marks another quarter where we advanced our goal of becoming a central part of our customers' daily financial lives, strengthened our position in the ecosystem and enhanced our value proposition as a customer champion company. First, I will walk you through the highlights for our second quarter results.
On a currency-neutral basis, total payment volume was $86.2 billion, an increase of 29%. U.S. payment volume grew 27% and international volume grew 31%. Our merchant services business grew 36%, demonstrating that our strategy of being a customer champion and moving from being a payment button to an end-to-end payment solution for merchants of all sizes continues to gain traction.
We ended the quarter with 188 million active accounts, an 11% increase from a year ago. Account growth was predominantly driven by our PayPal forward offering, followed by Venmo. The number of payment transactions per account increased to 29, up 13% year-over-year and an acceleration from the first quarter. This, when combined with the increase in active accounts, contributed to payment transaction growth of 25% year-over-year.
In the second quarter, we generated revenue of $2.65 billion, up 19.5% on a currency-neutral basis and 15.6% on a spot basis. Q2 revenue exceeded our expectations as a result of strong performance in our core business and Braintree. In the second quarter, we faced difficult year-over-year comparisons from the amendment of our Synchrony and cobranded credit card agreement and the sale of a portion of our credit receivables portfolio last year, as well as a larger currency hedging gains in Q2 '15. We are pleased with our very strong top line performance and our ability to offset these year-over-year pressures.
Transaction revenue increased 23% on a currency-neutral basis in the quarter, an acceleration from the first quarter. Performance was driven by large merchant growth in our core business and strength in the Braintree business. This resulted in a transaction take rate of 2.69% for the second quarter, a decline of 22 basis points year-over-year. The decline was primarily driven by lower currency hedged revenue in the quarter versus last year, the growth of our P2P business, including Venmo; and the mix shifts towards Braintree and larger business. Revenue from Other Value Added Services was flat versus last year, driven by the amendment of our Synchrony agreement and the sale of our credit receivables in Q2 of last year, offset by solid results from our credit products.
Transaction expense and transaction and loan losses on our volume-based expenses, increased 28%, in line with total payment volume growth. This resulted in a transaction margin of 59.8% versus 63.8% in Q2 '15. In the quarter on a year-over-year basis, the transaction decline was driven primarily by strong performance from Braintree which had a lower take rate and higher transaction expense, the lapping of the amended Synchrony agreement and the sale of a portion of our credit receivables and the high margin hedged revenue recognized in Q2 '15.
Other expenses grew 10%, well below revenue growth, and drove 185 basis points of leverage. Excluding the acquisition of Xoom, our other expenses increased approximately 7% demonstrating good cost control.
We continue to be focused on strong expense discipline. The scale of our platform allows us to carefully manage the growth of these other expenses, even as our revenue grew nearly 20% on a currency-neutral basis. We continue to see opportunity to manage these costs over time.
We delivered operating income of $528 million in the second quarter. For the first half of 2016, operating income increased 10% to $1.1 billion. Operating margin for the second quarter was 19.9%, a decline from last year, predominantly driven by the items I already mentioned affecting revenue: the amendment of our Synchrony agreement of the sale of our credit receivables, both of which dropped directly to the bottom line. We were also impacted by the acquisition of Xoom, which was approximately 40 basis points. By excluding these items, operating margin would have expanded approximately 100 basis points year-over-year.
We generated not GAAP EPS of $0.36 per share for the quarter, the top end of our guidance range. For the first half of 2016, non-GAAP earnings per share increased 19% to $0.73.
Second quarter capital expenditures were $201 million or approximately 8% of revenue. Free cash flow in the second quarter was $495 million, representing $0.19 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue.
During the quarter, we also returned approximately $300 million to shareholders by buying back an additional 8 million shares. Year-to-date, we have returned approximately $900 million to shareholders, repurchasing 25 million shares at an average price of $36.34. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $6.2 billion, including approximately $1.3 billion in the U.S.
I want to take a few -- make a few comments regarding the U.K. to vote leave the European Union. First, we should acknowledge that we are in the very early days and exactly what happens to Europe will take some time to unfold. Europe generally and the U.K. specifically are very important parts of our business that we will continue to serve. In the second quarter, approximately 12% of our revenue was generated in the U.K. Because of the global nature of our business, we typically see a counterbalance effect when any one currency measurably weakens or strengthens. This is particularly pronounced in certain quarters whereas like the U.S. and Canada and the U.K. and the EU due to proximity and consumers' awareness of currency shifts. In the medium-term, we are obviously going to keep a close eye on the broader economic environment and any effect on customer behavior.
From a foreign currency standpoint, the euro and the pound are the 2 currencies where we have the most exposure. For that reason, we hedged both currencies, and our exposure from a translation us perspective in 2016 is minimal. Importantly, EU business is operated through our Luxembourg Bank, where we are allowed to passport our banking license among the EU member states. The U.K.'s decision to exit the EU will have some impact on the regulatory framework under which we operate. We are then assessing the ramifications of the leave vote since the referendum was announced. And once we have better clarity on how the relationship between the U.K. and the EU with respect to financial services will be governed, we will take the necessary steps to be able to continue to serve our customers in the capacity that we do today.
Now, I'd like to give you an update on our credit portfolio. Our credit product supports and complements our platform, enhancing our digital payments offering for both our consumers and our merchants. Credit drives a positive network effects of our business, increasing volume and engagement on our platform. Credit represents approximately 2% of our TPV and in the medium term, we expect the TPV contribution from our credit products to remain around this level. In addition, as we've said previously, we continue to assess asset-light strategies to fund and grow our credit offering.
The performance of our credit portfolio continues to be in line with our expectations. In the second quarter, we saw improvement in our delinquency rates and most of other credit quality metrics. We have, however, experienced a higher percentage of our late-stage delinquent consumer credit balances rolling to charge-off. This has resulted in a charge-off rate of 6.3% versus 6.1% last quarter. We attribute the increased charge-off to changes in our own collections efforts that were recently instituted. We've taken steps to address this impact the back half of this year.
As Dan mentioned, our agreement with Visa and more broadly, our strategic decision to invest in customer choice, is a great opportunity for our customers, our shareholders and other partners in the payments ecosystem. This partnership will help drive the digitization of payments, both in-mobile and in-store. Much has been made about the blurring of the off-line and online world through digital payments. The agreement with Visa is an important step, allowing us to more fully participate in this powerful secular shift with our mobile-first strategy, complemented by the Visa's in-store strengths. We have an expansive vision for PayPal, including being everyday part of our customers' financial lives. Customer choice, as we refer to it, involves empowering our customers to use PayPal where they want to pay and how they want to pay, and is the vehicle for achieving that vision.
For the remainder of 2016, we do not anticipate any material impact to our results from a movement of choice. Beginning next year, we expect the changes to our funding mix from customer choice will increase transaction expense, but at the same time, we believe expanding customer choice will unlock future revenue opportunities.
Moving to customer choice and our agreement with Visa, laid the foundation for sustainable revenue growth, with more certainty in our cost structure. It's very early on and we're only 6 months through the year. As we get closer to year-end, we will provide more detail on the impact of this and how it affects our 2017 performance.
Finally, I'd like to discuss our financial guidance for the third quarter and full year. Our strong performance in the first half of the year across our core business, Braintree and P2P, in addition to our growing mobile penetration, further validates our strategies and our business priorities. As a result, we are raising our full year 2016 revenue guidance to $10.75 billion to $10.85 billion or 19% to 20% growth on a currency-neutral basis. We are also narrowing the non-GAAP earnings range to $1.47 to $1.50 per share, representing growth of 18% at the high end of the range. And we are reaffirming our full year prior 2016 guidance on free cash flow CapEx and non-GAAP effective tax rate.
For the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $2.6 billion to $2.67 billion or 19% to 21% growth on a currency-neutral basis. And we expect non-GAAP earnings of $0.33 to $0.35 per share.
In conclusion, our second quarter results demonstrate the continued progress we are making in our business. Revenue is strong and we are combining that with excellent cost control to generate healthy margins and strong free cash flow. We continue to allocate capital in a way that generate shareholder value. And our partnership with Visa has removed an overhang on our business, giving us greater cost certainty going forward, allowing us to possibly participate in the off-line market and creating the foundation for being a customer champion.
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions. Thank you."

So we're very excited about the partnership with Visa. I think it's very important to understand that, I think as Charlie said on the Visa call, partnerships like the one we announced today work best when there'",640,"Hey, this is Dan. Thanks for your question. So we're very excited about the partnership with Visa. I think it's very important to understand that, I think as Charlie said on the Visa call, partnerships like the one we announced today work best when there's alignment for everyone. And we believe that we've designed an agreement that works for PayPal, Visa and the issuers. We have been in discussion with issuers, visa has been in discussion with its issuers and they're excited about the benefit from the volumes that we can bring to them and that we can bring to point-of-sale. And as Charlie pointed out, this agreement removes many of the concerns about all of the concerns that issuers and others in the ecosystem has about working with PayPal. Choice is something that everybody has been talking about. What issuers want, what we want is the ability for a consumer to make a choice, to have options as to what payment tender type they want to pay with. What that basically means is that a consumer could pay for their credit, with ACH, with debit, with cash, with P2P, with PayPal Credit, any of those, but it's the option of the consumer to make that choice. And then when you add on top of that optionality the fact that we are very willing and happy to share the same source of data that somebody will get with a typical credit card swipe back to the networks, back to the issuers and to customers, that's exactly what issuers have been asking for. We actually think that this deal that we have with Visa offers a couple of benefits. Obviously it offers access to tokens at rates that are comparable to other contactless methods out there, and so we can compete with anybody now at point-of-sale. There's no competitive disadvantage to anybody else out there and we can go off-line profitably. Second, we get fee certainty, as we talked about, targeting -- targeted actions against PayPal limits on new fees, even industry-based fees and volume-based discounts. So we have certainty around our cost structure. And very importantly, I think this opens us up to new partnerships. New partnerships with issuers, networks and others. Choice and data turn us into their friends. And when I think about the partnerships that we have, we're an ideal distribution mechanism to drive more online and mobile spend to issuers. They're an ideal partner to drive incremental net adds in customers into the PayPal platform. That's a win-win for both of us. And this is going to open up a new chapter for PayPal to partner with and for all of us to work together to advance digital payments going forward. And as I mentioned in my remarks and John mentioned, a choice also is going to help us drive incremental new net adds. We're already seeing that in some of the changes we've made to our onboarding. When you look at One Touch and you see what our customers do when they're able to default a payment mechanism, their engagement goes up, their conversion rates go up. And obviously, when a customer gets to choose what instrument they want, we're going to see less calls coming to customer care for us, we're going to see customer satisfaction go up, and typically, when that happens, customer churn goes down. So we think this is a very strong agreement that benefits Visa, its issuers and us, allows us to work within the ecosystem. And the issuers don't need to sign any unique agreements with us. It's simply an opt-in to participate with us. It's no additional work for them. And our movement to choice, data sharing plus our commitment to quality, I think, puts us on par with others that are using Visa tokens in the ecosystem."

If you consider we have just rough order of magnitude $300 billion of TPV today. And if you were to look at funding shift on that, that would overstate the effect of fund and shift. Because this agreement, for now, is U.S.-only and as we disclosed in the past, that's roughly half of our TPV. We also see differences in funding mix between P2P versus goods and services, so you've got to strip that out or at least treat that differently. And we disclosed earlier this year that P2P is roughly $40 billion of our annual TPV. And then lastly, you need to also consider that there's a large percentage of our customers today that only have a card in their wallet. So choice for them would -- there'd be no other increase in cost by moving -- by adding additional card or doing different cards. So from a cost side, that's the right framework to think about this."

But you're right, it just takes some time for this to be implemented and to move forward. And so our guidance incorporates any impact that there may be from customer choice. And as John mentioned, we will wait until we get closer to 2017 to give 2017 guidance. First of all, obviously, we'll take a look at consumer behavior as a result of this. There are a number of discussions going on in the ecosystem and we want to look at the totality of the landscape before we really talk about what 2017 could look like. And finally, we're halfway through the year you got a full -- another 6 months to execute against and let's see how our momentum takes us before we provide 2017 guidance. And on the merchant side. Merchants have been working with this quite closely as we're creating a platform for them to take advantage of digital commerce. And that basically means letting a merchant write their own application, and we power that application through a platform that enables them to extend a value proposition to their customers online, on mobile and in-store. And part of that in-store environment when it comes to the PayPal wallet, we did not have tokenization scheme. We used different forms of that. And so from a merchant perspective, the rates now that we can offer on an in-store point-of-sale transaction are significantly more competitive for them. And so it just strengthens our position in terms of working with merchants. No change in our strategy. But it certainly strengthens it and opens up a wider opportunity for us as we talk about the blurring of online and off-line coming together, this really opens up our ability to move into any context, whether it be online, in-app or in-store with our digital wallet."

So when you think about the piece parts that we've started to put together, we had PayPal that was obviously very strong in the online market, Braintree extremely strong in the mobile and in-app marketplace and Paydiant, very strong in the in-store environment. And so all of those are now coming together and being integrated so that we can offer merchants the ability to look across any of this context and use our platform to power and enable their move to digital commerce. Then what we've done, obviously, is because our base is so large, we take our branded PayPal wallet, which now is available to go into more context, as I've just mentioned, and write up those applications because we have so many subscribers that we can bring to those merchants. And so you've got a platform plane that's really unbranded that supports a merchant's move into digital commerce and then a branded wallet. And this helps us with our branded wallet to move into that off-line space.

Where there's perhaps an upfront cost but there's a revenue stream that more than offsets that where it's very accretive to the business. With respect to the increase in transaction expense, we'll give more specific guidance as we get towards the end of the year about 2017. But when you look at both the revenue benefit, as well as the good demonstrated cost control that you are seeing for several quarters now, and just look at the over 180 basis points of leverage this quarter, the fact that our operating expenses, if you normalized for the Xoom acquisition, it only went up 7% a quarter, we can continue to demonstrate that we have a laser focus on discipline here, while still not starving the business for investment as well. We're making sure that we continue to invest organically. So all that in combination gives us a level of comfort with this but it's absolutely the right thing to do for the business.

I'm pleased to say we had another strong quarter, with our financial results at the high end of our guidance and, in many cases, exceeding our own expectations. A",2255,"Thanks, Gabrielle. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. I'm pleased to say we had another strong quarter, with our financial results at the high end of our guidance and, in many cases, exceeding our own expectations. And, of course, we announced earlier a multiyear partnership with Visa. But before I discuss our results, I'd like to point out that it's been one year since PayPal became a publicly traded company for the second time. In many ways, our listing last year was a full circle moment for PayPal. It allowed us to return to the core mission of our founders, the mission they were pursuing when they took PayPal public in 2002. Even with the Internet in its infancy, they saw the opportunity for technology to democratize money.
Today, our purpose is the same, but our opportunity is much greater with the digitization of money accelerating and the adoption of mobile devices continuing its rapid pace globally. PayPal's total addressable market has grown to include all of digital commerce and digital money, a $100 trillion opportunity. Today's announcement with Visa brings us closer to capitalizing on that opportunity.
The mission of PayPal is clear, we're striving to become an everyday essential financial service for underserved customers. And for our merchants, we want to provide a full-service solution and platform that enables digital commerce.
We are making tangible and consistent progress towards achieving these twin goals while consistently delivering strong financial performance. I'm proud that Q2 was another strong quarter for PayPal, both financially and strategically. Our partnership with Visa will help drive consumer choice and provide enhanced value to the larger payment ecosystem. But first, let's look at the financial metrics we delivered this quarter.
We grew revenue at 19.5%, delivering $2.65 billion on the top line. Given the challenging comps from Q2 last year, this exceeded our internal forecast and guidance. We processed $86.2 billion in total payment volume, an increase of 29%; and our merchant services volume expanded 36%. Our mobile payments volumes continues to accelerate, up 56% this quarter, accelerating for the third straight quarter; and we hit a record of over $24 billion in mobile TPV in the quarter.
In the last 12 months, we've added 19 million net active accounts, finishing the quarter with 188 million customer accounts transacting on the PayPal platform. And even as we add new active accounts, our transactions per account continue to expand, reaching 29 this quarter, up from 26 a year ago. We generated $495 million of free cash flow in the quarter, giving our business tremendous flexibility to continue to reinvest in our growth.
In the first 6 months of 2016, we produced $1.1 billion of free cash flow, on track to meet our guidance of more than $2.1 billion for the year. And finally, we delivered $0.36 of non-GAAP EPS versus our guidance of $0.34 to $0.36. I'm proud of the PayPal team and they worked hard to deliver these strong results.
I'd like to now spend some time talking about the partnership announcement we made today with Visa and the progress we are making towards enabling our strategy of being a true customer champion. Being a customer champion company is not just words for us. In order to be a great company over the long term, we need to provide the very best experience for our customers. We believe that means giving our customers both choice and optionality in where they want to pay and how they want to pay. This change in our business model positions us to better serve our customers, and it's fundamental to the long-term growth and success of PayPal.
While we expect this to drive incremental expense, we now have evidence to support the assertion that customer choice will benefit both our business model and our customers over the medium term. Our improved onboarding experience, which we began rolling out last quarter, gives customers more choice when opening a PayPal account and has already resulted in lifting our activations. In the coming quarters, we will be rolling out account setting and checkout experiences that also deliver enhanced customer choice. We believe these new experiences will result in improved engagement and a reduction in customer churn, all very good things for both our customers and for PayPal.
But we are already seeing another significant benefit. By making customer choice a priority for PayPal, we are opening up new opportunities for partnerships within our ecosystem. Today, PayPal and Visa announced a strategic partnership to further expand our long-standing relationship. This agreement will allow both companies to offer greater choice to merchants and consumers and increase the value to Visa issuers and PayPal customers.
The benefits of this partnership include our ability to gain access to Visa's tokenization services starting in the United States for in-store PayPal transactions. This will allow customers to pay with their Visa instruments in the PayPal wallet at the millions of retail locations where they see the Visa contactless logo. Importantly, retailers can expect to pay fees that are consistent with other contactless transactions they accept today. We will provide greater accessibility for Visa payment instruments in the PayPal digital wallet. PayPal will also provide Visa, their issuers and their cardholders additional visibility into each Visa-funded transaction, providing greater transparency and enhancing payment system security.
The agreement affords PayPal certain economic incentives, including Visa incentives for increased volume and greater long-term Visa fee certainty and removes the threat of any targeted pricing actions. This deal has the potential to be transformative for PayPal, Visa and the industry. We believe it provides us the flexibility and the capability to execute against our customer champion vision, to partner with issuers and others who share our vision and to accelerate PayPal's in-store access in new and profitable ways.
We also believe it provides more options for growth and the ability to partner with others to mutually cross-sell our various current and projected services to consumers and merchants around the world. All of these will take some time to come to fruition but this agreement opens up a new chapter for PayPal.
Giving customers choice in how and where they want to pay provides a pathway over the long term from our goal of 2 transactions a week from our current engagement of just over 2 per month. It's also important to say that we welcome the opportunity to work with more partners like Visa who share our vision, and we are in discussions with a variety of players in our ecosystem.
This is a new PayPal, one that is actively partnering across the digital image landscape. For example, in the quarter, we also expanded the European rollout of the Vodafone wallet we talked about last quarter. Consumers in Spain and Italy can now tap in paying stores with PayPal and Visa, another example of how PayPal is opening our platform to a slew of new partnerships. Our partnership with Facebook continues to expand, as do our efforts with Google, Pinterest, Alibaba and eBay.
I'm pleased with the quarter's results but we still have much to execute through the back half of the year. We need to continually innovate and deepen customer engagement in order to maintain and further widen the distance between our value proposition and that of our competition. And in keeping with that focus, Q2 saw a significant progress in consumer and merchant engagement on the PayPal platform. We are making steady strides in our efforts to become an everyday essential financial service for underserved customers.
In the second quarter, transactions per account increased to 29, and we processed 1.4 billion transactions, a new milestone for PayPal, and an increase of 25% from the same period last year.
Deepening consumer engagement is no accident. It is driven by our innovative products and an increasingly robust platform, designed with our customers and their needs in mind. Our aim is to deliver transformative products that make payments easier, faster, more reliable and more secure online, in-mobile, in-app and in-store. One Touch, our contextual commerce services; Venmo; and Xoom are all perfect examples of this.
One Touch is the most rapidly adopted product in PayPal's history. As of the second quarter, over 25 million consumers have opted into One Touch, and I'm pleased to say that we now have over 2 million merchants offering this innovative way to pay. With a market-leading 87% conversion rate, we continue to see increased engagement and conversion with the use of One Touch.
We are continuing to invest and innovate in contextual commerce. Last year, Pinterest launched its first foray into buyable buttons. Braintree powered 80% of the Pinterest-launched merchants. Building on this infrastructure, we are now powering Pinterest's new shopping bag functionality that lets shoppers pick items from across the web, collect them in a shopping cart and make a single purchase. This brings over 10 million unique products to Pinterest for an even richer and more convenient in-context shopping experience.
And Venmo continued its rapid growth. In the quarter, Venmo processed almost $4 billion in P2P payments, an increase of 141% year-over-year. We are very focused in making steady progress with our Pay with Venmo pilot. We have added 8 more next-generation apps beyond Munchery and Gametime. These include Parking Panda, PRIV, Wish, Boxed, Hop Market and Poshmark. We have also further expanded the Venmo pilot from 1 million to 3.5 million Venmo users. We expect to add many more merchants in all of the Venmo consumer base later this year.
Xoom's U.S. customers can now send money to loved ones in 53 countries, and it continues to redefine global remittances through mobile technology, ending the quarter with more than 70% of transactions originating on a mobile device. We continue to see the benefits of our integration efforts with Xoom adding more than double the number of net new actives this quarter versus a year ago. I'm pleased to say we are executing on our acquisition business case, and I have high hopes to what Xoom can offer to PayPal consumers in the years ahead.
All of these innovative new experiences are driving PayPal's leadership in mobile payments. As I mentioned, PayPal processed over 24 billion in mobile payment volume, an increase of 56% year-over-year, and mobile now represents 28% of our total payment volume, up from 26% in the first quarter.
Mobile is arguably the most competitive arena in the digital payments ecosystem and PayPal continues to widen its lead and gain share. Two quarters ago, we grew our mobile volumes 45% year-over-year. Last quarter, 54%. And despite a substantially increased base of mobile transactions, we grew 56% this quarter. We also continue to make substantial progress in acquiring new merchants and now have more than 14.5 million merchants transacting on our platform. Our increasing ability in providing suites of innovative services for merchants is not only accelerating our competitive differentiation but enabling us to be seen as a true full services payments partner.
PayPal's merchant services payment volume was $71.3 billion in the quarter, increasing 36%. Leading merchants continue to choose PayPal, including IKEA in multiple countries; the world's leading cruise brands of Carnival Corporation, including Carnival Cruise Lines, Princess Cruises, Holland America Line and Seabourn; Russia's VKontakte; Europe's largest social media network with 360 million users; women's fashion brand, TALBOTS; Cathay Pacific; and Eventbrite, the world's largest self-service ticketing platform, has now launched with Braintree full-stack processing. And Braintree continues to gain momentum rapidly adding new merchants, ending the quarter with 309 million cards on file, an increase of 101% from the same period a year ago.
Finally, PayPal Working Capital continues to be an important way we engage our small business merchants and support their growth. In Q2, we exceeded 2 billion in originations since our launch. We've now funded more than 90,000 small business merchants in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Our working capital merchants see an almost $0.50 increase in payment volume for every dollar of working capital extended to them by PayPal. Clearly, a powerful tool for our merchants.
Finally, I'd like to mention a few accolades we've recently received that highlight the strong progress we've made in the past year as an independent company. First, our financial performance has earned us a place on the Fortune 500 list at #307. Importantly, we are now being recognized for our leadership in innovation. Recently, InformationWeek named PayPal the #11 company in the country in terms of technology innovation. And the value of our brand is also on the rise. The Financial Times recently came out with the BrandZ listing of the top 100 most valuable global brands. PayPal was one of the top 10 brands that increased its value most in 2016, gaining 35%, and rising from #88 to the 65th most valuable brand across the globe. And finally, and perhaps most meaningfully to many of us, consumers in the United States recently ranked 180 top brands across the world in terms of social impact and doing the most good in the world. PayPal was ranked among the top 5 companies across the globe.
We've made strong progress in the 12 months since becoming public. We have a lot of work ahead of us but the opportunities are coming into sharper focus and are now clearly within our reach. We remain focused on executing with both discipline and excellence for our customers and for our shareholders.
I'd like to now turn the call over to John. John?"

I also want to thank all of PayPal's customers and our employees worldwide for making this another great quarter.

I also want to thank all of PayPal's customers and our employees worldwide for making this another great quarter. Q2 marks another quarter where we advanced our goal of becoming a central part of our customers' daily financial lives, strengthened our position in the ecosystem and enhanced our value proposition as a customer champion company. First, I will walk you through the highlights of our second quarter results.
On a currency-neutral basis, total payment volume was $86.2 billion, an increase of 29%. U.S. payment volume grew 27% and international volume grew 31%. Our merchant services business grew 36%, demonstrating that our strategy of being a customer champion and moving from being a payment button to an end-to-end payment solution for merchants of all sizes, continues to gain traction.
We ended the quarter with 188 million active accounts, an 11% increase from a year ago. Account growth was predominantly driven by our PayPal forward offering, followed by Venmo. The number of payment transactions per account increased to 29, up 13% year-over-year and an acceleration from the first quarter. This, when combined with the increase in active accounts, contributed to payment transaction growth of 25% year-over-year.
In the second quarter, we generated revenue of $2.65 billion, up 19.5% on a currency-neutral basis and 15.6% on a spot basis. Q2 revenue exceeded our expectations as a result of strong performance in our core business and Braintree. In the second quarter, we faced difficult year-over-year comparisons from the amendment of our Synchrony co-branded credit card agreement and the sale of a portion of our credit receivables portfolio last year, as well as a larger currency hedging gains in Q2 '15. We are pleased with our very strong top line performance and our ability to offset these year-over-year pressures.
Transaction revenue increased 23% on a currency-neutral basis in the quarter, an acceleration from the first quarter. Performance was driven by large merchant growth in our core business and strength in the Braintree business. This resulted in a transaction take rate of 2.69% for the second quarter, a decline of 22 basis points year-over-year. The decline was primarily driven by lower currency hedging revenue in the quarter versus last year; the growth of our P2P business, including Venmo; and the mix shift towards Braintree and larger merchants. Revenue from Other Value Added Services was flat versus last year, driven by the amendment of our Synchrony agreement and the sale of our credit receivables in Q2 of last year, offset by solid results from our credit products.
Transaction expense and transaction and loan losses, our volume-based expenses, increased 28%, in line with total payment volume growth. This resulted in a transaction margin of 59.8% versus 63.8% in Q2 '15. In the quarter on a year-over-year basis, the transaction margin decline was driven primarily by strong performance from Braintree, which had a lower take rate and higher transaction expense; the lapping of the amended Synchrony agreement and the sale of a portion of our credit receivables; and the high-margin hedge revenue recognized in Q2 '15.
Other expenses grew 10%, well below revenue growth, and drove 185 basis points of leverage. Excluding the acquisition of Xoom, our other expenses increased approximately 7%, demonstrating good cost control. We continue to be focused on strong expense discipline. The scale of our platform allows us to carefully manage the growth of these other expenses, even as our revenue grew nearly 20% on a currency-neutral basis. We continue to see opportunity to manage these costs over time.
We delivered operating income of $528 million in the second quarter. For the first half of 2016, operating income increased 10% to $1.1 billion. Operating margin for the second quarter was 19.9%, a decline from last year, predominantly driven by the items I already mentioned affecting revenue: the amendment of our Synchrony agreement of the sale of our credit receivables, both of which dropped directly to the bottom line. We were also impacted by the acquisition of Xoom, which was approximately 40 basis points. But excluding these items, operating margin would have expanded approximately 100 basis points year-over-year.
We generated not GAAP EPS of $0.36 per share for the quarter, the top end of our guidance range. For the first half of 2016, non-GAAP earnings per share increased 19% to $0.73.
Second quarter capital expenditures were $201 million or approximately 8% of revenue. Free cash flow in the second quarter was $495 million, representing $0.19 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue.
During the quarter, we also returned approximately $300 million to shareholders by buying back an additional 8 million shares. Year-to-date, we have returned approximately $900 million to shareholders, repurchasing 25 million shares at an average price of $36.34. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $6.2 billion, including approximately $1.3 billion in the U.S.
I want to take a few -- make a few comments regarding the U.K. vote to leave the European Union. First, we should acknowledge that we are in the very early days and exactly what happens from here will take some time to unfold. Europe generally and the U.K. specifically are very important parts of our business that we will continue to serve. In the second quarter, approximately 12% of our revenue was generated in the U.K. Because of the global nature of our business, we typically see a counterbalance effect when any one currency measurably weakens or strengthens. This is particularly pronounced in certain corridors like the U.S. and Canada and the U.K. and the EU due to proximity of consumers' awareness of currency shifts. In the medium-term, we are obviously going to keep a close eye on the broader economic environment and any effect on customer behavior.
From a foreign currency standpoint, the euro and the pound are the 2 currencies where we have the most exposure. For that reason, we hedged both currencies, and our exposure from a translation us perspective in 2016 is minimal. Importantly, our EU business is operated through our Luxembourg bank where we are allowed to passport our banking license among the EU member states. The U.K.'s decision to exit the EU will have some impact on the regulatory framework under which we operate. We have been assessing the ramifications of a leave vote since the referendum was announced and once we have better clarity on how the relationship between the U.K. and the EU with respect to financial services will be governed, we will take the necessary steps to be able to continue to serve our customers in the capacity that we do today.
Now, I'd like to give you an update on our credit portfolio. Our credit products support and complement our platform, enhancing our digital payments offering for both our consumers and our merchants. Credit drives a positive network effect for our business, increasing volume and engagement on our platform. Credit represents approximately 2% of our TPV and in the medium term, we expect the TPV contribution from our credit products to remain around this level.
In addition, as we've said previously, we continue to assess asset-light strategies to fund and grow our credit offering. The performance of our credit portfolio continues to be in line with our expectations. In the second quarter, we saw improvement in our delinquency rates and most of other credit quality metrics. We have, however, experienced a higher percentage of our late-stage delinquent consumer credit balances rolling to charge-offs. This has resulted in a charge-off rate of 6.3% versus 6.1% last quarter. We attribute the increased charge-offs to changes in our own collection efforts that were recently instituted. We've taken steps to address this impact in the back half of this year.
As Dan mentioned, our agreement with Visa and more broadly, our strategic decision to invest in customer choice, is a great opportunity for our customers, our shareholders and other partners in the payments ecosystem. This partnership will help drive the digitization of payments, both in-mobile and in-store. Much has been made about the blurring of the off-line and online worlds through digital payments. The agreement with Visa is an important step, allowing us to more fully participate in this powerful secular shift with our mobile-first strategy, complemented by Visa's in-store strengths. We have an expansive vision for PayPal, including being an everyday part of our customers' financial lives. Customer choice, as we refer to it, involves empowering our customers to use PayPal where they want to pay and how they want to pay, and is the vehicle for achieving that vision.
For the remainder of 2016, we do not anticipate any material impact to our results from the movement to choice. Beginning next year, we expect the changes to our funding mix from customer choice will increase transaction expense, but at the same time, we believe expanding customer choice will unlock future revenue opportunities. Moving to customer choice and our agreement with Visa, laid the foundation for sustainable revenue growth, with more certainty in our cost structure. It's very early on and we're only 6 months through the year. As we get closer to year-end, we will provide more detail on the impact of this and how it affects our 2017 performance.
Finally, I'd like to discuss our financial guidance for the third quarter and full year. Our strong performance in the first half of the year across our core business, Braintree and P2P, in addition to our growing mobile penetration, further validates our strategies and our business priorities. As a result, we are raising our full year 2016 revenue guidance to $10.75 billion to $10.85 billion or 19% to 20% growth on a currency-neutral basis. We are also narrowing the non-GAAP earnings range to $1.47 to $1.50 per share, representing growth of 18% at the high end of the range. And we are reaffirming our full year prior 2016 guidance on free cash flow, CapEx and non-GAAP effective tax rate. For the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $2.6 billion to $2.67 billion or 19% to 21% growth on a currency-neutral basis. And we expect non-GAAP earnings of $0.33 to $0.35 per share.
In conclusion, our second quarter results demonstrate the continued progress we are making in our business. Revenue is strong and we're combining that with excellent cost control to generate healthy margins and strong free cash flow. We continue to allocate capital in a way that generate shareholder value. And our partnership with Visa has removed an overhang on our business, giving us greater cost certainty going forward, allowing us to profitably participate in the off-line market and creating the foundation for being a customer champion.
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions. Thank you."

Thanks for your question. So we're very excited about the partnership with Visa. I think it's very important to understand that, I think as Charlie said on the Visa call, partnerships like the one we announced today work best when there's alignment for everyone. And we believe that we've designed an agreement that works for PayPal, Visa and the issuers. We have been in discussions with issuers, Visa has been in discussions with its issuers, and they're excited about the benefit from the volumes that we can bring to them and that we can bring to point-of-sale. And as Charlie pointed out, this agreement removes many of the concerns, if not all of the concerns, that issuers and others in the ecosystem has about working with PayPal. Choice is something that everybody has been talking about. What issuers want, what we want is the ability for a consumer to make a choice, to have options as to what payment tender type they want to pay with. What that basically means is that a consumer could pay with their credit, with ACH, with debit, with cash, with P2P, with PayPal Credit, any of those, but it's the option of the consumer to make that choice. And then when you add on top of that optionality the fact that we are very willing and happy to share the same sorts of data that somebody will get with a typical credit card swipe back to the networks, back to the issuers and to customers, that's exactly what issuers have been asking for. We actually think that this deal that we have with Visa offers a couple of benefits. Obviously, it offers access to tokens at rates that are comparable to other contactless methods out there, and so we can compete with anybody now at point-of-sale. There's no competitive disadvantage to anybody else out there, and we can go off-line profitably. Second, we get fee certainty, as we talked about, know targeting -- targeted actions against PayPal's limits on new fees, even industry-based fees and volume-based discounts. So we have certainty around our cost structure. And very importantly, I think this opens us up to new partnerships. New partnerships with issuers, networks and others. Choice and data turn us into their friends. And when I think about the partnerships that we have, we're an ideal distribution mechanism to drive more online and mobile spend to issuers. They're an ideal partner to drive incremental net adds in customers into the PayPal platform. That's a win-win for both of us. And this is going to open up a new chapter for PayPal to partner with and for all of us to work together to advance digital payments going forward. And as I mentioned in my remarks and John mentioned, choice also is going to help us drive incremental new net adds. We're already seeing that in some of the changes we've made to our onboarding. When you look at One Touch and you see what our customers do when they're able to default a payment mechanism, their engagement goes up, their conversion rates go up. And obviously, when a customer gets to choose what instrument they want, we're going to see less calls come into customer care for us, we're going to see customer satisfaction go up, and typically, when that happens, customer churn goes down. So we think this is a very strong agreement that benefits Visa, its issuers and us, allows us to work within the ecosystem. And the issuers don't need to sign any unique agreements with us. It's simply an opt-in to participate with us. It's no additional work from them. And our movement to choice, data sharing plus our commitment to quality, I think, puts us on par with others that are using Visa tokens in the ecosystem."

If you consider we have just, rough order of magnitude, $300 billion of TPV today. And if you were to look at a funding shift on that, that would overstate the effect of funding shift. Because this agreement, for now, is U.S.-only and as we disclosed in the past, that's roughly half of our TPV. We also see differences in funding mix between P2P versus goods and services, so you've got to strip that out or at least treat that differently. And we disclosed earlier this year that P2P is roughly $40 billion of our annual TPV. And then lastly, you need to also consider that there's a large percentage of our customers today that only have a card in their wallet. So choice for them would -- there'd be no other increase in cost by moving -- by adding additional card, doing a different card. So that -- from the cost side, that's the right framework to think about this."

But you're right, it just takes some time for this to be implemented and to move forward. And so our guidance incorporates any impact that there might be from customer choice. And as John mentioned, we will wait until we get closer to 2017 to give 2017 guidance. First of all, obviously, we'll take a look at consumer behavior as a result of this. There are a number of discussions going on in the ecosystem and we want to look at the totality of the landscape before we really talk about what 2017 could look like. And finally, we're halfway through the year, got a full -- another 6 months to execute against and let's see how our momentum takes us before we provide 2017 guidance. And on the merchant side. Merchants have been working with this quite closely as we're creating a platform for them to take advantage of digital commerce. And that basically means letting a merchant write their own application, and we power that application through a platform that enables them to extend a value proposition to their customers online, on mobile and in-store. And part of that in-store environment, when it comes to the PayPal wallet, we did not have tokenization scheme, we could use different forms of that. And so from a merchant perspective, the rates now that we can offer on an in-store point-of-sale transaction are significantly more competitive for them. And so it just strengthens our position in terms of working with merchants. No change in our strategy, but it certainly strengthens it and it opens up a wide opportunity for us. As we talk about the blurring of online and off-line coming together, this really opens up our ability to move into any context, whether it be online, in-app or in-store with our digital wallet."

And so all of those are now coming together and being integrated so that we can offer merchants the ability to look across any of this context and use our platform to power and enable their move to digital commerce. Then what we've done, obviously, is because our base is so large, we take our branded PayPal wallet, which now is available to go into more context, as I've just mentioned, and light up those applications because we have so many subscribers that we can bring to those merchants. And so you've got a platform play that's really unbranded that supports a merchant's move into digital commerce and then a branded wallet.

With respect to the increase in transaction expense, we'll give more specific guidance as we get towards the end of the year about 2017. But when you look at both the revenue benefit, as well as the good demonstrated cost control that we -- that you've seen for several quarters now, and just look at the over 180 basis points of leverage this quarter, the fact that our operating expenses, if you normalize for the Xoom acquisition, only went up 7% in the quarter, we can continue to demonstrate that we have a laser-focus on discipline here while still not starving the business for investment as well. We're making sure that we're continuing to invest organically. So all that in combination gives us a level of comfort with this but it's absolutely the right thing to do for the business.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. I'm pleased to say we had another strong quarter, with our financial results at the high end of our guidance and, in many cases, exceeding our own expectations. A",2256,"Thanks, Gabrielle. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. I'm pleased to say we had another strong quarter, with our financial results at the high end of our guidance and, in many cases, exceeding our own expectations. And, of course, we announced earlier a multiyear partnership with Visa. 
But before I discuss our results, I'd like to point out that it's been 1 year since PayPal became a publicly traded company for the second time. In many ways, our listing last year was a full circle moment for PayPal. It allowed us to return to the core mission of our founders, the mission they were pursuing when they took PayPal public in 2002. Even with the Internet in its infancy, they saw the opportunity for technology to democratize money.
Today, our purpose is the same, but our opportunity is much greater with the digitization of money accelerating and the adoption of mobile devices continuing its rapid pace globally. PayPal's total addressable market has grown to include all of digital commerce and digital money, a $100 trillion opportunity. Today's announcement with Visa brings us closer to capitalizing on that opportunity.
The mission of PayPal is clear, we're striving to become an everyday essential financial service for underserved customers. And for our merchants, we want to provide a full-service solution and platform that enables digital commerce.
We are making tangible and consistent progress towards achieving these twin goals while consistently delivering strong financial performance. I'm proud that Q2 was another strong quarter for PayPal, both financially and strategically. Our partnership with Visa will help drive consumer choice and provide enhanced value to the larger payment ecosystem. But first, let's look at the financial metrics we delivered this quarter.
We grew revenue at 19.5%, delivering $2.65 billion on the top line. Given the challenging comps from Q2 last year, this exceeded our internal forecasts and guidance. We processed $86.2 billion in total payment volume, an increase of 29%; and our merchant services volume expanded 36%. Our mobile payments volumes continues to accelerate, up 56% this quarter, accelerating for the third straight quarter; and we hit a record of over $24 billion in mobile TPV in the quarter.
In the last 12 months, we've added 19 million net active accounts, finishing the quarter with 188 million customer accounts transacting on the PayPal platform. And even as we add new active accounts, our transactions per account continue to expand, reaching 29 this quarter, up from 26 a year ago. We generated $495 million of free cash flow in the quarter, giving our business tremendous flexibility to continue to reinvest in our growth.
In the first 6 months of 2016, we produced $1.1 billion of free cash flow, on track to meet our guidance of more than $2.1 billion for the year. 
And finally, we delivered $0.36 of non-GAAP EPS versus our guidance of $0.34 to $0.36. I'm proud of the PayPal team and they worked hard to deliver these strong results.
I'd like to now spend some time talking about the partnership announcement we made today with Visa and the progress we are making towards enabling our strategy of being a true customer champion. Being a customer champion company is not just words for us. In order to be a great company over the long term, we need to provide the very best experience for our customers. We believe that means giving our customers both choice and optionality in where they want to pay and how they want to pay. This change in our business model positions us to better serve our customers, and it's fundamental to the long-term growth and success of PayPal.
While we expect this to drive incremental expense, we now have evidence to support the assertion that customer choice will benefit both our business model and our customers over the medium term. Our improved onboarding experience, which we began rolling out last quarter, gives customers more choice when opening a PayPal account and has already resulted in lifting our activations. In the coming quarters, we will be rolling out account setting and checkout experiences that also deliver enhanced customer choice. We believe these new experiences will result in improved engagement and a reduction in customer churn, all very good things for both our customers and for PayPal.
But we are already seeing another significant benefit. By making customer choice a priority for PayPal, we are opening up new opportunities for partnerships within our ecosystem. Today, PayPal and Visa announced a strategic partnership to further expand our long-standing relationship. This agreement will allow both companies to offer greater choice to merchants and consumers and increase the value to Visa issuers and PayPal customers.
The benefits of this partnership include our ability to gain access to Visa's tokenization services starting in the United States for in-store PayPal transactions. This will allow customers to pay with their Visa instruments in the PayPal wallet at the millions of retail locations where they see the Visa contactless logo. Importantly, retailers can expect to pay fees that are consistent with other contactless transactions they accept today. We will provide greater accessibility for Visa payment instruments in the PayPal digital wallet. PayPal will also provide Visa, their issuers and their cardholders additional visibility into each Visa-funded transaction, providing greater transparency and enhancing payment system security.
The agreement affords PayPal certain economic incentives, including Visa incentives for increased volume and greater long-term Visa fee certainty and removes the threat of any targeted pricing actions. This deal has the potential to be transformative for PayPal, Visa and the industry. We believe it provides us the flexibility and the capability to execute against our customer champion vision, to partner with issuers and others who share our vision and to accelerate PayPal's in-store access in new and profitable ways.
We also believe it provides more options for growth and the ability to partner with others to mutually cross-sell our various current and projected services to consumers and merchants around the world. All of these will take some time to come to fruition but this agreement opens up a new chapter for PayPal.
Giving customers choice in how and where they want to pay provides a pathway over the long term from our goal of 2 transactions a week from our current engagement of just over 2 per month. It's also important to say that we welcome the opportunity to work with more partners like Visa who share our vision, and we are in discussions with a variety of players in our ecosystem.
This is a new PayPal, one that is actively partnering across the digital payments landscape. For example, in the quarter, we also expanded the European rollout of the Vodafone Wallet we talked about last quarter. Consumers in Spain and Italy can now tap in paying stores with PayPal and Visa, another example of how PayPal is opening our platform to a slew of new partnerships. Our partnership with Facebook continues to expand, as do our efforts with Google, Pinterest, Alibaba and eBay.
I'm pleased with the quarter's results, but we still have much to execute through the back half of the year. We need to continually innovate and deepen customer engagement in order to maintain and further widen the distance between our value proposition and that of our competition. And in keeping with that focus, Q2 saw a significant progress in consumer and merchant engagement on the PayPal platform. We are making steady strides in our efforts to become an everyday essential financial service for underserved customers.
In the second quarter, transactions per account increased to 29, and we processed 1.4 billion transactions, a new milestone for PayPal, and an increase of 25% from the same period last year.
Deepening consumer engagement is no accident. It is driven by our innovative products and an increasingly robust platform, designed with our customers and their needs in mind. Our aim is to deliver transformative products that make payments easier, faster, more reliable and more secure online, in-mobile, in-app and in-store. One Touch, our contextual commerce services; Venmo; and Xoom are all perfect examples of this.
One Touch is the most rapidly adopted product in PayPal's history. As of the second quarter, over 25 million consumers have opted into One Touch, and I'm pleased to say that we now have over 2 million merchants offering this innovative way to pay. With a market-leading 87% conversion rate, we continue to see increased engagement and conversion with the use of One Touch.
We are continuing to invest and innovate in contextual commerce. Last year, Pinterest launched its first foray into buyable buttons. Braintree powered 80% of the Pinterest-launched merchants. Building on this infrastructure, we are now powering Pinterest's new shopping bag functionality that lets shoppers pick items from across the web, collect them in a shopping cart and make a single purchase. This brings over 10 million unique products to Pinterest for an even richer and more convenient in-context shopping experience.
And Venmo continues its rapid growth. In the quarter, Venmo processed almost $4 billion in P2P payments, an increase of 141% year-over-year. We are very focused in making steady progress with our Pay with Venmo pilot. We have added 8 more next-generation apps beyond Munchery and Gametime. These include Parking Panda, PRIV, Wish, Boxed, Hop Market and Poshmark. We have also further expanded the Venmo pilot from 1 million to 3.5 million Venmo users. We expect to add many more merchants in all of the Venmo consumer base later this year.
Xoom's U.S. customers can now send money to loved ones in 53 countries, and it continues to redefine global remittances through mobile technology, ending the quarter with more than 70% of transactions originating on a mobile device. We continue to see the benefits of our integration efforts with Xoom adding more than double the number of net new actives this quarter versus a year ago. I'm pleased to say we are executing on our acquisition business case, and I have high hopes to what Xoom can offer to PayPal consumers in the years ahead.
All of these innovative new experiences are driving PayPal's leadership in mobile payments. As I mentioned, PayPal processed over $24 billion in mobile payment volume, an increase of 56% year-over-year, and mobile now represents 28% of our total payment volume, up from 26% in the first quarter.
Mobile is arguably the most competitive arena in the digital payments ecosystem and PayPal continues to widen its lead and gain share. Two quarters ago, we grew our mobile volumes 45% year-over-year. Last quarter, 54%. And despite a substantially increased base of mobile transactions, we grew 56% this quarter. We also continue to make substantial progress in acquiring new merchants and now have more than 14.5 million merchants transacting on our platform. Our increasing ability to provide a suite of innovative services for merchants is not only accelerating our competitive differentiation but enabling us to be seen as a true full services payments partner.
PayPal's merchant services payment volume was $71.3 billion in the quarter, increasing 36%. Leading merchants continue to choose PayPal, including IKEA in multiple countries; the world's leading cruise brands of Carnival Corporation, including Carnival Cruise Lines, Princess Cruises, Holland America Line and Seabourn; Russia's VKontakte; Europe's largest social media network with 360 million users; women's fashion brand, TALBOTS; Cathay Pacific; and Eventbrite, the world's largest self-service ticketing platform, has now launched with Braintree full-stack processing. And Braintree continues to gain momentum rapidly adding new merchants, ending the quarter with 309 million cards on file, an increase of 101% from the same period a year ago.
Finally, PayPal Working Capital continues to be an important way we engage our small business merchants and support their growth. In Q2, we exceeded 2 billion in originations since our launch. We've now funded more than 90,000 small business merchants in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Our Working Capital merchants see an almost $0.50 increase in payment volume for every dollar of working capital extended to them by PayPal. Clearly, a powerful tool for our merchants.
Finally, I'd like to mention a few accolades we've recently received that highlight the strong progress we've made in the past year as an independent company. First, our financial performance has earned us a place on the Fortune 500 list at #307. Importantly, we are now being recognized for our leadership in innovation. Recently, InformationWeek named PayPal the #11 company in the country in terms of technology innovation. And the value of our brand is also on the rise. The Financial Times recently came out with the BrandZ listing of the top 100 most valuable global brands. PayPal was one of the top 10 brands that increased its value most in 2016, gaining 35%, and rising from #88 to the 65th most valuable brand across the globe. And finally, and perhaps most meaningfully to many of us, consumers in the United States recently ranked 180 top brands across the world in terms of social impact and doing the most good in the world. PayPal was ranked among the top 5 companies across the globe.
We've made strong progress in the 12 months since becoming public. We have a lot of work ahead of us but the opportunities are coming into sharper focus and are now clearly within our reach. We remain focused on executing with both discipline and excellence for our customers and for our shareholders.
I'd like to now turn the call over to John. John?"

I also want to thank all of PayPal's customers and our employees worldwide for making this another great quarter. Q2 marks another quarter where we advanced our goal of becoming a central part of our customers' daily financial lives, strengthened our position in the ecosystem and enhanced our value proposition as a customer champion company. 
First, I will walk you through the highlights of our second quarter results. On a currency-neutral basis, total payment volume was $86.2 billion, an increase of 29%. U.S. payment volume grew 27% and international volume grew 31%. Our merchant services business grew 36%, demonstrating that our strategy of being a customer champion and moving from being a payment button to an end-to-end payment solution for merchants of all sizes, continues to gain traction.
We ended the quarter with 188 million active accounts, an 11% increase from a year ago. Account growth was predominantly driven by our PayPal core offering, followed by Venmo. The number of payment transactions per account increased to 29, up 13% year-over-year and an acceleration from the first quarter. This, when combined with the increase in active accounts, contributed to payment transaction growth of 25% year-over-year.
In the second quarter, we generated revenue of $2.65 billion, up 19.5% on a currency-neutral basis and 15.6% on a spot basis. Q2 revenue exceeded our expectations as a result of strong performance in our core business and Braintree. In the second quarter, we faced difficult year-over-year comparisons from the amendment of our Synchrony co-branded credit card agreement and the sale of a portion of our credit receivables portfolio last year, as well as a larger currency hedging gains in Q2 '15. We are pleased with our very strong top line performance and our ability to offset these year-over-year pressures.
Transaction revenue increased 23% on a currency-neutral basis in the quarter, an acceleration from the first quarter. Performance was driven by large merchant growth in our core business and strength in the Braintree business. This resulted in a transaction take rate of 2.69% for the second quarter, a decline of 22 basis points year-over-year. The decline was primarily driven by lower currency hedging revenue in the quarter versus last year; the growth of our P2P business, including Venmo; and the mix shift towards Braintree and larger merchants. 
Revenue from Other Value Added Services was flat versus last year, driven by the amendment of our Synchrony agreement and the sale of our credit receivables in Q2 of last year, offset by solid results from our credit products.
Transaction expense and transaction and loan losses, our volume-based expenses, increased 28%, in line with total payment volume growth. This resulted in a transaction margin of 59.8% versus 63.8% in Q2 '15. In the quarter on a year-over-year basis, the transaction margin decline was driven primarily by strong performance from Braintree, which had a lower take rate and higher transaction expense; the lapping of the amended Synchrony agreement and the sale of a portion of our credit receivables; and the high-margin hedge revenue we recognized in Q2 '15.
Other expenses grew 10%, well below revenue growth, and drove 185 basis points of leverage. Excluding the acquisition of Xoom, our other expenses increased approximately 7%, demonstrating good cost control. We continue to be focused on strong expense discipline. The scale of our platform allows us to carefully manage the growth of these other expenses, even as our revenue grew nearly 20% on a currency-neutral basis. We continue to see opportunity to manage these costs over time.
We delivered operating income of $528 million in the second quarter. For the first half of 2016, operating income increased 10% to $1.1 billion. Operating margin for the second quarter was 19.9%, a decline from last year, predominantly driven by the items I already mentioned affecting revenue: the amendment of our Synchrony agreement and the sale of our credit receivables, both of which dropped directly to the bottom line. We were also impacted by the acquisition of Xoom, which was approximately 40 basis points. But excluding these items, operating margin would have expanded approximately 100 basis points year-over-year.
We generated not GAAP EPS of $0.36 per share for the quarter, the top end of our guidance range. For the first half of 2016, non-GAAP earnings per share increased 19% to $0.73.
Second quarter capital expenditures were $201 million or approximately 8% of revenue. Free cash flow in the second quarter was $495 million, representing $0.19 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue.
During the quarter, we also returned approximately $300 million to shareholders by buying back an additional 8 million shares. Year-to-date, we have returned approximately $900 million to shareholders, repurchasing 25 million shares at an average price of $36.34. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $6.2 billion, including approximately $1.3 billion in the U.S.
I want to take a few -- make a few comments regarding the U.K. vote to leave the European Union. First, we should acknowledge that we are in the very early days and exactly what happens from here will take some time to unfold. 
Europe generally and the U.K. specifically are very important parts of our business that we will continue to serve. In the second quarter, approximately 12% of our revenue was generated in the U.K. Because of the global nature of our business, we typically see a counterbalance effect when any one currency measurably weakens or strengthens. This was particularly pronounced in certain corridors like the U.S. and Canada and the U.K. and the EU due to proximity of consumers' awareness of currency shifts. In the medium-term, we are obviously going to keep a close eye on the broader economic environment and any effect on customer behavior.
From a foreign currency standpoint, the euro and the pound are the 2 currencies where we have the most exposure. For that reason, we hedge both currencies, and our exposure from a translation us perspective in 2016 is minimal. 
Importantly, our EU business is operated through our Luxembourg bank where we are allowed to passport our banking license among the EU member states. The U.K.'s decision to exit the EU will have some impact on the regulatory framework under which we operate. We have been assessing the ramifications of a leave vote since the referendum was announced and once we have better clarity on how the relationship between the U.K. and the EU with respect to financial services will be governed, we will take the necessary steps to be able to continue to serve our customers in the capacity that we do today.
Now, I'd like to give you an update on our credit portfolio. Our credit products support and complement our platform, enhancing our digital payments offering for both our consumers and our merchants. Credit drives a positive network effect for our business, increasing volume and engagement on our platform. Credit represents approximately 2% of our TPV and in the medium term, we expect the TPV contribution from our credit products to remain around this level.
In addition, as we've said previously, we continue to assess asset-light strategies to fund and grow our credit offering. The performance of our credit portfolio continues to be in line with our expectations. In the second quarter, we saw improvement in our delinquency rates and most of our other credit quality metrics. We have, however, experienced a higher percentage of our late-stage delinquent consumer credit balances rolling to charge-offs. This has resulted in a charge-off rate of 6.3% versus 6.1% last quarter. We attribute the increased charge-offs to changes in our own collection efforts that were recently instituted. We've taken steps to address this impact in the back half of this year.
As Dan mentioned, our agreement with Visa and more broadly, our strategic decision to invest in customer choice, is a great opportunity for our customers, our shareholders and other partners in the payments ecosystem. This partnership will help drive the digitization of payments, both in-mobile and in-store. 
Much has been made about the blurring of the off-line and online worlds through digital payments. The agreement with Visa is an important step, allowing us to more fully participate in this powerful secular shift with our mobile-first strategy, complemented by Visa's in-store strengths. 
We have an expansive vision for PayPal, including being an everyday part of our customers' financial lives. Customer choice, as we refer to it, involves empowering our customers to use PayPal where they want to pay and how they want to pay, and is the vehicle for achieving that vision.
For the remainder of 2016, we do not anticipate any material impact to our results from the movement to choice. Beginning next year, we expect the changes to our funding mix from customer choice will increase transaction expense, but at the same time, we believe expanding customer choice will unlock future revenue opportunities. 
Moving to customer choice and our agreement with Visa, laid the foundation for sustainable revenue growth, with more certainty in our cost structure. It's very early on and we're only 6 months through the year. As we get closer to year-end, we will provide more detail on the impact of this and how it affects our 2017 performance.
Finally, I'd like to discuss our financial guidance for the third quarter and full year. Our strong performance in the first half of the year across our core business, Braintree and P2P, in addition to our growing mobile penetration, further validates our strategies and our business priorities. As a result, we are raising our full year 2016 revenue guidance to $10.75 billion to $10.85 billion or 19% to 20% growth on a currency-neutral basis. We are also narrowing the non-GAAP earnings range to $1.47 to $1.50 per share, representing growth of 18% at the high end of the range. 
And we are reaffirming our full year prior 2016 guidance on free cash flow, CapEx and non-GAAP effective tax rate. For the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $2.6 billion to $2.67 billion or 19% to 21% growth on a currency-neutral basis. And we expect non-GAAP earnings of $0.33 to $0.35 per share.
In conclusion, our second quarter results demonstrate the continued progress we are making in our business. Revenue is strong and we're combining that with excellent cost control to generate healthy margins and strong free cash flow. We continue to allocate capital in a way that generates shareholder value. And our partnership with Visa has removed an overhang on our business, giving us greater cost certainty going forward, allowing us to profitably participate in the off-line market and creating the foundation for being a customer champion.
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions. Thank you."

Thanks for your question. So we're very excited about the partnership with Visa. I think it's very important to understand that, I think as Charlie said on the Visa call, partnerships like the one we announced today work best when there's alignment for everyone. And we believe that we've designed an agreement that works for PayPal, Visa and the issuers. We have been in discussions with issuers, Visa has been in discussions with its issuers, and they're excited about the benefit from the volumes that we can bring to them and that we can bring to point-of-sale. And as Charlie pointed out, this agreement removes many of the concerns, if not all of the concerns, that issuers and others in the ecosystem has about working with PayPal. Choice is something that everybody has been talking about. What issuers want, what we want is the ability for a consumer to make a choice, to have options as to what payment tender type they want to pay with. What that basically means is that a consumer could pay with their credit, with ACH, with debit, with cash, with P2P, with PayPal Credit, any of those, but it's the option of the consumer to make that choice. And then when you add on top of that optionality the fact that we are very willing and happy to share the same sorts of data that somebody would get with a typical credit card swipe back to the networks, back to the issuers and to customers, that's exactly what issuers have been asking for. We actually think that this deal that we have with Visa offers a couple of benefits. Obviously, it offers access to tokens at rates that are comparable to other contactless methods out there, and so we can compete with anybody now at point-of-sale. There's no competitive disadvantage to anybody else out there, and we can go off-line profitably. Second, we get fee certainty, as we talked about, know targeting -- targeted actions against PayPal's limits on new fees, even industry-based fees and volume-based discounts. So we have certainty around our cost structure. And very importantly, I think this opens us up to new partnerships. New partnerships with issuers, networks and others. Choice and data turn us into their friends. And when I think about the partnerships that we have, we're an ideal distribution mechanism to drive more online and mobile spend to issuers. They're an ideal partner to drive incremental net adds in customers into the PayPal platform. That's a win-win for both of us. And this is going to open up a new chapter for PayPal to partner with and for all of us to work together to advance digital payments going forward. And as I mentioned in my remarks and John mentioned, choice also is going to help us drive incremental new net adds. We're already seeing that in some of the changes we've made to our onboarding. When you look at One Touch and you see what our customers do when they're able to default a payment mechanism, their engagement goes up, their conversion rates go up. And obviously, when a customer gets to choose what instrument they want, we're going to see less calls come into customer care for us, we're going to see customer satisfaction go up, and typically, when that happens, customer churn goes down. So we think this is a very strong agreement that benefits Visa, its issuers and us, allows us to work within the ecosystem. And the issuers don't need to sign any unique agreements with us. It's simply an opt-in to participate with us. It's no additional work from them. And our movement to choice, data sharing, plus our commitment to quality, I think, puts us on par with others that are using Visa tokens in the ecosystem."

If you consider we have, just rough order of magnitude, $300 billion of TPV today. And if you were to look at a funding shift on that, that would overstate the effect of a funding shift. Because this agreement, for now, is U.S.-only and as we disclosed in the past, that's roughly half of our TPV. We also see differences in funding mix between P2P versus goods and services, so you've got to strip that out or at least treat that differently. And we disclosed earlier this year that P2P is roughly $40 billion of our annual TPV. And then lastly, you need to also consider that there's a large percentage of our customers today that only have a card in their wallet. So choice for them would -- there'd be no other increase in cost by moving -- by adding additional card, doing a different card. So that -- from the cost side, that's the right framework to think about this."

And as John mentioned, we will wait until we get closer to 2017 to give 2017 guidance. First of all, obviously, we'll take a look at consumer behavior as a result of this. There are a number of discussions going on in the ecosystem and we want to look at the totality of the landscape before we really talk about what 2017 could look like. And finally, we're halfway through the year, we got a full -- another 6 months to execute against and let's see how our momentum takes us before we provide 2017 guidance. And on the merchant side. Merchants have been working with us quite closely as we're creating a platform for them to take advantage of digital commerce. And that basically means letting a merchant write their own application, and we power that application through a platform that enables them to extend a value proposition to their customers online, on mobile and in-store. And part of that in-store environment, when it comes to the PayPal wallet, we did not have a tokenization scheme. We could use different forms of that. And so from a merchant perspective, the rates now that we can offer on an in-store point-of-sale transaction are significantly more competitive for them. And so it just strengthens our position in terms of working with merchants. No change in our strategy, but it certainly strengthens it and opens up a wide opportunity for us. As we talk about the blurring of online and off-line coming together, this really opens up our ability to move into any context, whether it be online, in-app or in-store with our digital wallet."

And so all of those are now coming together and being integrated so that we can offer merchants the ability to look across any of those context and use our platform to power and enable their move to digital commerce. Then what we've done, obviously, is because our base is so large, we take our branded PayPal wallet, which now is available to go into more context, as I just mentioned, and light up those applications because we have so many subscribers that we can bring to those merchants. And so you've got a platform play that's really unbranded that supports a merchant's move into digital commerce and then a branded wallet.

With respect to the increase in transaction expense, we'll give more specific guidance as we get towards the end of the year about 2017. But when you look at both the revenue benefit, as well as the good demonstrated cost control that we -- that you've seen for several quarters now, and just look at the over 180 basis points of leverage this quarter, the fact that our operating expenses, if you normalize for the Xoom acquisition, only went up 7% in the quarter, we can continue to demonstrate that we have a laser-focus on discipline here while still not starving the business for investment as well. We're making sure that we're continuing to invest organically. So all that in combination gives us a level of comfort with this but it's absolutely the right thing to do for the business.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. I'm pleased to say we had another strong quarter, with our financial results at the high end of our guidance and, in many cases, exceeding our own expectations. A",2256,"Thanks, Gabrielle. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. I'm pleased to say we had another strong quarter, with our financial results at the high end of our guidance and, in many cases, exceeding our own expectations. And of course, we announced earlier a multiyear partnership with Visa. 
But before I discuss our results, I'd like to point out that it's been 1 year since PayPal became a publicly traded company for the second time. In many ways, our listing last year was a full circle moment for PayPal. It allowed us to return to the core mission of our founders, the mission they were pursuing when they took PayPal public in 2002. Even with the Internet in its infancy, they saw the opportunity for technology to democratize money.
Today, our purpose is the same, but our opportunity is much greater with the digitization of money accelerating and the adoption of mobile devices continuing its rapid pace globally. PayPal's total addressable market has grown to include all of digital commerce and digital money, a $100 trillion opportunity. Today's announcement with Visa brings us closer to capitalizing on that opportunity.
The mission of PayPal is clear, we're striving to become an everyday essential financial service for underserved customers. And for our merchants, we want to provide a full-service solution and platform that enables digital commerce.
We are making tangible and consistent progress towards achieving these twin goals while consistently delivering strong financial performance. I'm proud that Q2 was another strong quarter for PayPal, both financially and strategically. Our partnership with Visa will help drive consumer choice and provide enhanced value to the larger payment ecosystem. But first, let's look at the financial metrics we delivered this quarter.
We grew revenue at 19.5%, delivering $2.65 billion on the top line. Given the challenging comps from Q2 last year, this exceeded our internal forecasts and guidance. We processed $86.2 billion in total payment volume, an increase of 29%; and our merchant services volume expanded 36%. Our mobile payments volumes continues to accelerate, up 56% this quarter, accelerating for the third straight quarter; and we hit a record of over $24 billion in mobile TPV in the quarter.
In the last 12 months, we've added 19 million net active accounts, finishing the quarter with 188 million customer accounts transacting on the PayPal platform. And even as we add new active accounts, our transactions per account continue to expand, reaching 29 this quarter, up from 26 a year ago. We generated $495 million of free cash flow in the quarter, giving our business tremendous flexibility to continue to reinvest in our growth.
In the first 6 months of 2016, we produced $1.1 billion of free cash flow, on track to meet our guidance of more than $2.1 billion for the year. 
And finally, we delivered $0.36 of non-GAAP EPS versus our guidance of $0.34 to $0.36. I'm proud of the PayPal team and they worked hard to deliver these strong results.
I'd like to now spend some time talking about the partnership announcement we made today with Visa and the progress we are making towards enabling our strategy of being a true customer champion. Being a customer champion company is not just words for us. In order to be a great company over the long term, we need to provide the very best experience for our customers. We believe that means giving our customers both choice and optionality in where they want to pay and how they want to pay. This change in our business model positions us to better serve our customers, and it's fundamental to the long-term growth and success of PayPal.
While we expect this to drive incremental expense, we now have evidence to support the assertion that customer choice will benefit both our business model and our customers over the medium term. Our improved onboarding experience, which we began rolling out last quarter, gives customers more choice when opening a PayPal account and has already resulted in lifting our activations. In the coming quarters, we will be rolling out account setting and checkout experiences that also deliver enhanced customer choice. We believe these new experiences will result in improved engagement and a reduction in customer churn, all very good things for both our customers and for PayPal.
But we are already seeing another significant benefit. By making customer choice a priority for PayPal, we are opening up new opportunities for partnerships within our ecosystem. Today, PayPal and Visa announced a strategic partnership to further expand our long-standing relationship. This agreement will allow both companies to offer greater choice to merchants and consumers and increase the value to Visa issuers and PayPal customers.
The benefits of this partnership include our ability to gain access to Visa's tokenization services starting in the United States for in-store PayPal transactions. This will allow customers to pay with their Visa instruments in the PayPal wallet at the millions of retail locations where they see the Visa contactless logo. Importantly, retailers can expect to pay fees that are consistent with other contactless transactions they accept today. We will provide greater accessibility for Visa payment instruments in the PayPal digital wallet. PayPal will also provide Visa, their issuers and their cardholders additional visibility into each Visa-funded transaction, providing greater transparency and enhancing payment system security.
The agreement affords PayPal certain economic incentives, including Visa incentives for increased volume and greater long-term Visa fee certainty and removes the threat of any targeted pricing actions. This deal has the potential to be transformative for PayPal, Visa and the industry. We believe it provides us the flexibility and the capability to execute against our customer champion vision, to partner with issuers and others who share our vision and to accelerate PayPal's in-store access in new and profitable ways.
We also believe it provides more options for growth and the ability to partner with others to mutually cross-sell our various current and projected services to consumers and merchants around the world. All of these will take some time to come to fruition but this agreement opens up a new chapter for PayPal.
Giving customers choice in how and where they want to pay provides a pathway over the long term from our goal of 2 transactions a week from our current engagement of just over 2 per month. It's also important to say that we welcome the opportunity to work with more partners like Visa who share our vision, and we are in discussions with a variety of players in our ecosystem.
This is a new PayPal, one that is actively partnering across the digital payments landscape. For example, in the quarter, we also expanded the European rollout of the Vodafone Wallet we talked about last quarter. Consumers in Spain and Italy can now tap in paying stores with PayPal and Visa, another example of how PayPal is opening our platform to a slew of new partnerships. Our partnership with Facebook continues to expand, as do our efforts with Google, Pinterest, Alibaba and eBay.
I'm pleased with the quarter's results, but we still have much to execute through the back half of the year. We need to continually innovate and deepen customer engagement in order to maintain and further widen the distance between our value proposition and that of our competition. And in keeping with that focus, Q2 saw a significant progress in consumer and merchant engagement on the PayPal platform. We are making steady strides in our efforts to become an everyday essential financial service for underserved customers.
In the second quarter, transactions per account increased to 29, and we processed 1.4 billion transactions, a new milestone for PayPal, and an increase of 25% from the same period last year.
Deepening consumer engagement is no accident. It is driven by our innovative products and an increasingly robust platform, designed with our customers and their needs in mind. Our aim is to deliver transformative products that make payments easier, faster, more reliable and more secure online, in-mobile, in-app and in-store. One Touch, our contextual commerce services; Venmo; and Xoom are all perfect examples of this.
One Touch is the most rapidly adopted product in PayPal's history. As of the second quarter, over 25 million consumers have opted into One Touch, and I'm pleased to say that we now have over 2 million merchants offering this innovative way to pay. With a market-leading 87% conversion rate, we continue to see increased engagement and conversion with the use of One Touch.
We are continuing to invest and innovate in contextual commerce. Last year, Pinterest launched its first foray into buyable buttons. Braintree powered 80% of the Pinterest-launched merchants. Building on this infrastructure, we are now powering Pinterest's new shopping bag functionality that lets shoppers pick items from across the web, collect them in a shopping cart and make a single purchase. This brings over 10 million unique products to Pinterest for an even richer and more convenient in-context shopping experience.
And Venmo continues its rapid growth. In the quarter, Venmo processed almost $4 billion in P2P payments, an increase of 141% year-over-year. We are very focused in making steady progress with our Pay with Venmo pilot. We have added 8 more next-generation apps beyond Munchery and Gametime. These include Parking Panda, PRIV, Wish, Boxed, Hop Market and Poshmark. We have also further expanded the Venmo pilot from 1 million to 3.5 million Venmo users. We expect to add many more merchants in all of the Venmo consumer base later this year.
Xoom's U.S. customers can now send money to loved ones in 53 countries, and it continues to redefine global remittances through mobile technology, ending the quarter with more than 70% of transactions originating on a mobile device. We continue to see the benefits of our integration efforts with Xoom adding more than double the number of net new actives this quarter versus a year ago. I'm pleased to say we are executing on our acquisition business case, and I have high hopes to what Xoom can offer to PayPal consumers in the years ahead.
All of these innovative new experiences are driving PayPal's leadership in mobile payments. As I mentioned, PayPal processed over $24 billion in mobile payment volume, an increase of 56% year-over-year, and mobile now represents 28% of our total payment volume, up from 26% in the first quarter.
Mobile is arguably the most competitive arena in the digital payments ecosystem and PayPal continues to widen its lead and gain share. Two quarters ago, we grew our mobile volumes 45% year-over-year. Last quarter, 54%. And despite a substantially increased base of mobile transactions, we grew 56% this quarter. We also continue to make substantial progress in acquiring new merchants and now have more than 14.5 million merchants transacting on our platform. Our increasing ability to provide a suite of innovative services for merchants is not only accelerating our competitive differentiation but enabling us to be seen as a true full services payments partner.
PayPal's merchant services payment volume was $71.3 billion in the quarter, increasing 36%. Leading merchants continue to choose PayPal, including IKEA in multiple countries; the world's leading cruise brands of Carnival Corporation, including Carnival Cruise Lines, Princess Cruises, Holland America Line and Seabourn; Russia's VKontakte; Europe's largest social media network with 360 million users; women's fashion brand, TALBOTS; Cathay Pacific; and Eventbrite, the world's largest self-service ticketing platform, has now launched with Braintree full-stack processing. And Braintree continues to gain momentum rapidly adding new merchants, ending the quarter with 309 million cards on file, an increase of 101% from the same period a year ago.
Finally, PayPal Working Capital continues to be an important way we engage our small business merchants and support their growth. In Q2, we exceeded 2 billion in originations since our launch. We've now funded more than 90,000 small business merchants in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Our Working Capital merchants see an almost $0.50 increase in payment volume for every dollar of working capital extended to them by PayPal. Clearly, a powerful tool for our merchants.
Finally, I'd like to mention a few accolades we've recently received that highlight the strong progress we've made in the past year as an independent company. First, our financial performance has earned us a place on the Fortune 500 list at #307. Importantly, we are now being recognized for our leadership in innovation. Recently, InformationWeek named PayPal the #11 company in the country in terms of technology innovation. And the value of our brand is also on the rise. The Financial Times recently came out with the BrandZ listing of the top 100 most valuable global brands. PayPal was one of the top 10 brands that increased its value most in 2016, gaining 35%, and rising from #88 to the 65th most valuable brand across the globe. And finally, and perhaps most meaningfully to many of us, consumers in the United States recently ranked 180 top brands across the world in terms of social impact and doing the most good in the world. PayPal was ranked among the top 5 companies across the globe.
We've made strong progress in the 12 months since becoming public. We have a lot of work ahead of us but the opportunities are coming into sharper focus and are now clearly within our reach. We remain focused on executing with both discipline and excellence for our customers and for our shareholders.
I'd like to now turn the call over to John. John?"

I also want to thank all of PayPal's customers and our employees worldwide for making this another great quarter.

I also want to thank all of PayPal's customers and our employees worldwide for making this another great quarter. Q2 marks another quarter where we advanced our goal of becoming a central part of our customers' daily financial lives, strengthened our position in the ecosystem and enhanced our value proposition as a customer champion company. 
First, I will walk you through the highlights of our second quarter results. On a currency-neutral basis, total payment volume was $86.2 billion, an increase of 29%. U.S. payment volume grew 27% and international volume grew 31%. Our merchant services business grew 36%, demonstrating that our strategy of being a customer champion and moving from being a payment button to an end-to-end payment solution for merchants of all sizes, continues to gain traction.
We ended the quarter with 188 million active accounts, an 11% increase from a year ago. Account growth was predominantly driven by our PayPal core offering, followed by Venmo. The number of payment transactions per account increased to 29, up 13% year-over-year and an acceleration from the first quarter. This, when combined with the increase in active accounts, contributed to payment transaction growth of 25% year-over-year.
In the second quarter, we generated revenue of $2.65 billion, up 19.5% on a currency-neutral basis and 15.6% on a spot basis. Q2 revenue exceeded our expectations as a result of strong performance in our core business and Braintree. In the second quarter, we faced difficult year-over-year comparisons from the amendment of our Synchrony co-branded credit card agreement and the sale of a portion of our credit receivables portfolio last year, as well as a larger currency hedging gains in Q2 '15. We are pleased with our very strong top line performance and our ability to offset these year-over-year pressures.
Transaction revenue increased 23% on a currency-neutral basis in the quarter, an acceleration from the first quarter. Performance was driven by large merchant growth in our core business and strength in the Braintree business. This resulted in a transaction take rate of 2.69% for the second quarter, a decline of 22 basis points year-over-year. The decline was primarily driven by lower currency hedging revenue in the quarter versus last year; the growth of our P2P business, including Venmo; and the mix shift towards Braintree and larger merchants. 
Revenue from Other Value Added Services was flat versus last year, driven by the amendment of our Synchrony agreement and the sale of our credit receivables in Q2 of last year, offset by solid results from our credit products.
Transaction expense and transaction and loan losses, our volume-based expenses, increased 28%, in line with total payment volume growth. This resulted in a transaction margin of 59.8% versus 63.8% in Q2 '15. In the quarter on a year-over-year basis, the transaction margin decline was driven primarily by strong performance from Braintree, which had a lower take rate and higher transaction expense; the lapping of the amended Synchrony agreement and the sale of a portion of our credit receivables; and the high-margin hedge revenue we recognized in Q2 '15.
Other expenses grew 10%, well below revenue growth, and drove 185 basis points of leverage. Excluding the acquisition of Xoom, our other expenses increased approximately 7%, demonstrating good cost control. We continue to be focused on strong expense discipline. The scale of our platform allows us to carefully manage the growth of these other expenses, even as our revenue grew nearly 20% on a currency-neutral basis. We continue to see opportunity to manage these costs over time.
We delivered operating income of $528 million in the second quarter. For the first half of 2016, operating income increased 10% to $1.1 billion. Operating margin for the second quarter was 19.9%, a decline from last year, predominantly driven by the items I already mentioned affecting revenue: the amendment of our Synchrony agreement and the sale of our credit receivables, both of which dropped directly to the bottom line. We were also impacted by the acquisition of Xoom, which was approximately 40 basis points. But excluding these items, operating margin would have expanded approximately 100 basis points year-over-year.
We generated not GAAP EPS of $0.36 per share for the quarter, the top end of our guidance range. For the first half of 2016, non-GAAP earnings per share increased 19% to $0.73.
Second quarter capital expenditures were $201 million or approximately 8% of revenue. Free cash flow in the second quarter was $495 million, representing $0.19 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue.
During the quarter, we also returned approximately $300 million to shareholders by buying back an additional 8 million shares. Year-to-date, we have returned approximately $900 million to shareholders, repurchasing 25 million shares at an average price of $36.34. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $6.2 billion, including approximately $1.3 billion in the U.S.
I want to take a few -- make a few comments regarding the U.K. vote to leave the European Union. First, we should acknowledge that we are in the very early days and exactly what happens from here will take some time to unfold. 
Europe generally and the U.K. specifically are very important parts of our business that we will continue to serve. In the second quarter, approximately 12% of our revenue was generated in the U.K. Because of the global nature of our business, we typically see a counterbalance effect when any one currency measurably weakens or strengthens. This was particularly pronounced in certain corridors like the U.S. and Canada and the U.K. and the EU due to proximity of consumers' awareness of currency shifts. In the medium term, we are obviously going to keep a close eye on the broader economic environment and any effect on customer behavior.
From a foreign currency standpoint, the euro and the pound are the 2 currencies where we have the most exposure. For that reason, we hedge both currencies, and our exposure from a translation us perspective in 2016 is minimal. 
Importantly, our EU business is operated through our Luxembourg bank where we are allowed to passport our banking license among the EU member states. The U.K.'s decision to exit the EU will have some impact on the regulatory framework under which we operate. We have been assessing the ramifications of a leave vote since the referendum was announced and once we have better clarity on how the relationship between the U.K. and the EU with respect to financial services will be governed, we will take the necessary steps to be able to continue to serve our customers in the capacity that we do today.
Now, I'd like to give you an update on our credit portfolio. Our credit products support and complement our platform, enhancing our digital payments offering for both our consumers and our merchants. Credit drives a positive network effect for our business, increasing volume and engagement on our platform. Credit represents approximately 2% of our TPV and in the medium term, we expect the TPV contribution from our credit products to remain around this level.
In addition, as we've said previously, we continue to assess asset-light strategies to fund and grow our credit offering. The performance of our credit portfolio continues to be in line with our expectations. In the second quarter, we saw improvement in our delinquency rates and most of our other credit quality metrics. We have, however, experienced a higher percentage of our late-stage delinquent consumer credit balances rolling to charge-offs. This has resulted in a charge-off rate of 6.3% versus 6.1% last quarter. We attribute the increased charge-offs to changes in our own collection efforts that were recently instituted. We've taken steps to address this impact in the back half of this year.
As Dan mentioned, our agreement with Visa and more broadly, our strategic decision to invest in customer choice, is a great opportunity for our customers, our shareholders and other partners in the payments ecosystem. This partnership will help drive the digitization of payments, both in-mobile and in-store. 
Much has been made about the blurring of the off-line and online worlds through digital payments. The agreement with Visa is an important step, allowing us to more fully participate in this powerful secular shift with our mobile-first strategy, complemented by Visa's in-store strengths. 
We have an expansive vision for PayPal, including being an everyday part of our customers' financial lives. Customer choice, as we refer to it, involves empowering our customers to use PayPal where they want to pay and how they want to pay, and is the vehicle for achieving that vision.
For the remainder of 2016, we do not anticipate any material impact to our results from the movement to choice. Beginning next year, we expect the changes to our funding mix from customer choice will increase transaction expense, but at the same time, we believe expanding customer choice will unlock future revenue opportunities. 
Moving to customer choice and our agreement with Visa, laid the foundation for sustainable revenue growth, with more certainty in our cost structure. It's very early on and we're only 6 months through the year. As we get closer to year-end, we will provide more detail on the impact of this and how it affects our 2017 performance.
Finally, I'd like to discuss our financial guidance for the third quarter and full year. Our strong performance in the first half of the year across our core business, Braintree and P2P, in addition to our growing mobile penetration, further validates our strategies and our business priorities. As a result, we are raising our full year 2016 revenue guidance to $10.75 billion to $10.85 billion or 19% to 20% growth on a currency-neutral basis. We are also narrowing the non-GAAP earnings range to $1.47 to $1.50 per share, representing growth of 18% at the high end of the range. 
And we are reaffirming our full year prior 2016 guidance on free cash flow, CapEx and non-GAAP effective tax rate. For the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $2.6 billion to $2.67 billion or 19% to 21% growth on a currency-neutral basis. And we expect non-GAAP earnings of $0.33 to $0.35 per share.
In conclusion, our second quarter results demonstrate the continued progress we are making in our business. Revenue is strong and we're combining that with excellent cost control to generate healthy margins and strong free cash flow. We continue to allocate capital in a way that generates shareholder value. And our partnership with Visa has removed an overhang on our business, giving us greater cost certainty going forward, allowing us to profitably participate in the off-line market and creating the foundation for being a customer champion.
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions. Thank you."

Thanks for your question. So we're very excited about the partnership with Visa. I think it's very important to understand that, I think as Charlie said on the Visa call, partnerships like the one we announced today work best when there's alignment for everyone. And we believe that we've designed an agreement that works for PayPal, Visa and the issuers. We have been in discussions with issuers, Visa has been in discussions with its issuers, and they're excited about the benefit from the volumes that we can bring to them and that we can bring to point-of-sale. And as Charlie pointed out, this agreement removes many of the concerns, if not all of the concerns, that issuers and others in the ecosystem has about working with PayPal. Choice is something that everybody has been talking about. What issuers want, what we want is the ability for a consumer to make a choice, to have options as to what payment tender type they want to pay with. What that basically means is that a consumer could pay with their credit, with ACH, with debit, with cash, with P2P, with PayPal Credit, any of those, but it's the option of the consumer to make that choice. And then when you add on top of that optionality the fact that we are very willing and happy to share the same sorts of data that somebody would get with a typical credit card swipe back to the networks, back to the issuers and to customers, that's exactly what issuers have been asking for. We actually think that this deal that we have with Visa offers a couple of benefits. Obviously, it offers access to tokens at rates that are comparable to other contactless methods out there, and so we can compete with anybody now at point-of-sale. There's no competitive disadvantage to anybody else out there, and we can go off-line profitably. Second, we get fee certainty, as we talked about, know targeting -- targeted actions against PayPal's limits on new fees, even industry-based fees and volume-based discounts. So we have certainty around our cost structure. And very importantly, I think this opens us up to new partnerships. New partnerships with issuers, networks and others. Choice and data turn us into their friends. And when I think about the partnerships that we have, we're an ideal distribution mechanism to drive more online and mobile spend to issuers. They're an ideal partner to drive incremental net adds in customers into the PayPal platform. That's a win-win for both of us. And this is going to open up a new chapter for PayPal to partner with and for all of us to work together to advance digital payments going forward. And as I mentioned in my remarks and John mentioned, choice also is going to help us drive incremental new net adds. We're already seeing that in some of the changes we've made to our onboarding. When you look at One Touch and you see what our customers do when they're able to default a payment mechanism, their engagement goes up, their conversion rates go up. And obviously, when a customer gets to choose what instrument they want, we're going to see less calls come into customer care for us, we're going to see customer satisfaction go up, and typically, when that happens, customer churn goes down. So we think this is a very strong agreement that benefits Visa, its issuers and us, allows us to work within the ecosystem. And the issuers don't need to sign any unique agreements with us. It's simply an opt-in to participate with us. It's no additional work from them. And our movement to choice, data sharing, plus our commitment to quality, I think, puts us on par with others that are using Visa tokens in the ecosystem."

But maybe, George, I can give you a construct or a framework to kind of think about this because I understand why you're asking the question. If you consider we have, just rough order of magnitude, $300 billion of TPV today. And if you were to look at a funding shift on that, that would overstate the effect of a funding shift. Because this agreement, for now, is U.S.-only and as we disclosed in the past, that's roughly half of our TPV. We also see differences in funding mix between P2P versus goods and services, so you've got to strip that out or at least treat that differently. And we disclosed earlier this year that P2P is roughly $40 billion of our annual TPV. And then lastly, you need to also consider that there's a large percentage of our customers today that only have a card in their wallet. So choice for them would -- there'd be no other increase in cost by moving -- by adding additional card, doing a different card. So that -- from the cost side, that's the right framework to think about this."

But you're right, it just takes some time for this to be implemented and to move forward. And so our guidance incorporates any impact that there might be from customer choice. And as John mentioned, we will wait until we get closer to 2017 to give 2017 guidance. First of all, obviously, we'll take a look at consumer behavior as a result of this. There are a number of discussions going on in the ecosystem and we want to look at the totality of the landscape before we really talk about what 2017 could look like. And finally, we're halfway through the year, we got a full -- another 6 months to execute against and let's see how our momentum takes us before we provide 2017 guidance. And on the merchant side. Merchants have been working with us quite closely as we're creating a platform for them to take advantage of digital commerce. And that basically means letting a merchant write their own application, and we power that application through a platform that enables them to extend a value proposition to their customers online, on mobile and in-store. And part of that in-store environment, when it comes to the PayPal wallet, we did not have a tokenization scheme. We could use different forms of that. And so from a merchant perspective, the rates now that we can offer on an in-store point-of-sale transaction are significantly more competitive for them. And so it just strengthens our position in terms of working with merchants. No change in our strategy, but it certainly strengthens it and opens up a wide opportunity for us. As we talk about the blurring of online and off-line coming together, this really opens up our ability to move into any context, whether it be online, in-app or in-store with our digital wallet."

And so all of those are now coming together and being integrated so that we can offer merchants the ability to look across any of those context and use our platform to power and enable their move to digital commerce. Then what we've done, obviously, is because our base is so large, we take our branded PayPal wallet, which now is available to go into more context, as I just mentioned, and light up those applications because we have so many subscribers that we can bring to those merchants. And so you've got a platform play that's really unbranded that supports a merchant's move into digital commerce and then a branded wallet.

With respect to the increase in transaction expense, we'll give more specific guidance as we get towards the end of the year about 2017. But when you look at both the revenue benefit, as well as the good demonstrated cost control that we -- that you've seen for several quarters now, and just look at the over 180 basis points of leverage this quarter, the fact that our operating expenses, if you normalize for the Xoom acquisition, only went up 7% in the quarter, we can continue to demonstrate that we have a laser-focus on discipline here while still not starving the business for investment as well. We're making sure that we're continuing to invest organically. So all that in combination gives us a level of comfort with this but it's absolutely the right thing to do for the business.

We're providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being broadcast on the Internet, and both the presentation and call are available through the Investor Relations section of our website.
In discussing year-over-year comparisons, including guidance growth rates for the full year 2016, we have chosen to present non-GAAP pro forma metrics because we believe that these metrics provide investors a consistent basis for reviewing the company's performance across different periods. We will also discuss some non-GAAP measures when talking about our company's performance, including the non-GAAP pro forma metrics mentioned above. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP metrics to the most directly comparable GAAP metrics in the presentation accompanying this conference call.
In addition, management will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions; and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include our guidance for fourth quarter and full year 2016 as well as our outlook for 2017 and the next 3 years. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in this call. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our operating results in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and available on the Investor Relations section of our website.

I'm pleased to say that PayPal delivered another quarter of strong results. We made significant strides in the quarter, forging new partnerships and delivering continued innovation to our customers. We feel well positioned for future growth and profitability.
I'll start my remarks with our financial performance. In the quarter, we reported $0.35 of non-GAAP EPS, at the high end of our non-GAAP guidance of $0.33 to $0.35. We delivered $2.67 billion in revenues, an increase of 21% over last year on an FX-neutral basis. And we generated $618 million in free cash flow. We increased the number of active customers and accelerated their engagement on the PayPal platform. We finished the quarter with 192 million active customer accounts, adding 19 million new accounts in the past 12 months. And transactions per account continued to increase, reaching 30 for the first time, up from 27 a year ago. In the quarter, PayPal processed over $87 billion in total payment volume, up 28% over last year on an FX-neutral basis.
These results reinforce our belief that the opportunities for PayPal to grow and gain share have never been greater. We are executing against our strategic plan with intensity and speed, and we are committed to seizing the opportunities in front of us by truly embracing the mantle of Customer Champion.
Being a customer champion means always prioritizing the needs of our customers. It means continually reexamining our business to improve the customer experience on our platform and to provide real differentiated value to both consumers and merchants. By making customer choice a priority for PayPal, we are creating a significantly better customer experience to accelerate adoption and drive engagement. In the quarter, we made meaningful progress in offering customer choice in our online and mobile checkout and in our P2P experiences. These have enhanced how our customers in the U.S. can send money, shop and pay with PayPal. Our customers are now able to set their preferred funding type in their PayPal Wallet to sources other than their PayPal balance. This gives customers the option to default to their favorite debit card, bank account or credit card, and we've seen a corresponding increase in engagement. And as we have demonstrated over the past several months, customer choice is also allowing us to forge valuable, new strategic partnerships across the ecosystem.
Since our announced agreement with Visa, we have also entered into a strategic partnership with Mastercard, which offers consumers greater choice and flexibility to manage or move their money. It ensures that Mastercard cardholders can easily identify and choose Mastercard within the PayPal Wallet. Our joint U.S. customers will be able to use their tokenization services to make in-store purchases at Mastercard's contactless-enabled merchant locations around the world. And along with our agreement with Visa, the deal with Mastercard exempts PayPal from current or future digital wallet fees and provides cost certainty for years to come. Thanks to our agreements with Visa and Mastercard, PayPal now has a seamless, quick and simple way to activate PayPal payments at the point of sale.
Our agreements with the payment networks are opening the doors to deeper and more engaged conversations with a host of financial institutions about how to drive incremental spend for their brands; and better, more innovative experiences for our mutual customers. These conversations have been very positive, and we are encouraged by the progress we are making in partnering with issuers.
We also are significantly extending our previous agreements with Alibaba. We just launched the first stages of becoming a payment option on Alibaba's global retail marketplace AliExpress. This partnership has the potential to drive meaningful cross-border traffic as PayPal consumers outside of China shop on AliExpress merchants in China. And while we are excited about these new and expanded partnerships, we are equally pleased with the progress we are making with previously announced partners such as American Móvil (sic) [ América Móvil ], which is set to go live this quarter. We are working with American Móvil to help their more than 140 million customers in Mexico and Brazil manage and move money with their Telcel and Claro digital wallets powered by PayPal's platform.
We also deepened our existing relationships with some of the world's leading technology companies, including Facebook and Apple. With Apple's new iOS 10, Venmo users with iPhones can now ask Siri to send and request money from friends and also send P2P payments within the messages app. These new experiences make sending and receiving money even easier and increase the relevance of Venmo by introducing the service in more context than ever before.
With each partnership agreement that we sign or extend, we further expand the ubiquity and value of the PayPal brand and move closer towards our vision of becoming an everyday essential financial service for people around the world.
We believe offering consumers choice in how they want to pay and where they want to pay is essential in becoming an everyday part of a customer's financial life. As we've shared previously, the average Venmo user already interacts with the app more than 2 times per week, and we are beginning to see some additional proof points that our strategy and partnerships are moving us towards our long-term engagement goals. For instance, our initial launch into Spain with Vodafone and Visa which provides customers the chance to pay online, in-app and in-store is already generating over 6 in-store transactions per month per active user. And the PayPal Vodafone service is now available in Italy and the U.K. We also made a further announcement with Visa to include the integration of Visa Checkout into Braintree. Braintree also announced several other new payment options in Q3, including Apple Pay for Web, Mastercard Masterpass, China UnionPay and PayPal Credit.
Another way we're executing against our Customer Champion vision is by being a true payments partner to our merchants to help them succeed in an increasingly connected and mobile-centric world. Mobile technology continues to raise the line that divides online from offline, and commerce is moving into an entirely new context. PayPal helps merchants navigate this disruptive environment and is increasingly the payments partner of choice to merchants of all sizes. We continue to move aggressively towards our goal of processing 100% share of checkout for merchants. This strategic focus enabled PayPal to grow its market share during the quarter. Our merchant services payment volumes once again grew faster than the growth of e-commerce. Merchant services payment volume grew to $73 billion in the third quarter, up 34% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis. And PayPal also continued its strong growth in mobile payments. In the quarter, we processed $26 billion in mobile payments, up 56% over last year. Mobile continues to become an increasingly relevant part of our platform, now representing approximately 30% of our volume. We are on track to process well over $100 billion in mobile payment volume in the next 12 months. This is a remarkable achievement considering we've cumulatively processed some $200 billion in mobile volume over the past 10 years.
Our growth online and in mobile is being driven by some of the world's top merchants choosing PayPal. These include the American Red Cross, which expanded their integration with PayPal to include our mass-pay products. We also worked with the American Red Cross in the quarter to support flood relief efforts in Louisiana by waiving our fees on the donations raised. H&M, the global fashion retailer, launched with PayPal as a payment option on its websites in France, Italy, Spain and the U.K. Costco de México became the first subsidiary of the global membership-only Warehouse Club to integrate PayPal as a payment method for its online store. Yandex.Direct, the paid search platform for Yandex, Russia's most popular search engine, went live with PayPal. And we expanded our relationship with Uber to make PayPal a way to pay for rides in Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Chile, Uruguay, Peru and Brazil. Braintree also added numerous new merchants, including Six Flags and Yelp.
Being a customer champion demands constant innovation for our customers. As One Touch demonstrates, when you create truly transformative experiences, you drive engagement. We now have more than 32 million consumers and more than 4 million merchants using One Touch. By the end of the year, we now expect 5 million merchant accounts to be offering One Touch to approximately 36 million consumer accounts.
Venmo continues to expand its reach and is becoming a daily part of the lives of mobile- and social media-connected consumers. In the quarter, Venmo processed $4.9 billion in volume, an increase of 131% year-over-year. It is now just shy of a $20 billion annual run rate. We are excited that Pay with Venmo is now generally available to all Venmo users, and we are pleased that giving users a new way to use their Venmo accounts is resulting in increased engagement. Early data suggests that people who use Pay with Venmo are approximately 30% more engaged than other Venmo users. And we are now ready to more rapidly expand the number of merchants accepting Venmo as we exit 2016 and go into next year.
Xoom is also driving significant innovations. Xoom recently added a new request feature which allows remittances to become a 2-way interaction between senders and receivers for the first time. Remittance recipients in 29 countries can now request funds, bill payments or mobile reloads from customers in the U.S. through the Xoom platform. Additionally, PayPal customers can now link their PayPal and Xoom accounts, giving customers access to their PayPal funding sources within Xoom. This will allow PayPal's U.S. customers to send funds to multiple new markets and get access to new services. As we shared at the time of the acquisition, cross-selling Xoom to our U.S. PayPal customers is a meaningful way to drive additional adoption and engagement with PayPal's 87 million active U.S. customers.
And in the third quarter, Paydiant launched an exciting, new mobile payment experience created for the Autogrill group in Italy. Autogrill is the world's leading provider of food and beverage services for travelers, operating mainly in airports, on highways and in railway stations. This international application of Paydiant's technology was made possible by PayPal's global reach and the integration of our platforms.
But finally, the third quarter saw PayPal receive some remarkable industry recognition. Venmo was named as 1 of Interbrand's Breakthrough Brands in their 2016 ranking of 60 companies that are younger than 10 years old but are driving significant change by creating new experiences for consumers. PayPal gained 7 spots and increased its brand value by 14% on the 2016 Interbrand Best Global Brands ranking, making PayPal once again 1 of the 100 most valuable brands in the world. I'm also pleased to announce that PayPal has been included on Fortune's 2016 Change the World list, a ranking of 50 companies that are doing well by doing good. This is a meaningful recognition for the PayPal team, and we are very proud of achieving the #19 spot on that list. And finally, Group XP, a part of WPP, named PayPal as 1 of the top 3 consumer experience brands in the world based on branding, design, content, online presence and user experience.
The past 6 months have been historic ones for us. We have embarked on a course that enables us to become a true customer champion. We are partnering across multiple ecosystems, from retailers to OEMs, to wireless carriers, technology companies and with financial institutions and networks. We strongly believe that this positions us for long-term growth and profitability. Consequently, we are increasing our 3-year outlook for revenue to 16% to 17% FX-neutral growth in contrast to the 15% previously guided. We expect our free cash flow to grow in line with our revenue growth. And importantly, we believe our non-GAAP operating margin will be stable to growing. John will provide more details on our outlook in his portion of the call.
In the past 2 years, in the face of one competitive announcement after another, we have attracted 35 million net new active accounts. Our engagement per active account has grown from 24 to 30 times per year. Our merchant base now totals 15 million active accounts, and our mobile payments volume and unique innovative capabilities continue to drive our growth. We believe the partnerships we've signed enable us to clearly, predictably and profitably pursue the $100 trillion total addressable market that is slowly but surely digitizing. I believe we now have the platform, capabilities, scale and partnerships to enable us to drive profitable growth not just next year but over the medium and long term.
And with that, let me turn the call to John."

I also want to thank all of PayPal's customers and our employees worldwide for making this another great quarter.
As Dan discussed, in the third quarter, we made great strides executing against our Customer Champion strategy and partnering across the payments ecosystem to drive ubiquity. We enhanced our value proposition for both consumers and merchants and laid the groundwork for long-term sustainable growth across our platform.
First, I will walk you through the financial highlights for our third quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, total payment volume increased 28% to $87 billion. U.S. payment volume grew 25% and international volume grew 30%. Our merchant services business grew 34% to $73 billion, primarily driven by core, Braintree and Venmo. We ended the quarter with 192 million active accounts, adding 4.4 million active customer accounts in the quarter and increasing our active accounts by 11% from the third quarter last year. Our core PayPal business, Venmo and Xoom are strong contributors to account growth. The number of payment transactions per account increased to 30, up 13%. Increased engagement in conjunction with continued double-digit growth in active accounts resulted in payment transaction growth of 24% year-over-year.
In the third quarter, we generated revenue of $2.67 billion, up 21% on a currency-neutral basis and 18% on a spot basis. Q3 revenue growth accelerated both sequentially and year-over-year as a result of strong performance in our core business and Braintree. Transaction revenue increased 20% on a currency-neutral basis in the quarter. Performance was driven by growth in our core business and in particular with large merchants and strength in the Braintree business. This resulted in a transaction take rate of 2.65% for the third quarter. The 19 basis point decline was primarily driven by the growth of our P2P business and the mix shift towards Braintree and larger merchants.
Revenue from other value-added services grew 28% versus last year, driven by growth in our credit products.
In the quarter, transaction expense and transaction and loan losses were $830 million and $271 million, respectively. In the aggregate, these volume-based expenses increased 29%, resulting in a transaction margin of 58.7% versus 62.3% in Q3 '15. The transaction margin decline year-over-year was primarily driven by the mix shift in our business toward Braintree and increased provisions in our credit business, partially offset by Xoom.
As we have discussed previously, in the third quarter, we made investments to further drive customer acquisition and engagement and in our compliance efforts and corporate functions, which increased operating expenses in the quarter. Despite these investments, other operating expenses grew 13%, well below revenue growth; and drove 200 basis points of leverage. To give you a bit more color on our non-GAAP operating expenses in the quarter, I will quickly run through the line items.
Customer support and operations expense was $304 million. Sales and marketing expense was $212 million. Product development was $181 million. G&A costs were $229 million, and depreciation and amortization expenses were $150 million [ph]. Excluding the acquisition of Xoom, our other operating expenses increased only 9% or approximately half the rate of revenue growth, once again demonstrating good cost control. We continue to be focused on expense discipline and see significant opportunities to manage our other expense line items over time.
In the third quarter, leverage in our other operating expenses partially offset the transaction margin decline, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 18.4% and non-GAAP operating income of $490 million.
Our third quarter non-GAAP effective tax rate was 15.3% versus 17.7% in Q3 '15, due primarily to discrete tax items.
Non-GAAP EPS grew 14% to $0.35 for the quarter.
Strong cash earnings generation resulted in 19% growth in free cash flow year-over-year. Our free cash flow for the third quarter was $618 million, representing $0.23 of free cash flow for every $1 of revenue. Third quarter capital expenditures were $183 million or approximately 7% of revenue.
During the quarter, we returned approximately $50 million to shareholders by buying back an additional 1.3 million shares. Year-to-date, we have returned approximately $945 million to shareholders by repurchasing 26 million shares at an average price of $36.37. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $6.4 billion, including approximately $1.3 billion in the U.S.
At the end of the third quarter, the total outstanding balances in our pool of consumer and merchant receivables were $4.5 billion and $581 million, respectively. For our consumer portfolio, the principal charge-off rate in the quarter was 6%, and we recognized $114 million as a provision for loan losses. The balance amount of our allowance for consumer loans and interest receivable is now $282 million. We've frequently spoken about moving to an asset-light credit strategy. I am pleased to say that we recently signed a strategic partnership agreement with Latitude Financial Services to develop new consumer financing products for PayPal's customers in Australia. The relationship will leverage PayPal's strengths and technology, but the receivables will be funded by Latitude. We'll share more on this as well as a more comprehensive off-balance-sheet strategy as we move through 2017.
As Dan mentioned, given the partnerships we've established, the response we've seen in our platform to the initial rollout of our choice experiences and the ongoing momentum in our business, we are better positioned today to provide you with an updated 3-year outlook as well as a framework for how to begin thinking about 2017.
Over the next 3 years, we expect total payment volume growth of mid-20% on a currency-neutral basis. We are raising our outlook for revenue growth to 16% to 17% on a currency-neutral basis, up from the 15% which we shared at Analyst Day in May of this year. We expect operating margins to be stable to growing on a non-GAAP basis. We also expect free cash flow to grow in line with revenue. Further, as we pursue a more asset-light credit strategy, we expect less of our free cash flow to be directed towards funding credit in the future.
For 2017, we estimate our revenue growth to be in line with our updated 3-year outlook or 16% to 17% on a currency-neutral basis. We also expect that the incremental expense related to our customer choice initiatives will be offset by other revenue and cost initiatives, resulting in an operating margin consistent with full year 2016. More detailed guidance for 2017 will be provided when we report fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings.
Finally, I would like to discuss our financial guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2016. Year-to-date, we have delivered strong performance and outstanding growth across our platform. For the full year, we expect revenue in a range of $10.78 billion to $10.85 billion or 20% growth on a currency-neutral basis. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share in a range of $1.48 to $1.50, representing growth of 18% at the high end. We now expect free cash flow for the full year to exceed $2.2 billion. We are also reaffirming our prior year -- prior full year 2016 guidance on CapEx and non-GAAP effective tax rate.
For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $2.92 billion to $2.99 billion or a 16% to 19% growth on a currency-neutral basis, and we expect non-GAAP earnings of $0.40 to $0.42 per share.
In conclusion, our third quarter results demonstrate our ability to deliver exceptional revenue growth and free cash flow while advancing our strategic priorities. Our scale affords us continued leverage opportunities across our other operating expenses. 
In addition, the cash flow-generating power of this business gives us great flexibility as we allocate capital with discipline.
We are focused on creating value for our shareholders and strengthening our position as the world's leading digital payments platform for our customers.
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions. Thank you."

I think it's important to get context here. Credit is a very small part of our business. It's about 2% of our overall volume, but it's also a very important part of our business. It complements a holistic set of payment offerings for our customers and our merchants ask for it to be integrated into the checkout experience because they see firsthand that the benefits of improved conversion and higher basket size. That said, as I discussed in my prepared remarks, we can obtain a lot of the benefits from credit by doing it in a more asset-light way which we'll disclose more about later. But overall, we're very comfortable with the performance of our portfolio and I would suggest that it's in line with our expectations. We did increase our provision. And as I discussed on the last earnings call, we have seen some deterioration in our late stage delinquencies. But we've also seen a lot of signs of health too in that our weighted average FICO scores improved from the last quarter. We've also seen the lowest quarterly charge-off rate in 4 quarters this year. We were averagely coming off of historic lows in credit and I think getting to something that is a more normalized rate going forward, but that rate is very consistent with both our underwriting expectations as well as our return goals for the business, so we're comfortable with credit. Thinking longer-term about what we do, the agreement with Latitude is a good indication of how we're thinking about moving forward with credit. We also can do something with our existing portfolio and we've got several different options that we're evaluating. Some of those take time because they could be bigger in nature and we plan to discuss those in the coming quarters."

Specifically, you asked about the effect of hedging in the quarter. Hedging was about 1 point of EPS for the quarter versus last year for us. Our hedge gain was about $28 million to $30 million in the quarter and it was $10 million to $15 million higher last year, so that certainly affected the margin performance in the quarter. But I would -- we want to emphasize though that we indicated this when we gave the guidance last time in the last call. We made some investments in our business in the quarter. And there you typically think of the seasonality of our business. Our fourth quarter can be 15% to 20% larger than the third quarter. And so we tend to step up in certain areas to prepare for that. We're also -- we look at the opportunity that we have in front of us which everyone recognizes with the huge addressable market. That does require some investing and we're not going to shy away from that. We've indicated that we expect margins to be stable to growing over time, but we're not going to be a slave to margin performance from 1 quarter to the next, particularly if it means that it's at the expense of investing in the business. That said, we also recognize that we don't get a pass from the market and we're going to continue to drive revenue growth and earnings performance like we've seen. With respect to some of our products, we've got a host of different things that Bill and his team are working on. I wouldn't necessarily pinpoint credit as the opportunity in terms of product expansion next year. We're thinking more broadly just in terms of how we can offer on the types of products and experiences for our customers."

And we are seeing very good momentum in the business right now. Bill and his team have put into place over the course of this year a number of new services, a number of new products. We've upgraded a lot of our flows by the upgrading of our platform. And so we see a tremendous amount of momentum coming into the business. Obviously, as we think about choice, we think about choice more over the medium and the longer-term pieces of this in terms of its impact in terms of growth for us. And so as we think about next year, we think really that's the momentum of the business, carrying us into that as we think further out. Obviously, the increased adoption, engagement and the other services and offerings that we're putting out beyond choice that will go into the market will all fuel that growth. And then on the margin side, as Dan mentioned, we feel we have a lot of room in our cost structure, a lot of OpEx room. But we also, in addition to that, are putting out new services, new enhancements that have increased margins associated with them.

So we're trying to be reasonably conservative on the -- on what we will see next year from that. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, and then Bill can expand on this, we are having quite a number of conversations with issuers, both large and small, in terms of ways that we can partner together. I'll let Bill get into the details of that. But the overall tender of those discussions are extremely positive. And one other thing I would just say before I turn it to Bill is with the tokenization schema that we have from the networks, the issuers don't need to do anything. They just need to opt into it. So we don't need to put out announcements for every one of these, and we don't plan to go and do that either. There'll be some that we'll announce, no doubt. But the majority of those, since there's really nothing that needs to be done, usually just needs to opt in, we'll just start to implement. Bill?"

We're able to do and deliver value to our customers in the ecosystem without them having to do work on their end. So this isn't really a framework of a lot of one-off announcements but one where we set a framework of how we work with the broader industry. And we're seeing from experiences we've rolled out already that as was mentioned earlier on the call by Dan and John, engagement list, those types of things that we have been seeing from consumer choice even ahead of our deals with Visa and MasterCard and the broader ecosystem, we're seeing those things play out in a way that's very much in line with how we thought about going into choice overall."

So let me take the more strategic part of that question, which is where we see ourselves going. And then turn over to Bill to talk exquisitely around where we are in the Customer Choice roll out piece of it. And so we've talked a little bit about PayPal moving from being well beyond just about a nanowebsite to really 2 things. For merchants, we want to be a full-service solution provider. As the world move towards mobile, merchants are looking to write applications, the big advantage of that mobile across online, in-app, mobile web and in-store. And they're trying to create those applications to enable them to get closer to consumers and create distinct differentiated value propositions. We think we want to power those applications with our platform. We want to do a 100% share of checkout. We want to integrate rewards capabilities through API and toolsets into our platform. We want to integrate contextual commerce into our platform, put credit into our platform so that merchants of all sizes can write the applications to get them closer to their customers and we can power that with our platform. And then we take the extensive number of consumers we have, the 177 million consumers we have, on top of the 15 million merchants we have. And we drive those consumers in a friction-free way to be able to sign up for those merchant apps. So we're really trying to be a much more extensive partner to merchants as they make this change in a mobile-centric world, things like the One Touch and conversion rate and all of that is tremendously powerful for them. On the consumer side, we are looking to be much more in the middle of how consumers manage and move money. We've talked about our longer-term engagement goals which are to go from of our 2.5 times a month, we were 2 times a month when we started that, but to go to something like 2 times a week. And we know that's a longer term goal. But if you look at what we've done with choice and enabling consumers to not just say how they want but where they want. And this is why I gave the example in Spain. I mean, it's obviously very early days and not a significant number of customers yet. But those customers just offline are using the service 6 times a month on there. So you can start to see that engagement. And we are looking at a host of other things. We've now integrated into Xoom, so that U.S. customers of PayPal can now use international remittances. It's another service offering on top of that and I don't want to give away any future hands right now on the call, but you can expect us to continue to grow the set of offerings that we give to consumers. And so as you look out over the medium term, you can expect us to continue to expand and grow our business, not just take the business we have and follow the tailwinds of digitization which will really drive that."

As we've discussed previously, I call out that many of those core concepts we have been testing even prior to these deals. And so we have rolled out, I would say, much of the core concepts of choice. Dan called out one of those earlier in the call around the ability to pay with things other than your PayPal balance. And as we have rolled those out, importantly, we're seeing consumer behavior on those really in line with how we expected that to play out from our prior testing around these things. So very much going as planned on that front. And then as we come into next year, we'll have some more of these things that will sort of layer in as we come into the first half of next year but the core concepts around users being able to pay however they want and us not influencing them or requiring them to use things like our preference, those core concepts have been implemented and we're seeing consumer behavior as we would've expected from our prior testing around those things. And finally, I would just call out some of the really beneficial points around what we get from those: access to tokens, instant withdrawals, those types of things we expect to have coming as we get into the first half of next year."

Choice was a proactive strategic choice we made well before we started into negotiations with the networks. Actually our move to choice enabled us to open those conversations and to really start to think about how do we become the allies with financial institutions and networks to drive digital payments together. And I mentioned in my remarks the elimination of digital wallet fees and the cost certainty, Bill talked about tokens, and that allows us to move in a very seamless way into in-store environments, but it also enabled us to have equivalent of what you would think of this card present rates coming into the in-store environment. It's a profitable way for us to move into the in-store environment. And the other thing, we obviously got some network discounts on top of that as well as instant access to funds with some of the who's trying to remove funds from their PayPal account through their bank account. And that was an important value proposition gap that we had. And we saw in other countries like the U.K. where we do have that today that people actually increased their balance on the PayPal platform when they know they can take that money off instantaneously. So it's a little counterintuitive to what most people are seeing but we've got a lot of experience and know-how in that."

You talked about Venmo users are of a much higher frequency. But I want to parse that with the types of merchant relationships that you're now able to engage in. Because it would seem as though from the legacy business you're in with eBay, you didn't have a lot of frequency with those merchants. You might go to eBay a lot but you don't necessarily go to those merchants a lot. And the announcements you guys keep making seem like just the consumer proposition to go back to that same merchant seems materially higher. So I'm just trying to think about how do those 2 kind of, I guess, shifts drive kind of the forward look."

I'll first start off that obviously, eBay is a large and incredibly important customer to us. We work hand in hand with that team to try and drive as much business as possible through that partnership. But obviously, as we split apart from eBay, part of the premise of that was that, as a truly neutral third-party digital payments platform that we could partner with numerous merchants and retailers that might have seen the relationship that we have with eBay as competitive to them and so that we wouldn't have been independent. I think a great example of that is Alibaba. We have been nurturing that relationship with them. We've done a couple of different announcements through the quarters. We started with wholesalers with them. But now really, AliExpress is the main marketplace of Alibaba, that's where really all their merchants are. And we've already started with PayPal being a payment option on that it's a really great example of it because we have great strengths outside of China with consumers. They have great strengths with merchants inside China. We're already a major cross-border player in the Chinese corridor. And so that match would never have happened have we not been an independent third party. And that's happening with numerous retailers as well especially as we expand our value proposition now to really appeal to a mobile-centric world that's 1 retailer after another of all sizes are thinking about."

So yes, we have new experiences like Venmo that are highly engaged. But we're also improving engagement on our core products. And interestingly, as you've seen from third-party validate, such as the comScore study that looked at PayPal conversion versus other new entrants to the market in standard checkout, our conversion nearly 40 points higher than our nearest competitor with us at 87.5% and the nearest competitor at 51%. That's an example of our increasing relevancy with consumers as they move to mobile and are demanding more and more seamless experiences as evidenced by the higher conversion rate that we have. So it is on multiple fronts that we're seeing that improvement in engagement. But the core product itself, we're seeing great increasing relevance with our consumers."

In discussing year-over-year comparisons, including guidance growth rates for the full year 2016, we have chosen to present non-GAAP pro forma metrics because we believe that these metrics provide investors a consistent basis for reviewing the company's performance across different periods. We will also discuss some non-GAAP measures when talking about our company's performance, including the non-GAAP pro forma metrics mentioned above. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP metrics to the most directly comparable GAAP metrics in the presentation accompanying this conference call.
In addition, management will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions; and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include our guidance for fourth quarter and full year 2016 as well as our outlook for 2017 and the next 3 years. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in this call. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our operating results in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and available on the Investor Relations section of our website.

I'm pleased to say that PayPal delivered another quarter of strong results. We made significant strides in the quarter, forging new partnerships and delivering continued innovation to our customers. We feel well positioned for future growth and profitability.
I'll start my remarks with our financial performance. In the quarter, we reported $0.35 of non-GAAP EPS, at the high end of our non-GAAP guidance of $0.33 to $0.35. We delivered $2.67 billion in revenues, an increase of 21% over last year on an FX-neutral basis. And we generated $618 million in free cash flow. We increased the number of active customers and accelerated their engagement on the PayPal platform. We finished the quarter with 192 million active customer accounts, adding 19 million new accounts in the past 12 months. And transactions per account continued to increase, reaching 30 for the first time, up from 27 a year ago. In the quarter, PayPal processed over $87 billion in total payment volume, up 28% over last year on an FX-neutral basis.
These results reinforce our belief that the opportunities for PayPal to grow and gain share have never been greater. We are executing against our strategic plan with intensity and speed, and we are committed to seizing the opportunities in front of us by truly embracing the mantle of Customer Champion.
Being a customer champion means always prioritizing the needs of our customers. It means continually reexamining our business to improve the customer experience on our platform and to provide real differentiated value to both consumers and merchants. By making customer choice a priority for PayPal, we are creating a significantly better customer experience to accelerate adoption and drive engagement. In the quarter, we made meaningful progress in offering customer choice in our online and mobile checkout and in our P2P experiences. These have enhanced how our customers in the U.S. can send money, shop and pay with PayPal. Our customers are now able to set their preferred funding type in their PayPal Wallet to sources other than their PayPal balance. This gives customers the option to default to their favorite debit card, bank account or credit card, and we've seen a corresponding increase in engagement. And as we have demonstrated over the past several months, customer choice is also allowing us to forge valuable, new strategic partnerships across the ecosystem.
Since our announced agreement with Visa, we have also entered into a strategic partnership with Mastercard, which offers consumers greater choice and flexibility to manage or move their money. It ensures that Mastercard cardholders can easily identify and choose Mastercard within the PayPal Wallet. Our joint U.S. customers will be able to use their tokenization services to make in-store purchases at Mastercard's contactless-enabled merchant locations around the world. And along with our agreement with Visa, the deal with Mastercard exempts PayPal from current or future digital wallet fees and provides cost certainty for years to come. Thanks to our agreements with Visa and Mastercard, PayPal now has a seamless, quick and simple way to activate PayPal payments at the point of sale.
Our agreements with the payment networks are opening the doors to deeper and more engaged conversations with a host of financial institutions about how to drive incremental spend for their brands; and better, more innovative experiences for our mutual customers. These conversations have been very positive, and we are encouraged by the progress we are making in partnering with issuers.
We also are significantly extending our previous agreements with Alibaba. We just launched the first stages of becoming a payment option on Alibaba's global retail marketplace AliExpress. This partnership has the potential to drive meaningful cross-border traffic as PayPal consumers outside of China shop on AliExpress merchants in China. And while we are excited about these new and expanded partnerships, we are equally pleased with the progress we are making with previously announced partners such as American Móvil (sic) [ América Móvil ], which is set to go live this quarter. We are working with American Móvil to help their more than 140 million customers in Mexico and Brazil manage and move money with their Telcel and Claro digital wallets powered by PayPal's platform.
We also deepened our existing relationships with some of the world's leading technology companies, including Facebook and Apple. With Apple's new iOS 10, Venmo users with iPhones can now ask Siri to send and request money from friends and also send P2P payments within the messages app. These new experiences make sending and receiving money even easier and increase the relevance of Venmo by introducing the service in more context than ever before.
With each partnership agreement that we sign or extend, we further expand the ubiquity and value of the PayPal brand and move closer towards our vision of becoming an everyday essential financial service for people around the world.
We believe offering consumers choice in how they want to pay and where they want to pay is essential in becoming an everyday part of a customer's financial life. As we've shared previously, the average Venmo user already interacts with the app more than 2 times per week, and we are beginning to see some additional proof points that our strategy and partnerships are moving us towards our long-term engagement goals. For instance, our initial launch into Spain with Vodafone and Visa which provides customers the chance to pay online, in-app and in-store is already generating over 6 in-store transactions per month per active user. And the PayPal Vodafone service is now available in Italy and the U.K. We also made a further announcement with Visa to include the integration of Visa Checkout into Braintree. Braintree also announced several other new payment options in Q3, including Apple Pay for Web, Mastercard Masterpass, China UnionPay and PayPal Credit.
Another way we're executing against our Customer Champion vision is by being a true payments partner to our merchants to help them succeed in an increasingly connected and mobile-centric world. Mobile technology continues to raise the line that divides online from offline, and commerce is moving into an entirely new context. PayPal helps merchants navigate this disruptive environment and is increasingly the payments partner of choice to merchants of all sizes. We continue to move aggressively towards our goal of processing 100% share of checkout for merchants. This strategic focus enabled PayPal to grow its market share during the quarter. Our merchant services payment volumes once again grew faster than the growth of e-commerce. Merchant services payment volume grew to $73 billion in the third quarter, up 34% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis. And PayPal also continued its strong growth in mobile payments. In the quarter, we processed $26 billion in mobile payments, up 56% over last year. Mobile continues to become an increasingly relevant part of our platform, now representing approximately 30% of our volume. We are on track to process well over $100 billion in mobile payment volume in the next 12 months. This is a remarkable achievement considering we've cumulatively processed some $200 billion in mobile volume over the past 10 years.
Our growth online and in mobile is being driven by some of the world's top merchants choosing PayPal. These include the American Red Cross, which expanded their integration with PayPal to include our mass-pay products. We also worked with the American Red Cross in the quarter to support flood relief efforts in Louisiana by waiving our fees on the donations raised. H&M, the global fashion retailer, launched with PayPal as a payment option on its websites in France, Italy, Spain and the U.K. Costco de México became the first subsidiary of the global membership-only Warehouse Club to integrate PayPal as a payment method for its online store. Yandex.Direct, the paid search platform for Yandex, Russia's most popular search engine, went live with PayPal. And we expanded our relationship with Uber to make PayPal a way to pay for rides in Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Chile, Uruguay, Peru and Brazil. Braintree also added numerous new merchants, including Six Flags and Yelp.
Being a customer champion demands constant innovation for our customers. As One Touch demonstrates, when you create truly transformative experiences, you drive engagement. We now have more than 32 million consumers and more than 4 million merchants using One Touch. By the end of the year, we now expect 5 million merchant accounts to be offering One Touch to approximately 36 million consumer accounts.
Venmo continues to expand its reach and is becoming a daily part of the lives of mobile- and social media-connected consumers. In the quarter, Venmo processed $4.9 billion in volume, an increase of 131% year-over-year. It is now just shy of a $20 billion annual run rate. We are excited that Pay with Venmo is now generally available to all Venmo users, and we are pleased that giving users a new way to use their Venmo accounts is resulting in increased engagement. Early data suggests that people who use Pay with Venmo are approximately 30% more engaged than other Venmo users. And we are now ready to more rapidly expand the number of merchants accepting Venmo as we exit 2016 and go into next year.
Xoom is also driving significant innovations. Xoom recently added a new request feature which allows remittances to become a 2-way interaction between senders and receivers for the first time. Remittance recipients in 29 countries can now request funds, bill payments or mobile reloads from customers in the U.S. through the Xoom platform. Additionally, PayPal customers can now link their PayPal and Xoom accounts, giving customers access to their PayPal funding sources within Xoom. This will allow PayPal's U.S. customers to send funds to multiple new markets and get access to new services. As we shared at the time of the acquisition, cross-selling Xoom to our U.S. PayPal customers is a meaningful way to drive additional adoption and engagement with PayPal's 87 million active U.S. customers.
And in the third quarter, Paydiant launched an exciting, new mobile payment experience created for the Autogrill group in Italy. Autogrill is the world's leading provider of food and beverage services for travelers, operating mainly in airports, on highways and in railway stations. This international application of Paydiant's technology was made possible by PayPal's global reach and the integration of our platforms.
But finally, the third quarter saw PayPal receive some remarkable industry recognition. Venmo was named as 1 of Interbrand's Breakthrough Brands in their 2016 ranking of 60 companies that are younger than 10 years old but are driving significant change by creating new experiences for consumers. PayPal gained 7 spots and increased its brand value by 14% on the 2016 Interbrand Best Global Brands ranking, making PayPal once again 1 of the 100 most valuable brands in the world. I'm also pleased to announce that PayPal has been included on Fortune's 2016 Change the World list, a ranking of 50 companies that are doing well by doing good. This is a meaningful recognition for the PayPal team, and we are very proud of achieving the #19 spot on that list. And finally, Group XP, a part of WPP, named PayPal as 1 of the top 3 consumer experience brands in the world based on branding, design, content, online presence and user experience.
The past 6 months have been historic ones for us. We have embarked on a course that enables us to become a true customer champion. We are partnering across multiple ecosystems, from retailers to OEMs, to wireless carriers, technology companies and with financial institutions and networks. We strongly believe that this positions us for long-term growth and profitability. Consequently, we are increasing our 3-year outlook for revenue to 16% to 17% FX-neutral growth in contrast to the 15% previously guided. We expect our free cash flow to grow in line with our revenue growth. And importantly, we believe our non-GAAP operating margin will be stable to growing. John will provide more details on our outlook in his portion of the call.
In the past 2 years, in the face of one competitive announcement after another, we have attracted 35 million net new active accounts. Our engagement per active account has grown from 24 to 30 times per year. Our merchant base now totals 15 million active accounts, and our mobile payments volume and unique innovative capabilities continue to drive our growth. We believe the partnerships we've signed enable us to clearly, predictably and profitably pursue the $100 trillion total addressable market that is slowly but surely digitizing. I believe we now have the platform, capabilities, scale and partnerships to enable us to drive profitable growth not just next year but over the medium and long term.
And with that, let me turn the call to John."
112732,404368544,1058768,"PayPal Holdings, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2016",2016-10-20,"Earnings Calls","PayPal Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dan.I also want to thank all of PayPal's customers and our employees worldwide for making this another great quarter.As Dan discussed, in the third quarter, we made great strides executing against our Customer Champion strategy and partnering",1308,"Thanks, Dan.
I also want to thank all of PayPal's customers and our employees worldwide for making this another great quarter.
As Dan discussed, in the third quarter, we made great strides executing against our Customer Champion strategy and partnering across the payments ecosystem to drive ubiquity. We enhanced our value proposition for both consumers and merchants and laid the groundwork for long-term sustainable growth across our platform.
First, I will walk you through the financial highlights for our third quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, total payment volume increased 28% to $87 billion. U.S. payment volume grew 25% and international volume grew 30%. Our merchant services business grew 34% to $73 billion, primarily driven by core, Braintree and Venmo. We ended the quarter with 192 million active accounts, adding 4.4 million active customer accounts in the quarter and increasing our active accounts by 11% from the third quarter last year. Our core PayPal business, Venmo and Xoom are strong contributors to account growth. The number of payment transactions per account increased to 30, up 13%. Increased engagement in conjunction with continued double-digit growth in active accounts resulted in payment transaction growth of 24% year-over-year.
In the third quarter, we generated revenue of $2.67 billion, up 21% on a currency-neutral basis and 18% on a spot basis. Q3 revenue growth accelerated both sequentially and year-over-year as a result of strong performance in our core business and Braintree. Transaction revenue increased 20% on a currency-neutral basis in the quarter. Performance was driven by growth in our core business and in particular with large merchants and strength in the Braintree business. This resulted in a transaction take rate of 2.65% for the third quarter. The 19 basis point decline was primarily driven by the growth of our P2P business and the mix shift towards Braintree and larger merchants.
Revenue from other value-added services grew 28% versus last year, driven by growth in our credit products.
In the quarter, transaction expense and transaction and loan losses were $830 million and $271 million, respectively. In the aggregate, these volume-based expenses increased 29%, resulting in a transaction margin of 58.7% versus 62.3% in Q3 '15. The transaction margin decline year-over-year was primarily driven by the mix shift in our business toward Braintree and increased provisions in our credit business, partially offset by Xoom.
As we have discussed previously, in the third quarter, we made investments to further drive customer acquisition and engagement and in our compliance efforts and corporate functions, which increased operating expenses in the quarter. Despite these investments, other operating expenses grew 13%, well below revenue growth; and drove 200 basis points of leverage. To give you a bit more color on our non-GAAP operating expenses in the quarter, I will quickly run through the line items.
Customer support and operations expense was $304 million. Sales and marketing expense was $212 million. Product development was $181 million. G&A costs were $229 million, and depreciation and amortization expenses were $150 million [ph]. Excluding the acquisition of Xoom, our other operating expenses increased only 9% or approximately half the rate of revenue growth, once again demonstrating good cost control. We continue to be focused on expense discipline and see significant opportunities to manage our other expense line items over time.
In the third quarter, leverage in our other operating expenses partially offset the transaction margin decline, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 18.4% and non-GAAP operating income of $490 million.
Our third quarter non-GAAP effective tax rate was 15.3% versus 17.7% in Q3 '15, due primarily to discrete tax items.
Non-GAAP EPS grew 14% to $0.35 for the quarter.
Strong cash earnings generation resulted in 19% growth in free cash flow year-over-year. Our free cash flow for the third quarter was $618 million, representing $0.23 of free cash flow for every $1 of revenue. Third quarter capital expenditures were $183 million or approximately 7% of revenue.
During the quarter, we returned approximately $50 million to shareholders by buying back an additional 1.3 million shares. Year-to-date, we have returned approximately $945 million to shareholders by repurchasing 26 million shares at an average price of $36.37. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $6.4 billion, including approximately $1.3 billion in the U.S.
At the end of the third quarter, the total outstanding balances in our pool of consumer and merchant receivables were $4.5 billion and $581 million, respectively. For our consumer portfolio, the principal charge-off rate in the quarter was 6%, and we recognized $114 million as a provision for loan losses. The balance amount of our allowance for consumer loans and interest receivable is now $282 million. We've frequently spoken about moving to an asset-light credit strategy. I am pleased to say that we recently signed a strategic partnership agreement with Latitude Financial Services to develop new consumer financing products for PayPal's customers in Australia. The relationship will leverage PayPal's strengths and technology, but the receivables will be funded by Latitude. We'll share more on this as well as a more comprehensive off-balance-sheet strategy as we move through 2017.
As Dan mentioned, given the partnerships we've established, the response we've seen in our platform to the initial rollout of our choice experiences and the ongoing momentum in our business, we are better positioned today to provide you with an updated 3-year outlook as well as a framework for how to begin thinking about 2017.
Over the next 3 years, we expect total payment volume growth of mid-20% on a currency-neutral basis. We are raising our outlook for revenue growth to 16% to 17% on a currency-neutral basis, up from the 15% which we shared at Analyst Day in May of this year. We expect operating margins to be stable to growing on a non-GAAP basis. We also expect free cash flow to grow in line with revenue. Further, as we pursue a more asset-light credit strategy, we expect less of our free cash flow to be directed towards funding credit in the future.
For 2017, we estimate our revenue growth to be in line with our updated 3-year outlook or 16% to 17% on a currency-neutral basis. We also expect that the incremental expense related to our customer choice initiatives will be offset by other revenue and cost initiatives, resulting in an operating margin consistent with full year 2016. More detailed guidance for 2017 will be provided when we report fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings.
Finally, I would like to discuss our financial guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2016. Year-to-date, we have delivered strong performance and outstanding growth across our platform. For the full year, we expect revenue in a range of $10.78 billion to $10.85 billion or 20% growth on a currency-neutral basis. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share in a range of $1.48 to $1.50, representing growth of 18% at the high end. We now expect free cash flow for the full year to exceed $2.2 billion. We are also reaffirming our prior year -- prior full year 2016 guidance on CapEx and non-GAAP effective tax rate.
For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $2.92 billion to $2.99 billion or 16% to 19% growth on a currency-neutral basis. And we expect non-GAAP earnings of $0.40 to $0.42 per share.
In conclusion, our third quarter results demonstrate our ability to deliver exceptional revenue growth and free cash flow while advancing our strategic priorities. Our scale affords us continued leverage opportunities across our other operating expenses.  In addition, the cash flow-generating power of this business gives us great flexibility as we allocate capital with discipline.
We are focused on creating value for our shareholders and strengthening our position as the world's leading digital payments platform for our customers.
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions. Thank you."

It's about 2% of our overall volume, but it's also a very important part of our business. It complements a holistic set of payment offerings for our customers, and our merchants ask for it to be integrated into the checkout experience because they see firsthand the benefits of improved conversion and higher basket size. That said, as I discussed in my prepared remarks, we can obtain a lot of the benefits from credit by doing it in a more asset-light way, which we will disclose more about later. Overall, we're very comfortable with the performance of our portfolio, and I would suggest that it's in line with our expectations. We did increase our provision. And as I discussed on the last earnings call, we have seen some deterioration in our late-stage delinquencies, but we've also seen a lot of signs of health too in that our weighted average FICO scores improved from the last quarters. We've also seen the lowest quarterly charge-off rate in 4 quarters this year. We were obviously coming off of historic lows in credit and, I think, getting to something that is a more normalized rate going forward, but that rate is very consistent with both our underwriting expectations as well as our return goals for the business, so we're comfortable with credit. Thinking longer term about what we do, the agreement with Latitude is a good indication of how we're thinking about moving forward with credit. We also can do something with our existing portfolio, and we've got several different options that we're evaluating. Some of those take time because they could be bigger in nature. And we plan to discuss those in the coming quarters. Thanks, Bryan."

Specifically, you asked about the effect of hedging in the quarter. Hedging was about 1 point of EPS for the quarter versus last year for us. Our hedge gain was about $28 million to $30 million in the quarter. And it was $10 million to $15 million higher last year, so that certainly affected the margin performance in the quarter, but I would want to emphasize, though, that -- we indicated this when we gave the guidance last time, in the last call. We made some investments in our business in the quarter. And you typically think of the seasonality of our business. Our fourth quarter can be 15% to 20% larger than the third quarter, and so we tend to step up in certain areas to prepare for that. We're -- also, we look at the opportunity that we have in front of us, which everyone recognizes with the huge addressable market. That does require some investing and we're not going to shy away from that. We've indicated that we expect margins to be stable to growing over time, but we're not going to be a slave to margin performance from 1 quarter to the next, particularly if it means that it's at the expense of investing in the business. That said, we also recognize that we don't get a pass from the market. And we're going to continue to drive revenue growth and earnings performance, like we've seen. With respect to some of our products, we've got a host of different things that Bill and his team are working on. I wouldn't necessarily pinpoint credit as the opportunity in terms of product expansion next year.

Bill and his team have put into place over the course of this year a number of new services, a number of new products. We've upgraded a lot of our flows by the upgrading of our platform. And so we see a tremendous amount of momentum coming into the business. Obviously, as we think about choice, we think about choice more over the medium- and the longer-term pieces of this in terms of its impact in terms of growth for us. And so as we think about next year, we think really about the momentum of the business carrying us into that as we think further out. Obviously, the increased adoption, engagement and the other services and offerings that we're putting out beyond choice that will go into the market will all fuel that growth. And then on the margin side, as John mentioned, we feel we have a lot of room in our cost structure, a lot of OpEx room, but we also in addition to that are putting out new services and new enhancements that have increased margins associated with them.

So we're trying to be reasonably conservative on the -- on what we will see next year from that. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, and Bill can expand on this, we are having quite a number of conversations with issuers, both large and small, in terms of ways that we can partner together. I'll let Bill get into the details of that, but the overall tenor of those discussions are extremely positive. And one other thing I will just say before I turn it to Bill is, with the tokenization schema that we have from the networks, the issuers don't need to do anything. They just need to opt into it, so we don't need to put out announcements for every one of these and we don't plan to go and do that either. There will be some that we'll announce, no doubt, but the majority of those, since there is really nothing that needs to be done, usually just needs to opt in, we'll just start to implement. Bill?"

But on top of that, we have added quite a number of new products this year that are giving us incremental margins, incremental lift in engagement, such as One Touch. It's a perfect example of that. And that will carry over into next year as well."

So we've talked a little bit about PayPal moving from being well beyond just a nano website to really 2 things. For merchants, we want to be a full-service solution provider. As the world moves towards mobile, merchants are looking to write applications, the big advantage of that mobile, across online, in app, mobile Web and in store. And they're trying to create those applications to enable them to get closer to consumers; and create distinct, differentiated value propositions. We basically want to power those applications with our platform. We want to do 100% share of checkout. We want to integrate rewards capabilities through API and tool sets into our platform. We want to integrate contextual commerce into our platform, credit into our platform so that merchants of all sizes can write the applications to get them closer to their customers and we can power that with our platform. And then we take the extensive number of consumers we have, the 177 million consumers we have, on top of the 15 million merchants we have, and we drive those consumers in a friction-free way to be able to sign up for those merchant apps. So we are really trying to be a much more extensive partner to merchants as they make this change in a mobile-centric world. Things like the One Touch and conversion rate and all of that is tremendously powerful for them. On the consumer side, we are looking to be much more in the middle of how consumers manage and move money. We've talked about our longer-term engagement goals, which are to go from -- well, now we're 2.5 times a month. We were at 2 times a month when we started that, but to go to something like 2 times a week. And we know that's a longer-term goal, but if you look at what we've done with choice and enabling consumers to not just say how they want but where they want -- and this is why I gave the example in Spain. I mean it's obviously very early days and not a significant number of customers yet, but those customers just offline are using the service 6 times a month on there. So you can start to see that engagement. And we are looking at a host of other things. We've now integrated into Xoom so that U.S. customers of PayPal can now use international remittances. It's another service offering on top of that. And I don't want to give away any future hands right now on the call, but you can expect us to continue to grow the set of offerings that we give to consumers. And so as you look out over the medium term, you can expect us to continue to expand and grow our business, not just take the business we have, and follow the tailwinds of digitization which will really drive that."

Choice was a proactive, strategic choice we made well before we started into negotiations with the networks. Actually, our move to choice enabled us to open those conversations and to really start to think about how do we become allies with financial institutions and networks to drive digital payments together. And I mentioned in my remarks the elimination of digital wallet fees and the cost certainty. Bill talked about tokens. And that allows us to move in a very seamless way into in-store environments, but it also enabled us to have like equivalent of what you would think of as card-present rates coming into the in-store environment. It's a profitable way for us to move into the in-store environment. And the other thing, we obviously got some network discounts on top of that, as well as instant access to funds when somebody is trying to remove funds from their PayPal account through their bank account. And that was an important value proposition gap that we had. And we saw in other countries, like the U.K., where we do have that today that people actually increase their balance on the PayPal platform when they know they can take that money off instantaneously. So it's a little counterintuitive to what most people are seeing, but we've got a lot of experience and knowhow in that."

So you talk about Venmo users, obviously a much higher frequency, but I want to parse that with the types of merchant relationships that you're now able to engage in. Because it would seem as though from the legacy business you're in with eBay you didn't have a lot of frequency with those merchants. You might go to eBay a lot, but you don't necessarily go to the merchants a lot. And the announcements you guys keep making seem like just, the consumer proposition, to go back to that same merchant seems materially higher. So I'm just trying to think about how do those 2 kind of, I guess, shifts drive kind of the forward look."

We work really hand in hand with that team to try and drive as much business as possible through that partnership, but obviously as we split apart from eBay, part of the premise of that was that -- as a truly neutral third-party digital payments platform, that we could partner with numerous merchants and retailers that might have seen the relationship that we have with eBay as competitive to them and so that we wouldn't have been independent. I think a great example of that is Alibaba. We have been nurturing that relationship with them. We've done a couple of different announcements through the quarters. We started with wholesalers with them, but now really AliExpress is the main marketplace of Alibaba. That's where really all their merchants are. And that we've already started with PayPal being a payment option on that, it's really a great example of it because we have great strengths outside of China with consumers. They have great strengths with merchants inside China. We're already a major cross-border player in the Chinese corridor. And so that match would never have happened had we not been an independent third party. And that's happening with numerous retailers as well, especially as we expand our value proposition now to really appeal to a mobile-centric world that's one retailer after another of all sizes are thinking about."

So yes, we have new experiences with like Venmo that are highly engaged, but we're also improving engagement on our core products. And interestingly, as you've seen from third-party validates or such as a comScore study that looked at PayPal conversion versus other new entrants to the market in standard checkout, our conversion is nearly 40 points higher than our nearest competitor with us at 87.5% and the nearest competitor at 51%. That's an example of our increasing relevancy with consumers as they move to mobile and are demanding more and more seamless experiences, as evidenced by the higher conversion rate that we have. So it is on multiple fronts that we're seeing that improvement in engagement, but the core products itself, we are seeing great, increasing relevance with our consumers."

Joining me today on the call are Dan Schulman, our President and CEO; John Rainey, our Chief Financial Officer; and Bill Ready, our Chief Operating Officer.
We're providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being broadcast on the Internet, and both the presentation and call are available through the Investor Relations section of our website.
In discussing year-over-year comparisons, including guidance growth rates for the full year 2016, we have chosen to present non-GAAP pro forma metrics because we believe that these metrics provide investors a consistent basis for reviewing the company's performance across different periods. We will also discuss some non-GAAP measures when talking about our company's performance, including the non-GAAP pro forma metrics mentioned above. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP metrics to the most directly comparable GAAP metrics in the presentation accompanying this conference call.
In addition, management will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions; and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include our guidance for fourth quarter and full year 2016 as well as our outlook for 2017 and the next 3 years. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in this call. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our operating results in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and available on the Investor Relations section of our website. You should not rely on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of today's date, October 20, 2016. We disclaim any obligations to update the information.

I'm pleased to say that PayPal delivered another quarter of strong results. We made significant strides in the quarter, forging new partnerships and delivering continued innovation to our customers. We feel well positioned for future growth and profitability.
I'll start my remarks with our financial performance. In the quarter, we reported $0.35 of non-GAAP EPS, at the high end of our non-GAAP guidance of $0.33 to $0.35. We delivered $2.67 billion in revenues, an increase of 21% over last year on an FX-neutral basis. And we generated $618 million in free cash flow. We increased the number of active customers and accelerated their engagement on the PayPal platform. We finished the quarter with 192 million active customer accounts, adding 19 million new accounts in the past 12 months. And transactions per account continued to increase, reaching 30 for the first time, up from 27 a year ago. In the quarter, PayPal processed over $87 billion in total payment volume, up 28% over last year on an FX-neutral basis.
These results reinforce our belief that the opportunities for PayPal to grow and gain share have never been greater. We are executing against our strategic plan with intensity and speed, and we are committed to seizing the opportunities in front of us by truly embracing the mantle of Customer Champion.
Being a customer champion means always prioritizing the needs of our customers. It means continually reexamining our business to improve the customer experience on our platform and to provide real differentiated value to both consumers and merchants. By making customer choice a priority for PayPal, we are creating a significantly better customer experience to accelerate adoption and drive engagement. In the quarter, we made meaningful progress in offering customer choice in our online and mobile checkout and in our P2P experiences. These has enhanced how our customers in the U.S. can send money, shop and pay with PayPal. Our customers are now able to set their preferred funding type in their PayPal Wallet to sources other than their PayPal balance. This gives customers the option to default to their favorite debit card, bank account or credit card, and we've seen a corresponding increase in engagement. And as we have demonstrated over the past several months, customer choice is also allowing us to forge valuable, new strategic partnerships across the ecosystem.
Since our announced agreement with Visa, we have also entered into a strategic partnership with Mastercard, which offers consumers greater choice and flexibility to manage or move their money. It ensures that Mastercard cardholders can easily identify and choose Mastercard within the PayPal Wallet. Our joint U.S. customers will be able to use their tokenization services to make in-store purchases at Mastercard's contactless-enabled merchant locations around the world. And along with our agreement with Visa, the deal with Mastercard exempts PayPal from current or future digital wallet fees and provides cost certainty for years to come. Thanks to our agreements with Visa and Mastercard, PayPal now has a seamless, quick and simple way to activate PayPal payments at the point of sale.
Our agreements with the payment networks are opening the doors to deeper and more engaged conversations with a host of financial institutions about how to drive incremental spend for their brands; and better, more innovative experiences for our mutual customers. These conversations have been very positive, and we are encouraged by the progress we are making in partnering with issuers.
We also are significantly extending our previous agreements with Alibaba. We just launched the first stages of becoming a payment option on Alibaba's global retail marketplace AliExpress. This partnership has the potential to drive meaningful cross-border traffic as PayPal consumers outside of China shop on AliExpress merchants in China. And while we are excited about these new and expanded partnerships, we are equally pleased with the progress we are making with previously announced partners such as American Móvil (sic) [ América Móvil ], which is set to go live this quarter. We are working with American Móvil to help their more than 140 million customers in Mexico and Brazil manage and move money with their Telcel and Claro digital wallets powered by PayPal's platform.
We also deepened our existing relationships with some of the world's leading technology companies, including Facebook and Apple. With Apple's new iOS 10, Venmo users with iPhones can now ask Siri to send and request money from friends and also send P2P payments within the messages app. These new experiences make sending and receiving money even easier and increase the relevance of Venmo by introducing the service in more context than ever before.
With each partnership agreement that we sign or extend, we further expand the ubiquity and value of the PayPal brand and move closer towards our vision of becoming an everyday essential financial service for people around the world.
We believe offering consumers choice in how they want to pay and where they want to pay is essential in becoming an everyday part of a customer's financial life. As we've shared previously, the average Venmo user already interacts with the app more than 2 times per week, and we are beginning to see some additional proof points that our strategy and partnerships are moving us towards our long-term engagement goals. For instance, our initial launch into Spain with Vodafone and Visa which provides customers the chance to pay online, in-app and in-store is already generating over 6 in-store transactions per month per active user. And the PayPal Vodafone service is now available in Italy and the U.K. We also made a further announcement with Visa to include the integration of Visa Checkout into Braintree. Braintree also announced several other new payment options in Q3, including Apple Pay for Web, Mastercard Masterpass, China UnionPay and PayPal Credit.
Another way we're executing against our Customer Champion vision is by being a true payments partner to our merchants to help them succeed in an increasingly connected and mobile-centric world. Mobile technology continues to raise the line that divides online from offline, and commerce is moving into an entirely new context. PayPal helps merchants navigate this disruptive environment and is increasingly the payments partner of choice to merchants of all sizes. We continue to move aggressively towards our goal of processing 100% share of checkout for merchants. This strategic focus enabled PayPal to grow its market share during the quarter. Our merchant services payment volumes once again grew faster than the growth of e-commerce. Merchant services payment volume grew to $73 billion in the third quarter, up 34% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis. And PayPal also continued its strong growth in mobile payments. In the quarter, we processed $26 billion in mobile payments, up 56% over last year. Mobile continues to become an increasingly relevant part of our platform, now representing approximately 30% of our volume. We are on track to process well over $100 billion in mobile payment volume in the next 12 months. This is a remarkable achievement considering we've cumulatively processed some $200 billion in mobile volume over the past 10 years.
Our growth online and in mobile is being driven by some of the world's top merchants choosing PayPal. These include the American Red Cross, which expanded their integration with PayPal to include up our mass-pay products. We also worked with the American Red Cross in the quarter to support flood relief efforts in Louisiana by waiving our fees on the donations raised. H&M, the global fashion retailer, launched with PayPal as a payment option on its websites in France, Italy, Spain and the U.K. Costco de México became the first subsidiary of the global membership-only Warehouse Club to integrate PayPal as a payment method for its online store. Yandex.Direct, the paid search platform for Yandex, Russia's most popular search engine, went live with PayPal. And we expanded our relationship with Uber to make PayPal a way to pay for rides in Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Chile, Uruguay, Peru and Brazil. Braintree also added numerous new merchants, including Six Flags and Yelp.
Being a customer champion demands constant innovation for our customers. As One Touch demonstrates, when you create truly transformative experiences, you drive engagement. We now have more than 32 million consumers and more than 4 million merchants using One Touch. By the end of the year, we now expect 5 million merchant accounts to be offering One Touch to approximately 36 million consumer accounts.
Venmo continues to expand its reach and is becoming a daily part of the lives of mobile- and social media-connected consumers. In the quarter, Venmo processed $4.9 billion in volume, an increase of 131% year-over-year. It is now just shy of a $20 billion annual run rate. We are excited that Pay with Venmo is now generally available to all Venmo users, and we are pleased that giving users a new way to use their Venmo account is resulting in increased engagement. Early data suggests that people who use Pay with Venmo are approximately 30% more engaged than other Venmo users. And we are now ready to more rapidly expand the number of merchants accepting Venmo as we exit 2016 and go into next year.
Xoom is also driving significant innovations. Xoom recently added a new request feature which allows remittances to become a 2-way interaction between senders and receivers for the first time. Remittance recipients in 29 countries can now request funds, bill payments or mobile reloads from customers in the U.S. through the Xoom platform. Additionally, PayPal customers can now link their PayPal and Xoom accounts, giving customers access to their PayPal funding sources within Xoom. This will allow PayPal's U.S. customers to send funds to multiple new markets and get access to new services. As we shared at the time of the acquisition, cross-selling Xoom to our U.S. PayPal customers is a meaningful way to drive additional adoption and engagement with PayPal's 87 million active U.S. customers.
And in the third quarter, Paydiant launched an exciting, new mobile payment experience created for the Autogrill group in Italy. Autogrill is the world's leading provider of food and beverage services for travelers, operating mainly in airports, on highways and in railway stations. This international application of Paydiant's technology was made possible by PayPal's global reach and the integration of our platforms.
Finally, the third quarter saw PayPal receive some remarkable industry recognition. Venmo was named as 1 of Interbrand's Breakthrough Brands in their 2016 ranking of 60 companies that are younger than 10 years old but are driving significant change by creating new experiences for consumers. PayPal gained 7 spots and increased its brand value by 14% on the 2016 Interbrand Best Global Brands ranking, making PayPal once again 1 of the 100 most valuable brands in the world. I'm also pleased to announce that PayPal has been included on Fortune's 2016 Change the World list, a ranking of 50 companies that are doing well by doing good. This is a meaningful recognition for the PayPal team, and we are very proud of achieving the #19 spot on that list. And finally, Group XP, a part of WPP, named PayPal as 1 of the top 3 consumer experience brands in the world based on branding, design, content, online presence and user experience.
The past 6 months have been historic ones for us. We have embarked on a course that enables us to become a true customer champion. We are partnering across multiple ecosystems, from retailers to OEMs, to wireless carriers, technology companies and with financial institutions and networks. We strongly believe that this positions us for long-term growth and profitability. Consequently, we are increasing our 3-year outlook for revenue to 16% to 17% FX-neutral growth in contrast to the 15% previously guided. We expect our free cash flow to grow in line with our revenue growth. And importantly, we believe our non-GAAP operating margin will be stable to growing. John will provide more details on our outlook in his portion of the call.
In the past 2 years, in the face of one competitive announcement after another, we have attracted 35 million net new active accounts. Our engagement per active account has grown from 24 to 30 times per year. Our merchant base now totals 15 million active accounts, and our mobile payments volume and unique innovative capabilities continue to drive our growth. We believe the partnerships we've signed enable us to clearly, predictably and profitably pursue the $100 trillion total addressable market that is slowly but surely digitizing. I believe we now have the platform, capabilities, scale and partnerships to enable us to drive profitable growth not just next year but over the medium and long term.
And with that, let me turn the call to John."
112732,404368544,1058865,"PayPal Holdings, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2016",2016-10-20,"Earnings Calls","PayPal Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dan.I also want to thank all of PayPal's customers and our employees worldwide for making this another great quarter.As Dan discussed, in the third quarter, we made great strides executing against our Customer Champion strategy and partnering",1307,"Thanks, Dan.
I also want to thank all of PayPal's customers and our employees worldwide for making this another great quarter.
As Dan discussed, in the third quarter, we made great strides executing against our Customer Champion strategy and partnering across the payments ecosystem to drive ubiquity. We enhanced our value proposition for both consumers and merchants and laid the groundwork for long-term sustainable growth across our platform.
First, I will walk you through the financial highlights for our third quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, total payment volume increased 28% to $87 billion. U.S. payment volume grew 25% and international volume grew 30%. Our merchant services business grew 34% to $73 billion, primarily driven by core, Braintree and Venmo. We ended the quarter with 192 million active accounts, adding 4.4 million active customer accounts in the quarter and increasing our active accounts by 11% from the third quarter last year. Our core PayPal business, Venmo and Xoom are strong contributors to account growth. The number of payment transactions per account increased to 30, up 13%. Increased engagement in conjunction with continued double-digit growth in active accounts resulted in payment transaction growth of 24% year-over-year.
In the third quarter, we generated revenue of $2.67 billion, up 21% on a currency-neutral basis and 18% on a spot basis. Q3 revenue growth accelerated both sequentially and year-over-year as a result of strong performance in our core business and Braintree. Transaction revenue increased 20% on a currency-neutral basis in the quarter. Performance was driven by growth in our core business and in particular with large merchants and strength in the Braintree business. This resulted in a transaction take rate of 2.65% for the third quarter. The 19 basis point decline was primarily driven by the growth of our P2P business and the mix shift towards Braintree and larger merchants.
Revenue from other value-added services grew 28% versus last year, driven by growth in our credit products.
In the quarter, transaction expense and transaction and loan losses were $830 million and $271 million, respectively. In the aggregate, these volume-based expenses increased 29%, resulting in a transaction margin of 58.7% versus 62.3% in Q3 '15. The transaction margin decline year-over-year was primarily driven by the mix shift in our business toward Braintree and increased provisions in our credit business, partially offset by Xoom.
As we have discussed previously, in the third quarter, we made investments to further drive customer acquisition and engagement and in our compliance efforts and corporate functions, which increased operating expenses in the quarter. Despite these investments, other operating expenses grew 13%, well below revenue growth; and drove 200 basis points of leverage. To give you a bit more color on our non-GAAP operating expenses in the quarter, I will quickly run through the line items.
Customer support and operations expense was $304 million. Sales and marketing expense was $212 million. Product development was $181 million. G&A costs were $229 million, and depreciation and amortization expenses were $150 million.  Excluding the acquisition of Xoom, our other operating expenses increased only 9% or approximately half the rate of revenue growth, once again demonstrating good cost control. We continue to be focused on expense discipline and see significant opportunities to manage our other expense line items over time.
In the third quarter, leverage in our other operating expenses partially offset the transaction margin decline, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 18.4% and non-GAAP operating income of $490 million.
Our third quarter non-GAAP effective tax rate was 15.3% versus 17.7% in Q3 '15, due primarily to discrete tax items.
Non-GAAP EPS grew 14% to $0.35 for the quarter.
Strong cash earnings generation resulted in 19% growth in free cash flow year-over-year. Our free cash flow for the third quarter was $618 million, representing $0.23 of free cash flow for every $1 of revenue. Third quarter capital expenditures were $183 million or approximately 7% of revenue.
During the quarter, we returned approximately $50 million to shareholders by buying back an additional 1.3 million shares. Year-to-date, we have returned approximately $945 million to shareholders by repurchasing 26 million shares at an average price of $36.37. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $6.4 billion, including approximately $1.3 billion in the U.S.
At the end of the third quarter, the total outstanding balances in our pool of consumer and merchant receivables were $4.5 billion and $581 million, respectively. For our consumer portfolio, the principal charge-off rate in the quarter was 6%, and we recognized $114 million as a provision for loan losses. The balance amount of our allowance for consumer loans and interest receivable is now $282 million. We've frequently spoken about moving to an asset-light credit strategy. I am pleased to say that we recently signed a strategic partnership agreement with Latitude Financial Services to develop new consumer financing products for PayPal's customers in Australia. The relationship will leverage PayPal's strengths and technology, but the receivables will be funded by Latitude. We'll share more on this as well as a more comprehensive off-balance-sheet strategy as we move through 2017.
As Dan mentioned, given the partnerships we've established, the response we've seen in our platform to the initial rollout of our choice experiences and the ongoing momentum in our business, we are better positioned today to provide you with an updated 3-year outlook as well as a framework for how to begin thinking about 2017.
Over the next 3 years, we expect total payment volume growth of mid-20% on a currency-neutral basis. We are raising our outlook for revenue growth to 16% to 17% on a currency-neutral basis, up from the 15% which we shared at Analyst Day in May of this year. We expect operating margins to be stable to growing on a non-GAAP basis. We also expect free cash flow to grow in line with revenue. Further, as we pursue a more asset-light credit strategy, we expect less of our free cash flow to be directed towards funding credit in the future.
For 2017, we estimate our revenue growth to be in line with our updated 3-year outlook or 16% to 17% on a currency-neutral basis. We also expect that the incremental expense related to our customer choice initiatives will be offset by other revenue and cost initiatives, resulting in an operating margin consistent with full year 2016. More detailed guidance for 2017 will be provided when we report fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings.
Finally, I would like to discuss our financial guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2016. Year-to-date, we have delivered strong performance and outstanding growth across our platform. For the full year, we expect revenue in a range of $10.78 billion to $10.85 billion or 20% growth on a currency-neutral basis. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share in a range of $1.48 to $1.50, representing growth of 18% at the high end. We now expect free cash flow for the full year to exceed $2.2 billion. We are also reaffirming our prior year -- prior full year 2016 guidance on CapEx and non-GAAP effective tax rate.
For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $2.92 billion to $2.99 billion or 16% to 19% growth on a currency-neutral basis. And we expect non-GAAP earnings of $0.40 to $0.42 per share.
In conclusion, our third quarter results demonstrate our ability to deliver exceptional revenue growth and free cash flow while advancing our strategic priorities. Our scale affords us continued leverage opportunities across our other operating expenses.  In addition, the cash flow-generating power of this business gives us great flexibility as we allocate capital with discipline.
We are focused on creating value for our shareholders and strengthening our position as the world's leading digital payments platform for our customers.
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions. Thank you."

It complements a holistic set of payment offerings for our customers, and our merchants ask for it to be integrated into the checkout experience because they see firsthand that the benefits of improved conversion and higher basket size. That said, as I discussed in my prepared remarks, we can obtain a lot of the benefits from credit by doing it in a more asset-light way, which we will disclose more about later. Overall, we're very comfortable with the performance of our portfolio, and I would suggest that it's in line with our expectations. We did increase our provision. And as I discussed on the last earnings call, we have seen some deterioration in our late-stage delinquencies, but we've also seen a lot of signs of health too in that our weighted average FICO scores improved from the last quarters. We've also seen the lowest quarterly charge-off rate in 4 quarters this year. We were obviously coming off of historic lows in credit and, I think, getting to something that is a more normalized rate going forward, but that rate is very consistent with both our underwriting expectations as well as our return goals for the business, so we're comfortable with credit. Thinking longer term about what we do, the agreement with Latitude is a good indication of how we're thinking about moving forward with credit. We also can do something with our existing portfolio, and we've got several different options that we're evaluating. Some of those take time because they could be bigger in nature. And we plan to discuss those in the coming quarters. Thanks, Bryan."

Specifically, you asked about the effect of hedging in the quarter. Hedging was about 1 point of EPS for the quarter versus last year for us. Our hedge gain was about $28 million to $30 million in the quarter. And it was $10 million to $15 million higher last year, so that certainly affected the margin performance in the quarter, but I would want to emphasize, though, that -- we indicated this when we gave the guidance last time, in the last call. We made some investments in our business in the quarter. And you typically think of the seasonality of our business. Our fourth quarter can be 15% to 20% larger than the third quarter, and so we tend to step up in certain areas to prepare for that. We're -- also, we look at the opportunity that we have in front of us, which everyone recognizes with the huge addressable market. That does require some investing and we're not going to shy away from that. We've indicated that we expect margins to be stable to growing over time, but we're not going to be a slave to margin performance from 1 quarter to the next, particularly if it means that it's at the expense of investing in the business. That said, we also recognize that we don't get a pass from the market. And we're going to continue to drive revenue growth and earnings performance, like we've seen. With respect to some of our products, we've got a host of different things that Bill and his team are working on. I wouldn't necessarily pinpoint credit as the opportunity in terms of product expansion next year.

Bill and his team have put into place over the course of this year a number of new services, a number of new products. We've upgraded a lot of our flows by the upgrading of our platform. And so we see a tremendous amount of momentum coming into the business. Obviously, as we think about choice, we think about choice more over the medium- and the longer-term pieces of this in terms of its impact in terms of growth for us. And so as we think about next year, we think really about the momentum of the business carrying us into that as we think further out. Obviously, the increased adoption, engagement and the other services and offerings that we're putting out beyond choice that will go into the market will all fuel that growth. And then on the margin side, as John mentioned, we feel we have a lot of room in our cost structure, a lot of OpEx room, but we also in addition to that are putting out new services and new enhancements that have increased margins associated with them.

And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, and Bill can expand on this, we are having quite a number of conversations with issuers, both large and small, in terms of ways that we can partner together. I'll let Bill get into the details of that, but the overall tenor of those discussions are extremely positive. And one other thing I will just say before I turn it to Bill is, with the tokenization schema that we have from the networks, the issuers don't need to do anything. They just need to opt into it, so we don't need to put out announcements for every one of these and we don't plan to go and do that either.

So this isn't really a framework of a lot of one-off announcements but one where we've set a framework of how we work with the broader industry. And we're seeing from the experiences we've rolled out already that, as was mentioned earlier in the call by Dan and John, engagement lifts, those types of things that we have been seeing from consumer choice even ahead of our deals with Visa and Mastercard and the broader ecosystem, we're seeing those things play out in a way that's very much in line with how we thought about going into choice overall."

So we've talked a little bit about PayPal moving from being well beyond just a nano website to really 2 things. For merchants, we want to be a full-service solution provider. As the world moves towards mobile, merchants are looking to write the applications, the big advantage of that mobile, across online, in app, mobile Web and in store. And they're trying to create those applications to enable them to get closer to consumers; and create distinct, differentiated value propositions. We basically want to power those applications with our platform. We want to do 100% share of checkout. We want to integrate rewards capabilities through API and tool sets into our platform. We want to integrate contextual commerce into our platform, put credit into our platform so that merchants of all sizes can write the applications to get them closer to their customers and we can power that with our platform. And then we take the extensive number of consumers we have, the 177 million consumers we have, on top of the 15 million merchants we have, and we drive those consumers in a friction-free way to be able to sign up for those merchant apps. So we are really trying to be a much more extensive partner to merchants as they make this change in a mobile-centric world. Things like the One Touch and conversion rate and all of that is tremendously powerful for them. On the consumer side, we are looking to be much more in the middle of how consumers manage and move money. We've talked about our longer-term engagement goals, which are to go from -- well, now we're 2.5 times a month. We were at 2 times a month when we started that, but to go to something like 2 times a week. And we know that's a longer-term goal, but if you look at what we've done with choice and enabling consumers to not just say how they want but where they want -- and this is why I gave the example in Spain. I mean it's obviously very early days and not a significant number of customers yet, but those customers just offline are using the service 6 times a month on there. So you can start to see that engagement. And we are looking at a host of other things. We've now integrated into Xoom so that U.S. customers of PayPal can now use international remittances. It's another service offering on top of that. And I don't want to give away any future hands right now on the call, but you can expect us to continue to grow the set of offerings that we give to consumers. And so as you look out over the medium term, you can expect us to continue to expand and grow our business, not just take the business we have, and follow the tailwinds of digitization which will really drive that."

Choice was a proactive, strategic choice we made well before we started into negotiations with the networks. Actually, our move to choice enabled us to open those conversations and to really start to think about how do we become allies with financial institutions and networks to drive digital payments together. And I mentioned in my remarks the elimination of digital wallet fees and the cost certainty. Bill talked about tokens. And that allows us to move in a very seamless way into in-store environments, but it also enabled us to have like equivalent of what you would think of as card-present rates coming into the in-store environment. It's a profitable way for us to move into the in-store environment. And the other thing, we obviously got some network discounts on top of that, as well as instant access to funds when somebody is trying to remove funds from their PayPal account through their bank account. And that was an important value proposition gap that we had. And we saw in other countries, like the U.K., where we do have that today that people actually increase their balance on the PayPal platform when they know they can take that money off instantaneously. So it's a little counterintuitive to what most people are seeing, but we've got a lot of experience and knowhow in that."

You've seen obviously numbers increase quite a bit. I'm wondering how much of it, up to this point at least, is really a function of this mix shift to different types of transactions. So you talk about Venmo users, obviously a much higher frequency, but I want to parse that with the types of merchant relationships that you're now able to engage in. Because it would seem as though from the legacy business you're in with eBay you didn't have a lot of frequency with those merchants. You might go to eBay a lot, but you don't necessarily go to those merchants a lot. And the announcements you guys keep making seem like just, the consumer proposition, to go back to that same merchant seems materially higher. So I'm just trying to think about how do those 2 kind of, I guess, shifts drive kind of the forward look."

We work really hand in hand with that team to try and drive as much business as possible through that partnership, but obviously as we split apart from eBay, part of the premise of that was that -- as a truly neutral third-party digital payments platform, that we could partner with numerous merchants and retailers that might have seen the relationship that we have with eBay as competitive to them and so that we wouldn't have been independent. I think a great example of that is Alibaba. We have been nurturing that relationship with them. We've done a couple of different announcements through the quarters. We started with wholesalers with them, but now really AliExpress is the main marketplace of Alibaba. That's where really all their merchants are. And that we've already started with PayPal being a payment option on that, it's really a great example of it because we have great strengths outside of China with consumers. They have great strengths with merchants inside China. We're already a major cross-border player in the Chinese corridor. And so that match would never have happened had we not been an independent third party. And that's happening with numerous retailers as well, especially as we expand our value proposition now to really appeal to a mobile-centric world that's one retailer after another of all sizes are thinking about."

So yes, we have new experiences with like Venmo that are highly engaged, but we're also improving engagement on our core products. And interestingly, as you've seen from third-party validates or such as a comScore study that looked at PayPal conversion versus other new entrants to the market in standard checkout, our conversion is nearly 40 points higher than our nearest competitor with us at 87.5% and the nearest competitor at 51%. That's an example of our increasing relevancy with consumers as they move to mobile and are demanding more and more seamless experiences, as evidenced by the higher conversion rate that we have. So it is on multiple fronts that we're seeing that improvement in engagement, but the core products itself, we are seeing great, increasing relevance with our consumers."

Joining me today on the call are Dan Schulman, our President and CEO; John Rainey, our Chief Financial Officer; and Bill Ready, our Chief Operating Officer.
We're providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being broadcast on the Internet, and both the presentation and call are available through the Investor Relations section of our website.
In discussing year-over-year comparisons, including guidance growth rates for the full year 2016, we have chosen to present non-GAAP pro forma metrics because we believe that these metrics provide investors a consistent basis for reviewing the company's performance across different periods. We will also discuss some non-GAAP measures when talking about our company's performance, including the non-GAAP pro forma metrics mentioned above. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP metrics to the most directly comparable GAAP metrics in the presentation accompanying this conference call.
In addition, management will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions; and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include our guidance for fourth quarter and full year 2016 as well as our outlook for 2017 and the next 3 years. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in this call. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our operating results in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and available on the Investor Relations section of our website. You should not rely on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of today's date, October 20, 2016. We disclaim any obligations to update the information.

I'm pleased to say that PayPal delivered another quarter of strong results. We made significant strides in the quarter, forging new partnerships and delivering continued innovation to our customers. We feel well positioned for future growth and profitability.
I'll start my remarks with our financial performance. In the quarter, we reported $0.35 of non-GAAP EPS, at the high end of our non-GAAP guidance of $0.33 to $0.35. We delivered $2.67 billion in revenues, an increase of 21% over last year on an FX-neutral basis. And we generated $618 million in free cash flow. We increased the number of active customers and accelerated their engagement on the PayPal platform. We finished the quarter with 192 million active customer accounts, adding 19 million new accounts in the past 12 months. And transactions per account continued to increase, reaching 30 for the first time, up from 27 a year ago. In the quarter, PayPal processed over $87 billion in total payment volume, up 28% over last year on an FX-neutral basis.
These results reinforce our belief that the opportunities for PayPal to grow and gain share have never been greater. We are executing against our strategic plan with intensity and speed, and we are committed to seizing the opportunities in front of us by truly embracing the mantle of Customer Champion.
Being a customer champion means always prioritizing the needs of our customers. It means continually reexamining our business to improve the customer experience on our platform and to provide real differentiated value to both consumers and merchants. By making customer choice a priority for PayPal, we are creating a significantly better customer experience to accelerate adoption and drive engagement. In the quarter, we made meaningful progress in offering customer choice in our online and mobile checkout and in our P2P experiences. These has enhanced how our customers in the U.S. can send money, shop and pay with PayPal. Our customers are now able to set their preferred funding type in their PayPal Wallet to sources other than their PayPal balance. This gives customers the option to default to their favorite debit card, bank account or credit card, and we've seen a corresponding increase in engagement. And as we have demonstrated over the past several months, customer choice is also allowing us to forge valuable, new strategic partnerships across the ecosystem.
Since our announced agreement with Visa, we have also entered into a strategic partnership with Mastercard, which offers consumers greater choice and flexibility to manage or move their money. It ensures that Mastercard cardholders can easily identify and choose Mastercard within the PayPal Wallet. Our joint U.S. customers will be able to use their tokenization services to make in-store purchases at Mastercard's contactless-enabled merchant locations around the world. And along with our agreement with Visa, the deal with Mastercard exempts PayPal from current or future digital wallet fees and provides cost certainty for years to come. Thanks to our agreements with Visa and Mastercard, PayPal now has a seamless, quick and simple way to activate PayPal payments at the point of sale.
Our agreements with the payment networks are opening the doors to deeper and more engaged conversations with a host of financial institutions about how to drive incremental spend for their brands; and better, more innovative experiences for our mutual customers. These conversations have been very positive, and we are encouraged by the progress we are making in partnering with issuers.
We also are significantly extending our previous agreements with Alibaba. We just launched the first stages of becoming a payment option on Alibaba's global retail marketplace AliExpress. This partnership has the potential to drive meaningful cross-border traffic as PayPal consumers outside of China shop on AliExpress merchants in China. And while we are excited about these new and expanded partnerships, we are equally pleased with the progress we are making with previously announced partners such as American Móvil (sic) [ América Móvil ], which is set to go live this quarter. We are working with American Móvil to help their more than 140 million customers in Mexico and Brazil manage and move money with their Telcel and Claro digital wallets powered by PayPal's platform.
We also deepened our existing relationships with some of the world's leading technology companies, including Facebook and Apple. With Apple's new iOS 10, Venmo users with iPhones can now ask Siri to send and request money from friends and also send P2P payments within the messages app. These new experiences make sending and receiving money even easier and increase the relevance of Venmo by introducing the service in more context than ever before.
With each partnership agreement that we sign or extend, we further expand the ubiquity and value of the PayPal brand and move closer towards our vision of becoming an everyday essential financial service for people around the world.
We believe offering consumers choice in how they want to pay and where they want to pay is essential in becoming an everyday part of a customer's financial life. As we've shared previously, the average Venmo user already interacts with the app more than 2 times per week, and we are beginning to see some additional proof points that our strategy and partnerships are moving us towards our long-term engagement goals. For instance, our initial launch into Spain with Vodafone and Visa which provides customers the chance to pay online, in-app and in-store is already generating over 6 in-store transactions per month per active user. And the PayPal Vodafone service is now available in Italy and the U.K. We also made a further announcement with Visa to include the integration of Visa Checkout into Braintree. Braintree also announced several other new payment options in Q3, including Apple Pay for Web, Mastercard Masterpass, China UnionPay and PayPal Credit.
Another way we're executing against our Customer Champion vision is by being a true payments partner to our merchants to help them succeed in an increasingly connected and mobile-centric world. Mobile technology continues to raise the line that divides online from offline, and commerce is moving into an entirely new context. PayPal helps merchants navigate this disruptive environment and is increasingly the payments partner of choice to merchants of all sizes. We continue to move aggressively towards our goal of processing 100% share of checkout for merchants. This strategic focus enabled PayPal to grow its market share during the quarter. Our merchant services payment volumes once again grew faster than the growth of e-commerce. Merchant services payment volume grew to $73 billion in the third quarter, up 34% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis. And PayPal also continued its strong growth in mobile payments. In the quarter, we processed $26 billion in mobile payments, up 56% over last year. Mobile continues to become an increasingly relevant part of our platform, now representing approximately 30% of our volume. We are on track to process well over $100 billion in mobile payment volume in the next 12 months. This is a remarkable achievement considering we've cumulatively processed some $200 billion in mobile volume over the past 10 years.
Our growth online and in mobile is being driven by some of the world's top merchants choosing PayPal. These include the American Red Cross, which expanded their integration with PayPal to include up our mass-pay products. We also worked with the American Red Cross in the quarter to support flood relief efforts in Louisiana by waiving our fees on the donations raised. H&M, the global fashion retailer, launched with PayPal as a payment option on its websites in France, Italy, Spain and the U.K. Costco de México became the first subsidiary of the global membership-only Warehouse Club to integrate PayPal as a payment method for its online store. Yandex.Direct, the paid search platform for Yandex, Russia's most popular search engine, went live with PayPal. And we expanded our relationship with Uber to make PayPal a way to pay for rides in Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Chile, Uruguay, Peru and Brazil. Braintree also added numerous new merchants, including Six Flags and Yelp.
Being a customer champion demands constant innovation for our customers. As One Touch demonstrates, when you create truly transformative experiences, you drive engagement. We now have more than 32 million consumers and more than 4 million merchants using One Touch. By the end of the year, we now expect 5 million merchant accounts to be offering One Touch to approximately 36 million consumer accounts.
Venmo continues to expand its reach and is becoming a daily part of the lives of mobile- and social media-connected consumers. In the quarter, Venmo processed $4.9 billion in volume, an increase of 131% year-over-year. It is now just shy of a $20 billion annual run rate. We are excited that Pay with Venmo is now generally available to all Venmo users, and we are pleased that giving users a new way to use their Venmo account is resulting in increased engagement. Early data suggests that people who use Pay with Venmo are approximately 30% more engaged than other Venmo users. And we are now ready to more rapidly expand the number of merchants accepting Venmo as we exit 2016 and go into next year.
Xoom is also driving significant innovations. Xoom recently added a new request feature which allows remittances to become a 2-way interaction between senders and receivers for the first time. Remittance recipients in 29 countries can now request funds, bill payments or mobile reloads from customers in the U.S. through the Xoom platform. Additionally, PayPal customers can now link their PayPal and Xoom accounts, giving customers access to their PayPal funding sources within Xoom. This will allow PayPal's U.S. customers to send funds to multiple new markets and get access to new services. As we shared at the time of the acquisition, cross-selling Xoom to our U.S. PayPal customers is a meaningful way to drive additional adoption and engagement with PayPal's 87 million active U.S. customers.
And in the third quarter, Paydiant launched an exciting, new mobile payment experience created for the Autogrill group in Italy. Autogrill is the world's leading provider of food and beverage services for travelers, operating mainly in airports, on highways and in railway stations. This international application of Paydiant's technology was made possible by PayPal's global reach and the integration of our platforms.
Finally, the third quarter saw PayPal receive some remarkable industry recognition. Venmo was named as 1 of Interbrand's Breakthrough Brands in their 2016 ranking of 60 companies that are younger than 10 years old but are driving significant change by creating new experiences for consumers. PayPal gained 7 spots and increased its brand value by 14% on the 2016 Interbrand Best Global Brands ranking, making PayPal once again 1 of the 100 most valuable brands in the world. I'm also pleased to announce that PayPal has been included on Fortune's 2016 Change the World list, a ranking of 50 companies that are doing well by doing good. This is a meaningful recognition for the PayPal team, and we are very proud of achieving the #19 spot on that list. And finally, Group XP, a part of WPP, named PayPal as 1 of the top 3 consumer experience brands in the world based on branding, design, content, online presence and user experience.
The past 6 months have been historic ones for us. We have embarked on a course that enables us to become a true customer champion. We are partnering across multiple ecosystems, from retailers to OEMs, to wireless carriers, technology companies and with financial institutions and networks. We strongly believe that this positions us for long-term growth and profitability. Consequently, we are increasing our 3-year outlook for revenue to 16% to 17% FX-neutral growth in contrast to the 15% previously guided. We expect our free cash flow to grow in line with our revenue growth. And importantly, we believe our non-GAAP operating margin will be stable to growing. John will provide more details on our outlook in his portion of the call.
In the past 2 years, in the face of one competitive announcement after another, we have attracted 35 million net new active accounts. Our engagement per active account has grown from 24 to 30 times per year. Our merchant base now totals 15 million active accounts, and our mobile payments volume and unique innovative capabilities continue to drive our growth. We believe the partnerships we've signed enable us to clearly, predictably and profitably pursue the $100 trillion total addressable market that is slowly but surely digitizing. I believe we now have the platform, capabilities, scale and partnerships to enable us to drive profitable growth not just next year but over the medium and long term.
And with that, let me turn the call to John."
112732,404368544,1059096,"PayPal Holdings, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2016",2016-10-20,"Earnings Calls","PayPal Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dan.I also want to thank all of PayPal's customers and our employees worldwide for making this another great quarter.As Dan discussed, in the third quarter, we made great strides executing against our Customer Champion strategy and partnering",1307,"Thanks, Dan.
I also want to thank all of PayPal's customers and our employees worldwide for making this another great quarter.
As Dan discussed, in the third quarter, we made great strides executing against our Customer Champion strategy and partnering across the payments ecosystem to drive ubiquity. We enhanced our value proposition for both consumers and merchants and laid the groundwork for long-term sustainable growth across our platform.
First, I will walk you through the financial highlights for our third quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, total payment volume increased 28% to $87 billion. U.S. payment volume grew 25% and international volume grew 30%. Our merchant services business grew 34% to $73 billion, primarily driven by core, Braintree and Venmo. We ended the quarter with 192 million active accounts, adding 4.4 million active customer accounts in the quarter and increasing our active accounts by 11% from the third quarter last year. Our core PayPal business, Venmo and Xoom are strong contributors to account growth. The number of payment transactions per account increased to 30, up 13%. Increased engagement in conjunction with continued double-digit growth in active accounts resulted in payment transaction growth of 24% year-over-year.
In the third quarter, we generated revenue of $2.67 billion, up 21% on a currency-neutral basis and 18% on a spot basis. Q3 revenue growth accelerated both sequentially and year-over-year as a result of strong performance in our core business and Braintree. Transaction revenue increased 20% on a currency-neutral basis in the quarter. Performance was driven by growth in our core business and in particular with large merchants and strength in the Braintree business. This resulted in a transaction take rate of 2.65% for the third quarter. The 19 basis point decline was primarily driven by the growth of our P2P business and the mix shift towards Braintree and larger merchants.
Revenue from other value-added services grew 28% versus last year, driven by growth in our credit products.
In the quarter, transaction expense and transaction and loan losses were $830 million and $271 million, respectively. In the aggregate, these volume-based expenses increased 29%, resulting in a transaction margin of 58.7% versus 62.3% in Q3 '15. The transaction margin decline year-over-year was primarily driven by the mix shift in our business toward Braintree and increased provisions in our credit business, partially offset by Xoom.
As we have discussed previously, in the third quarter, we made investments to further drive customer acquisition and engagement and in our compliance efforts and corporate functions, which increased operating expenses in the quarter. Despite these investments, other operating expenses grew 13%, well below revenue growth; and drove 200 basis points of leverage. To give you a bit more color on our non-GAAP operating expenses in the quarter, I will quickly run through the line items.
Customer support and operations expense was $304 million. Sales and marketing expense was $212 million. Product development was $181 million. G&A costs were $229 million, and depreciation and amortization expenses were $150 million.  Excluding the acquisition of Xoom, our other operating expenses increased only 9% or approximately half the rate of revenue growth, once again demonstrating good cost control. We continue to be focused on expense discipline and see significant opportunities to manage our other expense line items over time.
In the third quarter, leverage in our other operating expenses partially offset the transaction margin decline, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 18.4% and non-GAAP operating income of $490 million.
Our third quarter non-GAAP effective tax rate was 15.3% versus 17.7% in Q3 '15, due primarily to discrete tax items.
Non-GAAP EPS grew 14% to $0.35 for the quarter.
Strong cash earnings generation resulted in 19% growth in free cash flow year-over-year. Our free cash flow for the third quarter was $618 million, representing $0.23 of free cash flow for every $1 of revenue. Third quarter capital expenditures were $183 million or approximately 7% of revenue.
During the quarter, we returned approximately $50 million to shareholders by buying back an additional 1.3 million shares. Year-to-date, we have returned approximately $945 million to shareholders by repurchasing 26 million shares at an average price of $36.37. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $6.4 billion, including approximately $1.3 billion in the U.S.
At the end of the third quarter, the total outstanding balances in our pool of consumer and merchant receivables were $4.5 billion and $581 million, respectively. For our consumer portfolio, the principal charge-off rate in the quarter was 6%, and we recognized $114 million as a provision for loan losses. The balance amount of our allowance for consumer loans and interest receivable is now $282 million. We've frequently spoken about moving to an asset-light credit strategy. I am pleased to say that we recently signed a strategic partnership agreement with Latitude Financial Services to develop new consumer financing products for PayPal's customers in Australia. The relationship will leverage PayPal's strengths and technology, but the receivables will be funded by Latitude. We'll share more on this as well as a more comprehensive off-balance-sheet strategy as we move through 2017.
As Dan mentioned, given the partnerships we've established, the response we've seen in our platform to the initial rollout of our choice experiences and the ongoing momentum in our business, we are better positioned today to provide you with an updated 3-year outlook as well as a framework for how to begin thinking about 2017.
Over the next 3 years, we expect total payment volume growth of mid-20% on a currency-neutral basis. We are raising our outlook for revenue growth to 16% to 17% on a currency-neutral basis, up from the 15% which we shared at Analyst Day in May of this year. We expect operating margins to be stable to growing on a non-GAAP basis. We also expect free cash flow to grow in line with revenue. Further, as we pursue a more asset-light credit strategy, we expect less of our free cash flow to be directed towards funding credit in the future.
For 2017, we estimate our revenue growth to be in line with our updated 3-year outlook or 16% to 17% on a currency-neutral basis. We also expect that the incremental expense related to our customer choice initiatives will be offset by other revenue and cost initiatives, resulting in an operating margin consistent with full year 2016. More detailed guidance for 2017 will be provided when we report fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings.
Finally, I would like to discuss our financial guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2016. Year-to-date, we have delivered strong performance and outstanding growth across our platform. For the full year, we expect revenue in a range of $10.78 billion to $10.85 billion or 20% growth on a currency-neutral basis. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share in a range of $1.48 to $1.50, representing growth of 18% at the high end. We now expect free cash flow for the full year to exceed $2.2 billion. We are also reaffirming our prior year -- prior full year 2016 guidance on CapEx and non-GAAP effective tax rate.
For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $2.92 billion to $2.99 billion or 16% to 19% growth on a currency-neutral basis. And we expect non-GAAP earnings of $0.40 to $0.42 per share.
In conclusion, our third quarter results demonstrate our ability to deliver exceptional revenue growth and free cash flow while advancing our strategic priorities. Our scale affords us continued leverage opportunities across our other operating expenses.  In addition, the cash flow-generating power of this business gives us great flexibility as we allocate capital with discipline.
We are focused on creating value for our shareholders and strengthening our position as the world's leading digital payments platform for our customers.
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions. Thank you."

It complements a holistic set of payment offerings for our customers, and our merchants ask for it to be integrated into the checkout experience because they see firsthand that the benefits of improved conversion and higher basket size. That said, as I discussed in my prepared remarks, we can obtain a lot of the benefits from credit by doing it in a more asset-light way, which we will disclose more about later. Overall, we're very comfortable with the performance of our portfolio, and I would suggest that it's in line with our expectations. We did increase our provision. And as I discussed on the last earnings call, we have seen some deterioration in our late-stage delinquencies, but we've also seen a lot of signs of health too in that our weighted average FICO scores improved from the last quarters. We've also seen the lowest quarterly charge-off rate in 4 quarters this year. We were obviously coming off of historic lows in credit and, I think, getting to something that is a more normalized rate going forward, but that rate is very consistent with both our underwriting expectations as well as our return goals for the business, so we're comfortable with credit. Thinking longer term about what we do, the agreement with Latitude is a good indication of how we're thinking about moving forward with credit. We also can do something with our existing portfolio, and we've got several different options that we're evaluating. Some of those take time because they could be bigger in nature. And we plan to discuss those in the coming quarters. Thanks, Bryan."

Specifically, you asked about the effect of hedging in the quarter. Hedging was about 1 point of EPS for the quarter versus last year for us. Our hedge gain was about $28 million to $30 million in the quarter. And it was $10 million to $15 million higher last year, so that certainly affected the margin performance in the quarter, but I would want to emphasize, though, that -- we indicated this when we gave the guidance last time, in the last call. We made some investments in our business in the quarter. And you typically think of the seasonality of our business. Our fourth quarter can be 15% to 20% larger than the third quarter, and so we tend to step up in certain areas to prepare for that. We're -- also, we look at the opportunity that we have in front of us, which everyone recognizes with the huge addressable market. That does require some investing and we're not going to shy away from that. We've indicated that we expect margins to be stable to growing over time, but we're not going to be a slave to margin performance from 1 quarter to the next, particularly if it means that it's at the expense of investing in the business. That said, we also recognize that we don't get a pass from the market. And we're going to continue to drive revenue growth and earnings performance, like we've seen. With respect to some of our products, we've got a host of different things that Bill and his team are working on. I wouldn't necessarily pinpoint credit as the opportunity in terms of product expansion next year.

Bill and his team have put into place over the course of this year a number of new services, a number of new products. We've upgraded a lot of our flows by the upgrading of our platform. And so we see a tremendous amount of momentum coming into the business. Obviously, as we think about choice, we think about choice more over the medium- and the longer-term pieces of this in terms of its impact in terms of growth for us. And so as we think about next year, we think really about the momentum of the business carrying us into that as we think further out. Obviously, the increased adoption, engagement and the other services and offerings that we're putting out beyond choice that will go into the market will all fuel that growth. And then on the margin side, as John mentioned, we feel we have a lot of room in our cost structure, a lot of OpEx room, but we also in addition to that are putting out new services and new enhancements that have increased margins associated with them. And so as we look at our medium-term or our 3-year outlook, we felt very comfortable taking that revenue outlook up and maintaining our margin guidance."

The Visa, Mastercard and the issuer implementations, those will happen as we go through next year, but we don't assume a lot of either revenue or volume increases as a result of that. So we're trying to be reasonably conservative on the -- on what we will see next year from that. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, and Bill can expand on this, we are having quite a number of conversations with issuers, both large and small, in terms of ways that we can partner together. I'll let Bill get into the details of that, but the overall tenor of those discussions are extremely positive. And one other thing I will just say before I turn it to Bill is, with the tokenization schema that we have from the networks, the issuers don't need to do anything. They just need to opt into it, so we don't need to put out announcements for every one of these and we don't plan to go and do that either. There will be some that we'll announce, no doubt, but the majority of those, since there is really nothing that needs to be done, usually just needs to opt in, we'll just start to implement. Bill?"

We're able to do and deliver value to our customers in the ecosystem without them having to do work on their end. So this isn't really a framework of a lot of one-off announcements but one where we've set a framework of how we work with the broader industry. And we're seeing from the experiences we've rolled out already that, as was mentioned earlier in the call by Dan and John, engagement lifts, those types of things that we have been seeing from consumer choice even ahead of our deals with Visa and Mastercard and the broader ecosystem, we're seeing those things play out in a way that's very much in line with how we thought about going into choice overall."

So we've talked a little bit about PayPal moving from being well beyond just a nano website to really 2 things. For merchants, we want to be a full-service solution provider. As the world moves towards mobile, merchants are looking to write the applications, the big advantage of that mobile, across online, in app, mobile Web and in store. And they're trying to create those applications to enable them to get closer to consumers; and create distinct, differentiated value propositions. We basically want to power those applications with our platform. We want to do 100% share of checkout. We want to integrate rewards capabilities through API and tool sets into our platform. We want to integrate contextual commerce into our platform, put credit into our platform so that merchants of all sizes can write the applications to get them closer to their customers and we can power that with our platform. And then we take the extensive number of consumers we have, the 177 million consumers we have, on top of the 15 million merchants we have, and we drive those consumers in a friction-free way to be able to sign up for those merchant apps. So we are really trying to be a much more extensive partner to merchants as they make this change in a mobile-centric world. Things like the One Touch and conversion rate and all of that is tremendously powerful for them. On the consumer side, we are looking to be much more in the middle of how consumers manage and move money. We've talked about our longer-term engagement goals, which are to go from -- well, now we're 2.5 times a month. We were at 2 times a month when we started that, but to go to something like 2 times a week. And we know that's a longer-term goal, but if you look at what we've done with choice and enabling consumers to not just say how they want but where they want -- and this is why I gave the example in Spain. I mean it's obviously very early days and not a significant number of customers yet, but those customers just offline are using the service 6 times a month on there. So you can start to see that engagement. And we are looking at a host of other things. We've now integrated into Xoom so that U.S. customers of PayPal can now use international remittances. It's another service offering on top of that. And I don't want to give away any future hands right now on the call, but you can expect us to continue to grow the set of offerings that we give to consumers. And so as you look out over the medium term, you can expect us to continue to expand and grow our business, not just take the business we have, and follow the tailwinds of digitization which will really drive that."

So very much going as planned on that front. And then as we come into next year, we'll have some more of these things that will sort of layer in as we come into the first half of next year, but the core concepts around users being able to pay however they want and us not influencing them or requiring them to use things that were of our preference, those core concepts have been implemented and -- or we're seeing consumer behavior as we would have expected from our prior testing around those things.

Choice was a proactive, strategic choice we made well before we started into negotiations with the networks. Actually, our move to choice enabled us to open those conversations and to really start to think about how do we become allies with financial institutions and networks to drive digital payments together. And I mentioned in my remarks the elimination of digital wallet fees and the cost certainty. Bill talked about tokens. And that allows us to move in a very seamless way into in-store environments, but it also enabled us to have like equivalent of what you would think of as card-present rates coming into the in-store environment. It's a profitable way for us to move into the in-store environment. And the other thing, we obviously got some network discounts on top of that, as well as instant access to funds when somebody is trying to remove funds from their PayPal account through their bank account. And that was an important value proposition gap that we had. And we saw in other countries, like the U.K., where we do have that today that people actually increase their balance on the PayPal platform when they know they can take that money off instantaneously. So it's a little counterintuitive to what most people are seeing, but we've got a lot of experience and knowhow in that."

You've seen obviously numbers increase quite a bit. I'm wondering how much of it, up to this point at least, is really a function of this mix shift to different types of transactions. So you talk about Venmo users, obviously a much higher frequency, but I want to parse that with the types of merchant relationships that you're now able to engage in. Because it would seem as though from the legacy business you're in with eBay you didn't have a lot of frequency with those merchants. You might go to eBay a lot, but you don't necessarily go to those merchants a lot. And the announcements you guys keep making seem like just, the consumer proposition, to go back to that same merchant seems materially higher. So I'm just trying to think about how do those 2 kind of, I guess, shifts drive kind of the forward look."

We work really hand in hand with that team to try and drive as much business as possible through that partnership, but obviously as we split apart from eBay, part of the premise of that was that -- as a truly neutral third-party digital payments platform, that we could partner with numerous merchants and retailers that might have seen the relationship that we have with eBay as competitive to them and so that we wouldn't have been independent. I think a great example of that is Alibaba. We have been nurturing that relationship with them. We've done a couple of different announcements through the quarters. We started with wholesalers with them, but now really AliExpress is the main marketplace of Alibaba. That's where really all their merchants are. And that we've already started with PayPal being a payment option on that, it's really a great example of it because we have great strengths outside of China with consumers. They have great strengths with merchants inside China. We're already a major cross-border player in the Chinese corridor. And so that match would never have happened had we not been an independent third party. And that's happening with numerous retailers as well, especially as we expand our value proposition now to really appeal to a mobile-centric world that's one retailer after another of all sizes are thinking about."

So yes, we have new experiences with like Venmo that are highly engaged, but we're also improving engagement on our core products. And interestingly, as you've seen from third-party validates or such as a comScore study that looked at PayPal conversion versus other new entrants to the market in standard checkout, our conversion is nearly 40 points higher than our nearest competitor with us at 87.5% and the nearest competitor at 51%. That's an example of our increasing relevancy with consumers as they move to mobile and are demanding more and more seamless experiences, as evidenced by the higher conversion rate that we have. So it is on multiple fronts that we're seeing that improvement in engagement, but the core products itself, we are seeing great, increasing relevance with our consumers."
