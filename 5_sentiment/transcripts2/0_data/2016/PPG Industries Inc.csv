294639,321351908,919983,"PPG Industries, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2016",2016-01-21,"Earnings Calls","PPG Industries, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported fourth quarter and full year 2015 financial results. For the fourth quarter, our net sales were $3.7 billion, and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1",1823,"Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported fourth quarter and full year 2015 financial results. For the fourth quarter, our net sales were $3.7 billion, and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.23. While our net sales were flat with prior year, our sales in local currencies increased about 7% with higher sales volumes year-over-year and a continued benefit from acquisition-related sales. These sales increases were offset by persistent unfavorable foreign currency translation impacts. 
For the quarter, the unfavorable currency translation impact totaled about $250 million in sales and approximately $25 million on pretax income. Our sales volume growth in the quarter of nearly 2% represented our highest growth rate of the year. This solid volume growth stems from our validity to gain larger share of our customers' wallets through their adoption of new or leading PPG technologies. 
In addition, we benefited from broadening improvement in European demand as our volumes in this region steadily improved in each quarter of 2015. We grew coatings volumes 1% in Europe in the first quarter and steadily improved to 3% in the fourth quarter. 
We also returned to solid mid-single-digit percentage growth rate in Asia as demand in that region improved markedly in comparison with a weaker third quarter. Volume trends in the Americas were mixed with country but consistent with the prior year levels. We achieved organic growth in the U.S. and Mexico that was offset by lower year-over-year sales volumes in Canada and several South American countries. 
Our sales volume growth was broad based across our business portfolio led by Industrial Coatings segment, which grew by mid-single digits percentage and delivered sales volume gains in all our business units within the segment, including our general industrial business, where we reversed the negative sales volume trend we experienced in the second and third quarters. 
Also, the automotive OEM industry growth rate improved sequentially and year-over-year, and our automotive OEM coatings business continued to grow at a rate above the industry average. Rounding out the segment, our packaging coatings business continues to benefit from industry move to new interior can coatings. Customer adoption of our new interior can coating technology remains strong, supporting our mid-single-digit percentage growth in that business. 
In the Performance Coatings segment, automotive refinish, protective and marine coatings and architectural coatings EMEA grew sales volumes. Growth in architectural coatings in Mexico and the U.S. was offset by weaker demand in Canada, Brazil and China. Aerospace coating sales volume declined in relation to a strong growth in the prior year and due to year-over-year differences in certain customer order patterns. This was the first decline in aerospace volumes in quite some time, and we expect the business to return to growth in 2016. 
Finally, Glass segment sales volumes grew slightly principally due to higher flat Glass demand. Supplementing the company's volume growth in the quarter were acquisition-related sales gains of about 5%, stemming primarily from the Comex acquisition, which we completed in November 2014. 
For the fourth quarter, we generally experienced normal seasonal sales trends in all our businesses and regions. Lastly, overall selling prices were flat, which was consistent with our expectations communicated at the beginning of the year. 
From an earnings perspective, our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.23 improved 17% versus the prior year. We accomplished this despite the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. 
We delivered higher year-over-year income in each reporting segment due to our improving sales volumes and an unwavering focus on cost, supplemented by earnings-accretive acquisitions. With respect to costs, in addition to achieving our acquisition-related cost synergies, we also realized initial benefits from our previously announced business restructuring. We will continue to recognize additional restructuring-related savings in 2016 as we implement these actions. 
In addition to cash deployment acquisitions, we also repurchased $250 million of PPG's stock in the fourth quarter. This brings our full share repurchase total to $750 million or about 7 million shares. In the quarter, our average diluted shares outstanding were 2.3% lower versus the previous year's fourth quarter. 
Now let me comment quickly on our full year results. On a full year basis, our sales were $15.3 billion, consistent with the prior year despite $1.1 billion of negative foreign currency headwinds. Our full year sales volumes grew about 1%, led by modest but broadening growth throughout the region or throughout the year in Europe. 
Our adjusted earnings per diluted share was a record $5.69, up 17% versus our prior record and consistent with the adjusted EPS growth rates we achieved each quarter this year. For the quarter and full year, we are pleased with our strong financial performance and overall operational execution, in which was a modest year from a global economic growth perspective. 
Over the year, we continue to execute on our strategic objectives. First and foremost was the successful integration of Comex acquisition. Now that we have lapped the acquisition's 1 year anniversary, let me say that Comex performance has been excellent on virtually every measure. Specifically, the business grew organically by high single-digit percentage in the first year of acquisition. We were successful during the year in capturing our targeted cost synergies. In addition, during 2015, we added revenue synergy targets and began to work toward achievement of those increased objectives. 
These additions include the sale of PPG legacy products through the Comex concessionaire network plus incremental sales synergies in Central America. Lastly, Comex has been maintained a pace of opening up a new concessionaire store location about every 2 days. They've added almost 190 locations in total for the year, and I'm proud to note that we recently reached a milestone of 4,000 store locations in Mexico. While this is a great accomplishment, we have still considerable organic growth opportunities ahead of us. 
In addition to the Comex results, we also completed 6 smaller acquisitions throughout 2015 with a purchase price of over $400 million. During the year, we continued our legacy of strong cash innovation with about $1.8 billion of cash generated from continuing operations. We also maintained our heritage returning cash to our shareholders, delivering about 60% of the cash generated for the year or about $1.1 billion through dividends and share repurchases. 
I will remind everyone that we have paid a dividend for 116 consecutive years and have raised our annual per share dividend payout for 44 consecutive years, including a 7% per share dividend increase in April 2015. Again, a very strong full year performance for our company. 
As we enter 2016, we anticipate global economic growth will continue but at a very paced and mixed by major economy. In the Asia-Pacific region, growth will most likely remain varied throughout the year but solid on a full year basis. Some of this 2016 year-over-year variation will be due to uneven 2015 regional volume patterns. 
A primary driver for growth in Asia is increased consumer spending, which is beneficial to PPG as this affects the majority of our products sold in the region. We ended the year on a strong note in Asia, and our order book for the first month of 2016 looks solid. 
Economic expansion in North America is likely to continue at a modest pace comparable to 2015 supported by multiple sectors. We anticipate continued improvement in construction markets in the U.S. and for Canada to stabilize a lower activity level realized in the second half of 2015. 
Overall, industrial activity is expected to remain modest but positive in comparison to the lower-than-anticipated 2015 level. We continue to expect solid organic growth in Mexico, supplemented by our revenue-related acquisition synergies. 
One item specific to PPG in 2016 is that we will continue with that multiyear U.S. architectural coatings branding initiatives. During 2016, we will be working with our major national retail or DIY customers on various modified branding initiatives. 
As a reminder, in 2015, we've rebranded our U.S. company-owned store network to PPG Paints. 
Moving to South America, where our business is relatively small at about 3% of total sales, demand in that region is expected to remain erratic and subdued. In Europe, we expect the economies to build on the broadening growth rate achieved in 2015, which would be beneficial to PPG as nearly 30% of our total sales are in that region. 
Favorable end-use market trends are expect to continue in 2016, particularly in automotive OEM coatings as industry builds growth rates in Europe and in aggregate, globally are expected to be positive for the year. Given that we have substantially reduced our cost structure in Europe, we expect incremental margins in that region to be in the 35% to 40% range. 
From an overall PPG perspective, we remain focused on delivering higher organic growth, including continued commercialization of our innovative industry-leading coatings technologies. Over the past several years, we have deployed many new or leading technologies for our end-use markets. These include our Compact Process technology in automotive OEM coatings, which has been widely adopted by customers as it reduces their facility construction costs and ongoing operating costs; our water-based automotive refinish coatings, which are now the leading water-based products in the industry. We've converted more auto body repair shops to waterborne coatings than the rest of the entire coatings industry combined. Our new interior can coatings realized growing consumer adoption over the past year. This allowed us to deliver mid-single-digit percentage growth, which is well above the packaging coatings industry growth rates with more to come in 2016. And several new products in our aerospace business and end-use market that is driven by new technologies that fit our technical strengths and capabilities. This is the primary reason why we have a leading position globally. 
In addition to organic growth, we will continue to be aggressive on cost and productivity initiatives as those of you who know us and followed us over the years, this is a never-ending quest for PPG. We are always looking for better ways to improve our cost structure. Finally, our balance sheet remains strong as we ended the year with cash and short-term investments of $1.5 billion. We intend to continue creating shareholder value through earnings-accretive cash deployment. We remain on pace with our prior commitment to deploy between $2 billion and $2.5 billion of cash in the years 2015 and 2016 combined, including the $1.15 billion we deployed in 2015. 
We expect coatings industry consolidation to continue in 2016. Our pipeline remains strong as we continue to bet potential acquisitions around the world. Share repurchases will also remain an integral part of our capital allocation strategy. Let me conclude by saying 2015 was an excellent year for PPG. We delivered 17% adjusted earnings per share growth despite stiff currency headwinds and an uneven regional economic growth. We are looking forward to another successful year in 2016. 
And now I'd like to turn it over to Frank to review a few 2016 financial assumptions."
294639,321351908,919983,"PPG Industries, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2016",2016-01-21,"Earnings Calls","PPG Industries, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to cover several items that will assist in modeling PPG's 2016 sales and earnings. We have included in today's presentation materials a summary of these financial assumptions on Slide #12. Firs",491,"Thank you, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to cover several items that will assist in modeling PPG's 2016 sales and earnings. We have included in today's presentation materials a summary of these financial assumptions on Slide #12. 
First is the carryover impact from the 6 acquisitions we completed throughout 2015. As we've discussed in the past, these acquisitions are expected to achieve full year sales of about $400 million in 2016. We realized about $150 million of sales in 2015 for these acquisitions and expect an incremental $250 million in 2016. This incremental revenue will be classified in the acquisition category until each acquired entity reaches its respective acquisition anniversary date, after which time, the entity's performance will be included in normal operating organic results. These acquisitions will typically achieve at or below the segment average margins as they become fully integrated into PPG. 
Next, we will continue to experience the impact of foreign currency translation headwinds as measured against the U.S. dollar. As a result, the company expects that year-over-year currency translation will unfavorably impact sales by $550 million to $600 million, and approximately 2/3 of this impact will be in the first half of the year. Pretax earnings will be impacted by about $70 million to $80 million with similar phasing for the year. These figures represent our current assumptions based on current exchange rates as of this week. Again, these impacts our currency translation related. Given the nature of our business, we typically do not incur significant transaction-related currency impacts. 
The next item relates to the company's pension and other postretirement benefits or OPEB expenses. Following an increase in 2015, we are expecting these expenses to decrease by about $20 million to $25 million in 2016. This decrease stems from our adoption of the split discount rate methodology for measurements of pension cost components, partly offset by slightly lower expected return on assets. 
We expect slightly higher interest costs in 2016, including the impact of our placements of long-term debt at the end of the first quarter 2015 along with changes in the cash balances. As a result, we expect a total of about $20 million of higher net interest expense year-over-year, and we provided our quarterly net interest estimates on the presentation slide. 
Next, we anticipate that the company's 2016 tax rates on ongoing earnings from continuing operations will be in the range of 24.5% to 25.5%. A comparable rate for 2015 was 24.5%. This increase relates primarily to our regional earnings mix. 
Finally, as Michael mentioned, the company still anticipates cash deployment of $2 billion to $2.5 billion for the years 2015 and 2016 combined for acquisitions and share repurchases. 
Once again, a summary of these financial assumptions is contained in the presentation materials provided for today's call. This now concludes our prepared remarks. Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG.

This is work that's been underway for quite some period of time. We have a lot of leading technologies that we were focused on, but maybe there's some additional regional opportunities for us in emerging regions. That's one. You've seen these significant adoption pickup rate in our packaging business. That's been a good one. You've seen in our refinished business more water-based sales there, and of course, in our automotive business, using the most recent acquisitions that we've done in REVOCOAT where those products are applied in the paint shop they had limited customers, a limited geographic scope, and we were going to take that out globally and get some shares there as well. So we've worked hard on trying to commercialize all this faster, and I think that's what the focus has been. We also had some new wins that we'll be rolling out later in 2016 as commercial transport. So that's all good as well. So altogether, I would say probably the most recent ones that you probably haven't seen in the past that are popping up would be our protective segment. In protective, we've had significant wins in dry docking, significant wins in the LNG sector, significant wins in some of what we call our advantage products, tank linings and things like that. So those are ones that we're rolling out globally as well. So I'd say that all positive."

So the aerospace, we would say that would be low single digits, so that is a reasonable number. If you look into PMC given our last quarter, I would say that it should continue to be low single digits. Obviously, the marine side is a problem. The order book for the big guys in Korea, where 50% of what their expectations were so marine new-builds will continue to be a challenge, but the protective side should be really solid. If you look at our refinish business, miles driven continue to go up. Gas prices are down. Distracted driving is up. Insurance claims are up. So refinish has done quite well. So I would call that historically, that would be a 0 business, but I'd say it's going to be a low single-digit kind of year. And then that leaves architectural, and I think again that's going to vary considerably by the region. We were pleased. The U.K., Ireland, Benelux, Scandinavia, all had good 3-plus kind of numbers. That was good for us. France actually stabilized it. So we saw a couple of months in the fourth quarter that were marginally up. It's a little too early to tell yet what we expect there, but I would say France, I'm more optimistic now that I've been the last, say, 9 to 15 months. So that's all good. The Eastern European countries are -- they've had a lot of promotional challenges, but I would tell you overall, it should come back around. When you look at the U.S., we've obviously had some good growth in the U.S. except for the dealer market. The dealer market continues to be challenged. Canada, I think, is probably going to stabilize. So I don't expect a lot in there. Mexico, we've had tremendous growth there. We're going to continue to expect to grow 2x GDP. The one negative in Mexico is the fact that government spending has started to slow down with the price of oil dropping. I think Brazil's going to be a challenge. I think China is going to be a challenge. Australia should be good, at least mid- I would say low to mid-single digits in Australia. So that's a good market for us. So all in all, I would say we should be at or above GDP for the Performance Coatings segment."

294639,321351908,920092,"PPG Industries, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2016",2016-01-21,"Earnings Calls","PPG Industries, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported fourth quarter and full year 2015 financial results. For the fourth quarter, our net sales were $3.7 billion, and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1",1825,"Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported fourth quarter and full year 2015 financial results. For the fourth quarter, our net sales were $3.7 billion, and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.23. 
While our net sales were flat with prior year, our sales in local currencies increased about 7% with higher sales volumes year-over-year and a continued benefit from acquisition-related sales. These sales increases were offset by persistent unfavorable foreign currency translation impacts. 
For the quarter, the unfavorable currency translation impact totaled about $250 million on sales and approximately $25 million on pretax income. Our sales volume growth in the quarter of nearly 2% represented our highest growth rate of the year. This solid volume growth stemmed from our validity to gain a larger share of our customers' wallets through their adoption of new or leading PPG technologies. 
In addition, we benefited from broadening improvement in European demand as our volumes in this region steadily improved in each quarter of 2015. We grew coatings volumes 1% in Europe in the first quarter and steadily improved to 3% in the fourth quarter. 
We also returned to solid mid-single-digit percentage growth rate in Asia as demand in that region improved markedly in comparison with a weaker third quarter. Volume trends in the Americas were mixed with country, but consistent with the prior year levels. We achieved organic growth in the U.S. and Mexico that was offset with lower year-over-year sales volumes in Canada and several South American countries. 
Our sales volume growth was broad-based across our business portfolio led by Industrial Coatings segment, which grew by mid-single digit percentage. We delivered sales volume gains in all our business units within the segment, including our general industrial business, where we reversed a negative sales volume trend experienced in the second and third quarters. 
Also, the automotive OEM industry growth rate improved sequentially and year-over-year, and our automotive OEM coatings business continue to grow at a rate above the industry average. Rounding out the segment, our packaging coatings business continues to benefit from industry move to new interior can coatings. Customer adoption of INNOVEL, our new interior can coating technology, remains strong, supporting our mid-single-digit percentage growth in that business. 
In the Performance Coatings segment, automotive refinish, protective and marine coatings and architectural coatings EMEA grew sales volumes. Growth in architectural coatings in Mexico and the U.S. was offset by weaker demand in Canada, Brazil and China. Aerospace coating sales volume declined in relation to a strong growth in the prior year and due to year-over-year differences in certain customer order patterns. This was the first decline in aerospace volumes in quite some time, and we expect the business to return to growth in 2016. 
Finally, Glass segment sales volumes grew slightly principally due to higher flat glass demand. Supplementing the company's volume growth in the quarter were acquisition-related sales gains of about 5%, stemming primarily from the Comex acquisition, which we've completed in November 2014. 
For the fourth quarter, we generally experienced normal seasonal sales trends in all our businesses and regions. Lastly, overall selling prices were flat, which was consistent with our expectations communicated at the beginning of the year. 
From an earnings perspective, our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.23 improved 17% versus the prior year. We accomplished this despite the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. 
We delivered higher year-over-year income in each reporting segment due to our improving sales volumes and an unwavering focus on costs, supplemented by earnings-accretive acquisitions. With respect to costs, in addition to achieving our acquisition-related cost synergies, we also realized initial benefits from our previously announced business restructuring. We will continue to recognize additional restructuring-related savings in 2016 as we implement these actions. 
In addition to cash deployed on acquisitions, we also repurchased $250 million of PPG's stock in the fourth quarter. This brings our full share repurchase total to $750 million or about 7 million shares. In the quarter, our average diluted shares outstanding were 2.3% lower versus the previous year's fourth quarter. 
Now, let me comment quickly on our full year results. On a full year basis, our sales were $15.3 billion, consistent with the prior year despite $1.1 billion of negative foreign currency headwinds. Our full year sales volumes grew about 1%, led by a modest but broadening growth throughout the region or throughout the year in Europe. 
Our adjusted earnings per diluted share was a record $5.69, up 17% versus our prior record and consistent with the adjusted EPS growth rates we achieved each quarter this year. For the quarter and full year, we are pleased with our strong financial performance and overall operational execution in which was a modest year from a global economic growth perspective. 
Over the year, we continue to execute on our strategic objectives. First and foremost was the successful integration of Comex acquisition. Now that we have lapped the acquisition's 1 year anniversary, let me say that Comex performance has been excellent on virtually every measure. Specifically, the business grew organically by high single-digit percentage in the first year of acquisition. We were successful during the year in capturing our targeted cost synergies. 
In addition, during 2015, we added revenue synergy targets and began to work toward achievement of those increased objectives. These additions include the sale of PPG legacy products through the Comex concessionaire network plus incremental sales synergies in Central America. 
Lastly, Comex has maintained a pace of opening up a new concessionaire store location about every 2 days. They've added almost 190 locations in total for the year, and I'm proud to note that we recently reached a milestone of 4,000 store locations in Mexico. While this was a great accomplishment, we have still considerable organic growth opportunities ahead of us. 
In addition to the Comex results, we also completed 6 smaller acquisitions throughout 2015 with a purchase price of over $400 million. During the year, we continued our legacy of strong cash generation with about $1.8 billion of cash generated from continuing operations. We also maintained our heritage of returning cash to our shareholders, delivering about 60% of the cash generated for the year or about $1.1 billion through dividends and share repurchases. 
I will remind everyone that we have paid the dividend for 116 consecutive years and have raised our annual per share dividend payout for 44 consecutive years, including a 7% per share dividend increase in April 2015. Again, a very strong full year performance for our company. 
As we enter 2016, we anticipate global economic growth will continue, but in a varied pace and mixed by major economy. In the Asia-Pacific region, growth will most likely remain varied throughout the year but solid on a full year basis. Some of this 2016 year-over-year variation will be due to uneven 2015 regional volume patterns. 
A primary driver for growth in Asia is increased consumer spending, which is beneficial to PPG as this affects the majority of our products sold in the region. We ended the year on a strong note in Asia, and our order book for the first month of 2016 looks solid. 
Economic expansion in North America is likely to continue at a modest pace comparable to 2015 supported by multiple sectors. We anticipate continued improvement in construction markets in the U.S. and for Canada to stabilize a lower activity level realized in the second half of 2015. 
Overall industrial activity is expected to remain modest but positive in comparison to the lower-than-anticipated 2015 level. We continue to expect solid organic growth in Mexico, supplemented by our revenue-related acquisition synergies. 
One item specific to PPG in 2016 is that we will continue with that multiyear U.S. architectural coatings branding initiatives. During 2016, we will be working with our major national retail or DIY customers on various modified branding initiatives. 
As a reminder, in 2015, we've rebranded our U.S. company-owned store network to PPG Paints. 
Moving to South America, where our business is relatively small at about 3% of total sales, demand in that region is expected to remain erratic and subdued. In Europe, we expect the economies to build on the broadening growth rate achieved in 2015, which would be beneficial to PPG as nearly 30% of our total sales are in that region. 
Favorable end-use market trends are expected to continue in 2016, particularly in automotive OEM coatings as industry builds growth rates in Europe and, in aggregate, globally are expected to be positive for the year. Given that we have substantially reduced our cost structure in Europe, we expect incremental margin in that region to be in the 35% to 40% range. 
From an overall PPG perspective, we remain focused on delivering higher organic growth, including continued commercialization of our innovative industry-leading coatings technologies. Over the past several years, we have deployed many new or leading technologies for our end-use markets. These include our Compact Process technology in automotive OEM coatings, which has been widely adopted by customers as it reduces their facility construction cost and ongoing operating costs; our water-based automotive refinish coatings, which are now the leading water-based products in the industry. 
We've converted more auto body repair shops to waterborne coatings than the rest of the entire coatings industry combined, our new INNOVEL interior can coatings realized growing consumer adoption over the past year. This allowed us to deliver mid-single-digit percentage growth, which is well above the packaging coatings industry growth rates with more to come in 2016; and several new products in our aerospace business, an end-use market that is driven by new technologies that fit our technical strengths and capabilities. This is the primary reason why we have a leading position globally. 
In addition to organic growth, we will continue to be aggressive on cost and productivity initiatives. As those of you who know us and followed us over the years, this is a never-ending quest for PPG. We are always looking for better ways to improve our cost structure. 
Finally, our balance sheet remains strong as we ended the year with cash and short-term investments of $1.5 billion. We intend to continue creating shareholder value through earnings-accretive cash deployment. We remain on pace with our prior commitment to deploy between $2 billion and $2.5 billion of cash in the years 2015 and 2016 combined, including the $1.15 billion we deployed in 2015. 
We expect coatings industry consolidation to continue in 2016. Our pipeline remains strong as we continue to vet potential acquisitions around the world. Share repurchases will also remain an integral part of our capital allocation strategy. 
Let me conclude by saying 2015 was an excellent year for PPG. We delivered 17% adjusted earnings per share growth despite stiff currency headwinds and uneven regional economic growth. We are looking forward to another successful year in 2016. 
And now, I'd like to turn it over to Frank to review a few 2016 financial assumptions."
294639,321351908,920092,"PPG Industries, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2016",2016-01-21,"Earnings Calls","PPG Industries, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to cover several items that will assist in modeling PPG's 2016 sales and earnings. We have included in today's presentation materials a summary of these financial assumptions on Slide #12. Firs",489,"Thank you, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to cover several items that will assist in modeling PPG's 2016 sales and earnings. We have included in today's presentation materials a summary of these financial assumptions on Slide #12. 
First is the carryover impact from the 6 acquisitions we completed throughout 2015. As we've discussed in the past, these acquisitions are expected to achieve full year sales of about $400 million in 2016. We realized about $150 million of sales in 2015 for these acquisitions and expect an incremental $250 million in 2016. 
This incremental revenue will be classified in the acquisition category until each acquired entity reaches its respective acquisition anniversary date after which time the entity's performance will be included in normal operating organic results. These acquisitions will typically achieve at or below the segment average margins as they become fully integrated into PPG. 
Next, we will continue to experience the impact of foreign currency translation headwinds as measured against the U.S. dollar. As a result, the company expects that year-over-year currency translation will unfavorably impact sales by $550 million to $600 million, and approximately 2/3 of this impact will be in the first half of the year. 
Pretax earnings will be impacted by about $70 million to $80 million with similar phasing for the year. These figures represent our current assumptions based on current exchange rates as of this week. Again, these impacts are currency translation-related. Given the nature of our business, we typically do not incur significant transaction-related currency impacts. 
The next item relates to the company's pension and other postretirement benefits or OPEB expenses. Following an increase in 2015, we are expecting these expenses to decrease by about $20 million to $25 million in 2016. This decrease stems from our adoption of the split discount rate methodology for measurement of pension cost components, partly offset by slightly lower expected return on assets. 
We expect slightly higher interest costs in 2016, including the impact of our placement of long-term debt at the end of the first quarter 2015 along with changes in the cash balances. As a result, we expect a total of about $20 million of higher net interest expense year-over-year, and we've provided our quarterly net interest estimates on the presentation slide. 
Next, we anticipate that the company's 2016 tax rate on ongoing earnings from continuing operations will be in the range of 24.5% to 25.5%. A comparable rate for 2015 was 24.5%. This increase relates primarily to our regional earnings mix. 
Finally, as Michael mentioned, the company still anticipates cash deployment of $2 billion to $2.5 billion for the years 2015 and 2016 combined for acquisitions and share repurchases.

This is work that's been underway for quite some period of time. We have a lot of leading technologies that we were focused on, but maybe there are some additional regional opportunities for us in emerging regions. That's one. You've seen the significant adoption pickup rate in our packaging business. That's been a good one. You've seen in our refinished business more water-based sales there. And of course, in our automotive business, you've seen the most recent acquisitions that we've done in REVOCOAT, where those products were applied in the paint shop, they had limited customers, a limited geographic scope, and we are going to take that out globally and get some shares there as well. So we've worked hard on trying to commercialize all this faster, and I think that's what the focus has been. We also had some new wins that we'll be rolling out later in 2016 in commercial transport. So that's all good as well. So altogether, I would say probably the most recent ones that you probably haven't seen in the past that are popping up would be our protective segment. In protective, we've had significant wins in dry docking, significant wins in the LNG sector, significant wins in some of what we call our advantage products, tank linings, and things like that. So those are ones that we're rolling out globally as well. So I'd say all positive."

So the aerospace, we would say that would be low single digits. So that is a reasonable number. If you look into PMC given our last quarter, I would say that it should continue to be low single digits. Obviously, the marine side is a problem. The order book for the big guys in Korea were 50% of what their expectations were. So marine new-builds will continue to be a challenge, but the protective side should be really solid. If you look at our refinish business, miles driven continue to go up. Gas prices are down. Distracted driving is up. Insurance claims are up. So refinish has done quite well. So I would call that -- historically, that would be a 0 business, but I'd say it's going to be a low single-digit kind of year. And then that leaves architectural, and I think, again, that's going to vary considerably by the region. We were pleased. The U.K., Ireland, Benelux, Scandinavia, all had good 3-plus kind of numbers. That was good for us. France actually stabilized. And so we saw a couple of months in the fourth quarter that were marginally up. It's a little too early to tell yet what we expect there, but I would say France, I'm more optimistic now that I've been the last, say, 9 to 15 months. So that's all good. The Eastern European countries are -- they've had a lot of promotional challenges, but I would tell you overall, it should come back around. When you look at the U.S., we've obviously had some good growth in the U.S. except for the dealer market. The dealer market continues to be challenged. Canada, I think, is probably going to stabilize. So I don't expect a lot in there. Mexico, we've had tremendous growth there. We're going to continue to expect to grow 2x GDP. The one negative in Mexico is the fact that government spending has started to slow down with the price of oil dropping. I think Brazil is going to be a challenge. I think China is going to be a challenge. Australia should be good, at least mid -- I would say low to mid-single digits in Australia. So that's a good market for us. So all in all, I would say we should be at or above GDP for the Performance Coatings segment."

That's where we bring tremendous amount of value to our multi-shop operators. We're able to improve their business. Instead of getting 9 cars out of the shop, they can get 10 cars out in a day. So that's been a positive for us. So I'd tell you that our share in the U.S. continues to increase. I don't know how much more the MSOs will aggregate this year because when I think about it from a debt market, I'm not sure how aggressive they're going to be in trying to raise more debt given this environment.

So inventory-wise, even though Europe historically doesn't keep much inventory, we still think that's a positive. If you look in the southern countries in Europe, they all had very high growth rates albeit coming off an extremely low base, but those are positives. So I'd say unlike in the U.S. where we're in the late innings in the U.S. for automotive, I'd say in Europe, we're more like the middle innings there. So I think we're -- that's just our viewpoint.

294639,321351908,920153,"PPG Industries, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2016",2016-01-21,"Earnings Calls","PPG Industries, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported fourth quarter and full year 2015 financial results. For the fourth quarter, our net sales were $3.7 billion, and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1",1825,"Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported fourth quarter and full year 2015 financial results. For the fourth quarter, our net sales were $3.7 billion, and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.23. 
While our net sales were flat with prior year, our sales in local currencies increased about 7% with higher sales volumes year-over-year and a continued benefit from acquisition-related sales. These sales increases were offset by persistent unfavorable foreign currency translation impacts. 
For the quarter, the unfavorable currency translation impact totaled about $250 million on sales and approximately $25 million on pretax income. Our sales volume growth in the quarter of nearly 2% represented our highest growth rate of the year. This solid volume growth stemmed from our validity to gain a larger share of our customers' wallets through their adoption of new or leading PPG technologies. 
In addition, we benefited from broadening improvement in European demand as our volumes in this region steadily improved in each quarter of 2015. We grew coatings volumes 1% in Europe in the first quarter and steadily improved to 3% in the fourth quarter. 
We also returned to solid mid-single-digit percentage growth rate in Asia as demand in that region improved markedly in comparison with a weaker third quarter. Volume trends in the Americas were mixed with country, but consistent with the prior year levels. We achieved organic growth in the U.S. and Mexico that was offset with lower year-over-year sales volumes in Canada and several South American countries. 
Our sales volume growth was broad-based across our business portfolio led by Industrial Coatings segment, which grew by mid-single digit percentage. We delivered sales volume gains in all our business units within the segment, including our general industrial business, where we reversed a negative sales volume trend experienced in the second and third quarters. 
Also, the automotive OEM industry growth rate improved sequentially and year-over-year, and our automotive OEM coatings business continue to grow at a rate above the industry average. Rounding out the segment, our packaging coatings business continues to benefit from industry move to new interior can coatings. Customer adoption of INNOVEL, our new interior can coating technology, remains strong, supporting our mid-single-digit percentage growth in that business. 
In the Performance Coatings segment, automotive refinish, protective and marine coatings and architectural coatings EMEA grew sales volumes. Growth in architectural coatings in Mexico and the U.S. was offset by weaker demand in Canada, Brazil and China. Aerospace coating sales volume declined in relation to a strong growth in the prior year and due to year-over-year differences in certain customer order patterns. This was the first decline in aerospace volumes in quite some time, and we expect the business to return to growth in 2016. 
Finally, Glass segment sales volumes grew slightly principally due to higher flat glass demand. Supplementing the company's volume growth in the quarter were acquisition-related sales gains of about 5%, stemming primarily from the Comex acquisition, which we've completed in November 2014. 
For the fourth quarter, we generally experienced normal seasonal sales trends in all our businesses and regions. Lastly, overall selling prices were flat, which was consistent with our expectations communicated at the beginning of the year. 
From an earnings perspective, our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.23 improved 17% versus the prior year. We accomplished this despite the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. 
We delivered higher year-over-year income in each reporting segment due to our improving sales volumes and an unwavering focus on costs, supplemented by earnings-accretive acquisitions. With respect to costs, in addition to achieving our acquisition-related cost synergies, we also realized initial benefits from our previously announced business restructuring. We will continue to recognize additional restructuring-related savings in 2016 as we implement these actions. 
In addition to cash deployed on acquisitions, we also repurchased $250 million of PPG's stock in the fourth quarter. This brings our full share repurchase total to $750 million or about 7 million shares. In the quarter, our average diluted shares outstanding were 2.3% lower versus the previous year's fourth quarter. 
Now, let me comment quickly on our full year results. On a full year basis, our sales were $15.3 billion, consistent with the prior year despite $1.1 billion of negative foreign currency headwinds. Our full year sales volumes grew about 1%, led by a modest but broadening growth throughout the region or throughout the year in Europe. 
Our adjusted earnings per diluted share was a record $5.69, up 17% versus our prior record and consistent with the adjusted EPS growth rates we achieved each quarter this year. For the quarter and full year, we are pleased with our strong financial performance and overall operational execution in which was a modest year from a global economic growth perspective. 
Over the year, we continue to execute on our strategic objectives. First and foremost was the successful integration of Comex acquisition. Now that we have lapped the acquisition's 1 year anniversary, let me say that Comex performance has been excellent on virtually every measure. Specifically, the business grew organically by high single-digit percentage in the first year of acquisition. We were successful during the year in capturing our targeted cost synergies. 
In addition, during 2015, we added revenue synergy targets and began to work toward achievement of those increased objectives. These additions include the sale of PPG legacy products through the Comex concessionaire network plus incremental sales synergies in Central America. 
Lastly, Comex has maintained a pace of opening up a new concessionaire store location about every 2 days. They've added almost 190 locations in total for the year, and I'm proud to note that we recently reached a milestone of 4,000 store locations in Mexico. While this was a great accomplishment, we have still considerable organic growth opportunities ahead of us. 
In addition to the Comex results, we also completed 6 smaller acquisitions throughout 2015 with a purchase price of over $400 million. During the year, we continued our legacy of strong cash generation with about $1.8 billion of cash generated from continuing operations. We also maintained our heritage of returning cash to our shareholders, delivering about 60% of the cash generated for the year or about $1.1 billion through dividends and share repurchases. 
I will remind everyone that we have paid the dividend for 116 consecutive years and have raised our annual per share dividend payout for 44 consecutive years, including a 7% per share dividend increase in April 2015. Again, a very strong full year performance for our company. 
As we enter 2016, we anticipate global economic growth will continue, but in a varied pace and mixed by major economy. In the Asia-Pacific region, growth will most likely remain varied throughout the year but solid on a full year basis. Some of this 2016 year-over-year variation will be due to uneven 2015 regional volume patterns. 
A primary driver for growth in Asia is increased consumer spending, which is beneficial to PPG as this affects the majority of our products sold in the region. We ended the year on a strong note in Asia, and our order book for the first month of 2016 looks solid. 
Economic expansion in North America is likely to continue at a modest pace comparable to 2015 supported by multiple sectors. We anticipate continued improvement in construction markets in the U.S. and for Canada to stabilize a lower activity level realized in the second half of 2015. 
Overall industrial activity is expected to remain modest but positive in comparison to the lower-than-anticipated 2015 level. We continue to expect solid organic growth in Mexico, supplemented by our revenue-related acquisition synergies. 
One item specific to PPG in 2016 is that we will continue with that multiyear U.S. architectural coatings branding initiatives. During 2016, we will be working with our major national retail or DIY customers on various modified branding initiatives. 
As a reminder, in 2015, we've rebranded our U.S. company-owned store network to PPG Paints. 
Moving to South America, where our business is relatively small at about 3% of total sales, demand in that region is expected to remain erratic and subdued. In Europe, we expect the economies to build on the broadening growth rate achieved in 2015, which would be beneficial to PPG as nearly 30% of our total sales are in that region. 
Favorable end-use market trends are expected to continue in 2016, particularly in automotive OEM coatings as industry builds growth rates in Europe and, in aggregate, globally are expected to be positive for the year. Given that we have substantially reduced our cost structure in Europe, we expect incremental margin in that region to be in the 35% to 40% range. 
From an overall PPG perspective, we remain focused on delivering higher organic growth, including continued commercialization of our innovative industry-leading coatings technologies. Over the past several years, we have deployed many new or leading technologies for our end-use markets. These include our Compact Process technology in automotive OEM coatings, which has been widely adopted by customers as it reduces their facility construction cost and ongoing operating costs; our water-based automotive refinish coatings, which are now the leading water-based products in the industry. 
We've converted more auto body repair shops to waterborne coatings than the rest of the entire coatings industry combined, our new INNOVEL interior can coatings realized growing consumer adoption over the past year. This allowed us to deliver mid-single-digit percentage growth, which is well above the packaging coatings industry growth rates with more to come in 2016; and several new products in our aerospace business, an end-use market that is driven by new technologies that fit our technical strengths and capabilities. This is the primary reason why we have a leading position globally. 
In addition to organic growth, we will continue to be aggressive on cost and productivity initiatives. As those of you who know us and followed us over the years, this is a never-ending quest for PPG. We are always looking for better ways to improve our cost structure. 
Finally, our balance sheet remains strong as we ended the year with cash and short-term investments of $1.5 billion. We intend to continue creating shareholder value through earnings-accretive cash deployment. We remain on pace with our prior commitment to deploy between $2 billion and $2.5 billion of cash in the years 2015 and 2016 combined, including the $1.15 billion we deployed in 2015. 
We expect coatings industry consolidation to continue in 2016. Our pipeline remains strong as we continue to vet potential acquisitions around the world. Share repurchases will also remain an integral part of our capital allocation strategy. 
Let me conclude by saying 2015 was an excellent year for PPG. We delivered 17% adjusted earnings per share growth despite stiff currency headwinds and uneven regional economic growth. We are looking forward to another successful year in 2016. 
And now, I'd like to turn it over to Frank to review a few 2016 financial assumptions."
294639,321351908,920153,"PPG Industries, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2016",2016-01-21,"Earnings Calls","PPG Industries, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to cover several items that will assist in modeling PPG's 2016 sales and earnings. We have included in today's presentation materials a summary of these financial assumptions on Slide #12. Firs",489,"Thank you, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to cover several items that will assist in modeling PPG's 2016 sales and earnings. We have included in today's presentation materials a summary of these financial assumptions on Slide #12. 
First is the carryover impact from the 6 acquisitions we completed throughout 2015. As we've discussed in the past, these acquisitions are expected to achieve full year sales of about $400 million in 2016. We realized about $150 million of sales in 2015 for these acquisitions and expect an incremental $250 million in 2016. 
This incremental revenue will be classified in the acquisition category until each acquired entity reaches its respective acquisition anniversary date after which time the entity's performance will be included in normal operating organic results. These acquisitions will typically achieve at or below the segment average margins as they become fully integrated into PPG. 
Next, we will continue to experience the impact of foreign currency translation headwinds as measured against the U.S. dollar. As a result, the company expects that year-over-year currency translation will unfavorably impact sales by $550 million to $600 million, and approximately 2/3 of this impact will be in the first half of the year. 
Pretax earnings will be impacted by about $70 million to $80 million with similar phasing for the year. These figures represent our current assumptions based on current exchange rates as of this week. Again, these impacts are currency translation-related. Given the nature of our business, we typically do not incur significant transaction-related currency impacts. 
The next item relates to the company's pension and other postretirement benefits or OPEB expenses. Following an increase in 2015, we are expecting these expenses to decrease by about $20 million to $25 million in 2016. This decrease stems from our adoption of the split discount rate methodology for measurement of pension cost components, partly offset by slightly lower expected return on assets. 
We expect slightly higher interest costs in 2016, including the impact of our placement of long-term debt at the end of the first quarter 2015 along with changes in the cash balances. As a result, we expect a total of about $20 million of higher net interest expense year-over-year, and we've provided our quarterly net interest estimates on the presentation slide. 
Next, we anticipate that the company's 2016 tax rate on ongoing earnings from continuing operations will be in the range of 24.5% to 25.5%. A comparable rate for 2015 was 24.5%. This increase relates primarily to our regional earnings mix. 
Finally, as Michael mentioned, the company still anticipates cash deployment of $2 billion to $2.5 billion for the years 2015 and 2016 combined for acquisitions and share repurchases. 
Once again, a summary of these financial assumptions is contained in the presentation materials provided for today's call. This now concludes our prepared remarks. Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG.

We have a lot of leading technologies that we were focused on, but maybe there are some additional regional opportunities for us in emerging regions. That's one. You've seen the significant adoption pickup rate in our packaging business. That's been a good one. You've seen in our refinished business more water-based sales there. And of course, in our automotive business, you've seen the most recent acquisitions that we've done in REVOCOAT, where those products were applied in the paint shop, they had limited customers, a limited geographic scope, and we are going to take that out globally and get some shares there as well. So we've worked hard on trying to commercialize all this faster, and I think that's what the focus has been. We also had some new wins that we'll be rolling out later in 2016 in commercial transport. So that's all good as well. So altogether, I would say probably the most recent ones that you probably haven't seen in the past that are popping up would be our protective segment. In protective, we've had significant wins in dry docking, significant wins in the LNG sector, significant wins in some of what we call our advantage products, tank linings, and things like that. So those are ones that we're rolling out globally as well. So I'd say all positive."

So the aerospace, we would say that would be low single digits. So that is a reasonable number. If you look into PMC given our last quarter, I would say that it should continue to be low single digits. Obviously, the marine side is a problem. The order book for the big guys in Korea were 50% of what their expectations were. So marine new-builds will continue to be a challenge, but the protective side should be really solid. If you look at our refinish business, miles driven continue to go up. Gas prices are down. Distracted driving is up. Insurance claims are up. So refinish has done quite well. So I would call that -- historically, that would be a 0 business, but I'd say it's going to be a low single-digit kind of year. And then that leaves architectural, and I think, again, that's going to vary considerably by the region. We were pleased. The U.K., Ireland, Benelux, Scandinavia, all had good 3-plus kind of numbers. That was good for us. France actually stabilized. And so we saw a couple of months in the fourth quarter that were marginally up. It's a little too early to tell yet what we expect there, but I would say France, I'm more optimistic now that I've been the last, say, 9 to 15 months. So that's all good. The Eastern European countries are -- they've had a lot of promotional challenges, but I would tell you overall, it should come back around. When you look at the U.S., we've obviously had some good growth in the U.S. except for the dealer market. The dealer market continues to be challenged. Canada, I think, is probably going to stabilize. So I don't expect a lot in there. Mexico, we've had tremendous growth there. We're going to continue to expect to grow 2x GDP. The one negative in Mexico is the fact that government spending has started to slow down with the price of oil dropping. I think Brazil is going to be a challenge. I think China is going to be a challenge. Australia should be good, at least mid -- I would say low to mid-single digits in Australia. So that's a good market for us. So all in all, I would say we should be at or above GDP for the Performance Coatings segment."

First of all, I mean, in fourth quarter aerospace weakness that you mentioned, was that related due to newbuilds or was that on the rebate part of the business?

One part of it was because in the fourth quarter 2014, we had a government entity double order.

And then the other half of the slowdown was due to our sealants business. We have a customer that has -- that had a large new plane that they were working on, and they've gotten more consistent in ordering, and their work practices have gotten slightly better. So their -- what I would call, their waste has declined marginally. So now that that's more stable, we see them returning back to a year-over-year growth.

294639,321351908,920411,"PPG Industries, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2016",2016-01-21,"Earnings Calls","PPG Industries, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported fourth quarter and full year 2015 financial results. For the fourth quarter, our net sales were $3.7 billion, and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1",1825,"Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported fourth quarter and full year 2015 financial results. For the fourth quarter, our net sales were $3.7 billion, and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.23. 
While our net sales were flat with prior year, our sales in local currencies increased about 7% with higher sales volumes year-over-year and a continued benefit from acquisition-related sales. These sales increases were offset by persistent unfavorable foreign currency translation impacts. 
For the quarter, the unfavorable currency translation impact totaled about $250 million on sales and approximately $25 million on pretax income. Our sales volume growth in the quarter of nearly 2% represented our highest growth rate of the year. This solid volume growth stemmed from our validity to gain a larger share of our customers' wallets through their adoption of new or leading PPG technologies. 
In addition, we benefited from broadening improvement in European demand as our volumes in this region steadily improved in each quarter of 2015. We grew coatings volumes 1% in Europe in the first quarter and steadily improved to 3% in the fourth quarter. 
We also returned to solid mid-single-digit percentage growth rate in Asia as demand in that region improved markedly in comparison with a weaker third quarter. Volume trends in the Americas were mixed with country, but consistent with the prior year levels. We achieved organic growth in the U.S. and Mexico that was offset with lower year-over-year sales volumes in Canada and several South American countries. 
Our sales volume growth was broad-based across our business portfolio led by Industrial Coatings segment, which grew by mid-single digit percentage. We delivered sales volume gains in all our business units within the segment, including our general industrial business, where we reversed a negative sales volume trend experienced in the second and third quarters. 
Also, the automotive OEM industry growth rate improved sequentially and year-over-year, and our automotive OEM coatings business continue to grow at a rate above the industry average. Rounding out the segment, our packaging coatings business continues to benefit from industry move to new interior can coatings. Customer adoption of INNOVEL, our new interior can coating technology, remains strong, supporting our mid-single-digit percentage growth in that business. 
In the Performance Coatings segment, automotive refinish, protective and marine coatings and architectural coatings EMEA grew sales volumes. Growth in architectural coatings in Mexico and the U.S. was offset by weaker demand in Canada, Brazil and China. Aerospace coating sales volume declined in relation to a strong growth in the prior year and due to year-over-year differences in certain customer order patterns. This was the first decline in aerospace volumes in quite some time, and we expect the business to return to growth in 2016. 
Finally, Glass segment sales volumes grew slightly principally due to higher flat glass demand. Supplementing the company's volume growth in the quarter were acquisition-related sales gains of about 5%, stemming primarily from the Comex acquisition, which we've completed in November 2014. 
For the fourth quarter, we generally experienced normal seasonal sales trends in all our businesses and regions. Lastly, overall selling prices were flat, which was consistent with our expectations communicated at the beginning of the year. 
From an earnings perspective, our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.23 improved 17% versus the prior year. We accomplished this despite the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. 
We delivered higher year-over-year income in each reporting segment due to our improving sales volumes and an unwavering focus on costs, supplemented by earnings-accretive acquisitions. With respect to costs, in addition to achieving our acquisition-related cost synergies, we also realized initial benefits from our previously announced business restructuring. We will continue to recognize additional restructuring-related savings in 2016 as we implement these actions. 
In addition to cash deployed on acquisitions, we also repurchased $250 million of PPG's stock in the fourth quarter. This brings our full share repurchase total to $750 million or about 7 million shares. In the quarter, our average diluted shares outstanding were 2.3% lower versus the previous year's fourth quarter. 
Now, let me comment quickly on our full year results. On a full year basis, our sales were $15.3 billion, consistent with the prior year despite $1.1 billion of negative foreign currency headwinds. Our full year sales volumes grew about 1%, led by a modest but broadening growth throughout the region or throughout the year in Europe. 
Our adjusted earnings per diluted share was a record $5.69, up 17% versus our prior record and consistent with the adjusted EPS growth rates we achieved each quarter this year. For the quarter and full year, we are pleased with our strong financial performance and overall operational execution in which was a modest year from a global economic growth perspective. 
Over the year, we continue to execute on our strategic objectives. First and foremost was the successful integration of Comex acquisition. Now that we have lapped the acquisition's 1 year anniversary, let me say that Comex performance has been excellent on virtually every measure. Specifically, the business grew organically by high single-digit percentage in the first year of acquisition. We were successful during the year in capturing our targeted cost synergies. 
In addition, during 2015, we added revenue synergy targets and began to work toward achievement of those increased objectives. These additions include the sale of PPG legacy products through the Comex concessionaire network plus incremental sales synergies in Central America. 
Lastly, Comex has maintained a pace of opening up a new concessionaire store location about every 2 days. They've added almost 190 locations in total for the year, and I'm proud to note that we recently reached a milestone of 4,000 store locations in Mexico. While this was a great accomplishment, we have still considerable organic growth opportunities ahead of us. 
In addition to the Comex results, we also completed 6 smaller acquisitions throughout 2015 with a purchase price of over $400 million. During the year, we continued our legacy of strong cash generation with about $1.8 billion of cash generated from continuing operations. We also maintained our heritage of returning cash to our shareholders, delivering about 60% of the cash generated for the year or about $1.1 billion through dividends and share repurchases. 
I will remind everyone that we have paid the dividend for 116 consecutive years and have raised our annual per share dividend payout for 44 consecutive years, including a 7% per share dividend increase in April 2015. Again, a very strong full year performance for our company. 
As we enter 2016, we anticipate global economic growth will continue, but in a varied pace and mixed by major economy. In the Asia-Pacific region, growth will most likely remain varied throughout the year but solid on a full year basis. Some of this 2016 year-over-year variation will be due to uneven 2015 regional volume patterns. 
A primary driver for growth in Asia is increased consumer spending, which is beneficial to PPG as this affects the majority of our products sold in the region. We ended the year on a strong note in Asia, and our order book for the first month of 2016 looks solid. 
Economic expansion in North America is likely to continue at a modest pace comparable to 2015 supported by multiple sectors. We anticipate continued improvement in construction markets in the U.S. and for Canada to stabilize a lower activity level realized in the second half of 2015. 
Overall industrial activity is expected to remain modest but positive in comparison to the lower-than-anticipated 2015 level. We continue to expect solid organic growth in Mexico, supplemented by our revenue-related acquisition synergies. 
One item specific to PPG in 2016 is that we will continue with that multiyear U.S. architectural coatings branding initiatives. During 2016, we will be working with our major national retail or DIY customers on various modified branding initiatives. 
As a reminder, in 2015, we've rebranded our U.S. company-owned store network to PPG Paints. 
Moving to South America, where our business is relatively small at about 3% of total sales, demand in that region is expected to remain erratic and subdued. In Europe, we expect the economies to build on the broadening growth rate achieved in 2015, which would be beneficial to PPG as nearly 30% of our total sales are in that region. 
Favorable end-use market trends are expected to continue in 2016, particularly in automotive OEM coatings as industry builds growth rates in Europe and, in aggregate, globally are expected to be positive for the year. Given that we have substantially reduced our cost structure in Europe, we expect incremental margin in that region to be in the 35% to 40% range. 
From an overall PPG perspective, we remain focused on delivering higher organic growth, including continued commercialization of our innovative industry-leading coatings technologies. Over the past several years, we have deployed many new or leading technologies for our end-use markets. These include our Compact Process technology in automotive OEM coatings, which has been widely adopted by customers as it reduces their facility construction cost and ongoing operating costs; our water-based automotive refinish coatings, which are now the leading water-based products in the industry. 
We've converted more auto body repair shops to waterborne coatings than the rest of the entire coatings industry combined, our new INNOVEL interior can coatings realized growing consumer adoption over the past year. This allowed us to deliver mid-single-digit percentage growth, which is well above the packaging coatings industry growth rates with more to come in 2016; and several new products in our aerospace business, an end-use market that is driven by new technologies that fit our technical strengths and capabilities. This is the primary reason why we have a leading position globally. 
In addition to organic growth, we will continue to be aggressive on cost and productivity initiatives. As those of you who know us and followed us over the years, this is a never-ending quest for PPG. We are always looking for better ways to improve our cost structure. 
Finally, our balance sheet remains strong as we ended the year with cash and short-term investments of $1.5 billion. We intend to continue creating shareholder value through earnings-accretive cash deployment. We remain on pace with our prior commitment to deploy between $2 billion and $2.5 billion of cash in the years 2015 and 2016 combined, including the $1.15 billion we deployed in 2015. 
We expect coatings industry consolidation to continue in 2016. Our pipeline remains strong as we continue to vet potential acquisitions around the world. Share repurchases will also remain an integral part of our capital allocation strategy. 
Let me conclude by saying 2015 was an excellent year for PPG. We delivered 17% adjusted earnings per share growth despite stiff currency headwinds and uneven regional economic growth. We are looking forward to another successful year in 2016. 
And now, I'd like to turn it over to Frank to review a few 2016 financial assumptions."
294639,321351908,920411,"PPG Industries, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2016",2016-01-21,"Earnings Calls","PPG Industries, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to cover several items that will assist in modeling PPG's 2016 sales and earnings. We have included in today's presentation materials a summary of these financial assumptions on Slide #12. Firs",489,"Thank you, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to cover several items that will assist in modeling PPG's 2016 sales and earnings. We have included in today's presentation materials a summary of these financial assumptions on Slide #12. 
First is the carryover impact from the 6 acquisitions we completed throughout 2015. As we've discussed in the past, these acquisitions are expected to achieve full year sales of about $400 million in 2016. We realized about $150 million of sales in 2015 for these acquisitions and expect an incremental $250 million in 2016. 
This incremental revenue will be classified in the acquisition category until each acquired entity reaches its respective acquisition anniversary date after which time the entity's performance will be included in normal operating organic results. These acquisitions will typically achieve at or below the segment average margins as they become fully integrated into PPG. 
Next, we will continue to experience the impact of foreign currency translation headwinds as measured against the U.S. dollar. As a result, the company expects that year-over-year currency translation will unfavorably impact sales by $550 million to $600 million, and approximately 2/3 of this impact will be in the first half of the year. 
Pretax earnings will be impacted by about $70 million to $80 million with similar phasing for the year. These figures represent our current assumptions based on current exchange rates as of this week. Again, these impacts are currency translation-related. Given the nature of our business, we typically do not incur significant transaction-related currency impacts. 
The next item relates to the company's pension and other postretirement benefits or OPEB expenses. Following an increase in 2015, we are expecting these expenses to decrease by about $20 million to $25 million in 2016. This decrease stems from our adoption of the split discount rate methodology for measurement of pension cost components, partly offset by slightly lower expected return on assets. 
We expect slightly higher interest costs in 2016, including the impact of our placement of long-term debt at the end of the first quarter 2015 along with changes in the cash balances. As a result, we expect a total of about $20 million of higher net interest expense year-over-year, and we've provided our quarterly net interest estimates on the presentation slide. 
Next, we anticipate that the company's 2016 tax rate on ongoing earnings from continuing operations will be in the range of 24.5% to 25.5%. A comparable rate for 2015 was 24.5%. This increase relates primarily to our regional earnings mix. 
Finally, as Michael mentioned, the company still anticipates cash deployment of $2 billion to $2.5 billion for the years 2015 and 2016 combined for acquisitions and share repurchases. 
Once again, a summary of these financial assumptions is contained in the presentation materials provided for today's call. This now concludes our prepared remarks. Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG.

This is work that's been underway for quite some period of time. We have a lot of leading technologies that we were focused on, but maybe there are some additional regional opportunities for us in emerging regions. That's one. You've seen the significant adoption pickup rate in our packaging business. That's been a good one. You've seen in our refinished business more water-based sales there. And of course, in our automotive business, you've seen the most recent acquisitions that we've done in REVOCOAT, where those products were applied in the paint shop, they had limited customers, a limited geographic scope, and we are going to take that out globally and get some shares there as well. So we've worked hard on trying to commercialize all this faster, and I think that's what the focus has been. We also had some new wins that we'll be rolling out later in 2016 in commercial transport. So that's all good as well. So altogether, I would say probably the most recent ones that you probably haven't seen in the past that are popping up would be our protective segment. In protective, we've had significant wins in dry docking, significant wins in the LNG sector, significant wins in some of what we call our advantage products, tank linings, and things like that. So those are ones that we're rolling out globally as well. So I'd say all positive."

So the aerospace, we would say that would be low single digits. So that is a reasonable number. If you look into PMC given our last quarter, I would say that it should continue to be low single digits. Obviously, the marine side is a problem. The order book for the big guys in Korea were 50% of what their expectations were. So marine new-builds will continue to be a challenge, but the protective side should be really solid. If you look at our refinish business, miles driven continue to go up. Gas prices are down. Distracted driving is up. Insurance claims are up. So refinish has done quite well. So I would call that -- historically, that would be a 0 business, but I'd say it's going to be a low single-digit kind of year. And then that leaves architectural, and I think, again, that's going to vary considerably by the region. We were pleased. The U.K., Ireland, Benelux, Scandinavia, all had good 3-plus kind of numbers. That was good for us. France actually stabilized. And so we saw a couple of months in the fourth quarter that were marginally up. It's a little too early to tell yet what we expect there, but I would say France, I'm more optimistic now that I've been the last, say, 9 to 15 months. So that's all good. The Eastern European countries are -- they've had a lot of promotional challenges, but I would tell you overall, it should come back around. When you look at the U.S., we've obviously had some good growth in the U.S. except for the dealer market. The dealer market continues to be challenged. Canada, I think, is probably going to stabilize. So I don't expect a lot in there. Mexico, we've had tremendous growth there. We're going to continue to expect to grow 2x GDP. The one negative in Mexico is the fact that government spending has started to slow down with the price of oil dropping. I think Brazil is going to be a challenge. I think China is going to be a challenge. Australia should be good, at least mid -- I would say low to mid-single digits in Australia. So that's a good market for us. So all in all, I would say we should be at or above GDP for the Performance Coatings segment."

So those were all kind of the negative. We also had a slowing in the industrial production. So when you factor that in and look at what we're looking at for 2016, I'm not nearly as pessimistic.

We've also improved the quality of the receivables by working down the percentage of past due, so we're pleased with that. But we still have several days to go we can get out of inventories and keep working on past due receivables. So the goal will be continue to bring down working capital by kind of, on average, 100 basis points a year for the next couple of years.

I want to thank you for your continued interest in PPG. Today, we reported first quarter 2016 financial results.

I want to thank you for your continued interest in PPG. Today, we reported first quarter 2016 financial results. We achieved first quarter net sales of $3.7 billion and record adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.31. Overall, we continue to deliver strong financial results as evidenced by our adjusted earnings per diluted share growth in the quarter, which increased 11% versus the record established in the prior year. We achieved these results despite ongoing unfavorable foreign currency translation and continued uneven global economic and market conditions.
Several factors contributed to the record first quarter results, including earnings leverage on our organic sales volume growth, our continued heritage of cost management and acquisition-related sales and income. Additionally, we continue to utilize our strong balance sheet, deliver shareholder value, including first quarter 2016 share repurchases totaling $150 million. For the quarter, our average diluted shares outstanding declined by 2% year-over-year. 
Our strong quarterly results were aided by our own operational and strategic actions, including aggressive efforts to drive higher organic growth despite a mixed economic environment. We continue to accelerate our work on developing and commercializing new customer-driven technologies. This includes packaging coatings ongoing customer adoption of our new can coating technologies along with certain key technology adoptions in our protective coatings business. 
In addition, we are continuing to roll out of our enhanced customer branding initiatives. As you would expect from PPG, we continue to maintain our discipline over cost, including finalizing the remaining actions from our previously announced business restructuring program.
Now I will discuss specific business trends for the first quarter. Our net sales in local currencies increased about 4% while reported net sales were consistent with the prior year. Local currency net sales growth driven by acquisition-related sales of about 3% and sales volume growth of 1%. These gains were offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation of 4% or about $140 million in the first quarter. Our first quarter sales volumes increased 1%, consistent with the prior year's growth rate, reflecting a continuation of modest global economic trends, led by broadening European demand growth. Sales volume grew in emerging regions by 1%. Continued growth in Asia Pacific, including China, was partially offset by persistent market weakness in South America. Most of our business units entire sales volume in Asia led by increased market demand for PPG's new technologies in our packaging and automotive refinish coatings businesses along with growth in protective coatings. 
Automotive OEM sales in Asia were tempered primarily due to a strong prior year comparable period where PPG experienced above market, double-digit [indiscernible] volume increases. We expect second quarter emerging regions sales volume growth rate to improve the [indiscernible] in line increases in most businesses in Asia and modest overall improvements and Latin America. 
Volumes in the U.S. and Canada region were slightly higher versus prior year and represented sequential improvement compared to the prior 2 quarters. Regional demand trends continue to be mixed by business and country with ongoing demand softness in certain markets within Canada.
In the region, sales volumes grew in our packaging and automotive refinishing coatings business, along with modest growth in our architectural coatings business. Aerospace sales volume declined primarily due to lower commercial demand and continued customer inventory management actions. 
Looking ahead, we anticipate further incremental improvements in regional growth rates in the second quarter. Building upon the month of March we tend to have the strongest sales volume growth within the quarter. 
Regionally, our highest first quarter sales volume growth rate was in Europe, Middle East and Africa, which delivered over 3% growth. We continue to experience a broadening improvement in Europe demand with our fifth consecutive quarter improving growth rates. PPG volume growth rates were positive across in Europe with most countries improving year-over-year. Despite overall growth this quarter, regional demand levels remain uneven. 
Improved performance in our architectural coatings EMEA business added to continued strong performance in our packaging and automotive OEM coating business in a region primarily due to continued customer adoption of PPG's market-leading technologies and related world-class product, services and support. Architectural growth was led by gains in the U.K. and Benelux countries with year-over-year growth trends. We remain optimistic for future economic driven demand expansion in the EMEA region. 
Despite recent improvements, regional demand remains well below prerecession levels and we continue to see signs of ongoing modest improvement in various economic subsectors. During the past several years, we've completed significant actions to reduce our overall regional cost structure. Similar to our experience in the past several quarters, we expect strong income leverage on any incremental sales volume growth.
I would like to take -- provide a quick update on foreign currency translation. As I mentioned earlier, during the quarter, unfavorable foreign currency translation lowered sales by approximately $140 million in pretax income by about $15 million. This primarily related to the Mexican peso and the Canadian dollar but included other currencies as well such as Europe. Based on current exchange rates, we anticipate full year unfavorable foreign currency translation to lower net sales by $200 million to $260 million and income by $30 million to $40 million. This is a decrease from the figure that we provided during our fourth quarter 2015 earnings call in January. This change reflects the strengthening of several foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar during the first quarter.
Shifting to earnings. Year-over-year adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 11% to a new first quarter record of $1.31, including unfavorable foreign currency translation. This marks the 13th consecutive quarter at double-digit percentage earnings for diluted share growth, and was achieved despite record performance in the first quarter of 2015. This trend of strong increases in quarterly earnings per diluted share is a reflection of the success of our business portfolio transformation actions taken over the past several years, including the successful integration and synergy achievement of several major acquisitions.
For the quarter, Performance Coatings segment sales declined by 1% and segment income was up more than 6%. Contributing to the results were higher acquisition-related sales and income, primarily from Le Joint Francais, [indiscernible] microwave, strong income leverage on higher sales volume and benefits from business restructuring, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation. Segment income included approximately $15 million of incremental growth-related spending in architectural U.S. and Canada. I'm pleased to report that we're currently launching several new products within many of our domestic national account partner store networks. These launches include new premium products at some national accounts as well as improved product formulation and different phased product label.
Industrial Coatings segment sales were up 2% and segment earnings increased 9%. Earnings leverage from organic sales volume growth, acquisition-related sales and income, along with disciplined cost management were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation. Acquisition-related growth was primarily from the [indiscernible] code and IBC industrial businesses acquired in 2015. These businesses continue to deliver strong financial results. They provide an excellent platform for future global business firm. 
[indiscernible] segment sales declined 2% and earnings declined by 7% versus the prior year. Higher selling prices and cost management actions were offset by lower sales volumes, $8 million in repair-related expenses due to our plant facility outage and lower equity earnings. Despite the lower sales volume, underlying flat glass demand remained solid. Additional segment and regional details can be found in the presentation materials.
Overall, our business performed well in the first quarter as we continue to manage against a mixed global economic backdrop, continuing to focus our efforts on improving organic growth rates through enhanced product innovation, customer branding strategies. Remain diligent over our costs and on pace to achieve the previously announced savings from our ongoing business restructuring program. 
Finally, our balance sheet remains strong and we are committed to deploying between $2 billion and $2.5 billion of cash in years 2015 and 2016 combined on acquisitions and share repurchase. 
In the first quarter, we repurchased $150 million of our stock bringing the total to $900 million for the 2-year period to date, coupled with the approximately $400 million paper acquisitions in 2015, PPG has deployed about $1.3 billion on earnings accretive actions against the started to date. We have a strong global pipeline of acquisition candidates across various end-use markets.
In addition to share repurchases and acquisitions, PPG remains committed to sustainable dividend increases as part of our capital allocation strategy. Today, our Board of Directors approved the dividend increase of $0.04 per share, bringing the quarterly dividend to $0.40 per share. This represents an 11% increase versus the prior quarterly dividend. Our last quarterly dividend increase was 7% in the second quarter 2015. 
As you can say by our actions and continued strong financial results, we remain focused on driving additional growth aimed at creating shareholder value. This concludes our prepared remarks. Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG, and now Andrew, would you please open the line for questions."

Clearly, we're anticipating that this is going to be a better paint season than we had last year. So that was a manifestation of that. Also, you had the uneven and uncertain return from the Chinese New Year. People were worried about that. So we were -- and we tried to tell you that we had a good order book coming in the Chinese New Year at our last call. We did see that coming out of Chinese New Year. So we did see good growth there.

So I would say, when I think back about the 4 years of consecutive outperformance, if our team took a 1-quarter pause, not happy.

So one of them is, 1 year ago, customers were having significant large programs. And as they ramped up, the last thing they want to do is stop their alignment lack of product. And so they intended to over inventory. Now they're more at a steady state rate, and so that allows them to have more confidence in their build rate and their usage rate. So that's the short term hurdle. You do have some underlying softness. So if you take the oil and gas market, they fly a lot of helicopters. So obviously, they're flying less helicopters in this kind of environment, so you have less aftermarket sales and you have less new helicopter builds. So that would be one. And then generally, aviation, there's a lot of churn in the water as you can tell with one of our customers in Canada. So there's some things going on up there. So I think overall, we're on a short-term, one-quarter, two-quarter bump on the road. But I anticipate the second half of the year for aerospace to be much better. I would point out that the acquisitions that we made to aerospace acquisitions are performing very well. And their growth rate is above the growth rate of the overall business. So the outlook, I would say, is solid."

The GDP in Mexico is 2.2%. Our growth is being driven by several factors. The first one is the new store growth rate. Last year, we added 170 stores in Mexico for over 4000 stores. We're now, today, as we speak, over 4,100 stores and we will add another 170 stores there. So what we've been gaining a lot of share in Mexico, the co-match team when we bought them, had a very large concentration in market share in what I would call Central Mexico. They were underrepresented in southern Mexico and underrepresented in northern Mexico. But we have a U.S. retail partner that have stores in Mexico. So we recently introduced the store and store concept down there. That's allowed them to gain shares as well. So from the store side, it's about service and product availability. And that's doing very well. Certainly, government spending has softened. And a lot of that is related to projects the government is trying to reduce spending given the price of oil. But there are elections coming up. So I would tell you that we're going to wait and see how it plays out. But historically in Mexico, when they have elections, the local politicians try to spruce things up to make things look a little bit better. And obviously, if they do that, it will be very happy to participate as we have a very significant share of Mexico."

The second thing I would say is, perhaps they could be out of the market for some period of time. But you know what, they have cash. That is easy to get and we're not going to assume that this is an open runaway for us. We're going to look at what our competition is. We have multiple people that are competing with these properties. So we will continue to evaluate that. But the bottom line is, we have not seen any increase in the number of people coming to us. I would tell you that overall, our mantra remains the same that we are very disciplined buyers and the business teams have to make a justification and the synergies have to be there. And that's the focus anytime we look at any acquisition."

There's a big tax in China on solvent-based products. So that's a positive for us. Historically, we do have positive price in our refinished business. You would expect that this year that we'll have positive price as well. Interesting enough, volumes in the U.S. is actually up. That is, miles driven is up 2%. Not only do we have miles driven up but you have distracted driving up eventually that I see about every day on my way home. So that's a positive. The other thing is when you look at what's happening with technology, our water-based product is outperforming in every region in the world. So even this Argentina right now, our business is growing in Argentina. One of our competitors vacated Brazil. We picked up a huge chunk of that business. One of our other competitors vacated Europe. We picked up a vast majority of that business. So we continued to perform in that regard. So when I think about one of the shining stars in PPG, think our refinishes is at the top of the list."

When I think about what's going on in the overall global supply demand environment, you have additional capacity in China. You're soon to have additional capacity in Mexico. So from that regard, that's obviously, more supply. Demand, if you look at Europe -- European TiO2 consumption is down about 15% from its peak. So net-net, even though euro volumes are recovering a little bit, they are still substantially down from where they were. Then of course, you have the material weakness in Brazil. The material weakness in -- most of Latin America, Russia. And so from a supply demand standpoint, I think we still see it as a balanced market. And I know they are out there running around with price increases announced. But if you remember, they've had price increase announcements for several quarters out of the past 2 to 3 years. And that's -- just because they announced it doesn't mean we're paying them. So overall, our goal, as you know, we've taken out of PPG, 10% of our TiO2 consumption as down because of substitution strategy, replacement of alternative products. And also, with the bringing in billions. So I know there's a lot of noise out there. But when we talk to our suppliers, we're trying to get them focused on supply and demand, and that's where we're going to stay on that topic. I know they're looking at -- they're not making any new money. By they didn't write us a check the last time when they were on the top of the cycle."

Industrial is a mixed bag, dependent upon which segment has anything to do with commodities as down. Heavy-duty equipment, down. Packaging, we're a little disappointed in the packaging output. It's rather pivotably flat with the consumer-driven economy, we would have thought that would've been up a little bit more. But we are gaining share there with our BPA non-intent products. So we could be doing better. If you look at refinished with Frank explained earlier, the carpark is growing when they made a nice move to the premium market we gained. We're now introducing some midtier products. So that should be a net positive. And it hasn't happened yet. But there is Comac, which expects to build an airplane at some point in time. They rolled it out the hangar but they rolled it back in the hangar. So those didn't fly. So I don't know when that will start. But obviously, we have a lot of content on that plane. So if it does get into production, we will be a net beneficiary of that. On the protective side, we are doing very well in protective in China. Marine, not bad. But you really have to balance that with the fact that the Korean Marine is just falling off a cliff. In fact, 2 of the 3 largest Korean shipbuilders did not even get a major order in Q1. But you have to balance what you see in China with the fact that Korea, which is where the big market is, is off. So I guess that would be my kind of a -- around the segment approach there."

I want to thank you for your continued interest in PPG. Today, we reported first quarter 2016 financial results. We achieved first quarter net sales of $3.7 billion and record adjusted earnings per diluted s",1498,"Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to thank you for your continued interest in PPG. Today, we reported first quarter 2016 financial results. We achieved first quarter net sales of $3.7 billion and record adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.31. Overall, we continue to deliver strong financial results as evidenced by our adjusted earnings per diluted share growth in the quarter, which increased 11% versus the record established in the prior year. We achieved these results despite ongoing unfavorable foreign currency translation and continued uneven global economic and market conditions.
Several factors contributed to the record first quarter results, including earnings leverage on our organic sales volume growth, our continued heritage of cost management and acquisition-related sales and income. Additionally, we continue to utilize our strong balance sheet, deliver shareholder value, including first quarter 2016 share repurchases totaling $150 million. For the quarter, our average diluted shares outstanding declined by 2% year-over-year. 
Our strong quarterly results were aided by our own operational and strategic actions, including aggressive efforts to drive higher organic growth despite a mixed economic environment. We continue to accelerate our work on developing and commercializing new customer-driven technologies. This includes packaging, coatings, ongoing customer adoption of our new can coating technologies, along with certain key technology adoptions in our protective coatings business. 
In addition, we are continuing to roll out our enhanced customer branding initiatives. As you would expect from PPG, we continue to maintain our discipline over costs, including finalizing the remaining actions from our previously announced business restructuring program.
Now I will discuss some specific business trends for the first quarter. Our net sales in local currencies increased about 4%, while reported net sales were consistent with the prior year. Local currency net sales growth was driven by acquisition-related sales of about 3% and sales volume growth of 1%. These gains were offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation of 4% or about $140 million in the first quarter. Our first quarter sales volumes increased 1%, consistent with the prior year's growth rate, reflecting a continuation of modest global economic trends, led by broadening European demand growth. Sales volumes grew in emerging regions by 1%. Continued growth in Asia Pacific, including China, was partially offset by persistent market weakness in South America. Most of our business units experienced sales volumes in Asia led by increased market demand for PPG's new technologies in our packaging and automotive refinish coatings businesses, along with growth in protective coatings. 
Automotive OEM sales volumes in Asia were tempered, primarily due to a strong prior year comparable period where PPG experienced above market, double-digit percentage volume increases. We expect second quarter emerging region sales volumes growth rate to improve the borderline increases in most businesses in Asia, and modest overall improvements in Latin America. 
Volumes in the U.S. and Canada region were slightly higher versus prior year and represented sequential improvements compared to the prior 2 quarters. Regional demand trends continue to be mixed by business and country, with ongoing demand softness in certain markets within Canada.
In the region, sales volumes grew in our packaging and automotive refinished coatings business, along with modest growth in our architectural coatings business. Aerospace sales volumes declined primarily due to lower commercial demand and continued customer inventory management actions. 
Looking ahead, we anticipate further incremental improvements in regional growth rates in the second quarter. Building upon the month of March, we have the strongest sales volume growth within the quarter. 
Regionally, our highest first quarter sales volume growth rate was in Europe, Middle East and Africa, which delivered over 3% growth. We continue to experience a broadening improvement in Europe demands with our fifth consecutive quarter of improving growth rates. PPG's volume growth rates were positive across Western Europe, with most countries improving year-over-year. Despite overall growth this quarter, regional demand levels remain uneven. 
Improved performance in our architectural coatings EMEA business added to continued strong performance in our packaging and automotive OEM coatings business in a region primarily due to continued customer adoption of PPG's market-leading technologies and related world-class product, service and support. Architectural growth was led by gains in the U.K. and Benelux countries with year-over-year growth trends. We remain optimistic for future economic driven demand expansion in the EMEA region. 
Despite recent improvements, regional demand remains well below prerecession levels, and we continue to see signs of ongoing modest improvements in various economic subsectors. During the past several years, we've completed significant actions to reduce our overall regional cost structure. Similar to our experience in the past several quarters, we expect strong income leverage on any incremental sales volume growth.
I would like to take a -- provide a quick update on foreign currency translation. As I mentioned earlier, during the quarter, unfavorable foreign currency translation lowered sales by approximately $140 million and pretax income by about $15 million. This was primarily related to the Mexican peso and the Canadian dollar, but included other currencies as well, such as the euro. Based on current exchange rates, we anticipate full year unfavorable foreign currency translation to lower net sales by $200 million to $260 million, and income by $30 million to $40 million. This is a decrease from the figure that we provided during our fourth quarter 2015 earnings call in January. This change reflects the strengthening of several foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar during the first quarter.
Shifting to earnings. Year-over-year adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 11% to a new first quarter record of $1.31, including unfavorable foreign currency translation. This marks the 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit percentage earnings for diluted share growth, and was achieved despite record performance in the first quarter of 2015. This trend of strong increases in quarterly earnings per diluted share is a reflection on the success of our business portfolio transformation actions taken over the past several years, including the successful integration and synergy achievement at several major acquisitions.
For the quarter, Performance Coatings segment sales declined by 1%, and segment income was up more than 6%. Contributing to the results were higher acquisition-related sales and income, primarily from Le Joint Francais, Cuming's microwave; strong income leverage on higher sales volume and benefits from business restructuring, partly offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation. Segment income included approximately $15 million of incremental growth-related spending in architectural U.S. and Canada. I'm pleased to report that we're currently launching several new products within many of our domestic national account partner store networks. These launches include new premium products at some national accounts, as well as improved product formulation and different phased product label.
Industrial Coatings segment sales were up 2%, and segment earnings increased 9%. Earnings leverage from organic sales volume growth, acquisition-related sales and income, along with disciplined cost management were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation. Acquisition-related growth was primarily from the REVOCOAT and IBC industrial businesses acquired in 2015. These businesses continue to deliver strong financial results. They provide an excellent platform for future global business sprout. 
Glass segment sales declined 2% and earnings declined by 7% versus the prior year. Higher selling prices and cost management actions were offset by lower sales volumes, $8 million in repair-related expenses due to our plant facility outage, and lower equity earnings. Despite the lower sales volumes, underlying flat glass demand remains solid. Additional segment and regional details can be found in the presentation materials.
Overall, our business performed well in the first quarter as we continue to manage against a mixed global economic backdrop; continue to focus our efforts on improving organic growth rates through enhanced product innovation, customer branding strategies; remain diligent over our costs and are on pace to achieve the previously announced savings from our ongoing business restructuring program. 
Finally, our balance sheet remained strong and we are committed to deploying between $2 billion and $2.5 billion of cash, in years 2015 and 2016 combined, on acquisitions and share repurchase. 
In the first quarter, we repurchased $150 million of our stock, bringing the total to $900 million for the 2-year period to date, coupled with the approximately $400 million paid for acquisitions in 2015, PPG has deployed about $1.3 billion on earnings accretive actions against this target to date. We have a strong global pipeline of acquisition candidates across various end-use markets.
In addition to share repurchases and acquisitions, PPG remains committed to sustainable dividend increases as part of our capital allocation strategy. Today, our Board of Directors approved the dividend increase of $0.04 per share, bringing the quarterly dividend to $0.40 per share. This represents an 11% increase versus the prior quarterly dividend. Our last quarterly dividend increase was 7% in the second quarter 2015. 
As you can see by our actions and continued strong financial results, we remain focused on driving additional growth aimed at creating shareholder value. This concludes our prepared remarks. Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG, and now Andrew, would you please open the line for questions."

But we're in the very early stages of our growth programs, so the BPA-NI for packaging and coatings, we'll -- sure, we'll get questions on that. But that's progressing well. The OEM Compaq process continues to do well, Refinish, Waterborne. So I'd say that's the first commentary. The second one, which is March. March, we had a nice start to the paint season. Clearly, we're anticipating that this is going to be a better paint season than we had last year. So that was a manifestation of that. Also, you had the uneven and uncertain return from the Chinese New Year. People were worried about that. So we were -- and we tried to tell you that we had a good order book coming in the Chinese New Year at our last call. We did see that coming out of Chinese New Year. So we did see a good growth there. And I think the other one is the broadening of the growth rate in Europe. That was a nice win there as well. So altogether, I would say that we are closer to 2% to 3% growth in March versus the 1% that we reported in the overall quarter."

At some point, we would have some reversion of mean. If you remember, last year, first quarter of 2015, we were up 9%, and Asia was up much higher than that. So when I look at our automotive performance, we had 2 regions that outperformed, 1 region that underperformed and 1 region was at parity. So we were essentially at the 1.7% growth rate for the industry. So I would say, when I think back about the 4 years of consecutive outperformance, if our team took a 1-quarter pause, not happy. But obviously, in the grand scheme of things, we continue to perform very well in the automotive business. And I would expect that we're going to continue to see growth in Europe. Registrations were up 5%. So I would expect European build to continue. Asia builds, India's really doing well. I'm not going to call the bottom in Brazil because I don't know where that is. But certainly, I think overall, we are pleased with the performance."

Last year, we had marginally positive price in an, obviously, very challenging environment. We have forecasted marginally -- flat to marginally up, again this year. The automotive segment, it's not really a fair thing to look at it on a piece by piece basis because most of what we have is new product technology. So it's hard to compare the new technology versus the old. So overall, we've had very sophisticated automotive customers. They expect a fair pricing. We have new technology.

I don't want to comment per se on how our retail customers are doing. I think it's up to them to comment on how the retail customers are doing. But I will tell you that we had new product launches with DIAMOND and the GLIDDEN brand in Home Depot. The early signs -- it's just now getting in the market. The early signs are very positive. We have a super-premium price point. A fair amount in Menards, also off to a good start. We'll then complete at Walmart. So I think when we look at it from our perspective, and I certainly have to let our customers talk about it from their perspective, but we're pleased with what we're seeing.

So one of them is, 1 year ago, customers were having significant launch programs. And as they ramped up, the last thing they want to do is stop their line with lack of product. And so they tended to over inventory. Now they're more at a steady state rate, and so there it allows them to have more confidence in their build rate and their usage rate. So that's the short term hurdle. You do have some underlying softness. So if you take the oil and gas market, they fly a lot of helicopters. So obviously, they're flying less helicopters in this kind of environment, so you have less aftermarket sales and you have less new helicopter builds. So that would be one. And then general aviation, there's a lot of churn in the water, as you can tell with one of our customers in Canada. So there's some things going on up there. So I think overall, we're on a short-term, one-quarter, two-quarter bump in the road. But I anticipate the second half of the year for aerospace to be much better. I would point out that the acquisitions that we made -- the 2 aerospace acquisitions we've made are performing very well. And their growth rate is above the growth rate of the overall business. So the outlook, I would say, is solid."

We're now, today, as we speak, over 4,100 stores and we will add another 170 stores there. So what -- we've been gaining a lot of share at Mexico, the Comex team, when we bought them, had a very large concentration in their market share in what I would call Central Mexico. They were underrepresented in southern Mexico and underrepresented in northern Mexico. But we have a U.S. retail partner that have stores in Mexico. So we recently introduced the store and store concept down there. That's allowing them to gain shares as well. So from the store side, it's about service and product availability. And that's doing very well. Certainly, government spending has softened. And a lot of that is related to projects. The government is trying to reduce spending, given the price of oil. But there are elections coming up. So I would tell you that we're going to wait and see how it plays out.

We do expect that we're going to settle up in the first half of the year -- before the end of the first half of the year. And consistent with what we've said in the past and what you'll see when we file our Q over, we lay that out, we've got about $500 million of cash going out initially, plus the option to pay out an additional amount of cash which represents the present value of the future obligations discounted at 5.5%. We'll obviously evaluate economic conditions at that time to determine whether we would take advantage of that discount. That could potentially be attractive for us to do so. So the gross being something over $800 million, but then almost immediately, we will start on a quarterly basis the adjusting our estimated taxes. And we'll over the ensuing few quarters, achieve a benefit that will bring the net cash outflow in total to about $500 million. That would assume -- if you were to assume that we took advantage of the discounted annuity. So that would be the way we'll look at it.

So you're looking at somewhere in the $50 million range. The stocks in our share count already, they'll remain in our share count going forward."

Despite the fact that we still -- even though the currency headwind was a little bit lower than we expected, it was still a headwind in Q1 versus prior. I think it was a combination of factors. One, we've taken some benefits -- additional benefit this year from restructuring that would not have taken place in the last year's first quarter because the restructuring program was really just getting underway at that point, first-half of the year. So there's that piece of it. We had some manufacturing productivity. We've moved more aggressively, obviously, particularly in Europe, on rationalizing and moving the consumer shared service department from the administrative side. Acquisitions, with a nice pass through of the margins from those acquisitions, was also an uplift, as those acquisitions provided us some margin, a little bit above the corporate average. So the combination of factors plus, admittedly, as we have said before, a modest amount of raw material savings in the first half of this year continuing what we saw in the back half of last year, all that contributed to the 110 basis points."

So southern Europe, Spain, Italy, for example, significantly accelerating growth quarter-over-quarter in all our businesses. And that's the benefit. We don't have architectural. We do have a little bit in Spain but very little. We have a little bit in Italy. But in grand scheme of things, it's pretty small. So overall, Spain and Southern Italy and southern Europe is doing very well, and that's a net positive for us. The offset to that, of course, is Russia. Although I will tell you that we are outperforming in Russia, especially in our industrial business, they've done a really good job. There they're trying to get more localization, and so that has benefited us. The Middle East, I would say, slightly better than company average. And that encompasses all our business.

Industrial is a mixed bag, dependent upon which segment, so anything to do with commodities is down. Heavy-duty equipment, down. Packaging, we're a little disappointed in the packaging output. It's relatively flat. With the consumer-driven economy, we would have thought that would've been up a little bit more. But we are gaining share there with our BPA non-intent products. So this could be doing better. If you look at refinished with, Frank explained earlier, the carpark is growing. When they've made the nice move to the premium market we gain. We're now introducing some midtier products. So that should be a net positive. It hasn't happened yet. But there is a Comac, which expects to build an airplane at some point in time. They rolled it out of the hangar but they rolled it back in the hangar, as far as I saw they didn't fly. So I don't know when that will start. But obviously, we have a lot of content on that plane. So if it does get into production, we will be a net beneficiary of that. On the protective side, we are doing very well in protective in China. Marine, not bad. But you really have to balance that with the fact that the Korean Marine is just falling off a cliff. In fact, 2 of the 3 largest Korean shipbuilders did not even get a major order in Q1. But you have to balance with what you see in China with the fact that Korea, which is where the big market is, is off. So I guess that would be my kind of a -- around the segment approach there."

So Q2, in fact, will still be a headwind, but a bit less than Q1, if things stay where they are and will continue to dwindle down as it goes through the year. Positive and negative at some point in time. Well, it depends on the mix, because, as far as the last few quarters, the biggest headwind was the euro, with a little bit stronger euro than anticipated but a little bit weaker peso, for instance, because of some of the oil-based factors there as well as some weakness in the Latin America. Some of that mix could change. So could one of the currencies turn positive at some point in time? Sure. But overall, if you look at the whole basket, yes. The 140 on the top line the 50 you saw on the bottom line in the first quarter, that'll be a little bit less. And then the numbers that Michael gave for the year, that $200 million, $260 million on the top line, and the 30 to 40 at the bottom line dictates that, at current rates, things will automatically come down. We'll see how that plays out [indiscernible] throughout the year. And I'll remind everybody, the guidance we gave in January was close to $600 million top line and 70 -- I'm sorry 70, 80 bottom line.

I want to thank you for your continued interest in PPG. Today, we reported first quarter 2016 financial results. We achieved first quarter net sales of $3.7 billion and record adjusted earnings per diluted s",1497,"Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to thank you for your continued interest in PPG. Today, we reported first quarter 2016 financial results. We achieved first quarter net sales of $3.7 billion and record adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.31. Overall, we continue to deliver strong financial results as evidenced by our adjusted earnings per diluted share growth in the quarter, which increased 11% versus the record established in the prior year. We achieved these results despite ongoing unfavorable foreign currency translation and continued uneven global economic and market conditions.
Several factors contributed to the record first quarter results, including earnings leverage on our organic sales volume growth, our continued heritage of cost management and acquisition-related sales and income. Additionally, we continue to utilize our strong balance sheet, deliver shareholder value, including first quarter 2016 share repurchases totaling $150 million. For the quarter, our average diluted shares outstanding declined by 2% year-over-year. 
Our strong quarterly results were aided by our own operational and strategic actions, including aggressive efforts to drive higher organic growth despite a mixed economic environment. We continue to accelerate our work on developing and commercializing new customer-driven technologies. This includes packaging, coatings, ongoing customer adoption of our new can coating technologies, along with certain key technology adoptions in our protective coatings business. 
In addition, we are continuing to roll out our enhanced customer branding initiatives. As you would expect from PPG, we continue to maintain our discipline over costs, including finalizing the remaining actions from our previously announced business restructuring program.
Now I will discuss some specific business trends for the first quarter. Our net sales in local currencies increased about 4%, while reported net sales were consistent with the prior year. Local currency net sales growth was driven by acquisition-related sales of about 3% and sales volume growth of 1%. These gains were offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation of 4% or about $140 million in the first quarter. Our first quarter sales volumes increased 1%, consistent with the prior year's growth rate, reflecting a continuation of modest global economic trends, led by broadening European demand growth. Sales volumes grew in emerging regions by 1%. Continued growth in Asia-Pacific, including China, was partially offset by persistent market weakness in South America. Most of our business units experienced sales volumes in Asia led by increased market demand for PPG's new technologies in our packaging and automotive refinish coatings businesses, along with growth in protective coatings. 
Automotive OEM sales volumes in Asia were tempered, primarily due to a strong prior year comparable period where PPG experienced above market, double-digit percentage volume increases. We expect second quarter emerging region sales volumes growth rate to improve the borderline increases in most businesses in Asia, and modest overall improvements in Latin America. 
Volumes in the U.S. and Canada region were slightly higher versus prior year and represented sequential improvements compared to the prior 2 quarters. Regional demand trends continue to be mixed by business and country, with ongoing demand softness in certain markets within Canada.
In the region, sales volumes grew in our packaging and automotive refinished coatings business, along with modest growth in our architectural coatings business. Aerospace sales volumes declined primarily due to lower commercial demand and continued customer inventory management actions. 
Looking ahead, we anticipate further incremental improvements in regional growth rates in the second quarter, building upon the month of March which had the strongest sales volume growth within the quarter. 
Regionally, our highest first quarter sales volume growth rate was in Europe, Middle East and Africa, which delivered over 3% growth. We continue to experience a broadening improvement in Europe demand with our fifth consecutive quarter of improving growth rates. PPG's volume growth rates were positive across Western Europe, with most countries improving year-over-year. Despite overall growth this quarter, regional demand levels remain uneven. 
Improved performance in our architectural coatings EMEA business added to continued strong performance in our packaging and automotive OEM coatings business in the region primarily due to continued customer adoption of PPG's market-leading technologies and related world-class product, service and support. Architectural growth was led by gains in the U.K. and Benelux countries with year-over-year growth trends [ph]. We remain optimistic for future economic driven demand expansion in the EMEA region. 
Despite recent improvements, regional demand remains well below prerecession levels, and we continue to see signs of ongoing modest improvements in various economic subsectors. During the past several years, we've completed significant actions to reduce our overall regional cost structure. Similar to our experience in the past several quarters, we expect strong income leverage on any incremental sales volume growth.
I would like to take a -- provide a quick update on foreign currency translation. As I mentioned earlier, during the quarter, unfavorable foreign currency translation lowered sales by approximately $140 million and pretax income by about $15 million. This was primarily related to the Mexican peso and the Canadian dollar, but included other currencies as well, such as the euro. Based on current exchange rates, we anticipate full year unfavorable foreign currency translation to lower net sales by $200 million to $260 million, and income by $30 million to $40 million. This is a decrease from the figure that we provided during our fourth quarter 2015 earnings call in January. This change reflects the strengthening of several foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar during the first quarter.
Shifting to earnings. Year-over-year adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 11% to a new first quarter record of $1.31, including unfavorable foreign currency translation. This marks the 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit percentage earnings per diluted share growth, and was achieved despite record performance in the first quarter of 2015. This trend of strong increases in quarterly earnings per diluted share is a reflection on the success of our business portfolio transformation actions taken over the past several years, including the successful integration and synergy achievement at several major acquisitions.
For the quarter, Performance Coatings segment sales declined by 1%, and segment income was up more than 6%. Contributing to the results were higher acquisition-related sales and income, primarily from Le Joint Francais, Cumings Microwave; strong income leverage on higher sales volume and benefits from business restructuring, partly offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation. Segment income included approximately $15 million of incremental growth-related spending in architectural U.S. and Canada. I'm pleased to report that we're currently launching several new products within many of our domestic national account partner store networks. These launches include new premium products at some national accounts, as well as improved product formulation and differentiated product labels.
Industrial Coatings segment sales were up 2%, and segment earnings increased 9%. Earnings leverage from organic sales volume growth, acquisition-related sales and income, along with disciplined cost management were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation. Acquisition-related growth was primarily from the REVOCOAT and IBC industrial businesses acquired in 2015. These businesses continue to deliver strong financial results. They provide an excellent platform for future global business growth. 
Glass segment sales declined 2% and earnings declined by 7% versus the prior year. Higher selling prices and cost management actions were offset by lower sales volumes, $8 million in repair-related expenses due to a planned facility outage, and lower equity earnings. Despite the lower sales volumes, underlying flat glass demand remains solid. Additional segment and regional details can be found in the presentation materials.
Overall, our business performed well in the first quarter as we continue to manage against a mixed global economic backdrop; continue to focus our efforts on improving organic growth rates through enhanced product innovation, customer branding strategies; remain diligent over our costs and are on pace to achieve the previously announced savings from our ongoing business restructuring program. 
Finally, our balance sheet remained strong and we are committed to deploying between $2 billion and $2.5 billion of cash, in years 2015 and 2016 combined, on acquisitions and share repurchase. 
In the first quarter, we repurchased $150 million of our stock, bringing the total to $900 million for the 2-year period to date, coupled with the approximately $400 million paid for acquisitions in 2015, PPG has deployed about $1.3 billion on earnings accretive actions against this target to date. We have a strong global pipeline of acquisition candidates across various end-use markets.
In addition to share repurchases and acquisitions, PPG remains committed to sustainable dividend increases as part of our capital allocation strategy. Today, our Board of Directors approved the dividend increase of $0.04 per share, bringing the quarterly dividend to $0.40 per share. This represents an 11% increase versus the prior quarterly dividend. Our last quarterly dividend increase was 7% in the second quarter 2015. 
As you can see by our actions and continued strong financial results, we remain focused on driving additional growth aimed at creating shareholder value. This concludes our prepared remarks. Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG, and now Andrew, would you please open the line for questions."

The OEM Compact Process continues to do well, Refinish, Waterborne. So I'd say that's the first commentary. The second one, which is March. March, we had a nice start to the paint season. Clearly, we're anticipating that this is going to be a better paint season than we had last year. So that was a manifestation of that. Also, you had the uneven and uncertain return from the Chinese New Year. People were worried about that. So we were -- and we tried to tell you that we had a good order book coming in the Chinese New Year at our last call. We did see that coming out of Chinese New Year. So we did see a good growth there. And I think the other one is the broadening of the growth rate in Europe. That was a nice win there as well. So altogether, I would say that we are closer to 2% to 3% growth in March versus the 1% that we reported in the overall quarter."

So when I look at our automotive performance, we had 2 regions that outperformed, 1 region that underperformed and 1 region was at parity. So we were essentially at the 1.7% growth rate for the industry. So I would say, when I think back about the 4 years of consecutive outperformance, if our team took a 1-quarter pause, not happy. But obviously, in the grand scheme of things, we continue to perform very well in the automotive business. And I would expect that we're going to continue to see growth. In Europe, registrations were up 5%. So I would expect European build to continue. Asia builds, India's really doing well. I'm not going to call the bottom in Brazil because I don't know where that is. But certainly, I think overall, we are pleased with the performance."

The automotive segment, it's not really a fair thing to look at it on a piece by piece basis because most of what we have is new product technology. So it's hard to compare the new technology versus the old. So overall, we've had very sophisticated automotive customers. They expect fair pricing. We have new technology.

I don't want to comment per se on how our retail customers are doing. I think it's up to them to comment on how the retail customers are doing. But I will tell you that we had new product launches with DIAMOND and the GLIDDEN brand in Home Depot. The early signs -- it's just now getting in the market. The early signs are very positive.

So one of them is, 1 year ago, customers were having significant launch programs. And as they ramped up, the last thing they want to do is stop their line with lack of product. And so they tended to over-inventory. Now they're more at a steady state rate, and so there it allows them to have more confidence in their build rate and their usage rate. So that's the short term hurdle. You do have some underlying softness. So if you take the oil and gas market, they fly a lot of helicopters. So obviously, they're flying less helicopters in this kind of environment, so you have less aftermarket sales and you have less new helicopter builds. So that would be one. And then general aviation, there's a lot of churn in the water, as you can tell with one of our customers in Canada. So there's some things going on up there. So I think overall, we're on a short-term, one-quarter, two-quarter bump in the road. But I anticipate the second half of the year for aerospace to be much better. I would point out that the acquisitions that we made -- the 2 aerospace acquisitions we've made are performing very well. And their growth rate is above the growth rate of the overall business. So the outlook, I would say, is solid."

We're now, today, as we speak, over 4,100 stores and we will add another 170 stores there. So what -- we've been gaining a lot of share at Mexico. The Comex team, when we bought them, had a very large concentration in their market share in what I would call central Mexico. They were underrepresented in southern Mexico and underrepresented in northern Mexico. But we have a U.S. retail partner that have stores in Mexico. So we recently introduced the store-in-store concept down there. That's allowing them to gain share as well. So from the store side, it's about service and product availability. And that's doing very well. Certainly, government spending has softened. And a lot of that is related to projects. The government is trying to reduce spending, given the price of oil. But there are elections coming up. So I would tell you that we're going to wait and see how it plays out. But historically in Mexico, when they have elections, the local politicians try to spruce things up to make things look a little bit better.

We'll obviously evaluate economic conditions at that time to determine whether we would take advantage of that discount. That could potentially be attractive for us to do so. So the gross being something over $800 million, but then almost immediately, we will start on a quarterly basis the adjusting our estimated taxes. And we'll over the ensuing few quarters, achieve a benefit that will bring the net cash outflow in total to about $0.5 billion.

So there's that piece of it. We had some manufacturing productivity. We've moved more aggressively, obviously, particularly in Europe, on rationalizing and moving things from the shared service department from the administrative side. Acquisitions, with a nice pass-through of the margins from those acquisitions, was also an uplift, as those acquisitions provided us a margin, a little bit above the corporate average.

There's a big tax in China on solvent-based products. So that's a positive for us. Historically, we do have positive price in our refinished business. You would expect that this year that we'll have positive price as well. Interestingly enough, volumes in the U.S. is actually up. That is, miles driven is up 2%. Not only do we have miles driven up, but you have distracted driving up, eventually, now I see it about every day on my way home. So that's a positive. The other thing is, when you look at what's happening with technology, our water-based product is outperforming in every region in the world. So even in Argentina right now, our business is growing in Argentina. One of our competitors vacated Brazil. We picked up a huge chunk of that business. One of our other competitors vacated Europe. We picked up the vast majority of that business. So we continue to perform in that regard. So when I think about one of the shining stars in PPG, I think our refinish is at the top of the list."

When I think about what's going on in the overall global supply demand environment, you have additional capacity in China. You're soon to have additional capacity in Mexico. So from that regard, that's obviously, more supply. Demand, if you look at Europe -- European TiO2 consumption is down about 15% from its peak. So net-net, even though Europe volumes are recovering a little bit, they are still substantially down from where they were. Then of course, you have the material weakness in Brazil. The material weakness in all of -- most of Latin America, Russia. And so from a supply demand standpoint, I think we still see it as a balanced market. And I know they are out there running around with price increases announced. But if you remember, they've had price increase announcements for several quarters out in the past 2 or 3 years. And that's -- just because they announced, doesn't mean we're paying. So overall, our goal, as you know, we've taken out of PPG. 10% of our TiO2 consumption is down because of the substitution strategy, replacement of alternative products. And also, with the bringing in Henan Billions. So I know there's a lot of noise out there. But when we talk to our suppliers, we're trying to get them focused on supply and demand, and that's where we're going to stay on that topic.

So this could be doing better. If you look at refinish with, Frank explained earlier, the carpark is growing. When they've made the nice move to the premium market we gained. We're now introducing some mid-tier products. So that should be a net positive. It hasn't happened yet. But there is a Comac, which expects to build an airplane at some point in time. They rolled it out of the hangar but they rolled it back in the hangar, as everybody saw. They didn't fly. So I don't know when that will start. But obviously, we have a lot of content on that plane. So if it does get into production, we will be a net beneficiary of that. On the protective side, we are doing very well in protective in China. Marine, not bad. But you really have to balance that with the fact that the Korean Marine is just falling off a cliff. In fact, 2 of the 3 largest Korean shipbuilders did not even get a major order in Q1. So you have to balance with what you see in China with the fact that Korea, which is where the big market is, is off. So I guess that would be my kind of a -- around the segment approach there."

Positive and negative at some point in time. Well, it depends on the mix, because, as far as the last few quarters, the biggest headwind was the euro, with a little bit stronger euro than anticipated but a little bit weaker peso, for instance, because of some of the oil-based factors there as well as some weakness in the Latin America. Some of that mix could change. So could one of the currencies turn positive at some point in time? Sure. But overall, if you look at the whole basket, yes. The $140 million on the top line the $50 million you saw on the bottom line in the first quarter, that'll be a little bit less. And then the numbers that Michael gave for the year, that $200 million, $260 million on the top line, and the $30 million to $40 million at the bottom line dictates that, at current rates, things will automatically come down.

I want to thank you for your continued interest in PPG. Today, we reported first quarter 2016 financial results. We achieved first quarter net sales of $3.7 billion and record adjusted earnings per diluted s",1497,"Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to thank you for your continued interest in PPG. Today, we reported first quarter 2016 financial results. We achieved first quarter net sales of $3.7 billion and record adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.31. Overall, we continue to deliver strong financial results as evidenced by our adjusted earnings per diluted share growth in the quarter, which increased 11% versus the record established in the prior year. We achieved these results despite ongoing unfavorable foreign currency translation and continued uneven global economic and market conditions.
Several factors contributed to the record first quarter results, including earnings leverage on our organic sales volume growth, our continued heritage of cost management and acquisition-related sales and income. Additionally, we continue to utilize our strong balance sheet, deliver shareholder value, including first quarter 2016 share repurchases totaling $150 million. For the quarter, our average diluted shares outstanding declined by 2% year-over-year. 
Our strong quarterly results were aided by our own operational and strategic actions, including aggressive efforts to drive higher organic growth despite a mixed economic environment. We continue to accelerate our work on developing and commercializing new customer-driven technologies. This includes packaging, coatings, ongoing customer adoption of our new can coating technologies, along with certain key technology adoptions in our protective coatings business. 
In addition, we are continuing to roll out our enhanced customer branding initiatives. As you would expect from PPG, we continue to maintain our discipline over costs, including finalizing the remaining actions from our previously announced business restructuring program.
Now I will discuss some specific business trends for the first quarter. Our net sales in local currencies increased about 4%, while reported net sales were consistent with the prior year. Local currency net sales growth was driven by acquisition-related sales of about 3% and sales volume growth of 1%. These gains were offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation of 4% or about $140 million in the first quarter. Our first quarter sales volumes increased 1%, consistent with the prior year's growth rate, reflecting a continuation of modest global economic trends, led by broadening European demand growth. Sales volumes grew in emerging regions by 1%. Continued growth in Asia-Pacific, including China, was partially offset by persistent market weakness in South America. Most of our business units experienced sales volumes in Asia led by increased market demand for PPG's new technologies in our packaging and automotive refinish coatings businesses, along with growth in protective coatings. 
Automotive OEM sales volumes in Asia were tempered, primarily due to a strong prior year comparable period where PPG experienced above market, double-digit percentage volume increases. We expect second quarter emerging region sales volumes growth rate to improve the borderline increases in most businesses in Asia, and modest overall improvements in Latin America. 
Volumes in the U.S. and Canada region were slightly higher versus prior year and represented sequential improvements compared to the prior 2 quarters. Regional demand trends continue to be mixed by business and country, with ongoing demand softness in certain markets within Canada.
In the region, sales volumes grew in our packaging and automotive refinished coatings business, along with modest growth in our architectural coatings business. Aerospace sales volumes declined primarily due to lower commercial demand and continued customer inventory management actions. 
Looking ahead, we anticipate further incremental improvements in regional growth rates in the second quarter, building upon the month of March which had the strongest sales volume growth within the quarter. 
Regionally, our highest first quarter sales volume growth rate was in Europe, Middle East and Africa, which delivered over 3% growth. We continue to experience a broadening improvement in Europe demand with our fifth consecutive quarter of improving growth rates. PPG's volume growth rates were positive across Western Europe, with most countries improving year-over-year. Despite overall growth this quarter, regional demand levels remain uneven. 
Improved performance in our architectural coatings EMEA business added to continued strong performance in our packaging and automotive OEM coatings business in the region primarily due to continued customer adoption of PPG's market-leading technologies and related world-class product, service and support. Architectural growth was led by gains in the U.K. and Benelux countries with year-over-year growth trends [ph]. We remain optimistic for future economic driven demand expansion in the EMEA region. 
Despite recent improvements, regional demand remains well below prerecession levels, and we continue to see signs of ongoing modest improvements in various economic subsectors. During the past several years, we've completed significant actions to reduce our overall regional cost structure. Similar to our experience in the past several quarters, we expect strong income leverage on any incremental sales volume growth.
I would like to take a -- provide a quick update on foreign currency translation. As I mentioned earlier, during the quarter, unfavorable foreign currency translation lowered sales by approximately $140 million and pretax income by about $15 million. This was primarily related to the Mexican peso and the Canadian dollar, but included other currencies as well, such as the euro. Based on current exchange rates, we anticipate full year unfavorable foreign currency translation to lower net sales by $200 million to $260 million, and income by $30 million to $40 million. This is a decrease from the figure that we provided during our fourth quarter 2015 earnings call in January. This change reflects the strengthening of several foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar during the first quarter.
Shifting to earnings. Year-over-year adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 11% to a new first quarter record of $1.31, including unfavorable foreign currency translation. This marks the 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit percentage earnings per diluted share growth, and was achieved despite record performance in the first quarter of 2015. This trend of strong increases in quarterly earnings per diluted share is a reflection on the success of our business portfolio transformation actions taken over the past several years, including the successful integration and synergy achievement at several major acquisitions.
For the quarter, Performance Coatings segment sales declined by 1%, and segment income was up more than 6%. Contributing to the results were higher acquisition-related sales and income, primarily from Le Joint Francais, Cumings Microwave; strong income leverage on higher sales volume and benefits from business restructuring, partly offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation. Segment income included approximately $15 million of incremental growth-related spending in architectural U.S. and Canada. I'm pleased to report that we're currently launching several new products within many of our domestic national account partner store networks. These launches include new premium products at some national accounts, as well as improved product formulation and differentiated product labels.
Industrial Coatings segment sales were up 2%, and segment earnings increased 9%. Earnings leverage from organic sales volume growth, acquisition-related sales and income, along with disciplined cost management were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation. Acquisition-related growth was primarily from the REVOCOAT and IBC industrial businesses acquired in 2015. These businesses continue to deliver strong financial results. They provide an excellent platform for future global business growth. 
Glass segment sales declined 2% and earnings declined by 7% versus the prior year. Higher selling prices and cost management actions were offset by lower sales volumes, $8 million in repair-related expenses due to a planned facility outage, and lower equity earnings. Despite the lower sales volumes, underlying flat glass demand remains solid. Additional segment and regional details can be found in the presentation materials.
Overall, our business performed well in the first quarter as we continue to manage against a mixed global economic backdrop; continue to focus our efforts on improving organic growth rates through enhanced product innovation, customer branding strategies; remain diligent over our costs and are on pace to achieve the previously announced savings from our ongoing business restructuring program. 
Finally, our balance sheet remained strong and we are committed to deploying between $2 billion and $2.5 billion of cash, in years 2015 and 2016 combined, on acquisitions and share repurchase. 
In the first quarter, we repurchased $150 million of our stock, bringing the total to $900 million for the 2-year period to date, coupled with the approximately $400 million paid for acquisitions in 2015, PPG has deployed about $1.3 billion on earnings accretive actions against this target to date. We have a strong global pipeline of acquisition candidates across various end-use markets.
In addition to share repurchases and acquisitions, PPG remains committed to sustainable dividend increases as part of our capital allocation strategy. Today, our Board of Directors approved the dividend increase of $0.04 per share, bringing the quarterly dividend to $0.40 per share. This represents an 11% increase versus the prior quarterly dividend. Our last quarterly dividend increase was 7% in the second quarter 2015. 
As you can see by our actions and continued strong financial results, we remain focused on driving additional growth aimed at creating shareholder value. This concludes our prepared remarks. Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG, and now Andrew, would you please open the line for questions."

So we did see a good growth there. And I think the other one is the broadening of the growth rate in Europe. That was a nice win there as well. So altogether, I would say that we are closer to 2% to 3% growth in March versus the 1% that we reported in the overall quarter."

At some point, we would have some reversion of mean. If you remember, last year, first quarter of 2015, we were up 9%, and Asia was up much higher than that. So when I look at our automotive performance, we had 2 regions that outperformed, 1 region that underperformed and 1 region was at parity. So we were essentially at the 1.7% growth rate for the industry. So I would say, when I think back about the 4 years of consecutive outperformance, if our team took a 1-quarter pause, not happy. But obviously, in the grand scheme of things, we continue to perform very well in the automotive business. And I would expect that we're going to continue to see growth. In Europe, registrations were up 5%. So I would expect European build to continue. Asia builds, India's really doing well. I'm not going to call the bottom in Brazil because I don't know where that is. But certainly, I think overall, we are pleased with the performance."

I don't want to comment per se on how our retail customers are doing. I think it's up to them to comment on how the retail customers are doing.

So one of them is, 1 year ago, customers were having significant launch programs. And as they ramped up, the last thing they want to do is stop their line with lack of product. And so they tended to over-inventory. Now they're more at a steady state rate, and so there it allows them to have more confidence in their build rate and their usage rate. So that's the short term hurdle. You do have some underlying softness. So if you take the oil and gas market, they fly a lot of helicopters. So obviously, they're flying less helicopters in this kind of environment, so you have less aftermarket sales and you have less new helicopter builds. So that would be one. And then general aviation, there's a lot of churn in the water, as you can tell with one of our customers in Canada. So there's some things going on up there. So I think overall, we're on a short-term, one-quarter, two-quarter bump in the road. But I anticipate the second half of the year for aerospace to be much better. I would point out that the acquisitions that we made -- the 2 aerospace acquisitions we've made are performing very well. And their growth rate is above the growth rate of the overall business. So the outlook, I would say, is solid."

We're now, today, as we speak, over 4,100 stores and we will add another 170 stores there. So what -- we've been gaining a lot of share at Mexico. The Comex team, when we bought them, had a very large concentration in their market share in what I would call central Mexico. They were underrepresented in southern Mexico and underrepresented in northern Mexico. But we have a U.S. retail partner that have stores in Mexico. So we recently introduced the store-in-store concept down there. That's allowing them to gain share as well. So from the store side, it's about service and product availability. And that's doing very well. Certainly, government spending has softened. And a lot of that is related to projects. The government is trying to reduce spending, given the price of oil. But there are elections coming up. So I would tell you that we're going to wait and see how it plays out.

Despite the fact that we still -- even though the currency headwind was a little bit lower than we expected, it was still a headwind in Q1 versus prior. I think it was a combination of factors. One, we've taken some benefits -- additional benefit this year from restructuring that would not have taken place in the last year's first quarter because the restructuring program was really just getting underway at that point, first-half of the year. So there's that piece of it. We had some manufacturing productivity. We've moved more aggressively, obviously, particularly in Europe, on rationalizing and moving things from the shared service department from the administrative side. Acquisitions, with a nice pass-through of the margins from those acquisitions, was also an uplift, as those acquisitions provided us a margin, a little bit above the corporate average. So the combination of factors plus, admittedly, as we have said before, a modest amount of raw material savings in the first half of this year continuing what we saw in the back half of last year, all that contributed to the 110 basis points."

But then when you get in to our other businesses, we have a broadening recovery. So southern Europe, Spain, Italy, for example, significantly accelerating growth quarter-over-quarter in all our businesses. And that's the benefit. We don't have architectural. We do have a little bit in Spain but very little. We have a little bit in Italy. But in grand scheme of things, it's pretty small. So overall, Spain and southern Italy and southern Europe is doing very well, and that's a net positive for us. The offset to that, of course, is Russia. Although I will tell you that we are outperforming in Russia, especially in our industrial business. They've done a really good job. They're trying to get more localization, and so that has benefited us. The Middle East, I would say, slightly better than company average. And that encompasses all our business.

When I think about what's going on in the overall global supply demand environment, you have additional capacity in China. You're soon to have additional capacity in Mexico.

The material weakness in all of -- most of Latin America, Russia. And so from a supply demand standpoint, I think we still see it as a balanced market.

And then on the other side of the equation, would be architectural, including company-owned stores and independent dealers where people are walking in on a daily basis and the pattern certainly has a cadence to it. But it's not as predictable. So there we have, let's call it a few days' worth of visibility.

So Q2, in fact, will still be a headwind, but a bit less than Q1, if things stay where they are and will continue to dwindle down as it goes through the year. Positive and negative at some point in time. Well, it depends on the mix, because, as far as the last few quarters, the biggest headwind was the euro, with a little bit stronger euro than anticipated but a little bit weaker peso, for instance, because of some of the oil-based factors there as well as some weakness in the Latin America. Some of that mix could change. So could one of the currencies turn positive at some point in time? Sure. But overall, if you look at the whole basket, yes. The $140 million on the top line the $50 million you saw on the bottom line in the first quarter, that'll be a little bit less. And then the numbers that Michael gave for the year, that $200 million, $260 million on the top line, and the $30 million to $40 million at the bottom line dictates that, at current rates, things will automatically come down. We'll see how that plays out as far as rates fall [ph] throughout the year. And I'll remind everybody, the guidance we gave in January was close to $600 million top line and $70 million -- I'm sorry $70 million, $80 million bottom line.

294639,369877680,1009768,"PPG Industries, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","PPG Industries, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to thank you for your continued interest in PPG. Today, we reported our second quarter 2016 financial results. We achieved first quarter net sales of $4.1 billion and achieved adjusted earnings per",2136,"Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to thank you for your continued interest in PPG. 
Today, we reported our second quarter 2016 financial results. We achieved first quarter net sales of $4.1 billion and achieved adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.85. Overall, we continue to deliver strong financial results as evidenced by the 11% growth in our adjusted earnings per diluted share versus the prior year. This marks our 14th consecutive quarter of double-digit percentage increases in adjusted earnings per diluted share. 
This level of sustained financial growth despite uneven global economic conditions demonstrates PPG's ability to consistently and successfully commercialize new and innovative products as recently discussed during our innovation deep-dive event, acquire and integrate new businesses, maintain strict discipline over our cost structure and successfully deploy cash to continually create shareholder value. 
Our adjusted earnings per share growth in the second quarter benefited from earnings leveraged on solid regional volume growth in Europe and Asia. In addition, we benefited from acquisition-related income driven by the IVC Industrial Coatings and Le Joint Français, now called Sealants Europe, and Cuming Microwave acquisitions completed in 2015, and lower total costs, including increasing our cost structure improvement from business restructuring related to the program we announced in the second quarter 2015. 
Also we continue to execute on our strategic initiatives. These include the sale of our flat glass business that we announced today; the sale of our European fiber glass business that was announced during the second quarter; the completion of the sale of our minority interest in Pittsburgh Glass Works; and the acquisition of MetoKote Corporation, a global leader in coatings services with locations on 3 continents and over $200 million in annual revenues. The MetoKote acquisition closed July 1, and we expect the business divestitures to be completed by year-end. 
In addition to these portfolio enhancements, we continue to work on other important actions. During the quarter, we fully funded our Pittsburgh Corning Asbestos Trust obligation, including the prepayment of all future obligations for about $270 million at a 5.5% discount rate. This payment finalizes our long-term settlement efforts and concludes our involvement with all Pittsburgh Corning-related asbestos litigation. Also we announced annuitization of a sizable portion of our U.S. pension obligation, allowing us to reduce volatility of future earnings and mitigate financial risks associated with these pension plans. 
We continue to have excellent financial flexibility with cash and short-term investments of $1.7 billion at the end of the quarter. As part of our multiyear goal to reduce working capital, we improved our operating working capital levels by 180 basis points in the second quarter on top of prior year improvements. Operating working capital results improved year-over-year in all 3 business segments. 
In 2015 and 2016 combined, we have deployed $1.6 billion for acquisitions and the share repurchases, including the recent purchase of MetoKote. The company did not purchase or repurchase shares in the second quarter as we fully funded our portion of the asbestos trust. We plan to accelerate our pace of cash deployment in the second half of 2016, targeting the upper end of the previously announced cash deployment range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion for the years 2015 and 2016 combined. 
Now I'll discuss some specific business trends for the second quarter. Second quarter sales increased by more than 1% in local currency versus prior year. Reported net sales were down less than 1%. Acquisition-related sales were up more than 1% year-over-year. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted the second quarter, reducing sales by $95 million or more than 2%, including a 15% decrease in the Mexican peso versus the U.S. dollar as well as declines in the Chinese yuan, Canadian dollar, British pound and others. 
In the second quarter, the euro reversed a multi-quarter trend of year-over-year weakness versus the U.S. dollar, improving by almost 2%. As a result of currency movements, our 2016 year-to-date negative impact from foreign currency is approximately $235 million on sales and about $30 million on pretax income. Based on the current exchange rates, we expect full year 2016 unfavorable foreign currency translation to lower net sales by $320 million to $350 million and pretax income by $50 million to $60 million. 
In aggregate, our sales volumes were consistent with prior year, reflecting the modest growth rates in many major economies worldwide. Volume has expanded in Europe for the sixth consecutive quarter, reflecting a continued broad-based recovery by country and end-use market. Sales volume accelerated in the Asia Pacific sequentially versus the first quarter 2016 with continued growth in China and India, partially offset by weakness in Korea, primarily due to a slowdown in marine new-build activity. 
Sales volumes declined in U.S. and Canada but were mixed by end-use market. While our overall volumes were flat, we grew at or above market rates in many of our regional businesses around the world. We've included in our prepared materials for this quarterly call a heat map that provides our volume performance versus estimated industry growth rates for each of our businesses by region. 
As illustrated in the heat map, our investments in technology and global expansion are paying dividends, given our above-market performance in various coatings end-use markets. We have and we'll continue to put significant effort into driving additional organic growth in the areas where we are performing at or below market. Near term, we anticipate an acceleration of our volume growth in the third quarter, reflecting various actions and growth investments the past year or so that will begin providing tangible benefits. 
By segment, for the second quarter, Industrial Coatings led our volume results, increasing by 3% year-over-year, led by above-market gains in general industrial and packaging coatings. General Industrial Coatings volumes benefited from above-market growth in Europe and Asia. Packaging coatings continues to benefit at an above-market rate from industry conversions to new PPG can coating technologies around the world. This is being driven by an increase in environmental regulations, including recent propositions by the state of California and growing action by global food and beverage companies to eliminate BPA or bisphenol A-containing materials. Volumes in the automotive OEM coatings were consistent with industry growth rates with higher PPG performance in Asia and Europe, 2 regions where we expect higher industry growth in 2016 and 2017 as well. 
Volumes declined by 2% in the Performance Coatings segment with varied results by business. Automotive refinish coatings continued to outperform the market with mid-single-digit organic sales growth, led by continued conversions to PPG's market-leading waterborne products and favorable industry trends, including increased vehicle miles driven in the U.S. and Canada and total fleet expansion in China. Aerospace coatings returned to volume growth following the prior 2 quarters, where we experienced volume declines related to customer inventory management. Volumes in protective and marine coatings declined primarily due to continued and significant weakness in global marine new-build demand, along with sluggish protective coatings demand in the oil and gas sector. 
After improving for 3 consecutive quarters, volumes declined very modestly in the architectural EMEA primarily due to unfavorable weather patterns and flooding across portions of Western Europe during the second quarter. Architectural coatings declined by more than 20% in both Brazil and China, reflecting slowing end-use market conditions in those countries. Countering these declines was above-market architectural coatings growth in Mexico and Australia. Sales volumes also declined in architectural U.S. and Canada in aggregate with varied results by channel. 
Company-owned stores increased volumes by low single-digit percentage as we begin to see initial benefit from prior year investments to improve our store network and expanded penetration into certain end-use submarkets. Volumes fell in the independent dealer network, consistent with prior quarters, due to overall modest but continued structural decline within the channel. Despite the volume declines, this channel continues to create shareholder value for PPG as we are able to effectively manage our costs and maintain good returns. 
Volumes were lower in the national retail accounts or DIY channel. This was due in part to comparison to solid volume growth in last year's second quarter coupled with current year customer initiatives to structurally lower their inventory levels. However, our product sales to the DIY end customers, also known as point-of-sale or out-the-door sales, were higher year-over-year, benefiting from sales of some of our new and recently launched products. 
Local currency architectural coatings sales increased in Mexico at more than the expected rate of double Mexican GDP as we have further market penetration and the addition of over 100 new store locations year-to-date in 2016. Architectural volumes continued to expand rapidly in Central America, particularly in Panama and Costa Rica, due to the company's efforts to establish a presence in the region, leveraging our prior year acquisitions of Comex and Consorcio Latinoamericano. 
Overall, sales were up modestly in the Glass segment as higher average selling prices offset unfavorable foreign currency translation and flat volumes. Volumes declined modestly in our flat glass segment primarily due to the negative impacts stemming from reduced manufacturing capability early in the quarter when our Fresno, California facility was restarting after planned maintenance outage in the first quarter 2016. Underlying flat glass end-use market demand remains solid. Fiber glass volumes increased slightly in the second quarter. 
Looking ahead, we continue to expect varied business conditions globally due to the uneven pace of regional economic growth. We expect an acceleration of our volume growth in the third quarter as we continue to deliver above-market growth in many of our businesses. We expect this growth will be supplemented by benefits from several growth initiatives in our regional businesses. This includes our architectural U.S. and Canada business with continued improvement in our company-owned store network following our rebranding and sales force investments in the past year and growing demand for recently launched new products with many of our DIY customers. 
In addition, protective coatings volumes are expected to improve, driven by continued customer adoption of leading protective products and additional acquisition-related sale synergies, including a higher adoption of our legacy PPG products in Latin America. Lastly, as we have said on prior calls, in the second half of 2016, we will begin to anniversary the prior year decline in global commodity prices and anticipate general stability in this cost bucket as we approach the seasonal end of the bulk of the paint production season. 
I'd like to take a moment to comment on the historic Brexit vote that recently occurred in the U.K. PPG has a successful and growing business in both the U.K. and Continental Europe. While the businesses share noncustomer-facing resources, coatings, by and large, is a local business. Therefore, we buy, make and sell our products within a small radius and do not anticipate any material change or impact to our production costs or fixed costs stemming from the vote and subsequent financial market impacts. It is too early to tell the long-term regional economic impact of the vote, if any. But we haven't seen any notable short-term impacts and don't expect any material impacts to our business in the second half of the year. We continue to believe that the ongoing broad-based recovery in Europe is sustainable, supported by underlying modest but continued improvement in customer demand across the region. 
We believe that midterm, that regional growth from business investments could be marginally reduced without a clear path and time line for the U.K. exit. We believe the respective leaders are fully aware of this, and we'll be working to minimize or avoid this impact. We also believe that if there is a slowdown in regional economic activity, it will be accompanied by a reduction in regional commodity costs. Naturally, as you have come to expect from PPG, we'll remain proactive in preserving our level of earnings and cash generation in the region. Let me reiterate that our base case assumption is for little to no impact in the coming quarters from the Brexit vote. 
Now let me summarize our second quarter. Our business continued to perform well. We increased earnings by double-digit percentage for the 14th consecutive quarter. We took tangible actions to further achieve our strategic portfolio objectives. And we've continued to generate and deploy cash to benefit our shareholders, including the acquisition of MetoKote Corporation and the payment of our dividend, which increased by 11% year-over-year. 
Looking ahead, we are strengthening our commitment to returning cash to our shareholders via acquisitions and share repurchases. We've already successfully taken actions to aggressively manage our business for growth in earnings in an uneven global economy and expect to continue these efforts in the third quarter as we anticipate an acceleration in the level of volume growth. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG. And now Andrea, would you please open the line for questions?"

And so we underperformed in the U.S. We do think that's a short-term phenomena. But that's 2 quarters in a row where we've underperformed. In Latin America, we're at market in Latin America. Of course, that's a smaller market. But overall, we outperformed in the automotive market probably for 4 years in a row. So this is just a short-term bump. When you look forward to the third quarter, if you remember in China last year, they had some pretty significant build reductions, especially in August. And the government came out with a reduction, the tax on the small 1.6-liter engines. And so that obviously won't happen again. China's build rates continue to be robust. We expect them to continue to be robust. There's a lot of new automotive plants coming on in the second half of the year. We won more than our fair share of those new plants.

But when you put it all together, we were up in the second quarter. We expect to be up in the third quarter. F-35 build rate is coming up. So that's going to be a positive. And if you look at Boeing and Airbus, they have only delivered 2 more planes in the second quarter versus what they delivered last year. And they're only up -- actually, they're down 6 planes each from their build rate in the first half of the year versus last half. And so they have a very full backlog.

That, combined with adjustments, and then add that to the net proceeds of the European fiber glass business, which is relatively modest, double-digit net returns after taxes and adjustments, you could say the dilution is in the range of what you're talking about. But you have to do your own calculation. Please keep in mind that the flat glass business had a more than the Glass average margins. So in computing a potential dilution, you have to take that into effect. And of course, both those businesses will be in discounts for Q3. But in terms of what we do about that dilution, we have continued to demonstrate that we will take excess cash. And given the back half of the year is our cash-generating half, we will have proceeds from these businesses. We will continue, as Michael said, continue to deploy that in a manner that generates value for the shareholders. And so we have ample liquidity. We have cash on the balance sheet.

I would say at least 5 of those still have downward pressure, the rest of them flat, and we do have one that has some upward pressure. I don't regard the TiO2 price increase in the second quarter as a trend line. One point doesn't make a trend line. When you look at overall volumes across the globe in coatings, it is a modest number. More importantly, when you look at their input costs, their input costs are ore. Ore volumes are down. So when I couple their input costs and our view of what's going on the coatings segment, we're still having discussions, not to mention we still have billions out there. We have favorable pricing with billions. We're -- we used 3x as much billions in the first quarter than we did fourth quarter last year. We increased that again in the second quarter, and we sequentially expect to increase the amount of product used by billions in the third quarter from the fluoride plant, and their performance continues to improve. So I would tell you overall, we're pretty -- we're going to had to continue to fight hard for what we have. But raw material deflation is slowing but not over."

And I think one of the reasons that PPG has been more successful than the average Fortune company in integrating acquisitions is the diligence around both revenue and cost synergies. If you look at the properties that we've acquired in the last few years, they've had an element of either a unique technology, unique customer base, but all had some kind of additional leverage that we could get either by expanding the customer base globally or putting the technology as part of our overall portfolio.

It's too early to talk about what that might take out to be, but clearly, the model that we have in Comex, the concessionary network model, plays very well into Central America, where you have entrepreneurial people that are looking to put extra TVs in their house, go out and buy a car. This model works very well down there, and we're exporting the Comex model into Central America. So that's a real positive for us. We're bringing the PPG products into Comex. That has continued the acceleration that Comex sales. That's why we're more than 2x GDP. The Comex team continues to perform at a very high level.

I want to thank you for your continued interest in PPG. Today, we reported our second quarter 2016 financial results. We achieved first quarter net sales of $4.1 billion and achieved adjusted earnings per",2136,"Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to thank you for your continued interest in PPG. 
Today, we reported our second quarter 2016 financial results. We achieved first quarter net sales of $4.1 billion and achieved adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.85. Overall, we continue to deliver strong financial results as evidenced by the 11% growth in our adjusted earnings per diluted share versus the prior year. This marks our 14th consecutive quarter of double-digit percentage increases in adjusted earnings per diluted share. 
This level of sustained financial growth despite uneven global economic conditions demonstrates PPG's ability to consistently and successfully commercialize new and innovative products as recently discussed during our innovation deep-dive event, acquire and integrate new businesses, maintain strict discipline over our cost structure and successfully deploy cash to continually create shareholder value. 
Our adjusted earnings per share growth in the second quarter benefited from earnings leveraged on solid regional volume growth in Europe and Asia. In addition, we benefited from acquisition-related income driven by the IVC Industrial Coatings and Le Joint Français, now called Sealants Europe, and Cuming Microwave acquisitions completed in 2015, and lower total costs, including increasing our cost structure improvement from business restructuring related to the program we announced in the second quarter 2015. 
Also we continue to execute on our strategic initiatives. These include the sale of our flat glass business that we announced today; the sale of our European fiber glass business that was announced during the second quarter; the completion of the sale of our minority interest in Pittsburgh Glass Works; and the acquisition of MetoKote Corporation, a global leader in coatings services with locations on 3 continents and over $200 million in annual revenues. The MetoKote acquisition closed July 1, and we expect the business divestitures to be completed by year-end. 
In addition to these portfolio enhancements, we continue to work on other important actions. During the quarter, we fully funded our Pittsburgh Corning Asbestos Trust obligation, including the prepayment of all future obligations for about $270 million at a 5.5% discount rate. This payment finalizes our long-term settlement efforts and concludes our involvement with all Pittsburgh Corning-related asbestos litigation. Also we announced annuitization of a sizable portion of our U.S. pension obligation, allowing us to reduce volatility of future earnings and mitigate financial risks associated with these pension plans. 
We continue to have excellent financial flexibility with cash and short-term investments of $1.7 billion at the end of the quarter. As part of our multiyear goal to reduce working capital, we improved our operating working capital levels by 180 basis points in the second quarter on top of prior year improvements. Operating working capital results improved year-over-year in all 3 business segments. 
In 2015 and 2016 combined, we have deployed $1.6 billion for acquisitions and the share repurchases, including the recent purchase of MetoKote. The company did not purchase or repurchase shares in the second quarter as we fully funded our portion of the asbestos trust. We plan to accelerate our pace of cash deployment in the second half of 2016, targeting the upper end of the previously announced cash deployment range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion for the years 2015 and 2016 combined. 
Now I'll discuss some specific business trends for the second quarter. Second quarter sales increased by more than 1% in local currency versus prior year. Reported net sales were down less than 1%. Acquisition-related sales were up more than 1% year-over-year. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted the second quarter, reducing sales by $95 million or more than 2%, including a 15% decrease in the Mexican peso versus the U.S. dollar as well as declines in the Chinese yuan, Canadian dollar, British pound and others. 
In the second quarter, the euro reversed a multi-quarter trend of year-over-year weakness versus the U.S. dollar, improving by almost 2%. As a result of currency movements, our 2016 year-to-date negative impact from foreign currency is approximately $235 million on sales and about $30 million on pretax income. Based on the current exchange rates, we expect full year 2016 unfavorable foreign currency translation to lower net sales by $320 million to $350 million and pretax income by $50 million to $60 million. 
In aggregate, our sales volumes were consistent with prior year, reflecting the modest growth rates in many major economies worldwide. Volume has expanded in Europe for the sixth consecutive quarter, reflecting a continued broad-based recovery by country and end-use market. Sales volume accelerated in the Asia Pacific sequentially versus the first quarter 2016 with continued growth in China and India, partially offset by weakness in Korea, primarily due to a slowdown in marine new-build activity. 
Sales volumes declined in U.S. and Canada but were mixed by end-use market. While our overall volumes were flat, we grew at or above market rates in many of our regional businesses around the world. We've included in our prepared materials for this quarterly call a heat map that provides our volume performance versus estimated industry growth rates for each of our businesses by region. 
As illustrated in the heat map, our investments in technology and global expansion are paying dividends, given our above-market performance in various coatings end-use markets. We have and we'll continue to put significant effort into driving additional organic growth in the areas where we are performing at or below market. Near term, we anticipate an acceleration of our volume growth in the third quarter, reflecting various actions and growth investments the past year or so that will begin providing tangible benefits. 
By segment, for the second quarter, Industrial Coatings led our volume results, increasing by 3% year-over-year, led by above-market gains in general industrial and packaging coatings. General Industrial Coatings volumes benefited from above-market growth in Europe and Asia. Packaging coatings continues to benefit at an above-market rate from industry conversions to new PPG can coating technologies around the world. This is being driven by an increase in environmental regulations, including recent propositions by the state of California and growing action by global food and beverage companies to eliminate BPA or bisphenol A-containing materials. Volumes in the automotive OEM coatings were consistent with industry growth rates with higher PPG performance in Asia and Europe, 2 regions where we expect higher industry growth in 2016 and 2017 as well. 
Volumes declined by 2% in the Performance Coatings segment with varied results by business. Automotive refinish coatings continued to outperform the market with mid-single-digit organic sales growth, led by continued conversions to PPG's market-leading waterborne products and favorable industry trends, including increased vehicle miles driven in the U.S. and Canada and total fleet expansion in China. Aerospace coatings returned to volume growth following the prior 2 quarters, where we experienced volume declines related to customer inventory management. Volumes in protective and marine coatings declined primarily due to continued and significant weakness in global marine new-build demand, along with sluggish protective coatings demand in the oil and gas sector. 
After improving for 3 consecutive quarters, volumes declined very modestly in the architectural EMEA primarily due to unfavorable weather patterns and flooding across portions of Western Europe during the second quarter. Architectural coatings declined by more than 20% in both Brazil and China, reflecting slowing end-use market conditions in those countries. Countering these declines was above-market architectural coatings growth in Mexico and Australia. Sales volumes also declined in architectural U.S. and Canada in aggregate with varied results by channel. 
Company-owned stores increased volumes by low single-digit percentage as we begin to see initial benefit from prior year investments to improve our store network and expanded penetration into certain end-use submarkets. Volumes fell in the independent dealer network, consistent with prior quarters, due to overall modest but continued structural decline within the channel. Despite the volume declines, this channel continues to create shareholder value for PPG as we are able to effectively manage our costs and maintain good returns. 
Volumes were lower in the national retail accounts or DIY channel. This was due in part to comparison to solid volume growth in last year's second quarter coupled with current year customer initiatives to structurally lower their inventory levels. However, our product sales to the DIY end customers, also known as point-of-sale or out-the-door sales, were higher year-over-year, benefiting from sales of some of our new and recently launched products. 
Local currency architectural coatings sales increased in Mexico at more than the expected rate of double Mexican GDP as we have further market penetration and the addition of over 100 new store locations year-to-date in 2016. Architectural volumes continued to expand rapidly in Central America, particularly in Panama and Costa Rica, due to the company's efforts to establish a presence in the region, leveraging our prior year acquisitions of Comex and Consorcio Latinoamericano. 
Overall, sales were up modestly in the Glass segment as higher average selling prices offset unfavorable foreign currency translation and flat volumes. Volumes declined modestly in our flat glass segment primarily due to the negative impacts stemming from reduced manufacturing capability early in the quarter when our Fresno, California facility was restarting after planned maintenance outage in the first quarter 2016. Underlying flat glass end-use market demand remains solid. Fiber glass volumes increased slightly in the second quarter. 
Looking ahead, we continue to expect varied business conditions globally due to the uneven pace of regional economic growth. We expect an acceleration of our volume growth in the third quarter as we continue to deliver above-market growth in many of our businesses. We expect this growth will be supplemented by benefits from several growth initiatives in our regional businesses. This includes our architectural U.S. and Canada business with continued improvement in our company-owned store network following our rebranding and sales force investments in the past year and growing demand for recently launched new products with many of our DIY customers. 
In addition, protective coatings volumes are expected to improve, driven by continued customer adoption of leading protective products and additional acquisition-related sale synergies, including a higher adoption of our legacy PPG products in Latin America. Lastly, as we have said on prior calls, in the second half of 2016, we will begin to anniversary the prior year decline in global commodity prices and anticipate general stability in this cost bucket as we approach the seasonal end of the bulk of the paint production season. 
I'd like to take a moment to comment on the historic Brexit vote that recently occurred in the U.K. PPG has a successful and growing business in both the U.K. and Continental Europe. While the businesses share noncustomer-facing resources, coatings, by and large, is a local business. Therefore, we buy, make and sell our products within a small radius and do not anticipate any material change or impact to our production costs or fixed costs stemming from the vote and subsequent financial market impacts. It is too early to tell the long-term regional economic impact of the vote, if any. But we haven't seen any notable short-term impacts and don't expect any material impacts to our business in the second half of the year. We continue to believe that the ongoing broad-based recovery in Europe is sustainable, supported by underlying modest but continued improvement in customer demand across the region. 
We believe that midterm, that regional growth from business investments could be marginally reduced without a clear path and time line for the U.K. exit. We believe the respective leaders are fully aware of this, and we'll be working to minimize or avoid this impact. We also believe that if there is a slowdown in regional economic activity, it will be accompanied by a reduction in regional commodity costs. Naturally, as you have come to expect from PPG, we'll remain proactive in preserving our level of earnings and cash generation in the region. Let me reiterate that our base case assumption is for little to no impact in the coming quarters from the Brexit vote. 
Now let me summarize our second quarter. Our business continued to perform well. We increased earnings by double-digit percentage for the 14th consecutive quarter. We took tangible actions to further achieve our strategic portfolio objectives. And we've continued to generate and deploy cash to benefit our shareholders, including the acquisition of MetoKote Corporation and the payment of our dividend, which increased by 11% year-over-year. 
Looking ahead, we are strengthening our commitment to returning cash to our shareholders via acquisitions and share repurchases. We've already successfully taken actions to aggressively manage our business for growth in earnings in an uneven global economy and expect to continue these efforts in the third quarter as we anticipate an acceleration in the level of volume growth. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG. And now Andrea, would you please open the line for questions?"

Of course, that's a smaller market. But overall, we outperformed in the automotive market probably for 4 years in a row. So this is just a short-term bump. When you look forward to the third quarter, if you remember in China last year, they had some pretty significant build reductions, especially in August. And the government came out with a reduction, the tax on the small 1.6-liter engines. And so that obviously won't happen again. China's build rates continue to be robust. We expect them to continue to be robust. There's a lot of new automotive plants coming on in the second half of the year. We won more than our fair share of those new plants.

But when you put it all together, we were up in the second quarter. We expect to be up in the third quarter. F-35 build rate is coming up. So that's going to be a positive. And if you look at Boeing and Airbus, they have only delivered 2 more planes in the second quarter versus what they delivered last year. And they're only up -- actually, they're down 6 planes each from their build rate in the first half of the year versus last half. And so they have a very full backlog.

That was driven by 4 primary factors, maybe 5 if I'm generous. Volume improvement in Europe, that's a significant leverage. So anytime we drop any volume in Europe, that comes 30% to 40% margin. The benefits of restructuring, we're going to continue to focus on that. The acquisition-related synergies, that would continue to do well. We certainly had some modest raw material benefits. And then as you know, we look at it from a currency standpoint, the fact that the dollar is so much stronger, you actually get absolute lower COGS and lower overhead numbers. So that all contributed to the margin. Now the pace, I think I mentioned in my opening comments, the pace of raw material deflation is slowing. So when you go back and look at what oil was in the second quarter of last year and the second quarter this year and you look at it third quarter versus third quarter, that's a slowing. But we're not letting that purchasing and global supply management team off the hook here, right? When I parse our raw materials, we put them in about 9 buckets, so whether it's epoxies or solvents or additives, emulsions, you name it. I would say at least 5 of those still have downward pressure, the rest of them flat. And we do have one that has some upward pressure. I don't regard the TiO2 price increase in the second quarter as a trend line, 1 point doesn't make a trend line. When you look at overall volumes across the globe in coatings, it is a modest number. More importantly, when you look at their input costs, their input costs are ore. Ore volumes are down. So when I couple their input costs and our view of what's going on the coatings segment, we're still having discussions, not to mention we still have Billions out there. We have favorable pricing with Billions. We're -- we use 3x as much Billions in the first quarter than we did fourth quarter last year. We increased that again in the second quarter. And we sequentially expect to increase the amount of product used by Billions in the third quarter from the chloride plant. And their performance continues to improve. So I would tell you overall, we're pretty -- we're going to have to continue to fight hard for what we have. But raw material deflation is slowing but not over."

And if you look at the properties that we've acquired in the last few years, they've had an element of either a unique technology, unique customer base.

But there was significant momentum generated in the industrial and packaging business as well as really nice momentum in refinish, aerospace and automotive OEM doing well in the vast majority of the globe. And that momentum should continue. If you look at the heat map, there are a few selected parts of the portfolio, where whether it's a macro issue where we get a little bit of help and obviously a little bit of help from the weather in Europe going forward as well as some activities we've got going on in architectural USCA. With those turning, you'll have the vast majority of portfolio on a pretty good path. And that's why we have confidence for the back half of the year into '17 that we'll get improvement in the organic growth rate overall."

When you bring it over to architectural, there's not as much technology in the architectural. And we're not getting that. The market space, we think, is growing about 3%, maybe 4% max. Then you shift on over to protective and marine, that's a declining market with a huge overhang in the marine. We are taking share due to our technology. So that's another area.

294639,369877680,1010146,"PPG Industries, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","PPG Industries, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to thank you for your continued interest in PPG. Today, we reported our second quarter 2016 financial results. We achieved first quarter net sales of $4.1 billion and achieved adjusted earnings per",2136,"Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to thank you for your continued interest in PPG. 
Today, we reported our second quarter 2016 financial results. We achieved first quarter net sales of $4.1 billion and achieved adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.85. Overall, we continue to deliver strong financial results as evidenced by the 11% growth in our adjusted earnings per diluted share versus the prior year. This marks our 14th consecutive quarter of double-digit percentage increases in adjusted earnings per diluted share. 
This level of sustained financial growth despite uneven global economic conditions demonstrates PPG's ability to consistently and successfully commercialize new and innovative products as recently discussed during our innovation deep-dive event, acquire and integrate new businesses, maintain strict discipline over our cost structure and successfully deploy cash to continually create shareholder value. 
Our adjusted earnings per share growth in the second quarter benefited from earnings leveraged on solid regional volume growth in Europe and Asia. In addition, we benefited from acquisition-related income driven by the IVC Industrial Coatings and Le Joint Français, now called Sealants Europe, and Cuming Microwave acquisitions completed in 2015, and lower total costs, including increasing our cost structure improvement from business restructuring related to the program we announced in the second quarter 2015. 
Also we continue to execute on our strategic initiatives. These include the sale of our flat glass business that we announced today; the sale of our European fiber glass business that was announced during the second quarter; the completion of the sale of our minority interest in Pittsburgh Glass Works; and the acquisition of MetoKote Corporation, a global leader in coatings services with locations on 3 continents and over $200 million in annual revenues. The MetoKote acquisition closed July 1, and we expect the business divestitures to be completed by year-end. 
In addition to these portfolio enhancements, we continue to work on other important actions. During the quarter, we fully funded our Pittsburgh Corning Asbestos Trust obligation, including the prepayment of all future obligations for about $270 million at a 5.5% discount rate. This payment finalizes our long-term settlement efforts and concludes our involvement with all Pittsburgh Corning-related asbestos litigation. Also we announced annuitization of a sizable portion of our U.S. pension obligation, allowing us to reduce volatility of future earnings and mitigate financial risks associated with these pension plans. 
We continue to have excellent financial flexibility with cash and short-term investments of $1.7 billion at the end of the quarter. As part of our multiyear goal to reduce working capital, we improved our operating working capital levels by 180 basis points in the second quarter on top of prior year improvements. Operating working capital results improved year-over-year in all 3 business segments. 
In 2015 and 2016 combined, we have deployed $1.6 billion for acquisitions and the share repurchases, including the recent purchase of MetoKote. The company did not purchase or repurchase shares in the second quarter as we fully funded our portion of the asbestos trust. We plan to accelerate our pace of cash deployment in the second half of 2016, targeting the upper end of the previously announced cash deployment range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion for the years 2015 and 2016 combined. 
Now I'll discuss some specific business trends for the second quarter. Second quarter sales increased by more than 1% in local currency versus prior year. Reported net sales were down less than 1%. Acquisition-related sales were up more than 1% year-over-year. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted the second quarter, reducing sales by $95 million or more than 2%, including a 15% decrease in the Mexican peso versus the U.S. dollar as well as declines in the Chinese yuan, Canadian dollar, British pound and others. 
In the second quarter, the euro reversed a multi-quarter trend of year-over-year weakness versus the U.S. dollar, improving by almost 2%. As a result of currency movements, our 2016 year-to-date negative impact from foreign currency is approximately $235 million on sales and about $30 million on pretax income. Based on the current exchange rates, we expect full year 2016 unfavorable foreign currency translation to lower net sales by $320 million to $350 million and pretax income by $50 million to $60 million. 
In aggregate, our sales volumes were consistent with prior year, reflecting the modest growth rates in many major economies worldwide. Volume has expanded in Europe for the sixth consecutive quarter, reflecting a continued broad-based recovery by country and end-use market. Sales volume accelerated in the Asia Pacific sequentially versus the first quarter 2016 with continued growth in China and India, partially offset by weakness in Korea, primarily due to a slowdown in marine new-build activity. 
Sales volumes declined in U.S. and Canada but were mixed by end-use market. While our overall volumes were flat, we grew at or above market rates in many of our regional businesses around the world. We've included in our prepared materials for this quarterly call a heat map that provides our volume performance versus estimated industry growth rates for each of our businesses by region. 
As illustrated in the heat map, our investments in technology and global expansion are paying dividends, given our above-market performance in various coatings end-use markets. We have and we'll continue to put significant effort into driving additional organic growth in the areas where we are performing at or below market. Near term, we anticipate an acceleration of our volume growth in the third quarter, reflecting various actions and growth investments the past year or so that will begin providing tangible benefits. 
By segment, for the second quarter, Industrial Coatings led our volume results, increasing by 3% year-over-year, led by above-market gains in general industrial and packaging coatings. General Industrial Coatings volumes benefited from above-market growth in Europe and Asia. Packaging coatings continues to benefit at an above-market rate from industry conversions to new PPG can coating technologies around the world. This is being driven by an increase in environmental regulations, including recent propositions by the state of California and growing action by global food and beverage companies to eliminate BPA or bisphenol A-containing materials. Volumes in the automotive OEM coatings were consistent with industry growth rates with higher PPG performance in Asia and Europe, 2 regions where we expect higher industry growth in 2016 and 2017 as well. 
Volumes declined by 2% in the Performance Coatings segment with varied results by business. Automotive refinish coatings continued to outperform the market with mid-single-digit organic sales growth, led by continued conversions to PPG's market-leading waterborne products and favorable industry trends, including increased vehicle miles driven in the U.S. and Canada and total fleet expansion in China. Aerospace coatings returned to volume growth following the prior 2 quarters, where we experienced volume declines related to customer inventory management. Volumes in protective and marine coatings declined primarily due to continued and significant weakness in global marine new-build demand, along with sluggish protective coatings demand in the oil and gas sector. 
After improving for 3 consecutive quarters, volumes declined very modestly in the architectural EMEA primarily due to unfavorable weather patterns and flooding across portions of Western Europe during the second quarter. Architectural coatings declined by more than 20% in both Brazil and China, reflecting slowing end-use market conditions in those countries. Countering these declines was above-market architectural coatings growth in Mexico and Australia. Sales volumes also declined in architectural U.S. and Canada in aggregate with varied results by channel. 
Company-owned stores increased volumes by low single-digit percentage as we begin to see initial benefit from prior year investments to improve our store network and expanded penetration into certain end-use submarkets. Volumes fell in the independent dealer network, consistent with prior quarters, due to overall modest but continued structural decline within the channel. Despite the volume declines, this channel continues to create shareholder value for PPG as we are able to effectively manage our costs and maintain good returns. 
Volumes were lower in the national retail accounts or DIY channel. This was due in part to comparison to solid volume growth in last year's second quarter coupled with current year customer initiatives to structurally lower their inventory levels. However, our product sales to the DIY end customers, also known as point-of-sale or out-the-door sales, were higher year-over-year, benefiting from sales of some of our new and recently launched products. 
Local currency architectural coatings sales increased in Mexico at more than the expected rate of double Mexican GDP as we have further market penetration and the addition of over 100 new store locations year-to-date in 2016. Architectural volumes continued to expand rapidly in Central America, particularly in Panama and Costa Rica, due to the company's efforts to establish a presence in the region, leveraging our prior year acquisitions of Comex and Consorcio Latinoamericano. 
Overall, sales were up modestly in the Glass segment as higher average selling prices offset unfavorable foreign currency translation and flat volumes. Volumes declined modestly in our flat glass segment primarily due to the negative impacts stemming from reduced manufacturing capability early in the quarter when our Fresno, California facility was restarting after planned maintenance outage in the first quarter 2016. Underlying flat glass end-use market demand remains solid. Fiber glass volumes increased slightly in the second quarter. 
Looking ahead, we continue to expect varied business conditions globally due to the uneven pace of regional economic growth. We expect an acceleration of our volume growth in the third quarter as we continue to deliver above-market growth in many of our businesses. We expect this growth will be supplemented by benefits from several growth initiatives in our regional businesses. This includes our architectural U.S. and Canada business with continued improvement in our company-owned store network following our rebranding and sales force investments in the past year and growing demand for recently launched new products with many of our DIY customers. 
In addition, protective coatings volumes are expected to improve, driven by continued customer adoption of leading protective products and additional acquisition-related sale synergies, including a higher adoption of our legacy PPG products in Latin America. Lastly, as we have said on prior calls, in the second half of 2016, we will begin to anniversary the prior year decline in global commodity prices and anticipate general stability in this cost bucket as we approach the seasonal end of the bulk of the paint production season. 
I'd like to take a moment to comment on the historic Brexit vote that recently occurred in the U.K. PPG has a successful and growing business in both the U.K. and Continental Europe. While the businesses share noncustomer-facing resources, coatings, by and large, is a local business. Therefore, we buy, make and sell our products within a small radius and do not anticipate any material change or impact to our production costs or fixed costs stemming from the vote and subsequent financial market impacts. It is too early to tell the long-term regional economic impact of the vote, if any. But we haven't seen any notable short-term impacts and don't expect any material impacts to our business in the second half of the year. We continue to believe that the ongoing broad-based recovery in Europe is sustainable, supported by underlying modest but continued improvement in customer demand across the region. 
We believe that midterm, that regional growth from business investments could be marginally reduced without a clear path and time line for the U.K. exit. We believe the respective leaders are fully aware of this, and we'll be working to minimize or avoid this impact. We also believe that if there is a slowdown in regional economic activity, it will be accompanied by a reduction in regional commodity costs. Naturally, as you have come to expect from PPG, we'll remain proactive in preserving our level of earnings and cash generation in the region. Let me reiterate that our base case assumption is for little to no impact in the coming quarters from the Brexit vote. 
Now let me summarize our second quarter. Our business continued to perform well. We increased earnings by double-digit percentage for the 14th consecutive quarter. We took tangible actions to further achieve our strategic portfolio objectives. And we continue to generate and deploy cash to benefit our shareholders, including the acquisition of MetoKote Corporation and the payment of our dividend, which increased by 11% year-over-year. 
Looking ahead, we are strengthening our commitment to returning cash to our shareholders via acquisitions and share repurchases. We've already successfully taken actions to aggressively manage our business for growth in earnings in an uneven global economy and expect to continue these efforts in the third quarter as we anticipate an acceleration in the level of volume growth. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG. And now Andrea, would you please open the line for questions?"

We underperformed in the U.S. We had preferentially -- obviously, when you go into the bid season, if you were going to lose a piece of business and gain a piece of business, we wanted to gain it in the higher-growth regions. And so we underperformed in the U.S. We do think that is a short-term phenomenon. But that's 2 quarters in a row where we've underperformed. In Latin America, we were at market in Latin America. Of course, that's a smaller market. But overall, we outperformed in the automotive market probably for 4 years in a row. So this is just a short-term bump. When you look forward to the third quarter, if you remember in China last year, they had some pretty significant build reductions, especially in August. And the government came out with a reduction, the tax on the small 1.6-liter engines. And so that obviously won't happen again. China's build rates continue to be robust. We expect them to continue to be robust. There's a lot of new automotive plants coming on in the second half of the year. We won more than our fair share of those new plants.

Obviously, general aviation remains weak. If you think about the rotorcraft or the helicopter market for the oil and gas business remains difficult. But when you put it all together, we were up in the second quarter. We expect to be up in the third quarter. F-35 build rate is coming up. So that's going to be a positive. And if you look at Boeing and Airbus, they have only delivered 2 more planes in the second quarter versus what they delivered last year. And they're only up -- actually, they're down 6 planes each from their build rate in the first half of the year versus last half. And so they have a very full backlog.

So in terms of the amount of the dilution, if you take the gross proceeds from the flat glass business, we said we disclosed this morning, it was about $750 million. If you take adjustments and kind of -- since it's a U.S. business, you have a full federal and state tax rate on the gain, which is significant, the basis was not that significant. That, combined with adjustments, and then add that to the net proceeds of the European fiber glass business, which is relatively modest, double-digit net returns after taxes and adjustments, you could say the dilution is in the range of what you're talking about. But you have to do your own calculation. Please keep in mind that the flat glass business had a more than the Glass average margins. So in computing a potential dilution, you have to take that into effect. And of course, both those businesses will be in discounts for Q3. 
But in terms of what we do about that dilution, we have continued to demonstrate that we will take excess cash. And given the back half of the year is our cash-generating half, we will have proceeds from these businesses. We will continue, as Michael said, continue to deploy that in a manner that generates value for the shareholders. And so we have ample liquidity. We have cash on the balance sheet. We will continue to generate cash. We will get cash from these divestitures. So we are fully committed to that upper end of the previously communicated range by the end of this year."

That was driven by 4 primary factors, maybe 5 if I'm generous. Volume improvement in Europe, that's a significant leverage. So anytime we drop any volume in Europe, that comes 30% to 40% margin. The benefits of restructuring, we're going to continue to focus on that. The acquisition-related synergies, that would continue to do well. We certainly had some modest raw material benefits. And then as you know, we look at it from a currency standpoint, the fact that the dollar is so much stronger, you actually get absolute lower COGS and lower overhead numbers. So that all contributed to the margin. Now the pace, I think I mentioned in my opening comments, the pace of raw material deflation is slowing. So when you go back and look at what oil was in the second quarter of last year and the second quarter this year and you look at it third quarter versus third quarter, that's a slowing. But we're not letting that purchasing and global supply management team off the hook here, right? When I parse our raw materials, we put them in about 9 buckets, so whether it's epoxies or solvents or additives, emulsions, you name it. I would say at least 5 of those still have downward pressure, the rest of them flat. And we do have one that has some upward pressure. I don't regard the TiO2 price increase in the second quarter as a trend line, 1 point doesn't make a trend line. When you look at overall volumes across the globe in coatings, it is a modest number. More importantly, when you look at their input costs, their input costs are ore. Ore volumes are down. So when I couple their input costs and our view of what's going on the coatings segment, we're still having discussions, not to mention we still have Billions out there. We have favorable pricing with Billions. We're -- we use 3x as much Billions in the first quarter than we did fourth quarter last year. We increased that again in the second quarter. And we sequentially expect to increase the amount of product used by Billions in the third quarter from the chloride plant. And their performance continues to improve. So I would tell you overall, we're pretty -- we're going to have to continue to fight hard for what we have. But raw material deflation is slowing but not over."

And I think one of the reasons that PPG has been kind of more successful than the average Fortune company in integrating acquisitions is the diligence around both revenue and cost synergies. And if you look at the properties that we've acquired in the last few years, they've had an element of either a unique technology, unique customer base. But all had some kind of additional leverage that we could get either by expanding the customer base globally or putting the technology as part of our overall portfolio.

But clearly, the model that we have in Comex, the concessionaire network model, plays very well into Central America, where you have entrepreneurial people that are looking to put extra TVs in their house, go out and buy a car. This model works very well down there, and we're exporting the Comex model into Central America. So that's a real positive for us. We're bringing the PPG products into Comex. That has continued the acceleration of the Comex sales. That's why we're more than 2x GDP. The Comex team continues to perform at a very high level. We've been pleased. We've added over 100 stores in the first half of the year. So we're adding a store every other day. Basically, we anticipate having over 170 stores by the end of the year.

I want to thank you for your continued interest in PPG. Today, we reported our second quarter 2016 financial results. We achieved first quarter net sales of $4.1 billion and achieved adjusted earnings per",2136,"Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to thank you for your continued interest in PPG. 
Today, we reported our second quarter 2016 financial results. We achieved first quarter net sales of $4.1 billion and achieved adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.85. Overall, we continue to deliver strong financial results as evidenced by the 11% growth in our adjusted earnings per diluted share versus the prior year. This marks our 14th consecutive quarter of double-digit percentage increases in adjusted earnings per diluted share. 
This level of sustained financial growth despite uneven global economic conditions demonstrates PPG's ability to consistently and successfully commercialize new and innovative products as recently discussed during our innovation deep-dive event, acquire and integrate new businesses, maintain strict discipline over our cost structure and successfully deploy cash to continually create shareholder value. 
Our adjusted earnings per share growth in the second quarter benefited from earnings leveraged on solid regional volume growth in Europe and Asia. In addition, we benefited from acquisition-related income driven by the IVC Industrial Coatings and Le Joint Français, now called Sealants Europe, and Cuming Microwave acquisitions completed in 2015, and lower total costs, including increasing our cost structure improvement from business restructuring related to the program we announced in the second quarter 2015. 
Also we continue to execute on our strategic initiatives. These include the sale of our flat glass business that we announced today; the sale of our European fiber glass business that was announced during the second quarter; the completion of the sale of our minority interest in Pittsburgh Glass Works; and the acquisition of MetoKote Corporation, a global leader in coatings services with locations on 3 continents and over $200 million in annual revenues. The MetoKote acquisition closed July 1, and we expect the business divestitures to be completed by year-end. 
In addition to these portfolio enhancements, we continue to work on other important actions. During the quarter, we fully funded our Pittsburgh Corning Asbestos Trust obligation, including the prepayment of all future obligations for about $270 million at a 5.5% discount rate. This payment finalizes our long-term settlement efforts and concludes our involvement with all Pittsburgh Corning-related asbestos litigation. Also we announced annuitization of a sizable portion of our U.S. pension obligation, allowing us to reduce volatility of future earnings and mitigate financial risks associated with these pension plans. 
We continue to have excellent financial flexibility with cash and short-term investments of $1.7 billion at the end of the quarter. As part of our multiyear goal to reduce working capital, we improved our operating working capital levels by 180 basis points in the second quarter on top of prior year improvements. Operating working capital results improved year-over-year in all 3 business segments. 
In 2015 and 2016 combined, we have deployed $1.6 billion for acquisitions and the share repurchases, including the recent purchase of MetoKote. The company did not purchase or repurchase shares in the second quarter as we fully funded our portion of the asbestos trust. We plan to accelerate our pace of cash deployment in the second half of 2016, targeting the upper end of the previously announced cash deployment range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion for the years 2015 and 2016 combined. 
Now I'll discuss some specific business trends for the second quarter. Second quarter sales increased by more than 1% in local currency versus prior year. Reported net sales were down less than 1%. Acquisition-related sales were up more than 1% year-over-year. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted the second quarter, reducing sales by $95 million or more than 2%, including a 15% decrease in the Mexican peso versus the U.S. dollar as well as declines in the Chinese yuan, Canadian dollar, British pound and others. 
In the second quarter, the euro reversed a multi-quarter trend of year-over-year weakness versus the U.S. dollar, improving by almost 2%. As a result of currency movements, our 2016 year-to-date negative impact from foreign currency is approximately $235 million on sales and about $30 million on pretax income. Based on the current exchange rates, we expect full year 2016 unfavorable foreign currency translation to lower net sales by $320 million to $350 million and pretax income by $50 million to $60 million. 
In aggregate, our sales volumes were consistent with prior year, reflecting the modest growth rates in many major economies worldwide. Volume has expanded in Europe for the sixth consecutive quarter, reflecting a continued broad-based recovery by country and end-use market. Sales volume accelerated in the Asia Pacific sequentially versus the first quarter 2016 with continued growth in China and India, partially offset by weakness in Korea, primarily due to a slowdown in marine new-build activity. 
Sales volumes declined in U.S. and Canada but were mixed by end-use market. While our overall volumes were flat, we grew at or above market rates in many of our regional businesses around the world. We've included in our prepared materials for this quarterly call a heat map that provides our volume performance versus estimated industry growth rates for each of our businesses by region. 
As illustrated in the heat map, our investments in technology and global expansion are paying dividends, given our above-market performance in various coatings end-use markets. We have and we'll continue to put significant effort into driving additional organic growth in the areas where we are performing at or below market. Near term, we anticipate an acceleration of our volume growth in the third quarter, reflecting various actions and growth investments the past year or so that will begin providing tangible benefits. 
By segment, for the second quarter, Industrial Coatings led our volume results, increasing by 3% year-over-year, led by above-market gains in general industrial and packaging coatings. General Industrial Coatings volumes benefited from above-market growth in Europe and Asia. Packaging coatings continues to benefit at an above-market rate from industry conversions to new PPG can coating technologies around the world. This is being driven by an increase in environmental regulations, including recent propositions by the state of California and growing action by global food and beverage companies to eliminate BPA or bisphenol A-containing materials. Volumes in the automotive OEM coatings were consistent with industry growth rates with higher PPG performance in Asia and Europe, 2 regions where we expect higher industry growth in 2016 and 2017 as well. 
Volumes declined by 2% in the Performance Coatings segment with varied results by business. Automotive refinish coatings continued to outperform the market with mid-single-digit organic sales growth, led by continued conversions to PPG's market-leading waterborne products and favorable industry trends, including increased vehicle miles driven in the U.S. and Canada and total fleet expansion in China. Aerospace coatings returned to volume growth following the prior 2 quarters, where we experienced volume declines related to customer inventory management. Volumes in protective and marine coatings declined primarily due to continued and significant weakness in global marine new-build demand, along with sluggish protective coatings demand in the oil and gas sector. 
After improving for 3 consecutive quarters, volumes declined very modestly in the architectural EMEA primarily due to unfavorable weather patterns and flooding across portions of Western Europe during the second quarter. Architectural coatings declined by more than 20% in both Brazil and China, reflecting slowing end-use market conditions in those countries. Countering these declines was above-market architectural coatings growth in Mexico and Australia. Sales volumes also declined in architectural U.S. and Canada in aggregate with varied results by channel. 
Company-owned stores increased volumes by low single-digit percentage as we begin to see initial benefit from prior year investments to improve our store network and expanded penetration into certain end-use submarkets. Volumes fell in the independent dealer network, consistent with prior quarters, due to overall modest but continued structural decline within the channel. Despite the volume declines, this channel continues to create shareholder value for PPG as we are able to effectively manage our costs and maintain good returns. 
Volumes were lower in the national retail accounts or DIY channel. This was due in part to comparison to solid volume growth in last year's second quarter coupled with current year customer initiatives to structurally lower their inventory levels. However, our product sales to the DIY end customers, also known as point-of-sale or out-the-door sales, were higher year-over-year, benefiting from sales of some of our new and recently launched products. 
Local currency architectural coatings sales increased in Mexico at more than the expected rate of double Mexican GDP as we have further market penetration and the addition of over 100 new store locations year-to-date in 2016. Architectural volumes continued to expand rapidly in Central America, particularly in Panama and Costa Rica, due to the company's efforts to establish a presence in the region, leveraging our prior year acquisitions of Comex and Consorcio Latinoamericano. 
Overall, sales were up modestly in the Glass segment as higher average selling prices offset unfavorable foreign currency translation and flat volumes. Volumes declined modestly in our flat glass segment primarily due to the negative impacts stemming from reduced manufacturing capability early in the quarter when our Fresno, California facility was restarting after planned maintenance outage in the first quarter 2016. Underlying flat glass end-use market demand remains solid. Fiber glass volumes increased slightly in the second quarter. 
Looking ahead, we continue to expect varied business conditions globally due to the uneven pace of regional economic growth. We expect an acceleration of our volume growth in the third quarter as we continue to deliver above-market growth in many of our businesses. We expect this growth will be supplemented by benefits from several growth initiatives in our regional businesses. This includes our architectural U.S. and Canada business with continued improvement in our company-owned store network following our rebranding and sales force investments in the past year and growing demand for recently launched new products with many of our DIY customers. 
In addition, protective coatings volumes are expected to improve, driven by continued customer adoption of leading protective products and additional acquisition-related sale synergies, including a higher adoption of our legacy PPG products in Latin America. Lastly, as we have said on prior calls, in the second half of 2016, we will begin to anniversary the prior year decline in global commodity prices and anticipate general stability in this cost bucket as we approach the seasonal end of the bulk of the paint production season. 
I'd like to take a moment to comment on the historic Brexit vote that recently occurred in the U.K. PPG has a successful and growing business in both the U.K. and Continental Europe. While the businesses share noncustomer-facing resources, coatings, by and large, is a local business. Therefore, we buy, make and sell our products within a small radius and do not anticipate any material change or impact to our production costs or fixed costs stemming from the vote and subsequent financial market impacts. It is too early to tell the long-term regional economic impact of the vote, if any. But we haven't seen any notable short-term impacts and don't expect any material impacts to our business in the second half of the year. We continue to believe that the ongoing broad-based recovery in Europe is sustainable, supported by underlying modest but continued improvement in customer demand across the region. 
We believe that midterm, that regional growth from business investments could be marginally reduced without a clear path and time line for the U.K. exit. We believe the respective leaders are fully aware of this, and we'll be working to minimize or avoid this impact. We also believe that if there is a slowdown in regional economic activity, it will be accompanied by a reduction in regional commodity costs. Naturally, as you have come to expect from PPG, we'll remain proactive in preserving our level of earnings and cash generation in the region. Let me reiterate that our base case assumption is for little to no impact in the coming quarters from the Brexit vote. 
Now let me summarize our second quarter. Our business continued to perform well. We increased earnings by double-digit percentage for the 14th consecutive quarter. We took tangible actions to further achieve our strategic portfolio objectives. And we continue to generate and deploy cash to benefit our shareholders, including the acquisition of MetoKote Corporation and the payment of our dividend, which increased by 11% year-over-year. 
Looking ahead, we are strengthening our commitment to returning cash to our shareholders via acquisitions and share repurchases. We've already successfully taken actions to aggressively manage our business for growth in earnings in an uneven global economy and expect to continue these efforts in the third quarter as we anticipate an acceleration in the level of volume growth. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG. And now Andrea, would you please open the line for questions?"

Of course, that's a smaller market. But overall, we outperformed in the automotive market probably for 4 years in a row. So this is just a short-term bump. When you look forward to the third quarter, if you remember in China last year, they had some pretty significant build reductions, especially in August. And the government came out with a reduction, the tax on the small 1.6-liter engines. And so that obviously won't happen again. China's build rates continue to be robust. We expect them to continue to be robust. There's a lot of new automotive plants coming on in the second half of the year. We won more than our fair share of those new plants.

Obviously, general aviation remains weak. If you think about the rotorcraft or the helicopter market for the oil and gas business remains difficult. But when you put it all together, we were up in the second quarter. We expect to be up in the third quarter. F-35 build rate is coming up. So that's going to be a positive. And if you look at Boeing and Airbus, they have only delivered 2 more planes in the second quarter versus what they delivered last year. And they're only up -- actually, they're down 6 planes each from their build rate in the first half of the year versus last half. And so they have a very full backlog.

So in computing a potential dilution, you have to take that into effect. And of course, both those businesses will be in discounts for Q3.

That was driven by 4 primary factors, maybe 5 if I'm generous. Volume improvement in Europe, that's a significant leverage. So anytime we drop any volume in Europe, that comes 30% to 40% margin. The benefits of restructuring, we're going to continue to focus on that. The acquisition-related synergies, that would continue to do well. We certainly had some modest raw material benefits. And then as you know, we look at it from a currency standpoint, the fact that the dollar is so much stronger, you actually get absolute lower COGS and lower overhead numbers. So that all contributed to the margin. Now the pace, I think I mentioned in my opening comments, the pace of raw material deflation is slowing. So when you go back and look at what oil was in the second quarter of last year and the second quarter this year and you look at it third quarter versus third quarter, that's a slowing. But we're not letting that purchasing and global supply management team off the hook here, right? When I parse our raw materials, we put them in about 9 buckets, so whether it's epoxies or solvents or additives, emulsions, you name it. I would say at least 5 of those still have downward pressure, the rest of them flat. And we do have one that has some upward pressure. I don't regard the TiO2 price increase in the second quarter as a trend line, 1 point doesn't make a trend line. When you look at overall volumes across the globe in coatings, it is a modest number. More importantly, when you look at their input costs, their input costs are ore. Ore volumes are down. So when I couple their input costs and our view of what's going on the coatings segment, we're still having discussions, not to mention we still have Billions out there. We have favorable pricing with Billions. We're -- we use 3x as much Billions in the first quarter than we did fourth quarter last year. We increased that again in the second quarter. And we sequentially expect to increase the amount of product used by Billions in the third quarter from the chloride plant. And their performance continues to improve. So I would tell you overall, we're pretty -- we're going to have to continue to fight hard for what we have. But raw material deflation is slowing but not over."

And if you look at the properties that we've acquired in the last few years, they've had an element of either a unique technology, unique customer base.

But there was significant momentum generated in the industrial and packaging business as well as really nice momentum in refinish, aerospace and automotive OEM doing well in the vast majority of the globe. And that momentum should continue. If you look at the heat map, there are a few selected parts of the portfolio, where whether it's a macro issue where we get a little bit of help and obviously a little bit of help from the weather in Europe going forward as well as some activities we've got going on in architectural USCA. With those turning, you'll have the vast majority of portfolio on a pretty good path. And that's why we have confidence for the back half of the year into '17 that we'll get improvement in the organic growth rate overall."

When you bring it over to architectural, there's not as much technology in the architectural. And we're not getting that. The market space, we think, is growing about 3%, maybe 4% max. Then you shift on over to protective and marine, that's a declining market with a huge overhang in the marine. We are taking share due to our technology. So that's another area.

294639,369877680,1011360,"PPG Industries, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","PPG Industries, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to thank you for your continued interest in PPG. Today, we reported our second quarter 2016 financial results. We achieved first quarter net sales of $4.1 billion and achieved adjusted earnings per",2136,"Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to thank you for your continued interest in PPG. 
Today, we reported our second quarter 2016 financial results. We achieved first quarter net sales of $4.1 billion and achieved adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.85. Overall, we continue to deliver strong financial results as evidenced by the 11% growth in our adjusted earnings per diluted share versus the prior year. This marks our 14th consecutive quarter of double-digit percentage increases in adjusted earnings per diluted share. 
This level of sustained financial growth despite uneven global economic conditions demonstrates PPG's ability to consistently and successfully commercialize new and innovative products as recently discussed during our innovation deep-dive event, acquire and integrate new businesses, maintain strict discipline over our cost structure and successfully deploy cash to continually create shareholder value. 
Our adjusted earnings per share growth in the second quarter benefited from earnings leveraged on solid regional volume growth in Europe and Asia. In addition, we benefited from acquisition-related income driven by the IVC Industrial Coatings and Le Joint Français, now called Sealants Europe, and Cuming Microwave acquisitions completed in 2015, and lower total costs, including increasing our cost structure improvement from business restructuring related to the program we announced in the second quarter 2015. 
Also we continue to execute on our strategic initiatives. These include the sale of our flat glass business that we announced today; the sale of our European fiber glass business that was announced during the second quarter; the completion of the sale of our minority interest in Pittsburgh Glass Works; and the acquisition of MetoKote Corporation, a global leader in coatings services with locations on 3 continents and over $200 million in annual revenues. The MetoKote acquisition closed July 1, and we expect the business divestitures to be completed by year-end. 
In addition to these portfolio enhancements, we continue to work on other important actions. During the quarter, we fully funded our Pittsburgh Corning Asbestos Trust obligation, including the prepayment of all future obligations for about $270 million at a 5.5% discount rate. This payment finalizes our long-term settlement efforts and concludes our involvement with all Pittsburgh Corning-related asbestos litigation. Also we announced annuitization of a sizable portion of our U.S. pension obligation, allowing us to reduce volatility of future earnings and mitigate financial risks associated with these pension plans. 
We continue to have excellent financial flexibility with cash and short-term investments of $1.7 billion at the end of the quarter. As part of our multiyear goal to reduce working capital, we improved our operating working capital levels by 180 basis points in the second quarter on top of prior year improvements. Operating working capital results improved year-over-year in all 3 business segments. 
In 2015 and 2016 combined, we have deployed $1.6 billion for acquisitions and the share repurchases, including the recent purchase of MetoKote. The company did not purchase or repurchase shares in the second quarter as we fully funded our portion of the asbestos trust. We plan to accelerate our pace of cash deployment in the second half of 2016, targeting the upper end of the previously announced cash deployment range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion for the years 2015 and 2016 combined. 
Now I'll discuss some specific business trends for the second quarter. Second quarter sales increased by more than 1% in local currency versus prior year. Reported net sales were down less than 1%. Acquisition-related sales were up more than 1% year-over-year. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted the second quarter, reducing sales by $95 million or more than 2%, including a 15% decrease in the Mexican peso versus the U.S. dollar as well as declines in the Chinese yuan, Canadian dollar, British pound and others. 
In the second quarter, the euro reversed a multi-quarter trend of year-over-year weakness versus the U.S. dollar, improving by almost 2%. As a result of currency movements, our 2016 year-to-date negative impact from foreign currency is approximately $235 million on sales and about $30 million on pretax income. Based on the current exchange rates, we expect full year 2016 unfavorable foreign currency translation to lower net sales by $320 million to $350 million and pretax income by $50 million to $60 million. 
In aggregate, our sales volumes were consistent with prior year, reflecting the modest growth rates in many major economies worldwide. Volume has expanded in Europe for the sixth consecutive quarter, reflecting a continued broad-based recovery by country and end-use market. Sales volume accelerated in the Asia Pacific sequentially versus the first quarter 2016 with continued growth in China and India, partially offset by weakness in Korea, primarily due to a slowdown in marine new-build activity. 
Sales volumes declined in U.S. and Canada but were mixed by end-use market. While our overall volumes were flat, we grew at or above market rates in many of our regional businesses around the world. We've included in our prepared materials for this quarterly call a heat map that provides our volume performance versus estimated industry growth rates for each of our businesses by region. 
As illustrated in the heat map, our investments in technology and global expansion are paying dividends, given our above-market performance in various coatings end-use markets. We have and we'll continue to put significant effort into driving additional organic growth in the areas where we are performing at or below market. Near term, we anticipate an acceleration of our volume growth in the third quarter, reflecting various actions and growth investments the past year or so that will begin providing tangible benefits. 
By segment, for the second quarter, Industrial Coatings led our volume results, increasing by 3% year-over-year, led by above-market gains in general industrial and packaging coatings. General Industrial Coatings volumes benefited from above-market growth in Europe and Asia. Packaging coatings continues to benefit at an above-market rate from industry conversions to new PPG can coating technologies around the world. This is being driven by an increase in environmental regulations, including recent propositions by the state of California and growing action by global food and beverage companies to eliminate BPA or bisphenol A-containing materials. Volumes in the automotive OEM coatings were consistent with industry growth rates with higher PPG performance in Asia and Europe, 2 regions where we expect higher industry growth in 2016 and 2017 as well. 
Volumes declined by 2% in the Performance Coatings segment with varied results by business. Automotive refinish coatings continued to outperform the market with mid-single-digit organic sales growth, led by continued conversions to PPG's market-leading waterborne products and favorable industry trends, including increased vehicle miles driven in the U.S. and Canada and total fleet expansion in China. Aerospace coatings returned to volume growth following the prior 2 quarters, where we experienced volume declines related to customer inventory management. Volumes in protective and marine coatings declined primarily due to continued and significant weakness in global marine new-build demand, along with sluggish protective coatings demand in the oil and gas sector. 
After improving for 3 consecutive quarters, volumes declined very modestly in the architectural EMEA primarily due to unfavorable weather patterns and flooding across portions of Western Europe during the second quarter. Architectural coatings declined by more than 20% in both Brazil and China, reflecting slowing end-use market conditions in those countries. Countering these declines was above-market architectural coatings growth in Mexico and Australia. Sales volumes also declined in architectural U.S. and Canada in aggregate with varied results by channel. 
Company-owned stores increased volumes by low single-digit percentage as we begin to see initial benefit from prior year investments to improve our store network and expanded penetration into certain end-use submarkets. Volumes fell in the independent dealer network, consistent with prior quarters, due to overall modest but continued structural decline within the channel. Despite the volume declines, this channel continues to create shareholder value for PPG as we are able to effectively manage our costs and maintain good returns. 
Volumes were lower in the national retail accounts or DIY channel. This was due in part to comparison to solid volume growth in last year's second quarter coupled with current year customer initiatives to structurally lower their inventory levels. However, our product sales to the DIY end customers, also known as point-of-sale or out-the-door sales, were higher year-over-year, benefiting from sales of some of our new and recently launched products. 
Local currency architectural coatings sales increased in Mexico at more than the expected rate of double Mexican GDP as we have further market penetration and the addition of over 100 new store locations year-to-date in 2016. Architectural volumes continued to expand rapidly in Central America, particularly in Panama and Costa Rica, due to the company's efforts to establish a presence in the region, leveraging our prior year acquisitions of Comex and Consorcio Latinoamericano. 
Overall, sales were up modestly in the Glass segment as higher average selling prices offset unfavorable foreign currency translation and flat volumes. Volumes declined modestly in our flat glass segment primarily due to the negative impacts stemming from reduced manufacturing capability early in the quarter when our Fresno, California facility was restarting after planned maintenance outage in the first quarter 2016. Underlying flat glass end-use market demand remains solid. Fiber glass volumes increased slightly in the second quarter. 
Looking ahead, we continue to expect varied business conditions globally due to the uneven pace of regional economic growth. We expect an acceleration of our volume growth in the third quarter as we continue to deliver above-market growth in many of our businesses. We expect this growth will be supplemented by benefits from several growth initiatives in our regional businesses. This includes our architectural U.S. and Canada business with continued improvement in our company-owned store network following our rebranding and sales force investments in the past year and growing demand for recently launched new products with many of our DIY customers. 
In addition, protective coatings volumes are expected to improve, driven by continued customer adoption of leading protective products and additional acquisition-related sale synergies, including a higher adoption of our legacy PPG products in Latin America. Lastly, as we have said on prior calls, in the second half of 2016, we will begin to anniversary the prior year decline in global commodity prices and anticipate general stability in this cost bucket as we approach the seasonal end of the bulk of the paint production season. 
I'd like to take a moment to comment on the historic Brexit vote that recently occurred in the U.K. PPG has a successful and growing business in both the U.K. and Continental Europe. While the businesses share noncustomer-facing resources, coatings, by and large, is a local business. Therefore, we buy, make and sell our products within a small radius and do not anticipate any material change or impact to our production costs or fixed costs stemming from the vote and subsequent financial market impacts. It is too early to tell the long-term regional economic impact of the vote, if any. But we haven't seen any notable short-term impacts and don't expect any material impacts to our business in the second half of the year. We continue to believe that the ongoing broad-based recovery in Europe is sustainable, supported by underlying modest but continued improvement in customer demand across the region. 
We believe that midterm, that regional growth from business investments could be marginally reduced without a clear path and time line for the U.K. exit. We believe the respective leaders are fully aware of this, and we'll be working to minimize or avoid this impact. We also believe that if there is a slowdown in regional economic activity, it will be accompanied by a reduction in regional commodity costs. Naturally, as you have come to expect from PPG, we'll remain proactive in preserving our level of earnings and cash generation in the region. Let me reiterate that our base case assumption is for little to no impact in the coming quarters from the Brexit vote. 
Now let me summarize our second quarter. Our business continued to perform well. We increased earnings by double-digit percentage for the 14th consecutive quarter. We took tangible actions to further achieve our strategic portfolio objectives. And we continue to generate and deploy cash to benefit our shareholders, including the acquisition of MetoKote Corporation and the payment of our dividend, which increased by 11% year-over-year. 
Looking ahead, we are strengthening our commitment to returning cash to our shareholders via acquisitions and share repurchases. We've already successfully taken actions to aggressively manage our business for growth in earnings in an uneven global economy and expect to continue these efforts in the third quarter as we anticipate an acceleration in the level of volume growth. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG. And now Andrea, would you please open the line for questions?"

We underperformed in the U.S. We had preferentially -- obviously, when you go into the bid season, if you were going to lose a piece of business and gain a piece of business, we wanted to gain it in the higher-growth regions. And so we underperformed in the U.S. We do think that is a short-term phenomenon. But that's 2 quarters in a row where we've underperformed. In Latin America, we were at market in Latin America. Of course, that's a smaller market. But overall, we outperformed in the automotive market probably for 4 years in a row. So this is just a short-term bump. When you look forward to the third quarter, if you remember in China last year, they had some pretty significant build reductions, especially in August. And the government came out with a reduction, the tax on the small 1.6-liter engines. And so that obviously won't happen again. China's build rates continue to be robust. We expect them to continue to be robust. There's a lot of new automotive plants coming on in the second half of the year. We won more than our fair share of those new plants.

Obviously, general aviation remains weak. If you think about the rotorcraft or the helicopter market for the oil and gas business remains difficult. But when you put it all together, we were up in the second quarter. We expect to be up in the third quarter. F-35 build rate is coming up. So that's going to be a positive. And if you look at Boeing and Airbus, they have only delivered 2 more planes in the second quarter versus what they delivered last year. And they're only up -- actually, they're down 6 planes each from their build rate in the first half of the year versus last half. And so they have a very full backlog.

So in terms of the amount of the dilution, if you take the gross proceeds from the flat glass business, we said we disclosed this morning, it was about $750 million. If you take adjustments and kind of -- since it's a U.S. business, you have a full federal and state tax rate on the gain, which is significant, the basis was not that significant. That, combined with adjustments, and then add that to the net proceeds of the European fiber glass business, which is relatively modest, double-digit net returns after taxes and adjustments, you could say the dilution is in the range of what you're talking about. But you have to do your own calculation. Please keep in mind that the flat glass business had a more than the Glass average margins. So in computing a potential dilution, you have to take that into effect. And of course, both those businesses will be in discounts for Q3. 
But in terms of what we do about that dilution, we have continued to demonstrate that we will take excess cash. And given the back half of the year is our cash-generating half, we will have proceeds from these businesses. We will continue, as Michael said, continue to deploy that in a manner that generates value for the shareholders. And so we have ample liquidity. We have cash on the balance sheet. We will continue to generate cash. We will get cash from these divestitures. So we are fully committed to that upper end of the previously communicated range by the end of this year."

That was driven by 4 primary factors, maybe 5 if I'm generous. Volume improvement in Europe, that's a significant leverage. So anytime we drop any volume in Europe, that comes 30% to 40% margin. The benefits of restructuring, we're going to continue to focus on that. The acquisition-related synergies, that would continue to do well. We certainly had some modest raw material benefits. And then as you know, we look at it from a currency standpoint, the fact that the dollar is so much stronger, you actually get absolute lower COGS and lower overhead numbers. So that all contributed to the margin. Now the pace, I think I mentioned in my opening comments, the pace of raw material deflation is slowing. So when you go back and look at what oil was in the second quarter of last year and the second quarter this year and you look at it third quarter versus third quarter, that's a slowing. But we're not letting that purchasing and global supply management team off the hook here, right? When I parse our raw materials, we put them in about 9 buckets, so whether it's epoxies or solvents or additives, emulsions, you name it. I would say at least 5 of those still have downward pressure, the rest of them flat. And we do have one that has some upward pressure. I don't regard the TiO2 price increase in the second quarter as a trend line, 1 point doesn't make a trend line. When you look at overall volumes across the globe in coatings, it is a modest number. More importantly, when you look at their input costs, their input costs are ore. Ore volumes are down. So when I couple their input costs and our view of what's going on the coatings segment, we're still having discussions, not to mention we still have Billions out there. We have favorable pricing with Billions. We're -- we use 3x as much Billions in the first quarter than we did fourth quarter last year. We increased that again in the second quarter. And we sequentially expect to increase the amount of product used by Billions in the third quarter from the chloride plant. And their performance continues to improve. So I would tell you overall, we're pretty -- we're going to have to continue to fight hard for what we have. But raw material deflation is slowing but not over."

And I think one of the reasons that PPG has been kind of more successful than the average Fortune company in integrating acquisitions is the diligence around both revenue and cost synergies. And if you look at the properties that we've acquired in the last few years, they've had an element of either a unique technology, unique customer base. But all had some kind of additional leverage that we could get either by expanding the customer base globally or putting the technology as part of our overall portfolio.

This model works very well down there, and we're exporting the Comex model into Central America. So that's a real positive for us. We're bringing the PPG products into Comex. That has continued the acceleration of the Comex sales. That's why we're more than 2x GDP. The Comex team continues to perform at a very high level. We've been pleased.

I want to thank you for your continued interest in PPG. Today, we reported our third quarter 2016 financial results. We achieved third quarter net sales of $3.8 billion and adjusted earnings per share from",1234,"Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to thank you for your continued interest in PPG. 
Today, we reported our third quarter 2016 financial results. We achieved third quarter net sales of $3.8 billion and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.56. Third quarter net sales in local currencies grew by more than 3%, including year-over-year volume growth of 1.6%. We achieved this growth despite a broad-based deceleration of volume growth rates in Europe this quarter in comparison to the previous several quarters. 
Acquisition-related sales contributed about 2% in the quarter due to our MetoKote, IVC, Industrial Coatings and Le Joint Français acquisitions. Unfavorable foreign currency reduced sales by about 2%, due to primarily the significant year-over-year declines in the Mexican peso and the British pound. The British pound was down about 15% versus the prior year period, and the Mexican peso was down about 12%. 
With respect to the peso, as we have discussed in the past, the PPG-Comex architectural coatings business is seasonally strongest in the back half of the year. Therefore, a weakened peso is more impactful to us at this time in the year. 
From an earnings perspective, our adjusted earnings per share grew 1% versus the prior year. We had positive earnings contribution from the higher overall sales volumes, offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation and higher growth-related spending. What I just discussed were all year-over-year comparisons. As all of you know, we provided earnings guidance during the first week of October as our EPS was short of our expectations leading into the third quarter. We haven't had to provide preguidance on earnings for quite some time, so let me quickly discuss what we experienced during the quarter. 
The largest shortfall that we experienced during the third quarter was slower-than-expected volume growth in Europe. This reason -- region has been one of our stronger -- strongest growth engines over the past year plus. Our year-over-year European volumes, which had been growing by low- to mid-single-digit percentages, came in essentially flat for the quarter. 
While we have experienced some regional volume growth in certain businesses such as automotive OEM and general Industrial Coatings, the rate of growth contracted in these businesses. 
In addition, we experienced a similar several hundred basis point decline in most of our other regional businesses. This broad decline was also evidenced across many countries within the region. 
This lack of volume growth, coupled with the fact that Europe currently has our highest regional incremental operating margins, these incremental margins reflect the significant cost rationalization we have done over the past 5 years. While there were other factors in the quarter, the absence of the European volume growth and the related benefits from higher incremental margins were the major factors in our below-expectation performance. 
Looking at the other regions, we basically performed as expected. The Asia Pacific region delivered solid mid- to high single-digit percentage volume growth on a year-over-year basis, including strong gains in automotive OEM and refinished coatings. These increases were partially offset by continued declines in marine coatings due to exceptionally weak and continuing declines in shipbuilding activity. The automotive OEM strength in the Asia Pacific region was in comparison to a weak prior year period when regional automotive OEM industry production was down. In the fourth quarter, we will face significantly stronger comparison period as the industry production was up nearly 20% in the prior year. 
Coating sales volumes were flat in the U.S. and Canada compared to the prior year. We experienced volume growth in our U.S. and Canadian architectural coatings business versus a volume decline in the prior year period. Leading our growth were higher volume at our company-owned stores coupled with increased sales through the DIY channel supported by our new products and the associated higher launch-related promotional spending. Also in the region, year-over-year sales volumes continued to expand in refinish and packaging coatings, but were offset by lower automotive OEM sales and declines in general Industrial Coatings, which mirrored weak industrial production in the region. 
Latin American sales volumes expanded, primarily due to growth in the Mexican architectural coatings and OEM coatings markets, while most South American markets remain challenging. 
Overall, I am pleased we were able to grow sales volumes, and we did deliver modest earnings per share growth versus the prior year. However, I am disappointed by our earnings progression versus the prior 2 quarters of 2016, and our 1% year-over-year earnings per share growth is well below our expectations. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we currently do not see any near-term evidence of improvement in global demand. We now have a strong sense of our October order book, and as many of you know, for business seasonality reasons, the month of October is typically the largest sales month within the fourth quarter. 
As a result of this continued tepid demand, we are reviewing various potential restructuring actions to reduce our structural operating and functional costs. With these actions, we will place increased focus on regions and end-use markets that are the weakest. We are still vetting these potential actions, and we'll provide an update once we are finalized. 
We plan on maintaining an appropriate level of investment in growth-related initiatives, including research and development, sales, technical support and product-branding initiatives. 
Also worth mentioning during the quarter, we continue to execute on our strategic objectives, including a continuation of our portfolio actions. On July 1, we completed the MetoKote acquisition, a coating services business with approximately $200 million in annual revenue. Also in the third quarter, we announced the sale of our ownership interest in our 2 fiber glass joint ventures in Asia. The sale of these 2 joint ventures is expected to close by year-end 2016. Lastly, we completed the sales of our flat glass and European fiber glass businesses with both transactions closing on October 1. In addition to these portfolio actions, we completed $250 million in share repurchases during the third quarter. 
Finally, we ended the third quarter with about $1 billion of cash and short-term investments. This figure excludes about $1 billion of gross proceeds from 2 recently divested businesses and the pending sale of our ownership interest in the 2 Asian fiber glass joint ventures. We expect only modest tax leakage from these business divestments. 
We have ample flexibility, and we will continue to deploy cash in an earnings-accretive manner. While we remain price disciplined, our acquisition pipeline remains active. 
Additionally, our Board of Directors recently authorized an additional $2 billion repurchase program, which gave us, at that time of approval, about $2.5 billion of share repurchase capacity. We expect to deploy at least $650 million of cash in the fourth quarter on acquisitions and share repurchases to reach the top end of our previously communicated cash deployment range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion in the combined 2015, 2016 calendar years. We had deployed $1.85 billion toward the target to date. 
To summarize, we grew our year-over-year earnings in the third quarter, but at a rate that was below my expectations. We are working on variety of actions to improve our earnings growth rate, including acceleration of cash deployment and further reductions in our overall cost structure while preserving prudent growth-related investments. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG. And now, Gary, would you please open the line for questions?"

That would -- that may or may not necessarily detract from the U.S., but the overall U.S. market, we expect to be relatively flat next year. We're watching closely the incentives that the automotive manufacturers are putting out there. And I think we'll just continue to watch that closely. Europe, at 14 million builds, still has room to run. Southern Europe continues to perform very well. So if you look at what's going on in Spain, it was up double digits. Italy was up double digits. Germany was still up 5%. So -- and we're starting to see a little life in France in the automotive side, unfortunately not in the architectural side, but the automotive side. So that's all good. So I would think that, that's going to be a positive number next year in Europe. And then back to your question about China, first of all, China is -- has the -- a reduced tax out there through the end of 2016. There's no indication on whether or not they're going to make a change on that. I do believe, from a personal perspective, that China wants their automotive business to be a champion. They are just now starting to export a very small amount of cars out of China. We would expect them to continue to support them. So I am not looking for a material change in the China automotive growth rate. In fact, I would say it's going to grow again next year. And I won't be surprised if it has many, many years to run because if you look at the number of cars per person in China, it's still very, very low. And it is a big status symbol when you buy a car in China. So that's going to continue."

I want to thank you for your continued interest in PPG. Today, we reported our third quarter 2016 financial results. We achieved third quarter net sales of $3.8 billion and adjusted earnings per share from",1234,"Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to thank you for your continued interest in PPG. 
Today, we reported our third quarter 2016 financial results. We achieved third quarter net sales of $3.8 billion and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.56. Third quarter net sales in local currencies grew by more than 3%, including year-over-year volume growth of 1.6%. We achieved this growth despite a broad-based deceleration of volume growth rates in Europe this quarter in comparison to the previous several quarters. 
Acquisition-related sales contributed about 2% in the quarter due to our MetoKote, IVC, Industrial Coatings and Le Joint Français acquisitions. Unfavorable foreign currency reduced sales by about 2%, due to primarily the significant year-over-year declines in the Mexican peso and the British pound. The British pound was down about 15% versus the prior year period, and the Mexican peso was down about 12%. 
With respect to the peso, as we have discussed in the past, the PPG-Comex architectural coatings business is seasonally strongest in the back half of the year. Therefore, a weakened peso is more impactful to us at this time in the year. 
From an earnings perspective, our adjusted earnings per share grew 1% versus the prior year. We had positive earnings contribution from the higher overall sales volumes, offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation and higher growth-related spending. What I just discussed were all year-over-year comparisons. As all of you know, we provided earnings guidance during the first week of October as our EPS was short of our expectations leading into the third quarter. We haven't had to provide preguidance on earnings for quite some time, so let me quickly discuss what we experienced during the quarter. 
The largest shortfall that we experienced during the third quarter was slower-than-expected volume growth in Europe. This reason -- region has been one of our stronger -- strongest growth engines over the past year plus. Our year-over-year European volumes, which had been growing by low- to mid-single-digit percentages, came in essentially flat for the quarter. 
While we have experienced some regional volume growth in certain businesses such as automotive OEM and general Industrial Coatings, the rate of growth contracted in these businesses. 
In addition, we experienced a similar several hundred basis point decline in most of our other regional businesses. This broad decline was also evidenced across many countries within the region. 
This lack of volume growth, coupled with the fact that Europe currently has our highest regional incremental operating margins, these incremental margins reflect the significant cost rationalization we have done over the past 5 years. While there were other factors in the quarter, the absence of the European volume growth and the related benefits from higher incremental margins were the major factors in our below-expectation performance. 
Looking at the other regions, we basically performed as expected. The Asia Pacific region delivered solid mid- to high single-digit percentage volume growth on a year-over-year basis, including strong gains in automotive OEM and refinished coatings. These increases were partially offset by continued declines in marine coatings due to exceptionally weak and continuing declines in shipbuilding activity. The automotive OEM strength in the Asia Pacific region was in comparison to a weak prior year period when regional automotive OEM industry production was down. In the fourth quarter, we will face significantly stronger comparison period as the industry production was up nearly 20% in the prior year. 
Coating sales volumes were flat in the U.S. and Canada compared to the prior year. We experienced volume growth in our U.S. and Canadian architectural coatings business versus a volume decline in the prior year period. Leading our growth were higher volume at our company-owned stores coupled with increased sales through the DIY channel supported by our new products and the associated higher launch-related promotional spending. Also in the region, year-over-year sales volumes continued to expand in refinish and packaging coatings, but were offset by lower automotive OEM sales and declines in general Industrial Coatings, which mirrored weak industrial production in the region. 
Latin American sales volumes expanded, primarily due to growth in the Mexican architectural coatings and OEM coatings markets, while most South American markets remain challenging. 
Overall, I am pleased we were able to grow sales volumes, and we did deliver modest earnings per share growth versus the prior year. However, I am disappointed by our earnings progression versus the prior 2 quarters of 2016, and our 1% year-over-year earnings per share growth is well below our expectations. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we currently do not see any near-term evidence of improvement in global demand. We now have a strong sense of our October order book, and as many of you know, for business seasonality reasons, the month of October is typically the largest sales month within the fourth quarter. 
As a result of this continued tepid demand, we are reviewing various potential restructuring actions to reduce our structural operating and functional costs. With these actions, we will place increased focus on regions and end-use markets that are the weakest. We are still vetting these potential actions, and we'll provide an update once we are finalized. 
We plan on maintaining an appropriate level of investment in growth-related initiatives, including research and development, sales, technical support and product-branding initiatives. 
Also worth mentioning during the quarter, we continue to execute on our strategic objectives, including a continuation of our portfolio actions. On July 1, we completed the MetoKote acquisition, a coating services business with approximately $200 million in annual revenue. Also in the third quarter, we announced the sale of our ownership interest in our 2 fiber glass joint ventures in Asia. The sale of these 2 joint ventures is expected to close by year-end 2016. Lastly, we completed the sales of our flat glass and European fiber glass businesses with both transactions closing on October 1. In addition to these portfolio actions, we completed $250 million in share repurchases during the third quarter. 
Finally, we ended the third quarter with about $1 billion of cash and short-term investments. This figure excludes about $1 billion of gross proceeds from 2 recently divested businesses and the pending sale of our ownership interest in the 2 Asian fiber glass joint ventures. We expect only modest tax leakage from these business divestments. 
We have ample flexibility, and we will continue to deploy cash in an earnings-accretive manner. While we remain price disciplined, our acquisition pipeline remains active. 
Additionally, our Board of Directors recently authorized an additional $2 billion repurchase program, which gave us, at that time of approval, about $2.5 billion of share repurchase capacity. We expect to deploy at least $650 million of cash in the fourth quarter on acquisitions and share repurchases to reach the top end of our previously communicated cash deployment range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion in the combined 2015, 2016 calendar years. We had deployed $1.85 billion toward the target to date. 
To summarize, we grew our year-over-year earnings in the third quarter, but at a rate that was below my expectations. We are working on variety of actions to improve our earnings growth rate, including acceleration of cash deployment and further reductions in our overall cost structure while preserving prudent growth-related investments. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG. And now, Gary, would you please open the line for questions?"

That would -- that may or may not necessarily detract from the U.S., but the overall U.S. market, we expect to be relatively flat next year. We're watching closely the incentives that the automotive manufacturers are putting out there. And I think we'll just continue to watch that closely. Europe, at 14 million builds, still has room to run. Southern Europe continues to perform very well. So if you look at what's going on in Spain, it was up double digits. Italy was up double digits. Germany was still up 5%. So -- and we're starting to see a little life in France in the automotive side, unfortunately not in the architectural side, but the automotive side. So that's all good. So I would think that, that's going to be a positive number next year in Europe. And then back to your question about China, first of all, China is -- has the -- a reduced tax out there through the end of 2016. There's no indication on whether or not they're going to make a change on that. I do believe, from a personal perspective, that China wants their automotive business to be a champion. They are just now starting to export a very small amount of cars out of China. We would expect them to continue to support them. So I am not looking for a material change in the China automotive growth rate. In fact, I would say it's going to grow again next year. And I won't be surprised if it has many, many years to run because if you look at the number of cars per person in China, it's still very, very low. And it is a big status symbol when you buy a car in China. So that's going to continue."

So that will be more pressure in the marketplace to ship to the BPA-NI coatings. And of course, once that starts to happen, I always use tuna fish as an example. You pack cans in Thailand. Those cans show up in Europe. They show up in the U.S. And they're not going to run 2 and 3 different formulations for some of those tuna fish ones. So you're going to have certain markets following later just because of where they export to. So we're in the early innings, and we're really pleased with the acceptance of our new technology."

I want to thank you for your continued interest in PPG. Today, we reported our third quarter 2016 financial results. We achieved third quarter net sales of $3.8 billion and adjusted earnings per share from",1234,"Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to thank you for your continued interest in PPG. 
Today, we reported our third quarter 2016 financial results. We achieved third quarter net sales of $3.8 billion and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.56. Third quarter net sales in local currencies grew by more than 3%, including year-over-year volume growth of 1.6%. We achieved this growth despite a broad-based deceleration of volume growth rates in Europe this quarter in comparison to the previous several quarters. 
Acquisition-related sales contributed about 2% in the quarter due to our MetoKote, IVC, Industrial Coatings and Le Joint Français acquisitions. Unfavorable foreign currency reduced sales by about 2%, due to primarily the significant year-over-year declines in the Mexican peso and the British pound. The British pound was down about 15% versus the prior year period, and the Mexican peso was down about 12%. 
With respect to the peso, as we have discussed in the past, the PPG-Comex architectural coatings business is seasonally strongest in the back half of the year. Therefore, a weakened peso is more impactful to us at this time in the year. 
From an earnings perspective, our adjusted earnings per share grew 1% versus the prior year. We had positive earnings contribution from the higher overall sales volumes, offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation and higher growth-related spending. What I just discussed were all year-over-year comparisons. As all of you know, we provided earnings guidance during the first week of October as our EPS was short of our expectations leading into the third quarter. We haven't had to provide preguidance on earnings for quite some time, so let me quickly discuss what we experienced during the quarter. 
The largest shortfall that we experienced during the third quarter was slower-than-expected volume growth in Europe. This reason -- region has been one of our stronger -- strongest growth engines over the past year plus. Our year-over-year European volumes, which had been growing by low- to mid-single-digit percentages, came in essentially flat for the quarter. 
While we have experienced some regional volume growth in certain businesses such as automotive OEM and general Industrial Coatings, the rate of growth contracted in these businesses. 
In addition, we experienced a similar several hundred basis point decline in most of our other regional businesses. This broad decline was also evidenced across many countries within the region. 
This lack of volume growth, coupled with the fact that Europe currently has our highest regional incremental operating margins, these incremental margins reflect the significant cost rationalization we have done over the past 5 years. While there were other factors in the quarter, the absence of the European volume growth and the related benefits from higher incremental margins were the major factors in our below-expectation performance. 
Looking at the other regions, we basically performed as expected. The Asia Pacific region delivered solid mid- to high single-digit percentage volume growth on a year-over-year basis, including strong gains in automotive OEM and refinished coatings. These increases were partially offset by continued declines in marine coatings due to exceptionally weak and continuing declines in shipbuilding activity. The automotive OEM strength in the Asia Pacific region was in comparison to a weak prior year period when regional automotive OEM industry production was down. In the fourth quarter, we will face significantly stronger comparison period as the industry production was up nearly 20% in the prior year. 
Coating sales volumes were flat in the U.S. and Canada compared to the prior year. We experienced volume growth in our U.S. and Canadian architectural coatings business versus a volume decline in the prior year period. Leading our growth were higher volume at our company-owned stores coupled with increased sales through the DIY channel supported by our new products and the associated higher launch-related promotional spending. Also in the region, year-over-year sales volumes continued to expand in refinish and packaging coatings, but were offset by lower automotive OEM sales and declines in general Industrial Coatings, which mirrored weak industrial production in the region. 
Latin American sales volumes expanded, primarily due to growth in the Mexican architectural coatings and OEM coatings markets, while most South American markets remain challenging. 
Overall, I am pleased we were able to grow sales volumes, and we did deliver modest earnings per share growth versus the prior year. However, I am disappointed by our earnings progression versus the prior 2 quarters of 2016, and our 1% year-over-year earnings per share growth is well below our expectations. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we currently do not see any near-term evidence of improvement in global demand. We now have a strong sense of our October order book, and as many of you know, for business seasonality reasons, the month of October is typically the largest sales month within the fourth quarter. 
As a result of this continued tepid demand, we are reviewing various potential restructuring actions to reduce our structural operating and functional costs. With these actions, we will place increased focus on regions and end-use markets that are the weakest. We are still vetting these potential actions, and we'll provide an update once we are finalized. 
We plan on maintaining an appropriate level of investment in growth-related initiatives, including research and development, sales, technical support and product-branding initiatives. 
Also worth mentioning during the quarter, we continue to execute on our strategic objectives, including a continuation of our portfolio actions. On July 1, we completed the MetoKote acquisition, a coating services business with approximately $200 million in annual revenue. Also in the third quarter, we announced the sale of our ownership interest in our 2 fiber glass joint ventures in Asia. The sale of these 2 joint ventures is expected to close by year-end 2016. Lastly, we completed the sales of our flat glass and European fiber glass businesses with both transactions closing on October 1. In addition to these portfolio actions, we completed $250 million in share repurchases during the third quarter. 
Finally, we ended the third quarter with about $1 billion of cash and short-term investments. This figure excludes about $1 billion of gross proceeds from 2 recently divested businesses and the pending sale of our ownership interest in the 2 Asian fiber glass joint ventures. We expect only modest tax leakage from these business divestments. 
We have ample flexibility, and we will continue to deploy cash in an earnings-accretive manner. While we remain price disciplined, our acquisition pipeline remains active. 
Additionally, our Board of Directors recently authorized an additional $2 billion repurchase program, which gave us, at that time of approval, about $2.5 billion of share repurchase capacity. We expect to deploy at least $650 million of cash in the fourth quarter on acquisitions and share repurchases to reach the top end of our previously communicated cash deployment range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion in the combined 2015, 2016 calendar years. We had deployed $1.85 billion toward the target to date. 
To summarize, we grew our year-over-year earnings in the third quarter, but at a rate that was below my expectations. We are working on variety of actions to improve our earnings growth rate, including acceleration of cash deployment and further reductions in our overall cost structure while preserving prudent growth-related investments. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG. And now, Gary, would you please open the line for questions?"

As you know, there are a number of new automotive plants in Mexico that will be coming up in the next -- well, starting now through 2018. And those plants will obviously drive higher growth rate in Mexico than historically. That would -- that may or may not necessarily detract from the U.S., but the overall U.S. market, we expect to be relatively flat next year. We're watching closely the incentives that the automotive manufacturers are putting out there. And I think we'll just continue to watch that closely. Europe, at 14 million builds, still has room to run. Southern Europe continues to perform very well. So if you look at what's going on in Spain, it was up double digits. Italy was up double digits. Germany was still up 5%. So -- and we're starting to see a little life in France in the automotive side, unfortunately not in the architectural side, but the automotive side. So that's all good. So I would think that, that's going to be a positive number next year in Europe. And then back to your question about China, first of all, China is -- has the -- a reduced tax out there through the end of 2016. There's no indication on whether or not they're going to make a change on that. I do believe, from a personal perspective, that China wants their automotive business to be a champion. They are just now starting to export a very small amount of cars out of China. We would expect them to continue to support them. So I am not looking for a material change in the China automotive growth rate. In fact, I would say it's going to grow again next year. And I won't be surprised if it has many, many years to run because if you look at the number of cars per person in China, it's still very, very low. And it is a big status symbol when you buy a car in China. So that's going to continue."

But this gives us confidence that the trend going forward will be more in the circa 3% range of revenue. And along with looking at the macro environment that you referred to, we're being very disciplined in terms of deploying the actual individual projects, whether they be for cost savings, capacity growth, whatever. So gating the CapEx in a very, very careful way, so we do not get ahead of the market. So you might interpret that by meeting the fact that our previous outlook in terms of percent of revenue for CapEx in 2016, we're hoping come in at the low end of that percentage range and be very efficient how we deploy that kind of just-in-time basis."

You were right in saying that it was unusually low last year, and some of that was driven by the share price Q3 last year.

And of course, when we look out to Q4, that will depend upon how that particular factor plays out. But the remainder of the corporate expense bucket going forward, that would be, obviously, one area along with all other areas of cost that we'll be assessing as we go forward in terms of our rationalization program.

I want to thank you for your continued interest in PPG. Today, we reported our third quarter 2016 financial results. We achieved third quarter net sales of $3.8 billion and adjusted earnings per share from",1234,"Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to thank you for your continued interest in PPG. 
Today, we reported our third quarter 2016 financial results. We achieved third quarter net sales of $3.8 billion and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.56. Third quarter net sales in local currencies grew by more than 3%, including year-over-year volume growth of 1.6%. We achieved this growth despite a broad-based deceleration of volume growth rates in Europe this quarter in comparison to the previous several quarters. 
Acquisition-related sales contributed about 2% in the quarter due to our MetoKote, IVC, Industrial Coatings and Le Joint Français acquisitions. Unfavorable foreign currency reduced sales by about 2%, due to primarily the significant year-over-year declines in the Mexican peso and the British pound. The British pound was down about 15% versus the prior year period, and the Mexican peso was down about 12%. 
With respect to the peso, as we have discussed in the past, the PPG-Comex architectural coatings business is seasonally strongest in the back half of the year. Therefore, a weakened peso is more impactful to us at this time in the year. 
From an earnings perspective, our adjusted earnings per share grew 1% versus the prior year. We had positive earnings contribution from the higher overall sales volumes, offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation and higher growth-related spending. What I just discussed were all year-over-year comparisons. As all of you know, we provided earnings guidance during the first week of October as our EPS was short of our expectations leading into the third quarter. We haven't had to provide preguidance on earnings for quite some time, so let me quickly discuss what we experienced during the quarter. 
The largest shortfall that we experienced during the third quarter was slower-than-expected volume growth in Europe. This reason -- region has been one of our stronger -- strongest growth engines over the past year plus. Our year-over-year European volumes, which had been growing by low- to mid-single-digit percentages, came in essentially flat for the quarter. 
While we have experienced some regional volume growth in certain businesses such as automotive OEM and general Industrial Coatings, the rate of growth contracted in these businesses. 
In addition, we experienced a similar several hundred basis point decline in most of our other regional businesses. This broad decline was also evidenced across many countries within the region. 
This lack of volume growth, coupled with the fact that Europe currently has our highest regional incremental operating margins, these incremental margins reflect the significant cost rationalization we have done over the past 5 years. While there were other factors in the quarter, the absence of the European volume growth and the related benefits from higher incremental margins were the major factors in our below-expectation performance. 
Looking at the other regions, we basically performed as expected. The Asia Pacific region delivered solid mid- to high single-digit percentage volume growth on a year-over-year basis, including strong gains in automotive OEM and refinished coatings. These increases were partially offset by continued declines in marine coatings due to exceptionally weak and continuing declines in shipbuilding activity. The automotive OEM strength in the Asia Pacific region was in comparison to a weak prior year period when regional automotive OEM industry production was down. In the fourth quarter, we will face significantly stronger comparison period as the industry production was up nearly 20% in the prior year. 
Coating sales volumes were flat in the U.S. and Canada compared to the prior year. We experienced volume growth in our U.S. and Canadian architectural coatings business versus a volume decline in the prior year period. Leading our growth were higher volume at our company-owned stores coupled with increased sales through the DIY channel supported by our new products and the associated higher launch-related promotional spending. Also in the region, year-over-year sales volumes continued to expand in refinish and packaging coatings, but were offset by lower automotive OEM sales and declines in general Industrial Coatings, which mirrored weak industrial production in the region. 
Latin American sales volumes expanded, primarily due to growth in the Mexican architectural coatings and OEM coatings markets, while most South American markets remain challenging. 
Overall, I am pleased we were able to grow sales volumes, and we did deliver modest earnings per share growth versus the prior year. However, I am disappointed by our earnings progression versus the prior 2 quarters of 2016, and our 1% year-over-year earnings per share growth is well below our expectations. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we currently do not see any near-term evidence of improvement in global demand. We now have a strong sense of our October order book, and as many of you know, for business seasonality reasons, the month of October is typically the largest sales month within the fourth quarter. 
As a result of this continued tepid demand, we are reviewing various potential restructuring actions to reduce our structural operating and functional costs. With these actions, we will place increased focus on regions and end-use markets that are the weakest. We are still vetting these potential actions, and we'll provide an update once we are finalized. 
We plan on maintaining an appropriate level of investment in growth-related initiatives, including research and development, sales, technical support and product-branding initiatives. 
Also worth mentioning during the quarter, we continue to execute on our strategic objectives, including a continuation of our portfolio actions. On July 1, we completed the MetoKote acquisition, a coating services business with approximately $200 million in annual revenue. Also in the third quarter, we announced the sale of our ownership interest in our 2 fiber glass joint ventures in Asia. The sale of these 2 joint ventures is expected to close by year-end 2016. Lastly, we completed the sales of our flat glass and European fiber glass businesses with both transactions closing on October 1. In addition to these portfolio actions, we completed $250 million in share repurchases during the third quarter. 
Finally, we ended the third quarter with about $1 billion of cash and short-term investments. This figure excludes about $1 billion of gross proceeds from 2 recently divested businesses and the pending sale of our ownership interest in the 2 Asian fiber glass joint ventures. We expect only modest tax leakage from these business divestments. 
We have ample flexibility, and we will continue to deploy cash in an earnings-accretive manner. While we remain price disciplined, our acquisition pipeline remains active. 
Additionally, our Board of Directors recently authorized an additional $2 billion repurchase program, which gave us, at that time of approval, about $2.5 billion of share repurchase capacity. We expect to deploy at least $650 million of cash in the fourth quarter on acquisitions and share repurchases to reach the top end of our previously communicated cash deployment range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion in the combined 2015, 2016 calendar years. We had deployed $1.85 billion toward the target to date. 
To summarize, we grew our year-over-year earnings in the third quarter, but at a rate that was below my expectations. We are working on variety of actions to improve our earnings growth rate, including acceleration of cash deployment and further reductions in our overall cost structure while preserving prudent growth-related investments. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG. And now, Gary, would you please open the line for questions?"

That would -- that may or may not necessarily detract from the U.S., but the overall U.S. market, we expect to be relatively flat next year. We're watching closely the incentives that the automotive manufacturers are putting out there. And I think we'll just continue to watch that closely. Europe, at 14 million builds, still has room to run. Southern Europe continues to perform very well. So if you look at what's going on in Spain, it was up double digits. Italy was up double digits. Germany was still up 5%. So -- and we're starting to see a little life in France in the automotive side, unfortunately not in the architectural side, but the automotive side. So that's all good. So I would think that, that's going to be a positive number next year in Europe. And then back to your question about China, first of all, China is -- has the -- a reduced tax out there through the end of 2016. There's no indication on whether or not they're going to make a change on that. I do believe, from a personal perspective, that China wants their automotive business to be a champion. They are just now starting to export a very small amount of cars out of China. We would expect them to continue to support them. So I am not looking for a material change in the China automotive growth rate. In fact, I would say it's going to grow again next year. And I won't be surprised if it has many, many years to run because if you look at the number of cars per person in China, it's still very, very low. And it is a big status symbol when you buy a car in China. So that's going to continue."
