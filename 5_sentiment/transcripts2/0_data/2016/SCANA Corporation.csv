I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. GAAP earnings in the fourth quarter of 2015 were $0.69 per share compared to $0.73 per share in the same quarter of 2014. The decrease in earnings in t",2254,"Thanks, Susan, and thank you all for joining us today. 
I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. GAAP earnings in the fourth quarter of 2015 were $0.69 per share compared to $0.73 per share in the same quarter of 2014. The decrease in earnings in the fourth quarter is mainly attributable to the negative impact of weather on electric margins as well as on gas margins in our Georgia business. Lower gas margins also reflect $0.07 per share of lost margins due to the sale of CGT early in the year. These losses were partially offset by higher electric margins due primarily to a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth as well as lower depreciation expense as a result of a new depreciation study and lower O&M expense due primarily to labor savings and the impact of the sales of CGT during the first quarter of 2015. 
Note, too, that abnormal weather decreased electric margins by $0.14 per share and $0.02 per share versus normal in the fourth quarters of 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
Please turn to Slide 4. Earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2015, were $5.22 versus $3.79 in 2014. The improved results were mainly attributable to the net-of-tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI; higher electric margins, due primarily to a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth; as well as lower depreciation expense and O&M as described earlier. These were partially offset by lower electric margins due to weather; lower gas margins, primarily due to lost gas margins of $0.23 per share resulting from the sale of CGT; and the impact of abnormal weather on the Georgia business; and normal increases in CapEx-related items, including interest, property taxes and share dilution. 
Although electric margins reflected a negative $0.13 per share due to weather year-over-year, abnormal weather increased electric margins in both years, accounting for $0.08 per share in 2015 compared to $0.21 in 2014. 
Slide 5 shows earnings on a GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized basis. Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2015 were $0.83 per share compared to $0.75 per share in the same quarter of 2014. Full year earnings were $3.73 per share in 2015 compared to $3.58 per share in the prior year. As a reminder, GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized EPS excludes the impact of abnormal weather on electric margins and the net-of-tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI from the first quarter of 2015. 
Abnormal weather on gas margins is not adjusted in this measure as gas margins are weather-normalized for the North and South Carolina businesses, and the direct impact of abnormal weather on the Georgia business is generally insignificant. However, the extremely mild weather in the fourth quarter of 2015 was seen in that business' standalone results as I'll discuss later. 
Now on Slide 6, I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. On a GAAP basis, South Carolina Electric & Gas Company's fourth quarter 2015 earnings were down $0.01 per share compared to the same period of 2014. The decrease in earnings is due to lower electric margins due to abnormal weather and higher expenses related to our capital program, including interest expense and property taxes. These decreases more than offset increases due to the continued recovery of financing costs through the BLRA, customer growth in both the electric and gas businesses, the application of the previously mentioned new depreciation rates and lower O&M due primarily to labor savings. 
For the full year 2015, earnings were higher by $0.12 per share due to increased electric margins, primarily from the continued recovery of financing costs through the BLRA and customer growth, improved gas margins due to a customer growth and the application of new depreciation rates. These items were partially offset by the effective abnormal weather on electric margins and higher expenses related to our capital program, including interest expense, property taxes, dilution and continued increases in depreciation exclusive of the impact of the depreciation study. 
Although weather in both years contributed favorably to electric margins versus normal, 2015 was milder than 2014, with weather contributing $0.08 of margin versus normal in 2015 compared to $0.21 in 2014. 
PSNC Energy reported earnings of $0.17 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $0.16 per share in the same quarter of the prior year, primarily due to higher margins from customer growth. For the year ended December 2015, earnings are $0.38 per share compared to $0.39 per share in the prior year. 
SCANA Energy, our retail and natural gas marketing business in Georgia, showed a decrease in the fourth quarter earnings of $0.06 per share in 2015 over the same quarter of last year, primarily due to lower throughput and margins attributable to the extremely warm weather during the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to 2014, partially offset by lower bad debt expense. 
For the 12 months ended December 31, 2015, earnings were down $0.05 per share compared to the same period of 2014 due to the same drivers as the quarter. 
On a GAAP basis, SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported a loss of $0.01 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $0.03 in the comparative quarter of the prior year. Lower interest expense at the holding company and increased margins at our marketing business were primarily offset by foregone earnings contributions from the subsidiaries that were sold during the first [ph] quarter of this year. 
For the 12-month period, these businesses reported earnings per share of $1.36 in 2015 compared to $0.01 loss in 2014. Excluding the net-of-tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI of $1.41 per share, GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized EPS was down $0.04 from the prior year due primarily to foregone earnings from the sale of the businesses earlier this year, offset by lower interest expense at the holding company and increased margins on our marketing business. 
I would now like to touch on economic trends in our service territory on Slide 7. In 2015, the company's announced plans to invest over $2 billion with the expectation of creating over 6,000 jobs in our Carolinas territories. The Carolinas continue to be seen as a favorable business environment, and we're pleased by the continuous growth in our service territories. 
At the bottom of the slide, you can see the national unemployment rate along with the rates for the 3 states where SCANA has a presence and the SCE&G electric territory. South Carolina's unemployment rate is now at 5.5%, and the rate in SCE&G's electric territory is estimated at 4.7%. 
At the top of Slide 8, you can see the South Carolina employment statistics as of December 2015 and 2014. Over the course of 2015, South Carolina's unemployment rate has dropped over a percentage point from its level at the end of 2014. December of 2015 also marked all-time highs for the number of South Carolinians employed and in the labor force. 
Of particular interest and attesting to our state's strong economic growth, almost 80,000 or 3.8% more South Carolinians are working today than a year ago. Said another way, had the labor force not increased during 2015, the unemployment rate would be approximately 3%. 
The expansion of the labor force is simply evidence of the confidence of some of the workforce to reenter the market and the positive migration to the state of Carolina. 
As depicted on the bottom of the slide, United Van Lines recently released its annual movers study for 2015, which tracks migration patterns state to state. For the third consecutive year, South Carolina finished ranked second in terms of domestic migration destinations, cooperating our realized gross statistics. North Carolina has also been ranked in the top 5 for the last 3 years. 
Slide 9 presents customer growth and electric sales statistics. On the top half of the slide is the customer growth rate for each of our regulated businesses. SCE&G's electric business added customers at a year-over-year rate of 1.5%. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina added customers at a rate of 2.5% and 2.7%, respectively. We continue to see very strong customer growth in our businesses and in the region. 
The bottom table outlines our actual and weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales for the 12 months ended December 31, 2015. Overall, weather-normalized total retail sales are up 1.3% on a 12-month ended basis. 
In conjunction with the continued improvement of economic conditions in South Carolina, the past 2 quarters have shown an accelerating improvement in usage in the residential market. 
And now please turn to Slide 10, which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $9.6 billion. As denoted in the 2 shades of blue, approximately 86% of this rate base is related to the electric business. On the graph on the right, you will see SCE&G's base electric business, in which we're allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The earned return for the 12 months ended December 31, 2015, in the base electric business is approximately 9.75%, meeting our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA-related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. We continue to be pleased with the execution of our strategy. 
As a reminder, we're allowed a return on equity of 10.25% and 10.6% in our LDCs in South and North Carolina, respectively. In responsible -- in response to the normal attrition in the earned returns in our North Carolina business, yesterday, PSNC notified the North Carolina Utilities Commission of its intention to file a rate case. We plan to file the detailed case within the next 60 days, where more clarity will be provided. 
As you will recall, in South Carolina, if the earned ROE of the gas business for the 12 months ending in March falls outside a range of 50 basis points above or below the allowed ROE, then we will file to adjust rates under the Rate Stabilization Act in June. 
Slide 11 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast reflects the company's current estimate of new nuclear spending through 2018 and has been updated to reflect what was filed in our quarterly BLRA report, which also reflects the amended EPC that was announced in October 2015. 
At the bottom of the slide, we recap the estimated new nuclear CWIP from July 1 through June 30 to correspond to the periods on which the BLRA rate increases are historically calculated. 
Slide 12 presents the transition payments information and an expected time frame for our filing with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina. Once these events are complete, we will update the CapEx schedule and the corresponding financing plan. 
And now please turn to Slide 13 to review our estimated financing plan through 2018. As a reminder, we have switched to open market purchases instead of issuing new shares to fulfill our 401(k) and DRIP plans at least until we have fully utilized the net cash proceeds from the sales of CGT and SCI. We do not anticipate the need for further equity issuances until 2017, and again, the election of the fixed-price option would likely change planned equity issuances after 2016. 
While these are our best estimates of incremental debt and equity issuances, it is unlikely that these issuances will occur in the exact amounts or timing as presented as they're subject to changes in our funding needs for planned project expenses. We continue to adjust the financing to match the related project CapEx on a 50-50 debt and equity basis. 
On Slide 14, we are reaffirming our 2016 GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized earnings guidance as $3.90 per share to $4.10 per share with an internal target of $4 per share. We continue to be cautiously optimistic about our long-term view and are increasing the lower band of our long-term growth rate from 3% to 4%. We are also resetting our base year to 2015 GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized EPS of $3.73. 
Therefore, our new GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized annual growth guidance target will be to deliver 4% to 6% earnings growth over the 3 to 5 years using a base of 2015 GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized EPS of $3.73. This increase represents our projected earnings momentum driven by our BLRA filings, our stated goal to manage base retail electric returns and our view of the economy, balanced with our continued assumption of the impacts of energy conservation and efficiency standards. 
I also wanted to mention that earlier today, we announced an increase of $0.12 in our annual dividend rate for 2016 to $2.30 per share, a 5.5% increase. We continue to anticipate growing dividends fairly consistent with the earnings while staying within our stated payout policy of 55% to 60%. 
And finally, on Slide 15, we are very pleased to report that in late December, we successfully completed the syndication of an expanded and extended credit facility. The additional liquidity is important to our nuclear construction project and accelerated CapEx spending at PSNC. The committed lines of credit now total $2 billion. 
I would like to thank our banks for their enthusiastic support of our liquidity needs and therefore, the support of our nuclear expansion plans. We are pleased that we continue to receive an excellent response for our nuclear construction from our equity and debt investors as well as our banks, and I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project."

Slide 16 presents the outline we have shown in previous discussions as a recap. 
As you maybe aware, Westinghouse closed on the transaction to acquire Stone & Webster from CB&I at the end of December, and Fluor began work as a subcontracted construction manager in new nuclear construction site on January 4. We continue our analysis of the fixed-price option, and we'll include input from Fluor as they progressed. 
As a reminder, we have until November 1 of this year to unilaterally elect the fixed-price option or not, and we plan to take as much time as needed to ensure that we make the most prudent decision. Regardless of which scenario we choose, once a decision has been made, we will file petition with the Public Service Commission to amend the capital cost on scheduled for the project. As Jimmy said earlier, we expect to reach a conclusion in the second quarter. 
Moving on to some of the activities at the new nuclear construction site. Slide 17 presents an aerial photo of the site from September 2015. I provided this photo to give you a view of the layout of the site, and I've labeled both Units 2 and 3 as well as many other areas that make up what we call a tabletop. 
On Slide 18, you can see picture of the Unit 2 nuclear island. In this picture, you can see module CA20 on the right-hand side of the slide off the containment vessel #1, which was placed on and welded to the lower. Several of the large structural modules have now been placed inside the Unit 2 containment vessel. As we will discuss shortly, you can also see the beginnings of the shield building as 3 courses have now been placed. 
Slide 19 shows a picture of the Unit 3 nuclear island module CA-04 was placed inside a containment vessel lower back in June, and building walls continue. As you'll see shortly, we are making progress with the fabrication and placement of containment vessel structural modules on both units. 
Slide 20 presents a schematic view of the 5 large structural modules that are located inside the containment vessel. I showed the schematic numerous times before because this expanded view gives you better feel for how CA-01 through -05 fits spatially inside the containment vessel. As you may know, we've now placed CA-01, CA-04 and CA-05 for Unit 2 and CA-04 for Unit 3. 
Slide 21 shows a picture of the Unit 2 CA-02 module. CA-02 is a wall section that forms part of the in-containment refueling water storage tank. As mentioned last quarter, CA-02 is now structurally complete and awaiting installation. 
Slide 22 shows a picture of the Unit 2 CA-03, which is the west wall of the in-containment refueling water storage tank. 15 of CA-03's 17 submodules are on-site, and 12 are now on their assembly platform. 
Slide 23 shows a picture of the Unit 3 module CA-05. This module comprises one of the major wall sections within the containment vessel. Fabrication on the Unit 3 CA-05 has been completed and has been staged outside of the modular assembly building or MAB. 
Slide 24 shows a picture of the Unit 3 CA20, which is the auxiliary building module that will be located outside and adjacent to the containment vessel. 68 of the 72 submodules are on-site, and 20 of those submodules have been upended on the construction platform for fabrication in the MAB. 
Slide 25 shows a picture of the beginnings of the Unit 3 module CA-01. Module CA-01 houses the steam generators and the pressurizer and forms fueling canal inside the containment vessel. Currently, we have 15 of 47 submodules on-site, and 3 of those submodules are upright and being welded together in the MAB. 
Slide 26 shows the progress of the placement of the Unit 2 shield building panels. The first 6-panel course was placed during the first half of 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the second 6-panel course was set on top of the first course, and at the beginning of this month, we placed the third 6-panel course. As the shield building panels are placed and welded together, concrete is poured inside of the panels to create the shield building. Concrete has been placed in the first 2 courses. 
Slide 27 shows a couple of pictures from the Unit 2 turbine pedestal concrete placement from December of 2015. Overall, more than 2,300 cubic areas of concrete was placed over the course of about 20 hours. 
Slide 28 shows a picture of the single phase for the 230-ton Unit 2 main transformers. There are 4 such transformers for each unit, and here you can see one of the 4 being rig replacement adjacent to the Unit 2 turbine building. Each unit will have these 4 plus 6 other transformers. All 10 have been placed for Unit 2, and all 10 have been received for Unit 3. 
On Slide 29, you see the new nuclear CapEx actual and projected over the life of the construction. This chart shows CWIP during the years 2008 to 2020, reflecting the Q4 of 2015 BLRA quarterly report that we filed in February. As a reminder, the BLRA report now reflects the cost from the October 2015 amended EPC. As you can see, we are currently in the middle of the peak nuclear construction period. The green line represents the related actual and projected customer rate increases under the BLRA and is associated with the right-hand access. 
Please now turn to Slide 30. As we mentioned during our third quarter call in September, the PSC approved a rate increase of $64.5 million. The new rates were effective for bills rendered on or after October 30. Our BLRA filings for 2016 are showed at the bottom of the slide, and as you can see, we recently filed our quarterly status report for the fourth quarter, and our next quarterly update we filed in mid-May. Not depicted here is the update filing I addressed earlier as timing of that petition isn't yet known. 
Finally, I wanted to mention the results of an analysis performed at the direction of the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff. As you maybe aware, the ORS contracted an independent accounting firm to whether the revised rates provision under the Base Load Review Act is cost beneficial to SCE&G customers, consistent with our claims. This independent attestation concluded in January and reaffirmed the significant cost advantage of the BLRA as envisioned when the law was originally passed. This report is available on the ORS website, and the link to the independent accounting firms report can be found in the regulatory document section of the nuclear development area of SCANA's investor website. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now be glad to respond to any questions you might have."

I think all the turbine generator stuff is on-site, containment stuff on-site. We've got a couple of capacity exchangers that are being reworked at -- in Italy. Those should be finished shortly. We have cone pumps. Those are domestic, but those won't show up until 2017. That's most of the major stuff. Now when we get into submodules, we still have some of the submodules for the structural modules, particularly for the trailing unit, Unit 3, they're still in fabrication. And so, for example, CA01 is being fabricated between Toshiba in Japan and IHI in Japan. There are 47 different submodules that are associated with that unit. 15 have been delivered, 15 of the 47. 7 have shipped. It just takes a while for them to get here, and so 25 are yet to be shipped. So we've got almost half of those are either on-site or on the ocean. So I think if I were to categorize it, 85% of the major equipment's on-site, and of the remaining stuff, a lot of it is physically complete. Some of it is waiting to be shipped. Some of it is on the ocean now on its way to our site."

We were heartened to see the restructuring plan with the intent to stay in the energy business while they do intend to shed some of their business lines, they're going to stay in energy business, which would include nuclear. So that's good thing for us. Also, we are glad to see that with the significant changes in leadership in the board at Toshiba that the person that we have been largely dealing with in the nuclear arena survived that, and we think that's a good thing. I do believe that Toshiba has been successful at securing some debt from some large Japanese banks just recently. Bankruptcy also doesn't necessarily mean that things would stop. There are various kinds of bankruptcies, not that we think it'll get to that point, but it doesn't necessarily mean things at the site will stop. In addition to the sort of the financial protections that Jimmy just alluded to, we did actually forecast a situation like this back when we were negotiating the EPC contract. It's not necessarily that we thought that the larger corporation, Toshiba, might have financial difficulties, but we're really focusing on perhaps the smaller corporations like Westinghouse and/or Shaw might have some physical difficulties. So we do have in the contracts some provisions to escrow intellectual properties such that if there were to be a secession of operations by the contractor that we could finish the plant on our own."

The biggest issue the we had really was the anticipated that the fit up of this first of a kind item, taking these individual panels that come from Newport News Industrial or N&I and putting them together at the site, welding them up within the tolerances and filling them with concrete was going to be very difficult. We've done a lot of mock-ups. We received our half the panels for the first unit and maybe a 25% for the second unit. The placement so far I could categorize is going a little better than we had anticipated, and so we've got 16 courses of steel panels that go in a ring that we eventually will fill with concrete. We've placed the first 3 of those courses already. The first 2 have been welded, fit and put concrete in, and the third, the third course we recently placed. So we're welding that. But again, that's going I think better than we had anticipated. So now our focus is critical path is ensuring that we get these submodules, the pieces, the panels from NNI in a timely fashion, and so Westinghouse has taken over the contract that CB&I used to have so that's now exclusively a Westinghouse to an NNI deal if we think it's good, and then their delivery schedule looks to be good, and they're negotiating a mitigation strategy and I'll be going to NNI tomorrow to talk through the mitigation strategy that will accelerate some of those panel deliveries to the side.

So once we demonstrate proficiency with shield building then you focus on whatever's next. We're always looking at primary, secondary, tertiary critical paths. So the secondary critical path is, as you mentioned, CA20 [indiscernible] the trailing unit, Unit 3. We've already set CA20 for Unit 2 obviously, and we did come up with interesting mitigation strategy for the CA20 module whereas on the first unit on Unit 2, we set it as one piece. On the second one, we're going to set it in 2 halves. So that will save us probably couple of months in the fabrication, and that's important because it actually forms a part of the concrete form work for the rest of the plan. So it's important that we set that, that half of that and use it as the form concrete while we're working on the second half then set the second half. So as of right now, I thought that, that was -- the team on site came up with that plan. We're executing on that plan, and we ought to set that at first half, CA20, for the second unit in Q1, late Q1, and then we should set the second half of CA20 for Unit 3, probably early in Q2."

Toshiba obviously has all the incentive in the world under the agreement that we negotiated in October to expedite whatever they can. So they both have the parent company, Westinghouse in both penalties if they don't do things on time, and there are significant bonus incentives if they do finish on time. So they've got as much incentive as we could possibly put into an agreement.

I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. GAAP earnings in the fourth quarter of 2015 were $0.69 per share compared to $0.73 per share in the same quarter of 2014. The decrease in earnings in",2255,"Thanks, Susan, and thank you, all, for joining us today. 
I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. GAAP earnings in the fourth quarter of 2015 were $0.69 per share compared to $0.73 per share in the same quarter of 2014. The decrease in earnings in the fourth quarter is mainly attributable to the negative impact of weather on electric margins as well as on gas margins in our Georgia business. Lower gas margins also reflect $0.07 per share of lost margins due to the sale of CGT early in the year. These losses were partially offset by higher electric margins due primarily to a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth as well as lower depreciation expense as a result of a new depreciation study and lower O&M expense due primarily to labor savings and the impact of the sales of CGT during the first quarter of 2015. 
Note, too, that abnormal weather decreased electric margins by $0.14 per share and $0.02 per share versus normal in the fourth quarters of 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
Please turn to Slide 4. Earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2015, were $5.22 versus $3.79 in 2014. The improved results were mainly attributable to the net-of-tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI; higher electric margins, due primarily to a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth; as well as lower depreciation expense and O&M as described earlier. These were partially offset by lower electric margins due to weather; lower gas margins, primarily due to lost gas margins of $0.23 per share resulting from the sale of CGT; and the impact of abnormal weather on the Georgia business; and normal increases in CapEx-related items, including interest, property taxes and share dilution. 
Although electric margins reflected a negative $0.13 per share due to weather year-over-year, abnormal weather increased electric margins in both years, accounting for $0.08 per share in 2015 compared to $0.21 in 2014. 
Slide 5 shows earnings on a GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized basis. Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2015 were $0.83 per share compared to $0.75 per share in the same quarter of 2014. Full year earnings were $3.73 per share in 2015, compared to $3.58 per share in the prior year. As a reminder, GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized EPS excludes the impact of abnormal weather on electric margins and the net-of-tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI from the first quarter of 2015. 
Abnormal weather on gas margins is not adjusted in this measure, as gas margins are weather-normalized for the North and South Carolina businesses, and the direct impact of abnormal weather on the Georgia business is generally insignificant. However, the extremely mild weather in the fourth quarter of 2015 was seen in that business' standalone results as I'll discuss later. 
Now on Slide 6, I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. On a GAAP basis, South Carolina Electric & Gas Company's fourth quarter 2015 earnings were down $0.01 per share compared to the same period of 2014. The decrease in earnings is due to lower electric margins due to abnormal weather and higher expenses related to our capital program, including interest expense and property taxes. These decreases more than offset increases due to the continued recovery of financing costs through the BLRA, customer growth in both the electric and gas businesses, the application of the previously mentioned new depreciation rates and lower O&M due primarily to labor savings. 
For the full year 2015, earnings were higher by $0.12 per share due to increased electric margins, primarily from the continued recovery of financing costs through the BLRA and customer growth, improved gas margins due to a customer growth and the application of new depreciation rates. These items were partially offset by the effective abnormal weather on electric margins and higher expenses related to our capital program, including interest expense, property taxes, dilution and continued increases in depreciation exclusive of the impact of the depreciation study. 
Although weather in both years contributed favorably to electric margins versus normal, 2015 was milder than 2014, with weather contributing $0.08 of margin versus normal in 2015 compared to $0.21 in 2014. 
PSNC Energy reported earnings of $0.17 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $0.16 per share in the same quarter of the prior year, primarily due to higher margins from customer growth. For the year ended December 2015, earnings are $0.38 per share compared to $0.39 per share in the prior year. 
SCANA Energy, our retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia showed a decrease in the fourth quarter earnings of $0.06 per share in 2015 over the same quarter of last year, primarily due to lower throughput and margins attributable to the extremely warm weather during the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to 2014, partially offset by lower bad debt expense. 
For the 12 months ended December 31, 2015, earnings were down $0.05 per share compared to the same period of 2014 due to the same drivers as the quarter. 
On a GAAP basis, SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported a loss of $0.01 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $0.03 in the comparative quarter of the prior year. Lower interest expense at the holding company and increased margins at our marketing business were primarily offset by foregone earnings contributions from the subsidiaries that were sold during the fourth quarter of this year. 
For the 12-month period, these businesses reported earnings per share of $1.36 in 2015 compared to $0.01 loss in 2014. Excluding the net-of-tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI of $1.41 per share, GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized EPS was down $0.04 from the prior year due primarily to foregone earnings from the sale of the businesses earlier this year, offset by lower interest expense at the holding company and increased margins on our marketing business. 
I would now like to touch on economic trends in our service territory on Slide 7. In 2015, the company has announced plans to invest over $2 billion with the expectation of creating over 6,000 jobs in our Carolinas territories. The Carolinas continue to be seen as a favorable business environment, and we're pleased by the continuous growth in our service territories. 
At the bottom of the slide, you can see the national unemployment rate along with the rates for the 3 states, where SCANA has a presence and the SCE&G electric territory. South Carolina's unemployment rate is now at 5.5%, and the rate in SCE&G's electric territory is estimated at 4.7%. 
At the top of Slide 8, you can see the South Carolina employment statistics as of December 2015 and 2014. Over the course of 2015, South Carolina's unemployment rate has dropped over a percentage point from its level at the end of 2014. December of 2015 also marked all-time highs for the number of South Carolinians employed and in the labor force. 
Of particular interest and attesting to our state's strong economic growth, almost 80,000 or 3.8% more South Carolinians are working today than a year ago. Said another way, had the labor force not increased during 2015, the unemployment rate would be approximately 3%. 
The expansion of the labor force is simply evidence of the confidence of some of the workforce to reenter the market and the positive migration to the state of Carolina. 
As depicted on the bottom of the slide, United Van Lines recently released its annual movers study for 2015, which tracks migration patterns state to state. For the third consecutive year, South Carolina finished ranked second in terms of domestic migration destinations, corroborating our realized customer gross statistics. North Carolina has also been ranked in the top 5 for the last 3 years. 
Slide 9 presents customer growth and electric sales statistics. On the top half of the slide is the customer growth rate for each of our regulated businesses. SCE&G's electric business added customers at a year-over-year rate of 1.5%. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina added customers at a rate of 2.5% and 2.7%, respectively. We continue to see very strong customer growth in our businesses and in the region. 
The bottom table outlines our actual and weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales for the 12 months ended December 31, 2015. Overall, weather-normalized total retail sales are up 1.3% on a 12-month ended basis. 
In conjunction with the continued improvement of economic conditions in South Carolina, the past 2 quarters have shown an accelerating improvement in usage in the residential market. 
And now please turn to Slide 10, which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $9.6 billion. As denoted in the 2 shades of blue, approximately 86% of this rate base is related to the electric business. In the block on the right, you will see SCE&G's base electric business, in which we're allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The earned return for the 12 months ended December 31, 2015, in the base electric business is approximately 9.75%, meeting our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA-related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. We continue to be pleased with the execution of our strategy. 
As a reminder, we're allowed a return on equity of 10.25% and 10.6% in our LDCs in South and North Carolina, respectively. In responsible -- in response to the normal attrition in the earned returns in our North Carolina business, yesterday, PSNC notified the North Carolina Utilities Commission of its intention to file a rate case. We plan to file the detailed case within the next 60 days, where more clarity will be provided. 
As you will recall, in South Carolina, if the earned ROE of the gas business for the 12 months ending in March falls outside a range of 50 basis points above or below the allowed ROE, then we will file to adjust rates under the Rate Stabilization Act in June. 
Slide 11 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast reflects the company's current estimate of new nuclear spending through 2018 and has been updated to reflect what was filed in our quarterly BLRA report, which also reflects the amended EPC that was announced in October of 2015. 
At the bottom of the slide, we will recap the estimated new nuclear CWIP from July 1 through June 30, to correspond to the periods on which the BLRA rate increases are historically calculated. 
Slide 12 presents the transition payments information and an expected timeframe for our filing with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina. Once these events are complete, we will update the CapEx schedule and the corresponding financing plan. 
And now please turn to Slide 13 to review our estimated financing plan through 2018. As a reminder, we have switched to open market purchases instead of issuing new shares to fulfill our 401(k) and DRIP plans, at least until we have fully utilized the net cash proceeds from the sales of CGT and SCI. We do not anticipate the need for further equity issuances until 2017, and again, the election of the fixed-price option would likely changed planned equity issuances after 2016. 
While these are our best estimates of incremental debt and equity issuances, it is unlikely that these issuances will occur in the exact amounts or timing as presented, as they're subject to changes in our funding needs for planned project expenses. We continue to adjust the financing to match the related project CapEx on a 50-50 debt and equity basis. 
On Slide 14, we are reaffirming our 2016 GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized earnings guidance as $3.90 per share to $4.10 per share with an internal target of $4 per share. We continue to be cautiously optimistic about our long-term view and are increasing the lower band of our long-term growth rate from 3% to 4%. We are also resetting our base year to 2015 GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized EPS of $3.73. 
Therefore, our new GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized annual growth guidance target will be to deliver 4% to 6% earnings growth over the 3 to 5 years using a base of 2015 GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized EPS of $3.73. This increase represents our projected earnings momentum driven by our BLRA filings, our stated goal to manage base retail electric returns and our view of the economy, balanced with our continued assumption of the impacts of energy conservation and efficiency standards. 
I also wanted to mention that earlier today, we announced an increase of $0.12 in our annual dividend rate for 2016 to $2.30 per share, a 5.5% increase. We continue to anticipate growing dividends fairly consistent with the earnings while staying within our stated payout policy of 55% to 60%. 
And finally, on Slide 15, we are very pleased to report that in late December, we successfully completed the syndication of an expanded and extended credit facility. The additional liquidity is important to our nuclear construction project and accelerated CapEx spending at PSNC. The committed lines of credit now totaled $2 billion. 
I would like to thank our banks for their enthusiastic support of our liquidity needs and, therefore, the support of our nuclear expansion plans. We are pleased that we continue to receive an excellent response for our nuclear construction from our equity and debt investors as well as our banks. And I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project."

Slide 16 presents the outline we have shown in previous discussions as a recap. 
As you maybe aware, Westinghouse closed on the transaction to acquire Stone & Webster from CB&I at the end of December, and Fluor began work as a subcontracted construction manager in the new nuclear construction site on January 4. We continue our analysis of the fixed-price option, and we'll include input from Fluor as they progress. 
As a reminder, we have until November 1 of this year to unilaterally elect the fixed-price option or not, and we plan to take as much time as needed to ensure that we make the most prudent decision. Regardless of which scenario we choose, once a decision has been made, we will file a petition with the Public Service Commission to amend the capital cost and schedule for the project. As Jimmy said earlier, we expect to reach a conclusion in the second quarter. 
Moving on to some of the activities at the new nuclear construction site. Slide 17 presents an aerial photo of the site from September of 2015. I provided this photo to give you a view of the layout of the site, and I've labeled both Units 2 and 3, as well as many other areas that make up what we call a tabletop. 
On Slide 18, you can see a picture of the Unit 2 nuclear island. In this picture, you can see module CA20 on the right hand side of the slide off the containment vessel #1, which was placed on and welded to the lower bowl. Several of the large structural modules have now been placed inside the Unit 2 containment vessel. As we will discuss shortly, you can also see the beginnings of the shield building as 3 courses have now been placed. 
Slide 19 shows a picture of the Unit 3 nuclear island. Module CA-04 was placed inside the containment vessel lower bowl back in June, and Auxiliary Building wall has continued to go over. As you'll see shortly, we are making progress with the fabrication and placement of containment vessel structural modules on both units. 
Slide 20 presents a schematic view of the 5 large structural modules that are located inside the containment vessel. I've shown this schematic numerous times before because this expanded view gives you a better feel for how CA-01 through -05 fits spatially inside the containment vessel. As you may know, we've now placed CA-01, CA-04 and CA-05 for Unit 2 and CA-04 for Unit 3. 
Slide 21 shows a picture of the Unit 2 CA-02 module. CA-02 is a wall section that forms part of the in-containment refueling water storage tank. As mentioned last quarter, CA-02 is now structurally complete and awaiting installation. 
Slide 22 shows a picture of the Unit 2 CA-03, which is the west wall of the in-containment refueling water storage tank. 15 of CA-03's 17 submodules are on-site, and 12 are now on their assembly platform. 
Slide 23 shows a picture of the Unit 3 module CA-05. This module comprises one of the major wall sections within the containment vessel. Fabrication on the Unit 3 CA-05 has been completed and has been staged outside the modular assembly building or MAB. 
Slide 24 shows a picture of the Unit 3 CA20, which is the auxiliary building module that will be located outside and adjacent to the containment vessel. 68 of the 72 submodules are on-site, and 20 of those submodules have been upended on the construction platform or [indiscernible] for fabrication in the MAB. 
Slide 25 shows a picture of the beginnings of the Unit 3 module CA-01. Module CA-01 houses the steam generators and the pressurizer and forms a fueling canal inside the containment vessel. Currently, we have 15 of 47 submodules on-site, and 3 of those submodules are upright and being welded together in the MAB. 
Slide 26 shows the progress of the placement of the Unit 2 shield building panels. The first 6-panel course was placed during the first half of 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the second 6-panel course was set on top of the first course, and at the beginning of this month, we placed the third 6-panel course. As the shield building panels are placed and welded together, concrete is poured inside the panels to create the shield building. Concrete has been placed in the first 2 courses. 
Slide 27 shows a couple of pictures from the Unit 2 turbine pedestal concrete placement from December of 2015. Overall, more than 2,300 cubic areas of concrete was placed over the course of about 20 hours. 
Slide 28 shows a picture of the single phase for the 230-ton Unit 2 main transformers. There are 4 such transformers for each unit, and here you can see one of the 4 being rigged for placement adjacent to the Unit 2 turbine building. Each unit will have these 4 plus 6 other transformers. All 10 have been placed for Unit 2, and all 10 have been received for Unit 3. 
On Slide 29, you see the new nuclear CapEx actual and projected over the life of the construction. This chart shows CWIP during the years 2008 to 2020, reflecting the Q4 of 2015 BLRA quarterly report that we filed in February. As a reminder, the BLRA report now reflects the cost from the October 2015 amended EPC. As you can see, we are currently in the middle of the peak nuclear construction period. The green line represents the related actual and projected customer rate increases under the BLRA and is associated with the right-hand access. 
Please now turn to Slide 30. As we mentioned during our third quarter call in September, the PSC approved a rate increase of $64.5 million. The new rates were effective for bills rendered on or after October 30. Our BLRA filings for 2016 are showed at the bottom of the slide, and as you can see, we recently filed our quarterly status report for the fourth quarter, and our next quarterly update we filed in mid-May. Not depicted here is the update filing I addressed earlier as timing of that petition isn't yet known. 
Finally, I wanted to mention the results of an analysis performed at the direction of the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff. As you maybe aware, the ORS contracted an independent accounting firm to determine whether the revised rates provision under the Base Load Review Act is cost beneficial to SCE&G customers, consistent with our claims. This independent attestation concluded in January and reaffirmed the significant cost advantage of the BLRA as envisioned when the law was originally passed. This report is available on the ORS' website, and the link to the independent accounting firms report can be found in the regulatory document section of the nuclear development area of SCANA's investor website. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now be glad to respond to any questions you might have."

We've been tracking the situation at Toshiba, obviously a very large company, and I think the Japanese government would love to see them fail, but they did -- they have submitted obviously restructuring plan.

Also, we are glad to see that with the significant changes in leadership in the board at Toshiba that the person that we have been largely dealing with in the nuclear arena survived that turmoil, and again we think that's a good thing. And I do believe that Toshiba has been successful at securing some debt from some large Japanese banks just recently. Bankruptcy also doesn't necessarily mean that things would stop. There are various kinds of bankruptcies, not that we think it'll get to that point, but it doesn't necessarily mean things at the site will stop. In addition to the sort of the financial protections that Jimmy just alluded to, we did actually forecast a situation like this back when we were negotiating the EPC contract. It's not necessarily that we thought that the larger corporation, Toshiba, might have financial difficulties, but we're really focusing on perhaps the smaller corporations like Westinghouse and/or Shaw might have some physical difficulties. So we do have in the contracts some provisions to escrow intellectual properties such that if there were to be a secession of operations by the contractor that we could finish the plant on our own."

The biggest issue that we had really was that we anticipated that the fit up of this first of a kind item, taking these individual panels that come from Newport News Industrial or N&I and then putting them together at the site, welding them up within the tolerances and filling them with concrete was going to be very difficult. We've done a lot of mock-ups. We received our half the panels for the first unit and maybe a 25% for the second unit. The placement so far I could categorize is going a little better than we had anticipated, and so we've got 16 courses of steel panels that go in a ring that we eventually will fill with concrete. We've placed the first 3 of those courses already. The first 2 have been welded, fit and fixed the concrete in. And the third, the third course we recently placed. So we're welding that. But again, that's going, I think, better than we had anticipated. So now our focus instead is the critical path is ensuring that we get these submodules, the pieces, the panels from NNI in a timely fashion, and so Westinghouse has taken over the contract that CB&I used to have. So that's now exclusively a Westinghouse to NNI deal, if we think it's good, and then their delivery schedule looks to be good, and they're negotiating a mitigation strategy and, in fact, I'll be going to NNI tomorrow to talk through the mitigation strategy that will accelerate some of those panel deliveries to the side. So I think the shield-building, right now,   it's going pretty well, but it is our focus area because it is a critical path."

They are not necessarily dependent on the shield building, but they would come in right in line after the shield building. So once we demonstrate proficiency with shield building, then you focus on whatever's next. So we're always looking at primary, secondary, tertiary critical paths. So the secondary critical path is, as you mentioned, CA20, the trailing unit, Unit 3. We've already set CA20 for Unit 2, obviously. And we did come up with interesting mitigation strategy for the CA20 module, whereas on the first unit, on Unit 2, we set it as one piece. On the second one, we're going to set it in 2 halves. So that will save us probably a couple of months in the fabrication, and that's important because it actually forms a part of the concrete form work for the rest of the plan. So it's important that we set that -- that half of that and use it as a form concrete while we're working on the second half, then set the second half. So as of right now, I thought that, that was -- the team on site came up with that plan. We're executing on that plan, and we ought to set that at first half, CA20, for the second unit in Q1 -- late Q1, and then we should set the second half of CA20 for Unit 3, probably early in Q2."

Toshiba obviously has all the incentive in the world under the agreement that we negotiated in October to expedite whatever they can. So they both have -- since the parent company is Westinghouse, there is sort of both penalties if they don't do things on time, and there are significant bonus incentives if they do finish on time. So they've got as much incentive as we could possibly put into an agreement. So we'll look to accelerate the schedule for the modules coming out of Japan for CA-01, and we're implementing a strategy to switch CA20, set it in 2 halves instead of one large piece, the CA20 portion."

The decrease in earnings in",2257,"Thanks, Susan, and thank you, all, for joining us today. 
I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. GAAP earnings in the fourth quarter of 2015 were $0.69 per share compared to $0.73 per share in the same quarter of 2014. The decrease in earnings in the fourth quarter is mainly attributable to the negative impact of weather on electric margins as well as on gas margins in our Georgia business. Lower gas margins also reflect $0.07 per share of lost margins due to the sale of CGT early in the year. These losses were partially offset by higher electric margins due primarily to a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth as well as lower depreciation expense as a result of a new depreciation study and lower O&M expense due primarily to labor savings and the impact of the sales of CGT during the first quarter of 2015. 
Note, too, that abnormal weather decreased electric margins by $0.14 per share and $0.02 per share versus normal in the fourth quarters of 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
Please turn to Slide 4. Earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2015, were $5.22 versus $3.79 in 2014. The improved results were mainly attributable to the net-of-tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI; higher electric margins, due primarily to a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth; as well as lower depreciation expense and O&M as described earlier. These were partially offset by lower electric margins due to weather; lower gas margins, primarily due to lost gas margins of $0.23 per share resulting from the sale of CGT; and the impact of abnormal weather on the Georgia business; and normal increases in CapEx-related items, including interest, property taxes and share dilution. 
Although electric margins reflected a negative $0.13 per share due to weather year-over-year, abnormal weather increased electric margins in both years, accounting for $0.08 per share in 2015 compared to $0.21 in 2014. 
Slide 5 shows earnings on a GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized basis. Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2015 were $0.83 per share compared to $0.75 per share in the same quarter of 2014. Full year earnings were $3.73 per share in 2015, compared to $3.58 per share in the prior year. As a reminder, GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized EPS excludes the impact of abnormal weather on electric margins and the net-of-tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI from the first quarter of 2015. 
Abnormal weather on gas margins is not adjusted in this measure, as gas margins are weather-normalized for the North and South Carolina businesses, and the direct impact of abnormal weather on the Georgia business is generally insignificant. However, the extremely mild weather in the fourth quarter of 2015 was seen in that business' standalone results as I'll discuss later. 
Now on Slide 6, I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. On a GAAP basis, South Carolina Electric & Gas Company's fourth quarter 2015 earnings were down $0.01 per share compared to the same period of 2014. The decrease in earnings is due to lower electric margins due to abnormal weather and higher expenses related to our capital program, including interest expense and property taxes. These decreases more than offset increases due to the continued recovery of financing costs through the BLRA, customer growth in both the electric and gas businesses, the application of the previously mentioned new depreciation rates and lower O&M due primarily to labor savings. 
For the full year 2015, earnings were higher by $0.12 per share due to increased electric margins, primarily from the continued recovery of financing costs through the BLRA and customer growth, improved gas margins due to a customer growth and the application of new depreciation rates. These items were partially offset by the effect of abnormal weather on electric margins and higher expenses related to our capital program, including interest expense, property taxes, dilution and continued increases in depreciation exclusive of the impact of the depreciation study. 
Although weather in both years contributed favorably to electric margins versus normal, 2015 was milder than 2014, with weather contributing $0.08 of margin versus normal in 2015 compared to $0.21 in 2014. 
PSNC Energy reported earnings of $0.17 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $0.16 per share in the same quarter of the prior year, primarily due to higher margins from customer growth. For the year ended December 2015, earnings are $0.38 per share compared to $0.39 per share in the prior year. 
SCANA Energy, our retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia showed a decrease in the fourth quarter earnings of $0.06 per share in 2015 over the same quarter of last year, primarily due to lower throughput and margins attributable to the extremely warm weather during the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to 2014, partially offset by lower bad debt expense. 
For the 12 months ended December 31, 2015, earnings were down $0.05 per share compared to the same period of 2014 due to the same drivers as the quarter. 
On a GAAP basis, SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported a loss of $0.01 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $0.03 in the comparative quarter of the prior year. Lower interest expense at the holding company and increased margins in our marketing business were primarily offset by foregone earnings contributions from the subsidiaries that were sold during the fourth quarter of this year. 
For the 12-month period, these businesses reported earnings per share of $1.36 in 2015 compared to $0.01 loss in 2014. Excluding the net-of-tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI of $1.41 per share, GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized EPS was down $0.04 from the prior year due primarily to foregone earnings from the sale of the businesses earlier this year, offset by lower interest expense at the holding company and increased margins on our marketing business. 
I would now like to touch on economic trends in our service territory on Slide 7. In 2015, the company has announced plans to invest over $2 billion with the expectation of creating over 6,000 jobs in our Carolinas territories. The Carolinas continue to be seen as a favorable business environment, and we're pleased by the continuous growth in our service territories. 
At the bottom of the slide, you can see the national unemployment rate along with the rates for the 3 states, where SCANA has a presence and the SCE&G electric territory. South Carolina's unemployment rate is now at 5.5%, and the rate in SCE&G's electric territory is estimated at 4.7%. 
At the top of Slide 8, you can see the South Carolina employment statistics as of December 2015 and 2014. Over the course of 2015, South Carolina's unemployment rate has dropped over a percentage point from its level at the end of 2014. December of 2015 also marked all-time highs for the number of South Carolinians employed and in the labor force. 
Of particular interest and attesting to our state's strong economic growth, almost 80,000 or 3.8% more South Carolinians are working today than a year ago. Said another way, had the labor force not increased during 2015, the unemployment rate would be approximately 3%. 
The expansion of the labor force is simply evidence of the confidence of some of the workforce to reenter the market and the positive migration to the state of Carolina. 
As depicted on the bottom of the slide, United Van Lines recently released its annual movers study for 2015, which tracks migration patterns state to state. For the third consecutive year, South Carolina finished ranked second in terms of domestic migration destinations, corroborating our realized customer gross statistics. North Carolina has also been ranked in the top 5 for the last 3 years. 
Slide 9 presents customer growth and electric sales statistics. On the top half of the slide is the customer growth rate for each of our regulated businesses. SCE&G's electric business added customers at a year-over-year rate of 1.5%. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina added customers at a rate of 2.5% and 2.7%, respectively. We continue to see very strong customer growth in our businesses and in the region. 
The bottom table outlines our actual and weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales for the 12 months ended December 31, 2015. Overall, weather-normalized total retail sales are up 1.3% on a 12-month ended basis. 
In conjunction with the continued improvement of economic conditions in South Carolina, the past 2 quarters have shown an accelerating improvement in usage in the residential market. 
And now please turn to Slide 10, which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $9.6 billion. As denoted in the 2 shades of blue, approximately 86% of this rate base is related to the electric business. In the block on the right, you will see SCE&G's base electric business, in which we're allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The earned return for the 12 months ended December 31, 2015, in the base electric business is approximately 9.75%, meeting our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA-related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. We continue to be pleased with the execution of our strategy. 
As a reminder, we're allowed a return on equity of 10.25% and 10.6% in our LDCs in South and North Carolina, respectively. In responsible -- in response to the normal attrition in the earned returns in our North Carolina business, yesterday, PSNC notified the North Carolina Utilities Commission of its intention to file a rate case. We plan to file the detailed case within the next 60 days, where more clarity will be provided. 
As you will recall, in South Carolina, if the earned ROE of the gas business for the 12 months ending in March falls outside a range of 50 basis points above or below the allowed ROE, then we will file to adjust rates under the Rate Stabilization Act in June. 
Slide 11 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast reflects the company's current estimate of new nuclear spending through 2018 and has been updated to reflect what was filed in our quarterly BLRA report, which also reflects the amended EPC that was announced in October of 2015. 
At the bottom of the slide, we will recap the estimated new nuclear CWIP from July 1 through June 30, to correspond to the periods on which the BLRA rate increases are historically calculated. 
Slide 12 presents the transition payments information and an expected timeframe for our filing with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina. Once these events are complete, we will update the CapEx schedule and the corresponding financing plan. 
And now please turn to Slide 13 to review our estimated financing plan through 2018. As a reminder, we have switched to open market purchases instead of issuing new shares to fulfill our 401(k) and DRIP plans, at least until we have fully utilized the net cash proceeds from the sales of CGT and SCI. We do not anticipate the need for further equity issuances until 2017, and again, the election of the fixed-price option would likely changed planned equity issuances after 2016. 
While these are our best estimates of incremental debt and equity issuances, it is unlikely that these issuances will occur in the exact amounts or timing as presented, as they are subject to changes in our funding needs for planned project expenses. We continue to adjust the financing to match the related project CapEx on a 50-50 debt and equity basis. 
On Slide 14, we are reaffirming our 2016 GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized earnings guidance as $3.90 per share to $4.10 per share with an internal target of $4 per share. We continue to be cautiously optimistic about our long-term view and are increasing the lower band of our long-term growth rate from 3% to 4%. We are also resetting our base year to 2015 GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized EPS of $3.73. 
Therefore, our new GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized annual growth guidance target will be to deliver 4% to 6% earnings growth over the 3 to 5 years using a base of 2015 GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized EPS of $3.73. This increase represents our projected earnings momentum driven by our BLRA filings, our stated goal to manage base retail electric returns and our view of the economy, balanced with our continued assumption of the impacts of energy conservation and efficiency standards. 
I also wanted to mention that earlier today, we announced an increase of $0.12 in our annual dividend rate for 2016 to $2.30 per share, a 5.5% increase. We continue to anticipate growing dividends fairly consistent with the earnings while staying within our stated payout policy of 55% to 60%. 
And finally, on Slide 15, we are very pleased to report that in late December, we successfully completed the syndication of an expanded and extended credit facility. The additional liquidity is important to our nuclear construction project and accelerated CapEx spending at PSNC. The committed lines of credit now total $2 billion. 
I would like to thank our banks for their enthusiastic support of our liquidity needs and, therefore, the support of our nuclear expansion plans. We are pleased that we continue to receive an excellent response for our nuclear construction from our equity and debt investors as well as our banks. And I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project."

Slide 16 presents the outline we have shown in previous discussions as a recap. 
As you may be aware, Westinghouse closed on the transaction to acquire Stone & Webster from CB&I at the end of December, and Fluor began work as a subcontracted construction manager in the new nuclear construction site on January 4. We continue our analysis of the fixed-price option, and we'll include input from Fluor as they progress. 
As a reminder, we have until November 1 of this year to unilaterally elect the fixed-price option or not, and we plan to take as much time as needed to ensure that we make the most prudent decision. Regardless of which scenario we choose, once a decision has been made, we will file a petition with the Public Service Commission to amend the capital cost and schedule for the project. As Jimmy said earlier, we expect to reach a conclusion in the second quarter. 
Moving on to some of the activities at the new nuclear construction site. Slide 17 presents an aerial photo of the site from September of 2015. I provided this photo to give you a view of the layout of the site, and I've labeled both Units 2 and 3, as well as many other areas that make up what we call a tabletop. 
On Slide 18, you can see a picture of the Unit 2 nuclear island. In this picture, you can see module CA20 on the right hand side of the slide along with containment vessel ring #1, which was placed on and welded to the lower bowl. Several of the large structural modules have now been placed inside the Unit 2 containment vessel. As we will discuss shortly, you can also see the beginnings of the shield building as 3 courses have now been placed. 
Slide 19 shows a picture of the Unit 3 nuclear island. Module CA-04 was placed inside the containment vessel lower bowl back in June, and Auxiliary Building walls continue to go good [ph]. As you'll see shortly, we are making progress with the fabrication and placement of containment vessel structural modules on both units. 
Slide 20 presents a schematic view of the 5 large structural modules that are located inside the containment vessel. I've shown this schematic numerous times before because this expanded view gives you a better feel for how CA-01 through -05 fits spatially inside the containment vessel. As you may know, we've now placed CA-01, CA-04 and CA-05 for Unit 2 and CA-04 for Unit 3. 
Slide 21 shows a picture of the Unit 2 CA-02 module. CA-02 is a wall section that forms part of the in-containment refueling water storage tank. As mentioned last quarter, CA-02 is now structurally complete and awaiting installation. 
Slide 22 shows a picture of the Unit 2 CA-03, which is the west wall of the in-containment refueling water storage tank. 15 of CA-03's 17 submodules are on-site, and 12 are now on their assembly platform. 
Slide 23 shows a picture of the Unit 3 module CA-05. This module comprises one of the major wall sections within the containment vessel. Fabrication on the Unit 3 CA-05 has been completed and has been staged outside the modular assembly building or MAB. 
Slide 24 shows a picture of the Unit 3 CA20, which is the auxiliary building module that will be located outside and adjacent to the containment vessel. 68 of the 72 submodules are on-site, and 20 of those submodules have been upended on the construction platform, or plattened [ph], for fabrication in the MAB. 
Slide 25 shows a picture of the beginnings of the Unit 3 module CA-01. Module CA-01 houses the steam generators and the pressurizer and forms a fueling canal inside the containment vessel. Currently, we have 15 of 47 submodules on-site, and 3 of those submodules are upright and being welded together in the MAB. 
Slide 26 shows the progress of the placement of the Unit 2 shield building panels. The first 6-panel course was placed during the first half of 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the second 6-panel course was set on top of the first course, and at the beginning of this month, we placed the third 6-panel course. As the shield building panels are placed and welded together, concrete is poured inside the panels to create the shield building. Concrete has been placed in the first 2 courses. 
Slide 27 shows a couple of pictures from the Unit 2 turbine pedestal concrete placement from December of 2015. Overall, more than 2,300 cubic yards of concrete was placed over the course of about 20 hours. 
Slide 28 shows a picture of the single phase for the 230-ton Unit 2 main transformers. There are 4 such transformers for each unit, and here you can see one of the 4 being rigged for placement adjacent to the Unit 2 turbine building. Each unit will have these 4 plus 6 other transformers. All 10 have been placed for Unit 2, and all 10 have been received for Unit 3. 
On Slide 29, you see the new nuclear CapEx actual and projected over the life of the construction. This chart shows CWIP during the years 2008 to 2020, reflecting the Q4 of 2015 BLRA quarterly report that we filed in February. As a reminder, the BLRA report now reflects the cost from the October 2015 amended EPC. As you can see, we are currently in the middle of the peak nuclear construction period. The green line represents the related actual and projected customer rate increases under the BLRA and is associated with the right-hand axis. 
Please now turn to Slide 30. As we mentioned during our third quarter call in September, the PSC approved a rate increase of $64.5 million. The new rates were effective for bills rendered on or after October 30. Our BLRA filings for 2016 are showed at the bottom of the slide, and as you can see, we recently filed our quarterly status report for the fourth quarter, and our next quarterly update we filed in mid-May. Not depicted here is the update filing I addressed earlier as timing of that petition isn't yet known. 
Finally, I wanted to mention the results of an analysis performed at the direction of the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff. As you maybe aware, the ORS contracted an independent accounting firm to determine whether the revised rates provision under the Base Load Review Act is cost beneficial to SCE&G customers, consistent with our claims. This independent attestation concluded in January and reaffirmed the significant cost advantage of the BLRA as envisioned when the law was originally passed. This report is available on the ORS' website, and the link to the independent accounting firms report can be found in the regulatory document section of the nuclear development area of SCANA's investor website. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now be glad to respond to any questions you might have."

Those should be finished shortly. We had cone pumps. Those are domestic, but those won't show up until 2017. That's most of the major stuff. 
Now when we get into submodules, we still have some of the submodules for the structural modules, particularly for the trailing unit, Unit 3, that are still in fabrication. And so, for example, CA01 is being fabricated between Toshiba in Japan and IHI in Japan. There are 47 different submodules that are associated with that unit. 15 have been delivered, 15 of the 47; 7 have shipped. It just takes a while for them to get here, and so 25 are yet to be shipped. So we've got almost half of those are either on-site or on the ocean.

Also, we are glad to see that with the significant changes in leadership and the board at Toshiba that the person that we have been largely dealing with in the nuclear arena survived that turmoil, and again we think that's a good thing. And I do believe that Toshiba has been successful at securing some debt from some large Japanese banks just recently. Bankruptcy also doesn't necessarily mean that things would stop. There are various kinds of bankruptcies, not that we think it'll get to that point, but it doesn't necessarily mean things at the site will stop. In addition to the sort of the financial protections that Jimmy just alluded to, we did actually forecast a situation like this back when we were negotiating the EPC contract.

So we do have in the contracts some provisions to escrow intellectual property such that if there were to be a cessation of operations by the contractor that we could finish the plant on our own."

The biggest issue that we had really was that they had anticipated that the fit up of this first of a kind item, taking these individual panels that come from Newport News Industrial, or NNI, and then putting them together at the site, welding them up within the tolerances and filling them with concrete was going to be very difficult. We've done a lot of mock-ups. We received probably half the panels for the first unit and maybe a 25% for the second unit. The placement so far I could categorize is going a little better than we had anticipated, and so we've got 16 courses of steel panels that go in a ring that we eventually will fill with concrete. We've placed the first 3 of those courses already. The first 2 have been welded, fit and the concrete in. And the third, the third course we recently placed. So we're welding that. But again, that's going, I think, better than we had anticipated. So now our focus, since that is the critical path is ensuring that we get these submodules, the pieces, the panels from NNI in a timely fashion, and so Westinghouse has taken over the contract that CB&I used to have. So that's now exclusively a Westinghouse to NNI deal, which we think it's good. And then their delivery schedule looks to be good, and they're negotiating a mitigation strategy and, in fact, I'll be going to NNI tomorrow to talk through the mitigation strategy that will accelerate some of those panel deliveries to the site. So I think the shield-building, right now, it's going pretty well, but it is our focus area because it is a critical path."

So once we demonstrate proficiency with shield building, then you focus on whatever's next. So we're always looking at primary, secondary, tertiary critical paths. So the secondary critical path is, as you mentioned, that CA20 module for the trailing unit, Unit 3. We've already set CA20 for Unit 2, obviously. And we did come up with interesting mitigation strategy for the CA20 module, whereas on the first unit, on Unit 2, we set it as one piece. On the second one, we're going to set it in 2 halves. So that will save us probably a couple of months in the fabrication, and that's important because it actually forms a part of the concrete form work for the rest of the plan. So it's important that we set that -- that half of that and use it as a form concrete while we're working on the second half, then set the second half. So as of right now, I thought that, that was -- the team on site came up with that plan. We're executing on that plan, and we ought to set that at first half, CA20, for the second unit in Q1 -- late Q1, and then we should set the second half of CA20 for Unit 3, probably early in Q2."

Toshiba obviously has all the incentive in the world under the agreement that we negotiated in October to expedite whatever they can. So they both have -- since their the parent company of Westinghouse, so there are both penalties if they don't do things on time, and there are significant bonus incentives if they do finish on time. So they've got as much incentive as we could possibly put into an agreement.

I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. GAAP earnings in the fourth quarter of 2015 were $0.69 per share compared to $0.73 per share in the same quarter of 2014. The decrease in earnings in",2257,"Thanks, Susan, and thank you, all, for joining us today. 
I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. GAAP earnings in the fourth quarter of 2015 were $0.69 per share compared to $0.73 per share in the same quarter of 2014. The decrease in earnings in the fourth quarter is mainly attributable to the negative impact of weather on electric margins as well as on gas margins in our Georgia business. Lower gas margins also reflect $0.07 per share of lost margins due to the sale of CGT early in the year. These losses were partially offset by higher electric margins due primarily to a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth as well as lower depreciation expense as a result of a new depreciation study and lower O&M expense due primarily to labor savings and the impact of the sales of CGT during the first quarter of 2015. 
Note, too, that abnormal weather decreased electric margins by $0.14 per share and $0.02 per share versus normal in the fourth quarters of 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
Please turn to Slide 4. Earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2015, were $5.22 versus $3.79 in 2014. The improved results were mainly attributable to the net-of-tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI; higher electric margins, due primarily to a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth; as well as lower depreciation expense and O&M as described earlier. These were partially offset by lower electric margins due to weather; lower gas margins, primarily due to lost gas margins of $0.23 per share resulting from the sale of CGT; and the impact of abnormal weather on the Georgia business; and normal increases in CapEx-related items, including interest, property taxes and share dilution. 
Although electric margins reflected a negative $0.13 per share due to weather year-over-year, abnormal weather increased electric margins in both years, accounting for $0.08 per share in 2015 compared to $0.21 in 2014. 
Slide 5 shows earnings on a GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized basis. Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2015 were $0.83 per share compared to $0.75 per share in the same quarter of 2014. Full year earnings were $3.73 per share in 2015, compared to $3.58 per share in the prior year. As a reminder, GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized EPS excludes the impact of abnormal weather on electric margins and the net-of-tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI from the first quarter of 2015. 
Abnormal weather on gas margins is not adjusted in this measure, as gas margins are weather-normalized for the North and South Carolina businesses, and the direct impact of abnormal weather on the Georgia business is generally insignificant. However, the extremely mild weather in the fourth quarter of 2015 was seen in that business' standalone results as I'll discuss later. 
Now on Slide 6, I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. On a GAAP basis, South Carolina Electric & Gas Company's fourth quarter 2015 earnings were down $0.01 per share compared to the same period of 2014. The decrease in earnings is due to lower electric margins due to abnormal weather and higher expenses related to our capital program, including interest expense and property taxes. These decreases more than offset increases due to the continued recovery of financing costs through the BLRA, customer growth in both the electric and gas businesses, the application of the previously mentioned new depreciation rates and lower O&M due primarily to labor savings. 
For the full year 2015, earnings were higher by $0.12 per share due to increased electric margins, primarily from the continued recovery of financing costs through the BLRA and customer growth, improved gas margins due to a customer growth and the application of new depreciation rates. These items were partially offset by the effect of abnormal weather on electric margins and higher expenses related to our capital program, including interest expense, property taxes, dilution and continued increases in depreciation exclusive of the impact of the depreciation study. 
Although weather in both years contributed favorably to electric margins versus normal, 2015 was milder than 2014, with weather contributing $0.08 of margin versus normal in 2015 compared to $0.21 in 2014. 
PSNC Energy reported earnings of $0.17 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $0.16 per share in the same quarter of the prior year, primarily due to higher margins from customer growth. For the year ended December 2015, earnings are $0.38 per share compared to $0.39 per share in the prior year. 
SCANA Energy, our retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia showed a decrease in the fourth quarter earnings of $0.06 per share in 2015 over the same quarter of last year, primarily due to lower throughput and margins attributable to the extremely warm weather during the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to 2014, partially offset by lower bad debt expense. 
For the 12 months ended December 31, 2015, earnings were down $0.05 per share compared to the same period of 2014 due to the same drivers as the quarter. 
On a GAAP basis, SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported a loss of $0.01 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $0.03 in the comparative quarter of the prior year. Lower interest expense at the holding company and increased margins in our marketing business were primarily offset by foregone earnings contributions from the subsidiaries that were sold during the fourth quarter of this year. 
For the 12-month period, these businesses reported earnings per share of $1.36 in 2015 compared to $0.01 loss in 2014. Excluding the net-of-tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI of $1.41 per share, GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized EPS was down $0.04 from the prior year due primarily to foregone earnings from the sale of the businesses earlier this year, offset by lower interest expense at the holding company and increased margins on our marketing business. 
I would now like to touch on economic trends in our service territory on Slide 7. In 2015, the company has announced plans to invest over $2 billion with the expectation of creating over 6,000 jobs in our Carolinas territories. The Carolinas continue to be seen as a favorable business environment, and we're pleased by the continuous growth in our service territories. 
At the bottom of the slide, you can see the national unemployment rate along with the rates for the 3 states, where SCANA has a presence and the SCE&G electric territory. South Carolina's unemployment rate is now at 5.5%, and the rate in SCE&G's electric territory is estimated at 4.7%. 
At the top of Slide 8, you can see the South Carolina employment statistics as of December 2015 and 2014. Over the course of 2015, South Carolina's unemployment rate has dropped over a percentage point from its level at the end of 2014. December of 2015 also marked all-time highs for the number of South Carolinians employed and in the labor force. 
Of particular interest and attesting to our state's strong economic growth, almost 80,000 or 3.8% more South Carolinians are working today than a year ago. Said another way, had the labor force not increased during 2015, the unemployment rate would be approximately 3%. 
The expansion of the labor force is simply evidence of the confidence of some of the workforce to reenter the market and the positive migration to the state of Carolina. 
As depicted on the bottom of the slide, United Van Lines recently released its annual movers study for 2015, which tracks migration patterns state to state. For the third consecutive year, South Carolina finished ranked second in terms of domestic migration destinations, corroborating our realized customer gross statistics. North Carolina has also been ranked in the top 5 for the last 3 years. 
Slide 9 presents customer growth and electric sales statistics. On the top half of the slide is the customer growth rate for each of our regulated businesses. SCE&G's electric business added customers at a year-over-year rate of 1.5%. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina added customers at a rate of 2.5% and 2.7%, respectively. We continue to see very strong customer growth in our businesses and in the region. 
The bottom table outlines our actual and weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales for the 12 months ended December 31, 2015. Overall, weather-normalized total retail sales are up 1.3% on a 12-month ended basis. 
In conjunction with the continued improvement of economic conditions in South Carolina, the past 2 quarters have shown an accelerating improvement in usage in the residential market. 
And now please turn to Slide 10, which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $9.6 billion. As denoted in the 2 shades of blue, approximately 86% of this rate base is related to the electric business. In the block on the right, you will see SCE&G's base electric business, in which we're allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The earned return for the 12 months ended December 31, 2015, in the base electric business is approximately 9.75%, meeting our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA-related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. We continue to be pleased with the execution of our strategy. 
As a reminder, we're allowed a return on equity of 10.25% and 10.6% in our LDCs in South and North Carolina, respectively. In responsible -- in response to the normal attrition in the earned returns in our North Carolina business, yesterday, PSNC notified the North Carolina Utilities Commission of its intention to file a rate case. We plan to file the detailed case within the next 60 days, where more clarity will be provided. 
As you will recall, in South Carolina, if the earned ROE of the gas business for the 12 months ending in March falls outside a range of 50 basis points above or below the allowed ROE, then we will file to adjust rates under the Rate Stabilization Act in June. 
Slide 11 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast reflects the company's current estimate of new nuclear spending through 2018 and has been updated to reflect what was filed in our quarterly BLRA report, which also reflects the amended EPC that was announced in October of 2015. 
At the bottom of the slide, we will recap the estimated new nuclear CWIP from July 1 through June 30, to correspond to the periods on which the BLRA rate increases are historically calculated. 
Slide 12 presents the transition payments information and an expected timeframe for our filing with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina. Once these events are complete, we will update the CapEx schedule and the corresponding financing plan. 
And now please turn to Slide 13 to review our estimated financing plan through 2018. As a reminder, we have switched to open market purchases instead of issuing new shares to fulfill our 401(k) and DRIP plans, at least until we have fully utilized the net cash proceeds from the sales of CGT and SCI. We do not anticipate the need for further equity issuances until 2017, and again, the election of the fixed-price option would likely changed planned equity issuances after 2016. 
While these are our best estimates of incremental debt and equity issuances, it is unlikely that these issuances will occur in the exact amounts or timing as presented, as they are subject to changes in our funding needs for planned project expenses. We continue to adjust the financing to match the related project CapEx on a 50-50 debt and equity basis. 
On Slide 14, we are reaffirming our 2016 GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized earnings guidance as $3.90 per share to $4.10 per share with an internal target of $4 per share. We continue to be cautiously optimistic about our long-term view and are increasing the lower band of our long-term growth rate from 3% to 4%. We are also resetting our base year to 2015 GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized EPS of $3.73. 
Therefore, our new GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized annual growth guidance target will be to deliver 4% to 6% earnings growth over the 3 to 5 years using a base of 2015 GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized EPS of $3.73. This increase represents our projected earnings momentum driven by our BLRA filings, our stated goal to manage base retail electric returns and our view of the economy, balanced with our continued assumption of the impacts of energy conservation and efficiency standards. 
I also wanted to mention that earlier today, we announced an increase of $0.12 in our annual dividend rate for 2016 to $2.30 per share, a 5.5% increase. We continue to anticipate growing dividends fairly consistent with the earnings while staying within our stated payout policy of 55% to 60%. 
And finally, on Slide 15, we are very pleased to report that in late December, we successfully completed the syndication of an expanded and extended credit facility. The additional liquidity is important to our nuclear construction project and accelerated CapEx spending at PSNC. The committed lines of credit now total $2 billion. 
I would like to thank our banks for their enthusiastic support of our liquidity needs and, therefore, the support of our nuclear expansion plans. We are pleased that we continue to receive an excellent response for our nuclear construction from our equity and debt investors as well as our banks. And I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project."

I'd like to begin by addressing the status of the settlement with the consortium. Slide 16 presents the outline we have shown in previous discussions as a recap. As you may be aware, Westinghouse closed on the transaction to acquire Stone",1178,"Thanks, Jimmy. I'd like to begin by addressing the status of the settlement with the consortium. Slide 16 presents the outline we have shown in previous discussions as a recap. 
As you may be aware, Westinghouse closed on the transaction to acquire Stone & Webster from CB&I at the end of December, and Fluor began work as a subcontracted construction manager in the new nuclear construction site on January 4. We continue our analysis of the fixed-price option, and we'll include input from Fluor as they progress. 
As a reminder, we have until November 1 of this year to unilaterally elect the fixed-price option or not, and we plan to take as much time as needed to ensure that we make the most prudent decision. Regardless of which scenario we choose, once a decision has been made, we will file a petition with the Public Service Commission to amend the capital cost and schedule for the project. As Jimmy said earlier, we expect to reach a conclusion in the second quarter. 
Moving on to some of the activities at the new nuclear construction site. Slide 17 presents an aerial photo of the site from September of 2015. I provided this photo to give you a view of the layout of the site, and I've labeled both Units 2 and 3, as well as many other areas that make up what we call a tabletop. 
On Slide 18, you can see a picture of the Unit 2 nuclear island. In this picture, you can see module CA20 on the right hand side of the slide along with containment vessel ring #1, which was placed on and welded to the lower bowl. Several of the large structural modules have now been placed inside the Unit 2 containment vessel. As we will discuss shortly, you can also see the beginnings of the shield building as 3 courses have now been placed. 
Slide 19 shows a picture of the Unit 3 nuclear island. Module CA-04 was placed inside the containment vessel lower bowl back in June, and Auxiliary Building walls continue to go good [ph]. As you'll see shortly, we are making progress with the fabrication and placement of containment vessel structural modules on both units. 
Slide 20 presents a schematic view of the 5 large structural modules that are located inside the containment vessel. I've shown this schematic numerous times before because this expanded view gives you a better feel for how CA-01 through -05 fits spatially inside the containment vessel. As you may know, we've now placed CA-01, CA-04 and CA-05 for Unit 2 and CA-04 for Unit 3. 
Slide 21 shows a picture of the Unit 2 CA-02 module. CA-02 is a wall section that forms part of the in-containment refueling water storage tank. As mentioned last quarter, CA-02 is now structurally complete and awaiting installation. 
Slide 22 shows a picture of the Unit 2 CA-03, which is the west wall of the in-containment refueling water storage tank. 15 of CA-03's 17 submodules are on-site, and 12 are now on their assembly platform. 
Slide 23 shows a picture of the Unit 3 module CA-05. This module comprises one of the major wall sections within the containment vessel. Fabrication on the Unit 3 CA-05 has been completed and has been staged outside the modular assembly building or MAB. 
Slide 24 shows a picture of the Unit 3 CA20, which is the auxiliary building module that will be located outside and adjacent to the containment vessel. 68 of the 72 submodules are on-site, and 20 of those submodules have been upended on the construction platform, or plattened [ph], for fabrication in the MAB. 
Slide 25 shows a picture of the beginnings of the Unit 3 module CA-01. Module CA-01 houses the steam generators and the pressurizer and forms a fueling canal inside the containment vessel. Currently, we have 15 of 47 submodules on-site, and 3 of those submodules are upright and being welded together in the MAB. 
Slide 26 shows the progress of the placement of the Unit 2 shield building panels. The first 6-panel course was placed during the first half of 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the second 6-panel course was set on top of the first course, and at the beginning of this month, we placed the third 6-panel course. As the shield building panels are placed and welded together, concrete is poured inside the panels to create the shield building. Concrete has been placed in the first 2 courses. 
Slide 27 shows a couple of pictures from the Unit 2 turbine pedestal concrete placement from December of 2015. Overall, more than 2,300 cubic yards of concrete was placed over the course of about 20 hours. 
Slide 28 shows a picture of the single phase for the 230-ton Unit 2 main transformers. There are 4 such transformers for each unit, and here you can see one of the 4 being rigged for placement adjacent to the Unit 2 turbine building. Each unit will have these 4 plus 6 other transformers. All 10 have been placed for Unit 2, and all 10 have been received for Unit 3. 
On Slide 29, you see the new nuclear CapEx actual and projected over the life of the construction. This chart shows CWIP during the years 2008 to 2020, reflecting the Q4 of 2015 BLRA quarterly report that we filed in February. As a reminder, the BLRA report now reflects the cost from the October 2015 amended EPC. As you can see, we are currently in the middle of the peak nuclear construction period. The green line represents the related actual and projected customer rate increases under the BLRA and is associated with the right-hand axis. 
Please now turn to Slide 30. As we mentioned during our third quarter call in September, the PSC approved a rate increase of $64.5 million. The new rates were effective for bills rendered on or after October 30. Our BLRA filings for 2016 are showed at the bottom of the slide, and as you can see, we recently filed our quarterly status report for the fourth quarter, and our next quarterly update we filed in mid-May. Not depicted here is the update filing I addressed earlier as timing of that petition isn't yet known. 
Finally, I wanted to mention the results of an analysis performed at the direction of the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff. As you maybe aware, the ORS contracted an independent accounting firm to determine whether the revised rates provision under the Base Load Review Act is cost beneficial to SCE&G customers, consistent with our claims. This independent attestation concluded in January and reaffirmed the significant cost advantage of the BLRA as envisioned when the law was originally passed. This report is available on the ORS' website, and the link to the independent accounting firms report can be found in the regulatory document section of the nuclear development area of SCANA's investor website. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now be glad to respond to any questions you might have."

And what we told them was as soon as we were complete with our evaluation, we would come back to them with the option that we selected. So we intend to do that. One complicator that you might not see that makes my life a little more difficult is that in the interim, I have to sort of keep 2 sets of books, and so I have to base assumptions on both; we're exercising fixed-price option, and we're not exercising fixed-price option. And if we're going to exercise one or the other, it's a lot simpler for me if I can drop the other set of books.

We've been tracking the situation at Toshiba, obviously a very large company, and I think the Japanese government would be loath to see them fail, but they did -- they have submitted obviously restructuring plan. We were heartened to see in the restructuring plan that they intent to stay in the energy business, while they do intend to shed some of their business lines. They're going to stay in energy business, which would include nuclear. So that's a good thing for us. Also, we are glad to see that with the significant changes in leadership and the board at Toshiba that the person that we have been largely dealing with in the nuclear arena survived that turmoil, and again we think that's a good thing. And I do believe that Toshiba has been successful at securing some debt from some large Japanese banks just recently. Bankruptcy also doesn't necessarily mean that things would stop. There are various kinds of bankruptcies, not that we think it'll get to that point, but it doesn't necessarily mean things at the site will stop. In addition to the sort of the financial protections that Jimmy just alluded to, we did actually forecast a situation like this back when we were negotiating the EPC contract. Not necessarily that we thought that the larger corporation, Toshiba, might have financial difficulties, but we were really focusing on perhaps the smaller corporations like Westinghouse and/or Shaw might have some financial difficulty. So we do have in the contracts some provisions to escrow intellectual property such that if there were to be a cessation of operations by the contractor that we could finish the plant on our own."

The biggest issue that we had really was that they had anticipated that the fit up of this first of a kind item, taking these individual panels that come from Newport News Industrial, or NNI, and then putting them together at the site, welding them up within the tolerances and filling them with concrete was going to be very difficult. We've done a lot of mock-ups. We received probably half the panels for the first unit and maybe a 25% for the second unit. The placement so far I could categorize is going a little better than we had anticipated, and so we've got 16 courses of steel panels that go in a ring that we eventually will fill with concrete. We've placed the first 3 of those courses already. The first 2 have been welded, fit the concrete in. And the third, the third course we recently placed. So we're welding that. But again, that's going, I think, better than we had anticipated. So now our focus, since that is the critical path is ensuring that we get these submodules, the pieces, the panels from NNI in a timely fashion, and so Westinghouse has taken over the contract that CB&I used to have. So that's now exclusively a Westinghouse to NNI deal, which we think it's good. And then their delivery schedule looks to be good, and they're negotiating a mitigation strategy and, in fact, I'll be going to NNI tomorrow to talk through the mitigation strategy that will accelerate some of those panel deliveries to the site. So I think the shield-building, right now, it's going pretty well, but it is our focus area because it is a critical path."

And we did come up with interesting mitigation strategy for the CA20 module, whereas on the first unit, on Unit 2, we set it as one piece. On the second one, we're going to set it in 2 halves. So that will save us probably a couple of months in the fabrication, and that's important because it actually forms a part of the concrete form work for the rest of the plan. So it's important that we set that -- that half of that and use it as a form concrete while we're working on the second half, then set the second half. So as of right now, I thought that, that was -- the team on site came up with that plan.

GAAP earnings in the first quarter of 2016 were $1.23 per share compared to $2.80 per share in the same quarter of 2015. Excluding the net-of-tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI, positive earnings drivers from electric margins, primarily due to a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth as well as the positive impact of the depreciation study were more than offset by the negative impact of weather on both electric margins as well as on gas margins in our Georgia business. 
Gas margins were also down due to CGT operating for a month during the first quarter of 2015 before it was sold. Additionally, expected increases in O&M expenses in CapEx-related items, including interest and property taxes, had a negative impact on earnings. 
At the bottom of the slide, you will note that abnormal weather decreased electric margins by $0.05 per share in the first quarter of 2016 and increased electric margins by $0.05 per share in the first quarter of 2015, resulting in a $0.10 per share negative swing. 
Slide 4 shows earnings on a GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized basis. Earnings in the first quarter of 2016 were $1.28 per share compared to $1.34 per share in the same quarter of 2015. As a reminder, GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized EPS excludes the impact of abnormal weather on electric margins and the net-of-tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI from the first quarter of 2015. Abnormal weather on gas margins is not adjusted in this measure as gas margins are weather-normalized for the North and South Carolina gas businesses, and their direct impact of abnormal weather on the Georgia business is generally insignificant on an annual basis. 
Now on Slide 5, I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. On a GAAP basis, South Carolina Electric and Gas companies first quarter 2016 earnings were down $0.08 per share compared to the same period of 2015. The decrease in earnings is due to lower electric margins, principally as a result of abnormal weather in both periods as well as higher O&M expenses and higher expenses related to our capital program, including interest expense and property taxes. These decreases more than offset increases from the continued recovery of financing costs under the BLRA customer growth, both the electric and gas businesses and the application of the previously mentioned new depreciation rates. 
PSNC Energy reported earnings of $0.25 per share in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $0.24 per share in the same quarter of the prior year, primarily due to higher margins from customer growth. SCANA Energy, which includes SCANA Energy Marketing and SCANA Energy Georgia, showed a decrease in first quarter earnings of $0.06 per share, primarily due to lower throughput attributable to the warmer weather during the first quarter of 2016 as compared to 2015 and higher transportation costs. 
On a GAAP basis, SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported relatively flat earnings in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $1.44 per share in the comparative quarter of the prior year. Excluding the net-of-tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI of $1.41 per share, GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized EPS was down $0.03, due primarily to foregone earnings contributed by CGT and SCI prior to the closing of the sales in the first quarter of 2015. 
I would now like to touch on economic trends in our service territory on Slide 6. The Carolinas continue to have a favorable business environment, and we're pleased by the continuous growth in our service territories as evidenced by announcements to invest approximately $380 million with the expectation of creating approximately 1,300 jobs. At the bottom of the slide, you can see the national unemployment rate along with the rates for the 3 states where SCANA has a presence and the SCE&G electric territory. South Carolina's unemployment rate is now at 5.7%, and the rate in SCE&G's electric territory is estimated at 5%. Of particular interest and attesting to our state's strong economic growth, almost 80,000 or 3.7% more South Carolinians are working today than a year ago. 
Slide 7 presents customer growth and electric sales statistics. On the top half of the slide is the customer growth rate for each of our regulated businesses. SCE&G's electric business added customers at a year-over-year rate of 1.5%. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina added customers at a rate of 2.5% and 2.7%, respectively. We continue to see strong customer growth in our businesses and in the region. 
The bottom table outlines our actual and weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales for the 12 months ended March 31, 2016. Overall, weather-normalized total retail sales were up 1.3% on a 12-month ended basis. 
Now please turn to Slide 8, which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components our regulated rate base of approximately $9.5 billion. As noted in the 2 shades of blue, approximately 86% of this rate base is related to the electric business. 
In the block on the right, you will see SCE&G's base electric business, in which we're allowed 10.25% return on equity. The earned return for the 12 months ended March 31, 2016, in the base electric business continues at approximately 9.75%, meeting our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA-related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. 
We continue to be pleased with the execution of our strategy. As a reminder, we're allowed a return on equity of 10.25% in our LDC in South Carolina and if the earned ROE of the gas business for the 12 months ending March 31 falls outside the range of 50 basis points above or below the allowed ROE, then we will file to adjust rates under the Rate Stabilization Act in June. As of December 31, 2015, the 12-month earned return for SCE&G gas was 9.65%. 
As you are aware, we recently filed an application with the North Carolina Utilities Commission requesting an annual revenue increase of $41.6 million at PSNC Energy in response to the normal attrition in the earned returns in that business. This rate increase is a result of PSNC's need to recover cost to operate and expand its pipeline system and to implement a pipeline integrity management writer. This writer will allow PSNC to track and receive ongoing recovery of capital expenses related to its distribution and transmission pipeline integrity management programs. 
Slide 9 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast reflects the company's current estimate of new nuclear spending through 2018 and is consistent with last quarter's call and the February quarterly BLRA report, which also reflects the amended EPC agreement that was announced in October of 2015. 
At the bottom of the slide, we recap the estimated new nuclear CWIP from July 1 through June 30 to correspond to the periods on which BLRA increases are historically calculated. 
Slide 10 presents the transition payments information and an expected time frame for the filing with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina. Once these events are complete, we will update the CapEx schedule and the corresponding financing plan. 
Now please turn to Slide 11 to review our estimated financing plan through 2018. As a reminder, we have switched to open market purchases instead of issuing new shares to fulfill our 401(k) and DRIP plans at least until we have fully utilized the net cash proceeds from the sales of CGT and SCI. We do not anticipate the need for further equity issuances until 2017. The election of the fixed-price option would likely change planned equity issuances after 2016. 
It is unlikely that these issuances will occur in the exact amounts or timing as presented as they are subject to changes in our funding needs for planned project expenses. We continue to adjust the financing to match the related project CapEx on a 50-50 debt and equity basis. 
Now on Slide 12, we are reaffirming our 2016 GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized earnings guidance as $3.90 per share to $4.10 per share with an internal target of $4 per share. Our long-term GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized average annual growth guidance target remains unchanged as we plan to deliver 4% to 6% earnings growth over 3 to 5 years using a base of 2015's GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized EPS of $3.73. 
I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project."

Slide 13 presents the settlement agreement outline that we have previously shown. Westinghouse closed on the transaction to acquire Stone & Webster from CB&I at the end of December. Fluor began work as the subcontracted construction manager for the new nuclear construction site on January 4. The Kraft employees transitioned to Fluor on April 4. 
Slide 13 presents cost as of the settlement date. In our next quarterly BLRA update filing to be filed in the next couple of weeks, we plan to update the project cost for estimated change orders, primarily related items listed in Exhibit C of the settlement agreement. As you may recall, Exhibit C described items not resolved in net settlement. 
Listed on Slide 14 are several of those items for which we now have estimated the cost. Also listed are the estimated change orders associated with escrowing the software and documentation necessary to complete the project and new change orders initiated since the settlement that are on or directed. Additional sales tax, which has been excluded from the fixed price option, is also listed. 
Slide 15 presents the relative schedules of both the filing of an updated petition and the annual request for revised rates. We continue our analysis of the fixed price option, and we'll consider any input received from Fluor. 
As a reminder, we have until November 1 of this year to unilaterally elect the fixed price option. Regardless of which scenario we choose, once a decision has been made, we will file a petition with the Public Service Commission to amend the capital cost and schedule for the project. We continue to expect to reach a conclusion on the matter sometime during the second quarter and expect to have a minor delay of a few weeks in filing our annual request for revised rates under the BLRA in order to coordinate the petition with the revised rates application. 
Moving on to some of the activities at the new nuclear construction site. Fluor's integration into the project as Westinghouse's subcontracted construction manager continues to progress with the placement of managers in key positions of the construction areas in a series of assessments that are taking place to streamline processes and improvement -- I'm sorry, improve performance. 
Slide 16 presents an aerial photo of the site from September of 2015. This photo gives you a view of the layout of the site, and I've labeled both Units 2 and 3 as well as many other areas of the construction site. 
Slide 17 presents a schematic view of the 5 large structural modules that are located inside the containment vessel. This expanded view gives you a better feel for how CA-01 through 05 fits especially inside the containment vessel. As you will recall, we've now placed CA-01, CA-04 and CA-05 for Unit 2 and CA-04 for Unit 3. 
Slide 18 shows an aerial view of the Unit 2 containment. Looking down into the containment vessel, you see the first ring section with openings or penetrations sitting on top of the. I previously mentioned CA-01, CA-04 and CA-05 have been placed and can be seen in the picture. 
Slide 19 shows a picture of the Unit 2 CA-02 module. CA-02 is a wall section that forms part of the in-containment refueling water storage tank. As mentioned in previous quarters, CA-02 is now structurally complete and is awaiting installation. 
Slide 20 shows a picture of the Unit 2 CA-03, which is the west wall of the in-containment refueling water storage tank. Fabrication continues as all 17 of CA-03 submodules are on site and standing on the assembly platform. 
Slide 21 shows a picture of the first portion of the Unit 3 module CA-20, which was placed during March. This module consists of 4 subassemblies, and the decision was made to expedite placement of subassemblies 3 and 4 as they allow for work to move forward that is required in order to begin shield-building erection, which is the next critical path item. 
As you can see on Slide 22, fabrication continues on subassemblies 1 and 2 inside of the module assembly building or MAB. All 72 required submodules are on site. These remaining subassemblies will be placed once they are completed. As a reminder, CA-20 is an auxiliary building module that is located outside and adjacent to the containment vessel. 
Slide 23 shows a picture of the Unit 3 containment vessel ring 1 placement. Ring 1 was placed on top of the containment vessel lower ball on April 13. 
Slide 24 shows a picture of the Unit 3 module CA-05. This module comprises one of the major wall sections within the containment vessel. Fabrication of the Unit 3 CA-05 has been completed, and it has been staged outside of the MAB. 
Slide 25 shows a picture of the beginnings of the Unit 3 module CA-01. Module CA-01 houses the steam generators and the pressurizer and forms the refueling canal inside the containment vessel. Currently, we have 24 of the 47 [ph] submodules on site. 7 Of those submodules are bright and being welded together in the MAB. 
Now turn to Slide #26. I want to briefly mention that last week, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina approved SCE&G's request to reduce its electric rates to reflect lower fuel costs. Having a balanced and diversified fuel mix contributes to a fuel cost that we pass on to our customers. It is anticipated that this decrease should more than offset any decrease to residential customers from the BLRA for the year. 
Finally, please now turn to Slide #27 to discuss some of the SCE&G solar initiatives. Under South Carolina law or Act 2 36 [ph], we're allowed to recover certain costs associated with our efforts to implement renewable energy incentive programs. We officially rolled out our DER program in August of 2015 with the goal of adding approximately 84 megawatts of renewable generating facilities to our system by the end of 2020. We anticipate being almost halfway to our 2020 goal by the end of 2016. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now be glad to spend respond to any questions you might have."

We could either act as our own general contractor, which we'd be more comfortable doing now than we originally signed up for the project since we've made so much progress, and we understand that this construction progress.

188244,330349272,966590,"SCANA Corp., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","SCANA Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Susan, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. GAAP earnings in the first quarter of 2016 were $1.23 per share compared to $2.80 per share in the same quarter of 2015. Excluding the net-of-tax gains o",1428,"Thanks, Susan, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. GAAP earnings in the first quarter of 2016 were $1.23 per share compared to $2.80 per share in the same quarter of 2015. Excluding the net-of-tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI, positive earnings drivers from electric margins, primarily due to a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth, as well as the positive impact of the depreciation study were more than offset by the negative impact of weather on both electric margins as well as on gas margins in our Georgia business. 
Gas margins were also down due to CGT operating for a month during the first quarter of 2015 before it was sold. Additionally, expected increases in O&M expenses in CapEx-related items, including interest and property taxes, had a negative impact on earnings. 
At the bottom of the slide, you will note that abnormal weather decreased electric margins by $0.05 per share in the first quarter of 2016 and increased electric margins by $0.05 per share in the first quarter of 2015, resulting in a $0.10 per share negative swing. 
Slide 4 shows earnings on a GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized basis. Earnings in the first quarter of 2016 were $1.28 per share compared to $1.34 per share in the same quarter of 2015. As a reminder, GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized EPS excludes the impact of abnormal weather on electric margins and the net-of-tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI from the first quarter of 2015. Abnormal weather on gas margins is not adjusted in this measure as gas margins are weather-normalized for the North and South Carolina gas businesses, and the direct impact of abnormal weather on the Georgia business is generally insignificant on an annual basis. 
Now on Slide 5, I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. On a GAAP basis, South Carolina Electric and Gas Company's first quarter 2016 earnings were down $0.08 per share compared to the same period of 2015. The decrease in earnings is due to lower electric margins, principally as a result of abnormal weather in both periods, as well as higher O&M expenses and higher expenses related to our capital program, including interest expense and property taxes. These decreases more than offset increases from the continued recovery of financing cost under the BLRA, customer growth, both the electric and gas businesses and the application of the previously mentioned new depreciation rates. 
PSNC Energy reported earnings of $0.25 per share in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $0.24 per share in the same quarter of the prior year, primarily due to higher margins from customer growth. SCANA Energy, which includes SCANA Energy Marketing and SCANA Energy Georgia, showed a decrease in first quarter earnings of $0.06 per share, primarily due to lower throughput attributable to the warmer weather during the first quarter of 2016 as compared to 2015 and higher transportation cost.
On a GAAP basis, SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported relatively flat earnings in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $1.44 per share in the comparative quarter of the prior year. Excluding the net-of-tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI of $1.41 per share, GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized EPS was down $0.03, due primarily to foregone earnings contributed by CGT and SCI prior to the closing of the sales in the first quarter of 2015. 
I would now like to touch on economic trends in our service territory on Slide 6. The Carolinas continue to have a favorable business environment, and we are pleased by the continuous growth in our service territories as evidenced by announcements to invest approximately $380 million, with the expectation of creating approximately 1,300 jobs. At the bottom of the slide, you can see the national unemployment rate along with the rates for the 3 states where SCANA has a presence and the SCE&G electric territory. South Carolina's unemployment rate is now at 5.7%, and the rate in SCE&G's electric territory is estimated at 5%. Of particular interest and attesting to our state's strong economic growth, almost 80,000 or 3.7% more South Carolinians are working today than a year ago. 
Slide 7 presents customer growth in electric sales statistics. On the top half of the slide is the customer growth rate for each of our regulated businesses. SCE&G's electric business added customers at a year-over-year rate of 1.5%. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina added customers at a rate of 2.5% and 2.7%, respectively. We continue to see strong customer growth in our businesses and in the region. 
The bottom table outlines our actual and weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales for the 12 months ended March 31, 2016. Overall, weather-normalized total retail sales were up 1.3% on a 12-month ended basis. 
Now please turn to Slide 8, which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $9.5 billion. As noted in the 2 shades of blue, approximately 86% of this rate base is related to the electric business. 
In the block on the right, you will see SCE&G's base electric business, in which we're allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The earned return for the 12 months ended March 31, 2016, in the base electric business continues at approximately 9.75%, meeting our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA-related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. 
We continue to be pleased with the execution of our strategy. As a reminder, we're allowed a return on equity of 10.25% in our LDC in South Carolina and if the earned ROE of the gas business for the 12 months ending March 31 falls outside a range of 50 basis points above or below the allowed ROE, then we will file to adjust rates under the Rate Stabilization Act in June. As of December 31, 2015, the 12-month earned return for SCE&G gas was 9.65%. 
As you are aware, we recently filed an application with the North Carolina Utilities Commission requesting an annual revenue increase of $41.6 million at PSNC Energy in response to the normal attrition in the earned returns in that business. This rate increase is the result of PSNC's need to recover cost to operate and expand its pipeline system and to implement a pipeline integrity management rider. This rider would allow PSNC to track and receive ongoing recovery of capital expenses related to its distribution and transmission pipeline integrity management programs. 
Slide 9 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast reflects the company's current estimate of new nuclear spending through 2018 and is consistent with last quarter's call and the February quarterly BLRA report, which also reflects the amended EPC agreement that was announced in October of 2015. 
At the bottom of the slide, we recap the estimated new nuclear CWIP from July 1 through June 30 to correspond to the periods on which the BLRA rate increases are historically calculated. 
Slide 10 presents the transition payments information and an expected time frame for the filing with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina. Once these events are complete, we will update the CapEx schedule and the corresponding financing plan. 
Now please turn to Slide 11 to review our estimated financing plan through 2018. As a reminder, we have switched to open market purchases instead of issuing new shares to fulfill our 401(k) and DRIP plans, at least until we have fully utilized the net cash proceeds from the sales of CGT and SCI. We do not anticipate the need for further equity issuances until 2017. The election of the fixed-price option would likely change planned equity issuances after 2016. 
It is unlikely that these issuances will occur in the exact amounts or timing as presented, as they are subject to changes in our funding needs for planned project expenses. We continue to adjust the financing to match the related project CapEx on a 50-50 debt and equity basis. 
Now on Slide 12, we are reaffirming our 2016 GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized earnings guidance as $3.90 per share to $4.10 per share with an internal target of $4 per share. Our long-term GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized average annual growth guidance target remains unchanged as we plan to deliver 4% to 6% earnings growth over 3 to 5 years, using a base of 2015's GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized EPS of $3.73. 
I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project."

Also listed are the estimated change orders associated with escrowing the software and documentation necessary to complete the project and new change orders initiated since the settlement that are owner directed. Additional sales tax, which has been excluded from the fixed price option, is also listed. 
Slide 15 presents the relative schedules of both the filing of an update petition and the annual request for revised rates. We continue our analysis of the fixed price option, and we'll consider any input received from Fluor. 
As a reminder, we have until November 1 of this year to unilaterally elect the fixed price option. Regardless of which scenario we choose, once a decision has been made, we will file a petition with the Public Service Commission to amend the capital cost and schedule for the project. We continue to expect to reach a conclusion on the matter sometime during the second quarter, and expect to have a minor delay of a few weeks in filing our annual request for revised rates under the BLRA in order to coordinate the petition with the revised rates application. 
Moving on to some of the activities at the new nuclear construction site. Fluor's integration into the project as Westinghouse's subcontracted construction manager continues to progress, with the placement of managers in key positions of the construction areas in a series of assessments that are taking place to streamline processes and improvement -- I'm sorry, improve performance. 
Slide 16 presents an aerial photo of the site from September of 2015. This photo gives you a view of the layout of the site, and I've labeled both Units 2 and 3, as well as many other areas of the construction site. 
Slide 17 presents a schematic view of the 5 large structural modules that are located inside the containment vessel. This expanded view gives you a better feel for how CA-01 through 05 fits spatially inside of the containment vessel. As you will recall, we have now placed CA-01, CA-04 and CA-05 for Unit 2, and CA-04 for Unit 3. 
Slide 18 shows an aerial view of the Unit 2 containment. Looking down into the containment vessel, you see the first ring section with openings or penetrations sitting on top of the lower bowl. The previously mentioned CA-01, CA-04 and CA-05 have been placed, and can be seen in the picture. 
Slide 19 shows a picture of the Unit 2 CA-02 module. CA-02 is a wall section that forms part of the in-containment refueling water storage tank. As mentioned in previous quarters, CA-02 is now structurally complete and is awaiting installation. 
Slide 20 shows a picture of the Unit 2 CA-03, which is the west wall of the in-containment refueling water storage tank. Fabrication continues as all 17 of CA-03 submodules are on site and standing on the assembly platform. 
Slide 21 shows a picture of the first portion of the Unit 3 module CA20, which was placed during March. This module consists of 4 subassemblies, and the decision was made to expedite placement of subassemblies 3 and 4 as they allow for work to move forward that is required in order to begin shield building erection, which is the next critical path item. 
As you can see on Slide 22, fabrication continues on subassemblies 1 and 2 inside of the module assembly building or MAB. All 72 required submodules are on site. These remaining subassemblies will be placed once they are completed. As a reminder, CA-20 is an auxiliary building module that is located outside and adjacent to the containment vessel. 
Slide 23 shows a picture of the Unit 3 containment vessel ring 1 placement. Ring 1 was placed on top of the containment vessel lower bowl on April 13. 
Slide 24 shows a picture of the Unit 3 module CA-05. This module comprises one of the major wall sections within the containment vessel. Fabrication of the Unit 3 CA-05 has been completed, and it has been staged outside of the MAB. 
Slide 25 shows a picture of the beginnings of the Unit 3 module CA-01. Module CA-01 houses the steam generators and the pressurizer and forms the refueling canal inside the containment vessel. Currently, we have 24 of the 47 submodules on site. Seven of those submodules are upright and being welded together in the MAB. 
Now turn to Slide #26. I want to briefly mention that last week, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina approved SCE&G's request to reduce its electric rates to reflect lower fuel costs. Having a balanced and diversified fuel mix contributes to a fuel cost that will be passed on to our customers. It is anticipated that this decrease should more than offset any decrease to residential customers from the BLRA for the year. 
Finally, please now turn to Slide #27 to discuss some of the SCE&G solar initiatives. Under South Carolina law, or Act 236, we are allowed to recover certain costs associated with our efforts to implement renewable energy incentive programs. We officially rolled out our DER program in August of 2015, with the goal of adding approximately 84 megawatts of renewable generating facilities to our system by the end of 2020. We anticipate being almost halfway to our 2020 goal by the end of 2016. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now be glad to spend respond to any questions you might have."

So we should be in a good kind of an equivalent cash flow situation compared to the work completed and not be behind or, if you will, ahead on the cash payments at any point in time from here through to completion. So it's really the progress payments are aligning with the work as it's completed. We are also very focused on the next 6 months. We've got 6 more months before we have to make that decision.

I mean, the majority of this is related to growth in the territory. The areas we serve are growing very well. A lot of transmission enhancement in the next couple of years will be up in the Research Triangle area, too, in addition to Western North Carolina, because a lot of the industrials are really going, for example, the research universities are all going to complete gas supply, as opposed to other fuels. So I don't know if there's tremendous, new frontier kind of distribution opportunities, but I think there's a lot of industrials that are really pushing it.

Our concern for the shield building really came from the contractor, their concerns at the time that was Chicago Bridge & Iron.

So even though CB&I power exited the consortium, the CB&I services folks, who are doing the containment vessel welding and the shield building welding stay, and they're doing a tremendous job. So we've got -- there's about 16 courses of this steel that goes up to form the shield building. You lay a course at a time, weld it together then fill that course with concrete. So we've got 3 of those courses that have been placed, welded and filled with concrete. The fourth course has been placed. It's being welded. We anticipate filling that with concrete sometime in the next couple of weeks. The deliveries are coming in from an entity called Newport News Industrial, NNI, in Virginia, and those folks are working very hard to meet our schedule, and we're looking at diversifying that supply chain a little bit, by perhaps moving some of those modules to another vendor to free up a little bit of space at NNI.

So it would pay vendors that were in process and allow us to, in a systematic, logical fashion, wind the project down to the point where Toshiba and/or Westinghouse could exit.

We could do that one of a couple of ways: We could either act as our own general contractor, which we would be more comfortable doing now than when we originally signed up for the project since we've made so much progress, and we understand that this construction progress. And we would go out and get a subcontracted construction vendor, presumably Fluor, since they're already on-site, already familiar with that means and methods, and know the project; or we could EPC it again. So we could give it to an EPC contractor. Certainly Fluor would be in a good position. They are an EPC contractor. So we could give it to them.

I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. GAAP earnings in the first quarter of 2016 were $1.23 per share compared to $2.80 per share in the same quarter of 2015. Excluding the net-of-tax gains o",1428,"Thanks, Susan, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. GAAP earnings in the first quarter of 2016 were $1.23 per share compared to $2.80 per share in the same quarter of 2015. Excluding the net-of-tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI, positive earnings drivers from electric margins, primarily due to a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth, as well as the positive impact of the depreciation study were more than offset by the negative impact of weather on both electric margins as well as on gas margins in our Georgia business. 
Gas margins were also down due to CGT operating for a month during the first quarter of 2015 before it was sold. Additionally, expected increases in O&M expenses in CapEx-related items, including interest and property taxes, had a negative impact on earnings. 
At the bottom of the slide, you will note that abnormal weather decreased electric margins by $0.05 per share in the first quarter of 2016 and increased electric margins by $0.05 per share in the first quarter of 2015, resulting in a $0.10 per share negative swing. 
Slide 4 shows earnings on a GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized basis. Earnings in the first quarter of 2016 were $1.28 per share compared to $1.34 per share in the same quarter of 2015. As a reminder, GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized EPS excludes the impact of abnormal weather on electric margins and the net-of-tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI from the first quarter of 2015. Abnormal weather on gas margins is not adjusted in this measure as gas margins are weather-normalized for the North and South Carolina gas businesses, and the direct impact of abnormal weather on the Georgia business is generally insignificant on an annual basis. 
Now on Slide 5, I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. On a GAAP basis, South Carolina Electric and Gas Company's first quarter 2016 earnings were down $0.08 per share compared to the same period of 2015. The decrease in earnings is due to lower electric margins, principally as a result of abnormal weather in both periods, as well as higher O&M expenses and higher expenses related to our capital program, including interest expense and property taxes. These decreases more than offset increases from the continued recovery of financing cost under the BLRA, customer growth, both the electric and gas businesses and the application of the previously mentioned new depreciation rates. 
PSNC Energy reported earnings of $0.25 per share in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $0.24 per share in the same quarter of the prior year, primarily due to higher margins from customer growth. SCANA Energy, which includes SCANA Energy Marketing and SCANA Energy Georgia, showed a decrease in first quarter earnings of $0.06 per share, primarily due to lower throughput attributable to the warmer weather during the first quarter of 2016 as compared to 2015 and higher transportation cost.
On a GAAP basis, SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported relatively flat earnings in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $1.44 per share in the comparative quarter of the prior year. Excluding the net-of-tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI of $1.41 per share, GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized EPS was down $0.03, due primarily to foregone earnings contributed by CGT and SCI prior to the closing of the sales in the first quarter of 2015. 
I would now like to touch on economic trends in our service territory on Slide 6. The Carolinas continue to have a favorable business environment, and we are pleased by the continuous growth in our service territories as evidenced by announcements to invest approximately $380 million, with the expectation of creating approximately 1,300 jobs. At the bottom of the slide, you can see the national unemployment rate along with the rates for the 3 states where SCANA has a presence and the SCE&G electric territory. South Carolina's unemployment rate is now at 5.7%, and the rate in SCE&G's electric territory is estimated at 5%. Of particular interest and attesting to our state's strong economic growth, almost 80,000 or 3.7% more South Carolinians are working today than a year ago. 
Slide 7 presents customer growth in electric sales statistics. On the top half of the slide is the customer growth rate for each of our regulated businesses. SCE&G's electric business added customers at a year-over-year rate of 1.5%. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina added customers at a rate of 2.5% and 2.7%, respectively. We continue to see strong customer growth in our businesses and in the region. 
The bottom table outlines our actual and weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales for the 12 months ended March 31, 2016. Overall, weather-normalized total retail sales were up 1.3% on a 12-month ended basis. 
Now please turn to Slide 8, which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $9.5 billion. As noted in the 2 shades of blue, approximately 86% of this rate base is related to the electric business. 
In the block on the right, you will see SCE&G's base electric business, in which we're allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The earned return for the 12 months ended March 31, 2016, in the base electric business continues at approximately 9.75%, meeting our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA-related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. 
We continue to be pleased with the execution of our strategy. As a reminder, we're allowed a return on equity of 10.25% in our LDC in South Carolina and if the earned ROE of the gas business for the 12 months ending March 31 falls outside a range of 50 basis points above or below the allowed ROE, then we will file to adjust rates under the Rate Stabilization Act in June. As of December 31, 2015, the 12-month earned return for SCE&G gas was 9.65%. 
As you are aware, we recently filed an application with the North Carolina Utilities Commission requesting an annual revenue increase of $41.6 million at PSNC Energy in response to the normal attrition in the earned returns in that business. This rate increase is the result of PSNC's need to recover cost to operate and expand its pipeline system and to implement a pipeline integrity management rider. This rider would allow PSNC to track and receive ongoing recovery of capital expenses related to its distribution and transmission pipeline integrity management programs. 
Slide 9 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast reflects the company's current estimate of new nuclear spending through 2018 and is consistent with last quarter's call and the February quarterly BLRA report, which also reflects the amended EPC agreement that was announced in October of 2015. 
At the bottom of the slide, we recap the estimated new nuclear CWIP from July 1 through June 30 to correspond to the periods on which the BLRA rate increases are historically calculated. 
Slide 10 presents the transition payments information and an expected time frame for the filing with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina. Once these events are complete, we will update the CapEx schedule and the corresponding financing plan. 
Now please turn to Slide 11 to review our estimated financing plan through 2018. As a reminder, we have switched to open market purchases instead of issuing new shares to fulfill our 401(k) and DRIP plans, at least until we have fully utilized the net cash proceeds from the sales of CGT and SCI. We do not anticipate the need for further equity issuances until 2017. The election of the fixed-price option would likely change planned equity issuances after 2016. 
It is unlikely that these issuances will occur in the exact amounts or timing as presented, as they are subject to changes in our funding needs for planned project expenses. We continue to adjust the financing to match the related project CapEx on a 50-50 debt and equity basis. 
Now on Slide 12, we are reaffirming our 2016 GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized earnings guidance as $3.90 per share to $4.10 per share with an internal target of $4 per share. Our long-term GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized average annual growth guidance target remains unchanged as we plan to deliver 4% to 6% earnings growth over 3 to 5 years, using a base of 2015's GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized EPS of $3.73. 
I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project."

I'd like to begin by addressing the status of the settlement with the consortium and the PSC approval process. Slide 13 presents the settlement agreement outline that we have previously shown. Westinghouse closed on the transaction to acq",1050,"Thanks, Jimmy. I'd like to begin by addressing the status of the settlement with the consortium and the PSC approval process. 
Slide 13 presents the settlement agreement outline that we have previously shown. Westinghouse closed on the transaction to acquire Stone & Webster from CB&I at the end of December. Fluor began work as the subcontracted construction manager for the new nuclear construction site on January 4. The Kraft employees transitioned to Fluor on April 4. 
While Slide 13 presents cost as of the settlement date, in our next quarterly BLRA update filing to be filed in the next couple of weeks, we plan to update the project costs for estimated change orders, primarily related items listed in Exhibit C of the settlement agreement. As you may recall, Exhibit C described items not resolved in net settlement. 
Listed on Slide 14 are several of those items for which we now have estimated the cost. Also listed are the estimated change orders associated with escrowing the software and documentation necessary to complete the project and new change orders initiated since the settlement that are owner directed. Additional sales tax, which has been excluded from the fixed price option, is also listed. 
Slide 15 presents the relative schedules of both the filing of an update petition and the annual request for revised rates. We continue our analysis of the fixed price option, and we'll consider any input received from Fluor. 
As a reminder, we have until November 1 of this year to unilaterally elect the fixed price option. Regardless of which scenario we choose, once a decision has been made, we will file a petition with the Public Service Commission to amend the capital cost and schedule for the project. We continue to expect to reach a conclusion on the matter sometime during the second quarter, and expect to have a minor delay of a few weeks in filing our annual request for revised rates under the BLRA in order to coordinate the petition with the revised rates application. 
Moving on to some of the activities at the new nuclear construction site. Fluor's integration into the project as Westinghouse's subcontracted construction manager continues to progress, with the placement of managers in key positions of the construction areas in a series of assessments that are taking place to streamline processes and improvement -- I'm sorry, improve performance. 
Slide 16 presents an aerial photo of the site from September of 2015. This photo gives you a view of the layout of the site, and I've labeled both Units 2 and 3, as well as many other areas of the construction site. 
Slide 17 presents a schematic view of the 5 large structural modules that are located inside the containment vessel. This expanded view gives you a better feel for how CA-01 through 05 fits spatially inside of the containment vessel. As you will recall, we have now placed CA-01, CA-04 and CA-05 for Unit 2, and CA-04 for Unit 3. 
Slide 18 shows an aerial view of the Unit 2 containment. Looking down into the containment vessel, you see the first ring section with openings or penetrations sitting on top of the lower bowl. The previously mentioned CA-01, CA-04 and CA-05 have been placed, and can be seen in the picture. 
Slide 19 shows a picture of the Unit 2 CA-02 module. CA-02 is a wall section that forms part of the in-containment refueling water storage tank. As mentioned in previous quarters, CA-02 is now structurally complete and is awaiting installation. 
Slide 20 shows a picture of the Unit 2 CA-03, which is the west wall of the in-containment refueling water storage tank. Fabrication continues as all 17 of CA-03 submodules are on site and standing on the assembly platform. 
Slide 21 shows a picture of the first portion of the Unit 3 module CA20, which was placed during March. This module consists of 4 subassemblies, and the decision was made to expedite placement of subassemblies 3 and 4 as they allow for work to move forward that is required in order to begin shield building erection, which is the next critical path item. 
As you can see on Slide 22, fabrication continues on subassemblies 1 and 2 inside of the module assembly building or MAB. All 72 required submodules are on site. These remaining subassemblies will be placed once they are completed. As a reminder, CA-20 is an auxiliary building module that is located outside and adjacent to the containment vessel. 
Slide 23 shows a picture of the Unit 3 containment vessel ring 1 placement. Ring 1 was placed on top of the containment vessel lower bowl on April 13. 
Slide 24 shows a picture of the Unit 3 module CA-05. This module comprises one of the major wall sections within the containment vessel. Fabrication of the Unit 3 CA-05 has been completed, and it has been staged outside of the MAB. 
Slide 25 shows a picture of the beginnings of the Unit 3 module CA-01. Module CA-01 houses the steam generators and the pressurizer and forms the refueling canal inside the containment vessel. Currently, we have 24 of the 47 submodules on site. Seven of those submodules are upright and being welded together in the MAB. 
Now turn to Slide #26. I want to briefly mention that last week, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina approved SCE&G's request to reduce its electric rates to reflect lower fuel costs. Having a balanced and diversified fuel mix contributes to a fuel cost that will be passed on to our customers. It is anticipated that this decrease should more than offset any increase to residential customers from the BLRA for the year. 
Finally, please now turn to Slide #27 to discuss some of the SCE&G solar initiatives. Under South Carolina law, or Act 236, we are allowed to recover certain costs associated with our efforts to implement renewable energy incentive programs. We officially rolled out our DER program in August of 2015, with the goal of adding approximately 84 megawatts of renewable generating facilities to our system by the end of 2020. We anticipate being almost halfway to our 2020 goal by the end of 2016. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now be glad to spend respond to any questions you might have."

So we should be in a good kind of an equivalent cash flow situation compared to the work completed and not be behind or, if you will, ahead on the cash payments at any point in time from here through the completion. So it's really the progress payments are aligning with the work as it's completed. We are also very focused on the next 6 months. We've got 6 more months before we have to make that decision. And while we'll likely file before then, we don't have to make the technical election with Toshiba until that point. So we plan to monitor the situation. Of course, they've taken some actions already on disposing some of their noncore assets. They've said that this business is core to them, and they have backed that up with the decisions they've made to this point. So it's obviously dynamic, Jim, and we're going to continue to monitor it over the next several months."

So it would pay vendors that were in process and allow us to, in a systematic, logical fashion, wind the project down to the point where Toshiba and/or Westinghouse could exit. Now if we're presuming some kind of insolvency or bankruptcy, you'd also have to presume that Westinghouse doesn't survive that, and so, as a, with that provision then, as you're aware, there can be various kinds of bankruptcy and it doesn't necessarily mean that the contractor stops working, but -- so we're working hard to make sure that we're not in advance of payments, and then we have information, which includes source codes, software and proprietary design information that's being escrowed, and the bankruptcy or insolvency would be one of the triggers that gives me that information, and then we would look to finish the plan on our own. We could do that one of a couple of ways: We could either act as our own general contractor, which we would be more comfortable doing now than when we originally signed up for the project since we've made so much progress, and we understand that this construction progress. And we would go out and get a subcontracted construction vendor, presumably Fluor, since they're already on-site, already familiar with means and methods, and know the project; or we could EPC it again. So we could give it to an EPC contractor. Certainly Fluor would be in a good position. They are an EPC contractor. So we could give it to them.

I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. GAAP earnings in the first quarter of 2016 were $1.23 per share compared to $2.80 per share in the same quarter of 2015. Excluding the net-of-tax gains o",1428,"Thanks, Susan, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. GAAP earnings in the first quarter of 2016 were $1.23 per share compared to $2.80 per share in the same quarter of 2015. Excluding the net-of-tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI, positive earnings drivers from electric margins, primarily due to a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth, as well as the positive impact of the depreciation study were more than offset by the negative impact of weather on both electric margins as well as on gas margins in our Georgia business. 
Gas margins were also down due to CGT operating for a month during the first quarter of 2015 before it was sold. Additionally, expected increases in O&M expenses in CapEx-related items, including interest and property taxes, had a negative impact on earnings. 
At the bottom of the slide, you will note that abnormal weather decreased electric margins by $0.05 per share in the first quarter of 2016 and increased electric margins by $0.05 per share in the first quarter of 2015, resulting in a $0.10 per share negative swing. 
Slide 4 shows earnings on a GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized basis. Earnings in the first quarter of 2016 were $1.28 per share compared to $1.34 per share in the same quarter of 2015. As a reminder, GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized EPS excludes the impact of abnormal weather on electric margins and the net-of-tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI from the first quarter of 2015. Abnormal weather on gas margins is not adjusted in this measure as gas margins are weather-normalized for the North and South Carolina gas businesses, and the direct impact of abnormal weather on the Georgia business is generally insignificant on an annual basis. 
Now on Slide 5, I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. On a GAAP basis, South Carolina Electric and Gas Company's first quarter 2016 earnings were down $0.08 per share compared to the same period of 2015. The decrease in earnings is due to lower electric margins, principally as a result of abnormal weather in both periods, as well as higher O&M expenses and higher expenses related to our capital program, including interest expense and property taxes. These decreases more than offset increases from the continued recovery of financing cost under the BLRA, customer growth, both the electric and gas businesses and the application of the previously mentioned new depreciation rates. 
PSNC Energy reported earnings of $0.25 per share in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $0.24 per share in the same quarter of the prior year, primarily due to higher margins from customer growth. SCANA Energy, which includes SCANA Energy Marketing and SCANA Energy Georgia, showed a decrease in first quarter earnings of $0.06 per share, primarily due to lower throughput attributable to the warmer weather during the first quarter of 2016 as compared to 2015 and higher transportation cost.
On a GAAP basis, SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported relatively flat earnings in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $1.44 per share in the comparative quarter of the prior year. Excluding the net-of-tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI of $1.41 per share, GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized EPS was down $0.03, due primarily to foregone earnings contributed by CGT and SCI prior to the closing of the sales in the first quarter of 2015. 
I would now like to touch on economic trends in our service territory on Slide 6. The Carolinas continue to have a favorable business environment, and we are pleased by the continuous growth in our service territories as evidenced by announcements to invest approximately $380 million, with the expectation of creating approximately 1,300 jobs. At the bottom of the slide, you can see the national unemployment rate along with the rates for the 3 states where SCANA has a presence and the SCE&G electric territory. South Carolina's unemployment rate is now at 5.7%, and the rate in SCE&G's electric territory is estimated at 5%. Of particular interest and attesting to our state's strong economic growth, almost 80,000 or 3.7% more South Carolinians are working today than a year ago. 
Slide 7 presents customer growth in electric sales statistics. On the top half of the slide is the customer growth rate for each of our regulated businesses. SCE&G's electric business added customers at a year-over-year rate of 1.5%. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina added customers at a rate of 2.5% and 2.7%, respectively. We continue to see strong customer growth in our businesses and in the region. 
The bottom table outlines our actual and weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales for the 12 months ended March 31, 2016. Overall, weather-normalized total retail sales were up 1.3% on a 12-month ended basis. 
Now please turn to Slide 8, which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $9.5 billion. As noted in the 2 shades of blue, approximately 86% of this rate base is related to the electric business. 
In the block on the right, you will see SCE&G's base electric business, in which we're allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The earned return for the 12 months ended March 31, 2016, in the base electric business continues at approximately 9.75%, meeting our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA-related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. 
We continue to be pleased with the execution of our strategy. As a reminder, we're allowed a return on equity of 10.25% in our LDC in South Carolina and if the earned ROE of the gas business for the 12 months ending March 31 falls outside a range of 50 basis points above or below the allowed ROE, then we will file to adjust rates under the Rate Stabilization Act in June. As of December 31, 2015, the 12-month earned return for SCE&G gas was 9.65%. 
As you are aware, we recently filed an application with the North Carolina Utilities Commission requesting an annual revenue increase of $41.6 million at PSNC Energy in response to the normal attrition in the earned returns in that business. This rate increase is the result of PSNC's need to recover cost to operate and expand its pipeline system and to implement a pipeline integrity management rider. This rider would allow PSNC to track and receive ongoing recovery of capital expenses related to its distribution and transmission pipeline integrity management programs. 
Slide 9 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast reflects the company's current estimate of new nuclear spending through 2018 and is consistent with last quarter's call and the February quarterly BLRA report, which also reflects the amended EPC agreement that was announced in October of 2015. 
At the bottom of the slide, we recap the estimated new nuclear CWIP from July 1 through June 30 to correspond to the periods on which the BLRA rate increases are historically calculated. 
Slide 10 presents the transition payments information and an expected time frame for the filing with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina. Once these events are complete, we will update the CapEx schedule and the corresponding financing plan. 
Now please turn to Slide 11 to review our estimated financing plan through 2018. As a reminder, we have switched to open market purchases instead of issuing new shares to fulfill our 401(k) and DRIP plans, at least until we have fully utilized the net cash proceeds from the sales of CGT and SCI. We do not anticipate the need for further equity issuances until 2017. The election of the fixed-price option would likely change planned equity issuances after 2016. 
It is unlikely that these issuances will occur in the exact amounts or timing as presented, as they are subject to changes in our funding needs for planned project expenses. We continue to adjust the financing to match the related project CapEx on a 50-50 debt and equity basis. 
Now on Slide 12, we are reaffirming our 2016 GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized earnings guidance as $3.90 per share to $4.10 per share with an internal target of $4 per share. Our long-term GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized average annual growth guidance target remains unchanged as we plan to deliver 4% to 6% earnings growth over 3 to 5 years, using a base of 2015's GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized EPS of $3.73. 
I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project."

I'd like to begin by addressing the status of the settlement with the consortium and the PSC approval process. Slide 13 presents the settlement agreement outline that we have previously shown. Westinghouse closed on the transaction to acq",1050,"Thanks, Jimmy. I'd like to begin by addressing the status of the settlement with the consortium and the PSC approval process. 
Slide 13 presents the settlement agreement outline that we have previously shown. Westinghouse closed on the transaction to acquire Stone & Webster from CB&I at the end of December. Fluor began work as the subcontracted construction manager for the new nuclear construction site on January 4. The Kraft employees transitioned to Fluor on April 4. 
While Slide 13 presents cost as of the settlement date, in our next quarterly BLRA update filing to be filed in the next couple of weeks, we plan to update the project costs for estimated change orders, primarily related items listed in Exhibit C of the settlement agreement. As you may recall, Exhibit C described items not resolved in net settlement. 
Listed on Slide 14 are several of those items for which we now have estimated the cost. Also listed are the estimated change orders associated with escrowing the software and documentation necessary to complete the project and new change orders initiated since the settlement that are owner directed. Additional sales tax, which has been excluded from the fixed price option, is also listed. 
Slide 15 presents the relative schedules of both the filing of an update petition and the annual request for revised rates. We continue our analysis of the fixed price option, and we'll consider any input received from Fluor. 
As a reminder, we have until November 1 of this year to unilaterally elect the fixed price option. Regardless of which scenario we choose, once a decision has been made, we will file a petition with the Public Service Commission to amend the capital cost and schedule for the project. We continue to expect to reach a conclusion on the matter sometime during the second quarter, and expect to have a minor delay of a few weeks in filing our annual request for revised rates under the BLRA in order to coordinate the petition with the revised rates application. 
Moving on to some of the activities at the new nuclear construction site. Fluor's integration into the project as Westinghouse's subcontracted construction manager continues to progress, with the placement of managers in key positions of the construction areas in a series of assessments that are taking place to streamline processes and improvement -- I'm sorry, improve performance. 
Slide 16 presents an aerial photo of the site from September of 2015. This photo gives you a view of the layout of the site, and I've labeled both Units 2 and 3, as well as many other areas of the construction site. 
Slide 17 presents a schematic view of the 5 large structural modules that are located inside the containment vessel. This expanded view gives you a better feel for how CA-01 through 05 fits spatially inside of the containment vessel. As you will recall, we have now placed CA-01, CA-04 and CA-05 for Unit 2, and CA-04 for Unit 3. 
Slide 18 shows an aerial view of the Unit 2 containment. Looking down into the containment vessel, you see the first ring section with openings or penetrations sitting on top of the lower bowl. The previously mentioned CA-01, CA-04 and CA-05 have been placed, and can be seen in the picture. 
Slide 19 shows a picture of the Unit 2 CA-02 module. CA-02 is a wall section that forms part of the in-containment refueling water storage tank. As mentioned in previous quarters, CA-02 is now structurally complete and is awaiting installation. 
Slide 20 shows a picture of the Unit 2 CA-03, which is the west wall of the in-containment refueling water storage tank. Fabrication continues as all 17 of CA-03 submodules are on site and standing on the assembly platform. 
Slide 21 shows a picture of the first portion of the Unit 3 module CA20, which was placed during March. This module consists of 4 subassemblies, and the decision was made to expedite placement of subassemblies 3 and 4 as they allow for work to move forward that is required in order to begin shield building erection, which is the next critical path item. 
As you can see on Slide 22, fabrication continues on subassemblies 1 and 2 inside of the module assembly building or MAB. All 72 required submodules are on site. These remaining subassemblies will be placed once they are completed. As a reminder, CA-20 is an auxiliary building module that is located outside and adjacent to the containment vessel. 
Slide 23 shows a picture of the Unit 3 containment vessel ring 1 placement. Ring 1 was placed on top of the containment vessel lower bowl on April 13. 
Slide 24 shows a picture of the Unit 3 module CA-05. This module comprises one of the major wall sections within the containment vessel. Fabrication of the Unit 3 CA-05 has been completed, and it has been staged outside of the MAB. 
Slide 25 shows a picture of the beginnings of the Unit 3 module CA-01. Module CA-01 houses the steam generators and the pressurizer and forms the refueling canal inside the containment vessel. Currently, we have 24 of the 47 submodules on site. Seven of those submodules are upright and being welded together in the MAB. 
Now turn to Slide #26. I want to briefly mention that last week, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina approved SCE&G's request to reduce its electric rates to reflect lower fuel costs. Having a balanced and diversified fuel mix contributes to a fuel cost that will be passed on to our customers. It is anticipated that this decrease should more than offset any increase to residential customers from the BLRA for the year. 
Finally, please now turn to Slide #27 to discuss some of the SCE&G solar initiatives. Under South Carolina law, or Act 236, we are allowed to recover certain costs associated with our efforts to implement renewable energy incentive programs. We officially rolled out our DER program in August of 2015, with the goal of adding approximately 84 megawatts of renewable generating facilities to our system by the end of 2020. We anticipate being almost halfway to our 2020 goal by the end of 2016. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now be glad to spend respond to any questions you might have."

I think the things that are important for our consideration are, unlike the previous contract, where we had certain calendar-based payments, in the new arrangement, we're only paying for work completed. So we should be in a good kind of an equivalent cash flow situation compared to the work completed and not be behind or, if you will, ahead on the cash payments at any point in time from here through the completion. So it's really the progress payments are aligning with the work as it's completed. We are also very focused on the next 6 months. We've got 6 more months before we have to make that decision. And while we'll likely file before then, we don't have to make the technical election with Toshiba until that point. So we plan to monitor the situation.

We'll attach payments to those milestones, and when the -- Westinghouse hits those milestones, we'll make payment to them, but the additional cost just gets spread out over the remainder of the project."

Let me start, and I'll let Jimmy to finish, maybe a little bit on the surety bond, but the surety bond, as you pointed out earlier was there, really to create kind of a soft landing. So it would pay vendors that were in process and allow us to, in a systematic, logical fashion, wind the project down to the point where Toshiba and/or Westinghouse could exit. Now if we're presuming some kind of insolvency or bankruptcy, you'd also have to presume that Westinghouse doesn't survive that, and so, as a, with that provision then, as you're aware, there can be various kinds of bankruptcy and it doesn't necessarily mean that the contractor stops working, but -- so we're working hard to make sure that we're not in advance of payments, and then we have information, which includes source codes, software and proprietary design information that's being escrowed, and the bankruptcy or insolvency would be one of the triggers that gives me that information, and then we would look to finish the plan on our own. We could do that one of a couple of ways: We could either act as our own general contractor, which we would be more comfortable doing now than when we originally signed up for the project since we've made so much progress, and we understand that this construction progress. And we would go out and get a subcontracted construction vendor, presumably Fluor, since they're already on-site, already familiar with means and methods, and know the project; or we could EPC it again. So we could give it to an EPC contractor. Certainly Fluor would be in a good position. They are an EPC contractor. So we could give it to them. So the important part to me is that I have the information that I need to be able to finish the plant on my own, and that's whole reason why we're escrowing."

188244,330349272,966857,"SCANA Corp., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","SCANA Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Susan, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. GAAP earnings in the first quarter of 2016 were $1.23 per share compared to $2.80 per share in the same quarter of 2015. Excluding the net-of-tax gains o",1428,"Thanks, Susan, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. GAAP earnings in the first quarter of 2016 were $1.23 per share compared to $2.80 per share in the same quarter of 2015. Excluding the net-of-tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI, positive earnings drivers from electric margins, primarily due to a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth, as well as the positive impact of the depreciation study were more than offset by the negative impact of weather on both electric margins as well as on gas margins in our Georgia business. 
Gas margins were also down due to CGT operating for a month during the first quarter of 2015 before it was sold. Additionally, expected increases in O&M expenses in CapEx-related items, including interest and property taxes, had a negative impact on earnings. 
At the bottom of the slide, you will note that abnormal weather decreased electric margins by $0.05 per share in the first quarter of 2016 and increased electric margins by $0.05 per share in the first quarter of 2015, resulting in a $0.10 per share negative swing. 
Slide 4 shows earnings on a GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized basis. Earnings in the first quarter of 2016 were $1.28 per share compared to $1.34 per share in the same quarter of 2015. As a reminder, GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized EPS excludes the impact of abnormal weather on electric margins and the net-of-tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI from the first quarter of 2015. Abnormal weather on gas margins is not adjusted in this measure as gas margins are weather-normalized for the North and South Carolina gas businesses, and the direct impact of abnormal weather on the Georgia business is generally insignificant on an annual basis. 
Now on Slide 5, I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. On a GAAP basis, South Carolina Electric and Gas Company's first quarter 2016 earnings were down $0.08 per share compared to the same period of 2015. The decrease in earnings is due to lower electric margins, principally as a result of abnormal weather in both periods, as well as higher O&M expenses and higher expenses related to our capital program, including interest expense and property taxes. These decreases more than offset increases from the continued recovery of financing cost under the BLRA, customer growth, both the electric and gas businesses and the application of the previously mentioned new depreciation rates. 
PSNC Energy reported earnings of $0.25 per share in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $0.24 per share in the same quarter of the prior year, primarily due to higher margins from customer growth. SCANA Energy, which includes SCANA Energy Marketing and SCANA Energy Georgia, showed a decrease in first quarter earnings of $0.06 per share, primarily due to lower throughput attributable to the warmer weather during the first quarter of 2016 as compared to 2015 and higher transportation cost.
On a GAAP basis, SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported relatively flat earnings in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $1.44 per share in the comparative quarter of the prior year. Excluding the net-of-tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI of $1.41 per share, GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized EPS was down $0.03, due primarily to foregone earnings contributed by CGT and SCI prior to the closing of the sales in the first quarter of 2015. 
I would now like to touch on economic trends in our service territory on Slide 6. The Carolinas continue to have a favorable business environment, and we are pleased by the continuous growth in our service territories as evidenced by announcements to invest approximately $380 million, with the expectation of creating approximately 1,300 jobs. At the bottom of the slide, you can see the national unemployment rate along with the rates for the 3 states where SCANA has a presence and the SCE&G electric territory. South Carolina's unemployment rate is now at 5.7%, and the rate in SCE&G's electric territory is estimated at 5%. Of particular interest and attesting to our state's strong economic growth, almost 80,000 or 3.7% more South Carolinians are working today than a year ago. 
Slide 7 presents customer growth in electric sales statistics. On the top half of the slide is the customer growth rate for each of our regulated businesses. SCE&G's electric business added customers at a year-over-year rate of 1.5%. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina added customers at a rate of 2.5% and 2.7%, respectively. We continue to see strong customer growth in our businesses and in the region. 
The bottom table outlines our actual and weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales for the 12 months ended March 31, 2016. Overall, weather-normalized total retail sales were up 1.3% on a 12-month ended basis. 
Now please turn to Slide 8, which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $9.5 billion. As noted in the 2 shades of blue, approximately 86% of this rate base is related to the electric business. 
In the block on the right, you will see SCE&G's base electric business, in which we're allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The earned return for the 12 months ended March 31, 2016, in the base electric business continues at approximately 9.75%, meeting our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA-related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. 
We continue to be pleased with the execution of our strategy. As a reminder, we're allowed a return on equity of 10.25% in our LDC in South Carolina and if the earned ROE of the gas business for the 12 months ending March 31 falls outside a range of 50 basis points above or below the allowed ROE, then we will file to adjust rates under the Rate Stabilization Act in June. As of December 31, 2015, the 12-month earned return for SCE&G gas was 9.65%. 
As you are aware, we recently filed an application with the North Carolina Utilities Commission requesting an annual revenue increase of $41.6 million at PSNC Energy in response to the normal attrition in the earned returns in that business. This rate increase is the result of PSNC's need to recover cost to operate and expand its pipeline system and to implement a pipeline integrity management rider. This rider would allow PSNC to track and receive ongoing recovery of capital expenses related to its distribution and transmission pipeline integrity management programs. 
Slide 9 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast reflects the company's current estimate of new nuclear spending through 2018 and is consistent with last quarter's call and the February quarterly BLRA report, which also reflects the amended EPC agreement that was announced in October of 2015. 
At the bottom of the slide, we recap the estimated new nuclear CWIP from July 1 through June 30 to correspond to the periods on which the BLRA rate increases are historically calculated. 
Slide 10 presents the transition payments information and an expected time frame for the filing with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina. Once these events are complete, we will update the CapEx schedule and the corresponding financing plan. 
Now please turn to Slide 11 to review our estimated financing plan through 2018. As a reminder, we have switched to open market purchases instead of issuing new shares to fulfill our 401(k) and DRIP plans, at least until we have fully utilized the net cash proceeds from the sales of CGT and SCI. We do not anticipate the need for further equity issuances until 2017. The election of the fixed-price option would likely change planned equity issuances after 2016. 
It is unlikely that these issuances will occur in the exact amounts or timing as presented, as they are subject to changes in our funding needs for planned project expenses. We continue to adjust the financing to match the related project CapEx on a 50-50 debt and equity basis. 
Now on Slide 12, we are reaffirming our 2016 GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized earnings guidance as $3.90 per share to $4.10 per share with an internal target of $4 per share. Our long-term GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized average annual growth guidance target remains unchanged as we plan to deliver 4% to 6% earnings growth over 3 to 5 years, using a base of 2015's GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized EPS of $3.73. 
I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project."

Westinghouse closed on the transaction to acq",1050,"Thanks, Jimmy. I'd like to begin by addressing the status of the settlement with the consortium and the PSC approval process. 
Slide 13 presents the settlement agreement outline that we have previously shown. Westinghouse closed on the transaction to acquire Stone & Webster from CB&I at the end of December. Fluor began work as the subcontracted construction manager for the new nuclear construction site on January 4. The Kraft employees transitioned to Fluor on April 4. 
While Slide 13 presents cost as of the settlement date, in our next quarterly BLRA update filing to be filed in the next couple of weeks, we plan to update the project costs for estimated change orders, primarily related items listed in Exhibit C of the settlement agreement. As you may recall, Exhibit C described items not resolved in net settlement. 
Listed on Slide 14 are several of those items for which we now have estimated the cost. Also listed are the estimated change orders associated with escrowing the software and documentation necessary to complete the project and new change orders initiated since the settlement that are owner directed. Additional sales tax, which has been excluded from the fixed price option, is also listed. 
Slide 15 presents the relative schedules of both the filing of an update petition and the annual request for revised rates. We continue our analysis of the fixed price option, and we'll consider any input received from Fluor. 
As a reminder, we have until November 1 of this year to unilaterally elect the fixed price option. Regardless of which scenario we choose, once a decision has been made, we will file a petition with the Public Service Commission to amend the capital cost and schedule for the project. We continue to expect to reach a conclusion on the matter sometime during the second quarter, and expect to have a minor delay of a few weeks in filing our annual request for revised rates under the BLRA in order to coordinate the petition with the revised rates application. 
Moving on to some of the activities at the new nuclear construction site. Fluor's integration into the project as Westinghouse's subcontracted construction manager continues to progress, with the placement of managers in key positions of the construction areas in a series of assessments that are taking place to streamline processes and improvement -- I'm sorry, improve performance. 
Slide 16 presents an aerial photo of the site from September of 2015. This photo gives you a view of the layout of the site, and I've labeled both Units 2 and 3, as well as many other areas of the construction site. 
Slide 17 presents a schematic view of the 5 large structural modules that are located inside the containment vessel. This expanded view gives you a better feel for how CA-01 through 05 fits spatially inside of the containment vessel. As you will recall, we have now placed CA-01, CA-04 and CA-05 for Unit 2, and CA-04 for Unit 3. 
Slide 18 shows an aerial view of the Unit 2 containment. Looking down into the containment vessel, you see the first ring section with openings or penetrations sitting on top of the lower bowl. The previously mentioned CA-01, CA-04 and CA-05 have been placed, and can be seen in the picture. 
Slide 19 shows a picture of the Unit 2 CA-02 module. CA-02 is a wall section that forms part of the in-containment refueling water storage tank. As mentioned in previous quarters, CA-02 is now structurally complete and is awaiting installation. 
Slide 20 shows a picture of the Unit 2 CA-03, which is the west wall of the in-containment refueling water storage tank. Fabrication continues as all 17 of CA-03 submodules are on site and standing on the assembly platform. 
Slide 21 shows a picture of the first portion of the Unit 3 module CA20, which was placed during March. This module consists of 4 subassemblies, and the decision was made to expedite placement of subassemblies 3 and 4 as they allow for work to move forward that is required in order to begin shield building erection, which is the next critical path item. 
As you can see on Slide 22, fabrication continues on subassemblies 1 and 2 inside of the module assembly building or MAB. All 72 required submodules are on site. These remaining subassemblies will be placed once they are completed. As a reminder, CA-20 is an auxiliary building module that is located outside and adjacent to the containment vessel. 
Slide 23 shows a picture of the Unit 3 containment vessel ring 1 placement. Ring 1 was placed on top of the containment vessel lower bowl on April 13. 
Slide 24 shows a picture of the Unit 3 module CA-05. This module comprises one of the major wall sections within the containment vessel. Fabrication of the Unit 3 CA-05 has been completed, and it has been staged outside of the MAB. 
Slide 25 shows a picture of the beginnings of the Unit 3 module CA-01. Module CA-01 houses the steam generators and the pressurizer and forms the refueling canal inside the containment vessel. Currently, we have 24 of the 47 submodules on site. Seven of those submodules are upright and being welded together in the MAB. 
Now turn to Slide #26. I want to briefly mention that last week, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina approved SCE&G's request to reduce its electric rates to reflect lower fuel costs. Having a balanced and diversified fuel mix contributes to a fuel cost that will be passed on to our customers. It is anticipated that this decrease should more than offset any increase to residential customers from the BLRA for the year. 
Finally, please now turn to Slide #27 to discuss some of the SCE&G solar initiatives. Under South Carolina law, or Act 236, we are allowed to recover certain costs associated with our efforts to implement renewable energy incentive programs. We officially rolled out our DER program in August of 2015, with the goal of adding approximately 84 megawatts of renewable generating facilities to our system by the end of 2020. We anticipate being almost halfway to our 2020 goal by the end of 2016. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now be glad to spend respond to any questions you might have."

I think the things that are important for our consideration are, unlike the previous contract, where we had certain calendar-based payments, in the new arrangement, we're only paying for work completed. So we should be in a good kind of an equivalent cash flow situation compared to the work completed and not be behind or, if you will, ahead on the cash payments at any point in time from here through the completion. So it's really the progress payments are aligning with the work as it's completed. We are also very focused on the next 6 months. We've got 6 more months before we have to make that decision. And while we'll likely file before then, we don't have to make the technical election with Toshiba until that point. So we plan to monitor the situation.

Electric margins benefited from a Ba",1856,"Thanks, Susan, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. Earnings in the second quarter of 2016 were $0.74 per share compared to $0.69 per share in the same quarter of 2015. Electric margins benefited from a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth, but were partially offset by milder weather in the second quarter of 2016 when compared to the same quarter of last year and slightly lower average use. Results also improved due to increased gas margins at SCANA Energy and the positive impact of the depreciation study. As you will recall, this is the last quarter that a positive bottom line impact will be realized from this study on a comparative basis. 
Additionally, increases in O&M and property taxes had a negative impact on earnings. At the bottom of the slide, you will note that abnormal weather increased electric margins by $0.05 per share in the second quarter of 2016 and $0.06 per share in the second quarter 2015, resulting in a negative $0.01 per share impact to earnings quarter-over-quarter. Now please turn to Slide 4. Earnings per share for the 6 months ended June 30, 2016 were $1.97 versus $3.49 in 2015. The decline in results is mainly attributable to the net of tax gains from the sale of CGT and SCI, and the negative year-over-year impact from weather. Otherwise, higher electric margins due primarily to a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth as well as the depreciation study impact were offset by lower gas margins and expected increases in O&M and CapEx-related items, including interest and property taxes. 
Electric margins through the first 2 quarters of 2016 were unaffected on a net basis by abnormal weather, which is down $0.11 when compared to the benefit from abnormal weather through June 30, 2015. Now on Slide 5, I'd like to briefly review results from our principal lines of business. South Carolina electric and gas company second quarter 2016 earnings were up $0.02 per share compared to the same period of 2015. The increase in earnings is due to a higher electric margins, principally as a result of the continued recovery of financing costs through the BLRA and customer growth, partially offset by milder weather during the second quarter of 2016 versus the same period of 2015 and lower average use. 
The impact of the previously mentioned depreciation study also contributed to earnings for the quarter. These items were partially offset by an increase in operation and maintenance expenses as well as increases in expenses related to our capital program, including interest expense and property taxes. Year-to-date, SCE&G's earnings were down by $0.06, due primarily to milder weather that was experienced in 2015. PS&G energies reported seasonal flat earnings in the second quarter of 2016, consistent with the same quarter of the prior year. For the 6-month period ended June 30, earnings were up $0.01 per share in 2016 over the comparative period of 2015. 
SCANA Energy, which includes SCANA Energy Marketing and SCANA Energy Georgia, showed an increase in second quarter earnings of $0.02 per share, primarily due to higher margins during the second quarter of 2016 as compared to 2015. Year-to-date earnings are $0.17 per share compared to $0.21 per share in the prior year, down primarily due to milder weather in the first quarter. Additionally, I'm pleased to report that SCANA Energy has been granted a 1-year extension to serve as the regulated provider for the state of Georgia. This additional year will be added on to the current term and will end in August 2018. SCANA Energy has served as a regulated provider since the program's inception in 2002. 
SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported a loss of $0.05 per share in the second quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $0.06 per share in the comparative quarter. For the 6-month period, these businesses reported a loss of $0.05 per share in 2016 compared to earnings of $1.38 in 2015, primarily due to the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI of $1.41 per share, as well as the foregone earnings contributed by CGT and SCI prior to the closing of the sales in the first quarter of 2015. I would now like to touch on economic trends and our service territory on Slide 6.
The Carolinas environment continues to prosper and we are pleased by the continuous growth in our service territories, as evidenced by announcements to invest approximately $1.5 billion with the expectation of creating approximately 3,300 jobs. At the bottom of the slide, you can see the national unemployment rate, along with the rates for the 3 states where SCANA has a presence and the SCE&G electric territory. South Carolina's unemployment rate is now at 5.4% and the rate in SCE&G's electric territory is estimated at 4.4%. Attesting to our state's strong economic growth, almost 70,000 more South Carolinians are working today than a year ago. Slide 7 presents customer growth and electric sales statistics.
On the top half of the slide is the customer growth rate for each of our regulated businesses. SCE&G's electric business added customers at a year-over-year rate of 1.6%. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina added customers at a rate of 3% and 2.9%, respectively. This is the first time TS&C growth rate has hit 3% since the early stages of the 2008 recession. We continue to see strong customer growth in our businesses and in the region, which is a key fundamental. The bottom table outlines our actual and weather normalized kilowatt-hour sales for the 12 months ended June 30, 2016. Overall with the normalized total retail sales are up 0.3% on a 12-month ended basis. 
Now please turn to Slide 8, which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $9.7 billion. As denoted in the 2 shades of blue, approximately 85% of this rate base is related to the electric business. On the block on the right, you will see SCE&G's base electric business from which we're allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The earned return for the 12 months ended June 30, 2016 in the base electric business continues to meet our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA rated base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. We continue to be pleased with the acquisition of our strategy. 
As a reminder, we're allowed a return on equity of 10.25% in our gas LDC in South Carolina. If the earned ROE of the gas business for the 12 months ended March 31 falls outside the range of 50 basis points above or below the allowed ROE, then we file to adjust rates under the Rate Stabilization Act. As of March 31, 2016, the 12-month earned return was below the band and we recently filed for an annual increase of approximately $4 million in mid-June. As you are also aware, during the first quarter of 2016, we filed an application with the North Carolina utilities commission requesting an annual revenue increases of $41.6 million at PSNC Energy in response to the normal attrition and early returns in that business. This rate increase is the result of PSNC's need to recover cost to operate and expand its pipeline system and to implement a pipeline integrity management rider. The rider would allow PSNC to track and receive ongoing recovery of capital expenses related to this distribution and transmission pipeline integrity management programs. 
Our hearing with the North Carolina utilities commission on this rate case is scheduled for August 30. Slide 9 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast reflects the company's current estimate of new nuclear spending through 2018 and reflects the fixed price option spending as represented in the petition testimony as filed on July 1. As a reminder, these schedules reflect the existing payment plan and do not incorporate the construction payment milestone schedule as it is still under negotiation. Therefore, it is unlikely that the timing of these expenditures were -- will occur as presented. At the bottom of the slide, we recap the estimated new nuclear equip from July 1 through June 30 to correspond to the periods on which the BLRA rate increases are historically calculated. Slide 10 presents information regarding certain transitional payments being made in 2016 as it pertains to the construction payment milestone schedule and the settlement agreement. 
Once the construction payment milestone schedule is complete, we will update the CapEx schedule and the corresponding financing plan. Now please turn to Slide 11 to review our estimated financing plan through 2018. In June of this year, SCE&G issued $425 million, a 30-year bond at 4.1% and reopened and issued $75 million of bonds as part of a previous 4.5% series due June 1, 2064. Additionally, PSNC issued a 30-year private placement of $100 million at 4.13%. I would like to thank our banks and fixed income investors for their support of our liquidity needs. 
As a reminder, we have switched to open market purchases instead of issuing new shares to fulfill our 401(k) and DRIP plans until we fully utilized the net cash proceeds from the sales of CGT and SCI. We do not anticipate the need for further equity issuances until 2017. It is unlikely that these issuances will occur in the exact amounts or timing as presented as they are subject to changes in our funding needs for our uplanned project expenses. We continue to adjust the financing to match the related project CapEx on a 50-50 debt and equity basis. Again, this financing plan does not represent the election of the fixed-price option and we will conform this plan and the CapEx plan once we reach agreement on the construction payment milestone schedule later this year. 
On Slide 12. we're reaffirming our 2016 GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized earnings guidance as $3.90 per share to $4.10 per share with an internal target of $4 per share. However, I did want to take a moment and revise our operation and maintenance expense projection for the year. We previously issued O&M guidance for 2016 of approximately 2% higher than 2015. O&M has since outpaced that guidance rate, primarily due to increasing pension expense, which is offset with the pension rider in revenues and higher incentive compensation accruals as a result of the year-to-date stock performance. 
Pension expense has increased due to the lower discount rate associated with falling interest rates, which is applied to the projected liability. Although this incremental pension expense has no net effect on bottom line earnings, we are updating our O&M guidance for 2016 to approximate 4% higher than 2015. Our long-term GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized average annual growth guidance target remains unchanged as we plan to deliver 4% to 6% earnings growth over 3 to 5 years, using a base of 2015's GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized EPS of $3.73 per share. 
And I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project."

I'd like to begin by addressing the status of our current regulatory proceedings. Slide 13 presents the relative schedules for 2 filings. The first is an update petition, which includes our selection of the fixed-price option and the second is our annual request for revised rates. At the beginning of July, we filed our direct testimony for our update petition and anticipate a hearing in October with an order in late November. The Office of Regulatory Staff or ORS, will be issuing the report some time in the next month or so, regarding our annual request for revised rates and we also anticipate that concluding in late November. 
Slide 14 presents the projected cost associated with our update petition. Please note that we have removed the additional transmission costs originally requested in the petition from our testimony filing as we are evaluating other alternatives to installing additional capacitors in the Unit 1 switch out. Moving on to some of the activities of the new nuclear construction site. Slide 15 presents an aerial photo of what we call the tabletop from June of this year. This photo gives you a view of the layout of the site, and I believe with both Units 2 and 3 as well as many of the other areas of the construction site. Slide 16 presents a schematic view of the 5 large structural modules that are located inside the containment vessel. 
As you'll recall, we have previously placed module CA-01, 04 and 05 for Unit 2, and CA-04 and 05 for Unit 3. And more recently, we placed module CA-03 for Unit 2, which you'll see shortly. Slide 17 shows an aerial view of the in 2 nuclear island in containment from last week. Looking down at the containment vessel, you can see the first ring section as well as modules CA-01, 03, 04 and 05. Outside the containment vessel, you can see ancillary building module CA20, the shield building, which surrounds the containment vessel and the battery room. Slide 18 shows a few pictures of the Unit 2 CA-02 module. CA-02 is a wall section that forms part of the in containment refueling storage tank. CA-02 is structurally complete and should be installed this quarter. 
Slide 19 shows a picture of the Unit 2 CA-03 module, which is the west wall of the in-containment refilling water storage tank. This module was set in place last week. Slide 20 shows the continued fabrication of subassemblies 1 and 2, for the unit 3 module CA20. This is an auxiliary building module that is located outside and adjacent to the containment vessel. As you may recall, this module consists of 4 subassemblies and subassemblies 3 and 4 were previously placed in an effort to move forward with the shield building erection, which is the next critical path item. All required submodules for subassemblies 1 and 2 are on-site and they're replaced once fabrication is complete. 
Slide 21 shows a picture of the fabrication of the Unit 3 module CA-01. This module houses the same generators and the pressurizer and forms a fueling canal inside the containment vessel. Currently, all 47 submodules are on-site and 21 of those submodules are upright and being welded together in the Module Assembly Building. On Slide 22, you can see 1 of the 2 steam generators for unit 3 that arrived on the construction site in late April. It was transported from Port of Charleston on a specifically designed rail car. This steam generator weigh approximately 1.3 million pounds, hits about 20 feet in diameter and it's almost 82 feet long. The other unit 3 steam generator and the last 1 for the project is scheduled to be delivered during the fourth quarter of this year. 
Slide 23 shows a picture of the Sanmen plant in China. This past May, Westinghouse completed the coal hydrostatic testing at Sanmen Unit 1. The successful completion of this test confirms that they reactor systems, meet the design pressures under operating and excellent conditions. This is great news for the AP1000 design and Sanmen Unit 1 is expected to load fuel by the end of the year. Another Chinese AP1000 unit high on Unit 1 completed its coal hydro test in early July. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now be glad to respond to any questions you might have."

I don't expect anything necessarily to change from that review, say for perhaps the number of hours it might take and shifts that they would have to put on, that kind of thing. So we're -- the goal of that schedule review was to hold the dates constant and see what it would take to accomplish those dates. So I don't expect anything dramatic to come from that. With respect to milestones. The CA-03 list and set for Unit 2 was completed last week, as I think you saw in the photographs. We would intend to set the second half of auxiliary building module CA20 probably next week. If not, then the week after. So we're actually taking the end of the Module Assembly Building as we speak in order to get that module out. So that will be another large lift. That will be for Unit 3. We've got a module stock called CA-02, which should be the last of the Big 5 modules in the Unit 2 containment building, and that should come later in August. And then we've got conductor sections that we'll be setting for Unit 3 at the turbine building site and one of our goals this year is to set and align the reactor vessel for Unit 2. And we hope to do that sometime in September."

So the housing growth you might look like this in the electric growth is 1.6%.

It so much more affordable with the price of shale gas today in the market for folks to use it for heating and water heating and things of that nature. So you've got kind of the double benefit of that, if you will. So and they think it's kind of interesting I was looking at some stats earlier about the economic projections for the Carolina's. And for the first time in several years, the multiunit housing is projected over the next couple of years to drop as far as the number of units in single-family housing is projected to increase. And South Carolina single-family are projected over the next couple of years to go up 20% while multi-family is projected to go down to 20% -- down 20% North Carolina is even more exaggerated, up 25% and down 35%. I think what we're reaching is more of this kind of a relative saturation of this multiunit on a relative basis. I'm not saying there won't be more build but compared to the single-family unit they're starting to see single-family go faster than the multi-family they're just going to see a lot more the single-family units using natural gas, so I think that's going to be a big driver as well."

Electric margins benefited from a Ba",1859,"Thanks, Susan, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. Earnings in the second quarter of 2016 were $0.74 per share compared to $0.69 per share in the same quarter of 2015. Electric margins benefited from a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth, but were partially offset by milder weather in the second quarter of 2016 when compared to the same quarter of last year and slightly lower average use. Results also improved due to increased gas margins at SCANA Energy and the positive impact of the depreciation study. As you will recall, this is the last quarter that a positive bottom line impact will be realized from this study on a comparative basis. 
Additionally, increases in O&M and property taxes had a negative impact on earnings. At the bottom of the slide, you will note that abnormal weather increased electric margins by $0.05 per share in the second quarter of 2016 and $0.06 per share in the second quarter 2015, resulting in a negative $0.01 per share impact to earnings quarter-over-quarter. 
Please turn to Slide 4. Earnings per share for the 6 months ended June 30, 2016, were $1.97 versus $3.49 in 2015. The decline in results is mainly attributable to the net of tax gains on the sale of CGT and SCI, and the negative year-over-year impact from weather. Otherwise, higher electric margins due primarily to a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth as well as the depreciation study impact were offset by lower gas margins and expected increases in O&M and CapEx-related items, including interest and property taxes. Electric margins through the first 2 quarters of 2016 were unaffected on a net basis by abnormal weather, which is down $0.11 when compared to the benefit from abnormal weather through June 30, 2015. 
Now on Slide 5, I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. South Carolina Electric and Gas Company second quarter 2016 earnings were up $0.02 per share compared to the same period of 2015. The increase in earnings is due to higher electric margins, principally as a result of the continued recovery of financing cost through the BLRA and customer growth, partially offset by milder weather during the second quarter of 2016 versus the same period of 2015 and lower average use. The impact of the previously mentioned depreciation study also contributed to earnings for the quarter. These items were partially offset by an increase in operation and maintenance expenses as well as increases in expenses related to our capital program, including interest expense and property taxes. Year-to-date, SCE&G's earnings were down by $0.06 due primarily to milder weather that was experienced in 2015. PSNC Energy has reported seasonal flat earnings in the second quarter of 2016, consistent with the same quarter of the prior year. For the 6-month period ended June 30, earnings were up $0.01 per share in 2016 over the comparative period of 2015. 
SCANA Energy, which includes SCANA Energy Marketing and SCANA Energy Georgia, showed an increase in second quarter earnings of $0.02 per share, primarily due to higher margins during the second quarter of 2016 as compared to 2015. Year-to-date earnings are $0.17 per share compared to $0.21 per share in the prior year, down primarily due to milder weather in the first quarter. Additionally, I'm pleased to report that SCANA Energy has been granted a 1-year extension to serve as a regulated provider for the state of Georgia. This additional year will be added on to the current term and will end in August 2018. SCANA Energy has served as a regulated provider since the program's inception in 2002. 
SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported a loss of $0.05 per share in the second quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $0.06 per share in the comparative quarter. For the 6-month period, these businesses reported a loss of $0.05 per share in 2016 compared to earnings of $1.38 in 2015, primarily due to the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI of $1.41 per share as well as the foregone earnings contributed by CGT and SCI prior to the closing of the sales in the first quarter of 2015. 
I would now like to touch on economic trends and our service territory on Slide 6. The Carolinas' environment continues to prosper and we are pleased by the continuous growth in our service territories, as evidenced by announcements to invest approximately $1.5 billion with the expectation of creating approximately 3,300 jobs. At the bottom of the slide, you can see the national unemployment rate, along with the rates for the 3 states where SCANA has a presence and the SCE&G Electric territory. South Carolina's unemployment rate is now at 5.4% and the rate in SCE&G's Electric territory is estimated at 4.4%. Attesting to our state's strong economic growth, almost 70,000 more South Carolinians are working today than a year ago. 
Slide 7 presents customer growth and electric sales statistics. On the top half of the slide is the customer growth rate for each of our regulated businesses. SCE&G's Electric business added customers at a year-over-year rate of 1.6%. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina added customers at a rate of 3% and 2.9%, respectively. This is the first time PSNC's growth rate has hit 3% since the early stages of the 2008 recession. We continue to see strong customer growth in our businesses and in the region, which is a key fundamental. The bottom table outlines our actual and weather normalized kilowatt-hour sales for the 12 months ended June 30, 2016. Overall we're -- the normalized total retail sales are up 0.3% on a 12-month ended basis. 
Now please turn to Slide 8, which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $9.7 billion. As denoted in the 2 shades of blue, approximately 85% of this rate base is related to the electric business. In the block on the right, you will see SCE&G's base electric business from which we're allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The earned return for the 12 months ended June 30, 2016, in the base electric business continues to meet our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA rated base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. We continue to be pleased with the execution of our strategy. 
As a reminder, we're allowed a return on equity of 10.25% in our gas LDC in South Carolina. If the earned ROE of the gas business for the 12 months ended March 31 falls outside the range of 50 basis points above or below the allowed ROE, then we file to adjust rates under the Rate Stabilization Act. As of March 31, 2016, the 12-month earned return was below the band and we recently filed for an annual increase of approximately $4 million in mid-June. 
As you are also aware, during the first quarter of 2016, we filed an application with the North Carolina Utilities Commission requesting annual revenue increases of $41.6 million at PSNC Energy in response to the normal attrition and the earned returns in that business. This rate increase is the result of PSNC's need to recover cost to operate and expand its pipeline system and to implement a pipeline integrity management rider. The rider would allow PSNC to track and receive ongoing recovery of capital expenses related to its distribution and transmission pipeline integrity management programs. A hearing with the North Carolina Utilities Commission on this rate case is scheduled for August 30. 
Slide 9 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast reflects the company's current estimate of new nuclear spending through 2018 and reflects the fixed price option spending as represented in the petition testimony and is filed on July 1. As a reminder, these schedules reflect the existing payment plan and do not incorporate the construction payment milestone schedule as it is still under negotiation. Therefore, it is unlikely that the timing of these expenditures were -- will occur as presented. At the bottom of the slide, we recap the estimated new nuclear equip from July 1 through June 30 to correspond to the periods on which the BLRA rate increases are historically calculated. 
Slide 10 presents information regarding certain transitional payments being made in 2016 as it pertains to the construction payment milestone schedule and the settlement agreement. Once the construction payment milestone schedule is complete, we will update the CapEx schedule and the corresponding financing plan. 
Now please turn to Slide 11 to review our estimated financing plan through 2018. In June of this year, SCE&G issued $425 million of 30-year bonds at 4.1%, and reopened and issued $75 million of bonds as part of a previous 4.5% series due June 1, 2064. Additionally, PSNC issued a 30-year private placement of $100 million at 4.13%. I would like to thank our banks and fixed income investors for their support of our liquidity needs. 
As a reminder, we have switched to open market purchases instead of issuing new shares to fulfill our 401(k) and DRIP plans at least until we fully utilized the net cash proceeds from the sales of CGT and SCI. We do not anticipate the need for further equity issuances until 2017. It is unlikely that these issuances will occur in the exact amounts or timing as presented, as they are subject to changes in our funding needs for planned project expenses. We continue to adjust the financing to match the related project CapEx on a 50-50 debt and equity basis. Again, this financing plan does not represent the election of the fixed price option. And we will conform this plan and the CapEx plan once we reach agreement on the construction payment milestone schedule later this year. 
On Slide 12, we're reaffirming our 2016 GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized earnings guidance as $3.90 per share to $4.10 per share with an internal target of $4 per share. However, I did want to take a moment and revise our operation and maintenance expense projection for the year. We previously issued O&M guidance for 2016 of approximately 2% higher than 2015. O&M has since outpaced that guidance rate, primarily due to increasing pension expense, which is offset with the pension rider in revenues and higher incentive compensation accruals as a result of the year-to-date stock performance. 
Pension expense has increased due to the lower discount rate associated with falling interest rates, which is applied to the projected liability. Although this incremental pension expense has no net effect on bottom line earnings, we are updating our O&M guidance for 2016 to approximate 4% higher than 2015. Our long-term GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized average annual growth guidance target remains unchanged as we plan to deliver 4% to 6% earnings growth over 3 to 5 years using a base of 2015's GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized EPS of $3.73 per share. 
And I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project."

At the beginning of July, we filed our direct testimony for our update petition and anticipate a hearing in October with an order in late November. The Office of Regulatory Staff, or ORS, will be issuing their report sometime in the next month or so regarding our annual request for revised rates. And we also anticipate that concluding in late November. 
Slide 14 presents the projected cost associated with our update petition. Please note that we have removed the additional transmission cost originally requested in the petition from our testimony filing, as we are evaluating other alternatives to installing additional capacitors in the Unit 1 switch out [ph],
Moving on to some of the activities at the new nuclear construction site. Slide 15 presents an aerial photo of what we call the tabletop from June of this year. This photo gives you a view of the layout of the site and have labeled both Units 2 and 3 as well as many of the other areas of the construction site. 
Slide 16 presents a schematic view of the 5 large structural modules that are located inside the containment vessel. As you will recall, we have previously placed module CA01, 04 and 05 for Unit 2, and CA04 and 05 for Unit 3. And more recently, we placed module CA03 for Unit 2, which you'll see shortly. 
Slide 17 shows an aerial view of the Unit 2 nuclear round and containment from last week. Looking down in the containment vessel, you can see the first ring section as well as modules CA01, 03, 04 and 05. Outside the containment vessel, you can see auxillary building module CA20, the shield building, which surrounds the containment vessel and the battery room. 
Slide 18 shows a few pictures of the Unit 2 CA02 module. CA02 is a wall section that forms part of the in-containment refilling water storage tank. CA02 is structurally complete and should be installed this quarter. 
Slide 19 shows a picture of the Unit 2 CA03 module, which is the west wall of the in-containment refilling water storage tank. This module was set in place last week. 
Slide 20 shows the continued fabrication of subassemblies 1 and 2 for the Unit 3 module CA20. This is an auxiliary building module that is located outside and adjacent to the containment vessel. As you may recall, this module consists of 4 subassemblies, and subassemblies 3 and 4 were previously placed in an effort to move forward with the shield building erection, which is the next critical path item. All required submodules for subassemblies 1 and 2 are on-site and they'll be placed once fabrication is complete. 
Slide 21 shows a picture of the fabrication of the Unit 3 module CA01. This module houses the steam generators and the pressurizer, and forms a refueling canal inside the containment vessel. Currently, all 47 submodules are on-site, and 21 of those submodules are upright and being welded together in the Module Assembly Building. 
On Slide 22, you can see one of the 2 steam generators for Unit 3 that arrived on the construction site in late April. It was transported from the Port of Charleston on a specifically designed rail car. This steam generator weighs approximately 1.3 million pounds. It's about 20 feet in diameter and it's almost 82 feet long. The other Unit 3 steam generator and the last one for the project is scheduled to be delivered during the fourth quarter of this year. 
Slide 23 shows a picture of the Sanmen plant in China. This past May, Westinghouse completed the coal hydrostatic testing at Sanmen Unit 1. The successful completion of this test confirms that the reactive systems meet design pressures under operating and excellent conditions.

The guaranteed substantial completion dates remain at August of 2019 to August of 2020 for Unit 3. We don't see anything to change those. Fluor review of the schedule is really something that should conclude somewhere in the third quarter. And then they will be giving that to Westinghouse. And remember that on the project now, we're dealing just with Westinghouse. Fluor is a subcontractor to Westinghouse. I don't expect anything necessarily to change from that review, say for perhaps the number of hours it might take and shifts that they would have to put on, that kind of thing. So we're -- the goal of that schedule review was to hold the dates constant and see what it would take to accomplish those dates. So I don't expect anything dramatic to come from that. With respect to milestones, the CA03 lift and set for Unit 2 was completed last week, as I think you saw in the photographs. We would intend to set the second half of auxiliary building module CA20 probably next week, if not, then the week after. So we're actually taking the end off the Module Assembly Building as we speak in order to get that module out. So that will be another large lift. That will be for Unit 3. We've got a module stock called CA02, which should be the last of the big 5 modules to go in the Unit 2 containment building. That should come later in August. And then we've got condenser sections that we'll be setting for Unit 3, that's the turbine building side. And one of our goals this year is to set and align the reactor vessel for Unit 2, and we hope to do that sometime in September."

Year-to-date for SCANA from the electric side of the business for 2016, there's no impact from weather compared to our plan. Now there is impact compared to 2015's first half of the year because it was very cold in Q1 of '15 and very warm in Q2 of '15. But for 2016, the weather has been ""normal"" on a net basis. We were -- it was mild in Q1, but it was warmer in Q2. So we're kind of on plan from a weather standpoint through midyear. Now I don't really pay a lot of attention to trailing 12 months when it straddles year-end like that because there's so much difference in our business with the BLRA increases that are near calendar year end. In the past, it's been around 1st of November. Now they'll be a little later than that as well as our RSA increases when they occur in the LDC in South Carolina.

So the housing growth -- you might look at it like this. In the electric growth is 1.6%. So most of those, not all, but most of those are going to have gas if it's accessible because it's so much more affordable and it's a fuel of choice. People like it. I personally like it. I like it for heater, a water heater, clothes dryer, et cetera. But then on top of that you've got penetration of existing homes. Because of the price, it's so much more affordable with the price of shale gas today in the market for folks to use it for heating and water heating and things of that nature. So you've got kind of the double benefit of that, if you will. So -- and I think it's kind of interesting. I was looking at some stats earlier today about the economic projections for the Carolinas. And for the first time in several years, the multiunit housing is projected over the next couple of years to drop as far as the number of units and single-family housing is projected to increase. In South Carolina, single-family permits are projected over the next couple of years to go up 20% while multi-family is projected to go down to 20% -- down 20% North Carolina is even more exaggerated, up 25% and down 35%. I think what we're reaching is more of this kind of a relative saturation of this multiunit on a relative basis. I'm not saying there won't be more built.  But compared to the single-family units, you're starting to see single families grow faster than the multi-family. And you're just going to see a lot more of those single-family units using natural gas, so I think that's going to be a big driver as well."

And in South Carolina gas business, you've got the Rate Stabilization Act that captures any of that on -- the most you've had is a 1-year lag, so it's really not a big impact for us. So we don't model it in and spend a lot of time on that. I'm sure we could -- I could get that answer, but I just don't have it with me today."

Electric margins benefited from a Ba",1857,"Thanks, Susan, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. Earnings in the second quarter of 2016 were $0.74 per share compared to $0.69 per share in the same quarter of 2015. Electric margins benefited from a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth, but were partially offset by milder weather in the second quarter of 2016 when compared to the same quarter of last year and slightly lower average use. Results also improved due to increased gas margins at SCANA Energy and the positive impact of the depreciation study. As you will recall, this is the last quarter that a positive bottom line impact will be realized from this study on a comparative basis. 
Additionally, increases in O&M and property taxes had a negative impact on earnings. At the bottom of the slide, you will note that abnormal weather increased electric margins by $0.05 per share in the second quarter of 2016 and $0.06 per share in the second quarter 2015, resulting in a negative $0.01 per share impact to earnings quarter-over-quarter. 
Please turn to Slide 4. Earnings per share for the 6 months ended June 30, 2016, were $1.97 versus $3.49 in 2015. The decline in results is mainly attributable to the net of tax gains on the sale of CGT and SCI, and the negative year-over-year impact from weather. Otherwise, higher electric margins due primarily to a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth as well as the depreciation study impact were offset by lower gas margins and expected increases in O&M and CapEx-related items, including interest and property taxes. Electric margins through the first 2 quarters of 2016 were unaffected on a net basis by abnormal weather, which is down $0.11 when compared to the benefit from abnormal weather through June 30, 2015. 
Now on Slide 5, I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. South Carolina Electric and Gas Company second quarter 2016 earnings were up $0.02 per share compared to the same period of 2015. The increase in earnings is due to higher electric margins, principally as a result of the continued recovery of financing cost through the BLRA and customer growth, partially offset by milder weather during the second quarter of 2016 versus the same period of 2015 and lower average use. The impact of the previously mentioned depreciation study also contributed to earnings for the quarter. These items were partially offset by an increase in operation and maintenance expenses as well as increases in expenses related to our capital program, including interest expense and property taxes. Year-to-date, SCE&G's earnings were down by $0.06 due primarily to milder weather that was experienced in 2015. PSNC Energies reported seasonal flat earnings in the second quarter of 2016, consistent with the same quarter of the prior year. For the 6-month period ended June 30, earnings were up $0.01 per share in 2016 over the comparative period of 2015. 
SCANA Energy, which includes SCANA Energy Marketing and SCANA Energy Georgia, showed an increase in second quarter earnings of $0.02 per share, primarily due to higher margins during the second quarter of 2016 as compared to 2015. Year-to-date earnings are $0.17 per share compared to $0.21 per share in the prior year, down primarily due to milder weather in the first quarter. Additionally, I'm pleased to report that SCANA Energy has been granted a 1-year extension to serve as the regulated provider for the state of Georgia. This additional year will be added on to the current term and will end in August 2018. SCANA Energy has served as a regulated provider since the program's inception in 2002. 
SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported a loss of $0.05 per share in the second quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $0.06 per share in the comparative quarter. For the 6-month period, these businesses reported a loss of $0.05 per share in 2016 compared to earnings of $1.38 in 2015, primarily due to the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI of $1.41 per share as well as the foregone earnings contributed by CGT and SCI prior to the closing of the sales in the first quarter of 2015. 
I would now like to touch on economic trends and our service territory on Slide 6. The Carolinas' environment continues to prosper and we are pleased by the continuous growth in our service territories, as evidenced by announcements to invest approximately $1.5 billion with the expectation of creating approximately 3,300 jobs. At the bottom of the slide, you can see the national unemployment rate, along with the rates for the 3 states where SCANA has a presence and the SCE&G Electric territory. South Carolina's unemployment rate is now at 5.4% and the rate in SCE&G's Electric territory is estimated at 4.4%. Attesting to our state's strong economic growth, almost 70,000 more South Carolinians are working today than a year ago. 
Slide 7 presents customer growth and electric sales statistics. On the top half of the slide is the customer growth rate for each of our regulated businesses. SCE&G's Electric business added customers at a year-over-year rate of 1.6%. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina added customers at a rate of 3% and 2.9%, respectively. This is the first time PSNC's growth rate has hit 3% since the early stages of the 2008 recession. We continue to see strong customer growth in our businesses and in the region, which is a key fundamental. The bottom table outlines our actual and weather normalized kilowatt-hour sales for the 12 months ended June 30, 2016. Overall where the normalized total retail sales are up 0.3% on a 12-month ended basis. 
Now please turn to Slide 8, which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $9.7 billion. As denoted in the 2 shades of blue, approximately 85% of this rate base is related to the electric business. In the block on the right, you will see SCE&G's base electric business from which we're allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The earned return for the 12 months ended June 30, 2016, in the base electric business continues to meet our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA rated base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. We continue to be pleased with the execution of our strategy. 
As a reminder, we're allowed a return on equity of 10.25% in our gas LDC in South Carolina. If the earned ROE of the gas business for the 12 months ended March 31 falls outside the range of 50 basis points above or below the allowed ROE, then we file to adjust rates under the Rate Stabilization Act. As of March 31, 2016, the 12-month earned return was below the band and we recently filed for an annual increase of approximately $4 million in mid-June. 
As you are also aware, during the first quarter of 2016, we filed an application with the North Carolina Utilities Commission requesting annual revenue increases of $41.6 million at PSNC Energy in response to the normal attrition and the earned returns in that business. This rate increase is the result of PSNC's need to recover cost to operate and expand its pipeline system and to implement a pipeline integrity management rider. The rider would allow PSNC to track and receive ongoing recovery of capital expenses related to its distribution and transmission pipeline integrity management programs. A hearing with the North Carolina Utilities Commission on this rate case is scheduled for August 30. 
Slide 9 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast reflects the company's current estimate of new nuclear spending through 2018 and reflects the fixed price option spending as represented in the petition testimony and is filed on July 1. As a reminder, these schedules reflect the existing payment plan and do not incorporate the construction payment milestone schedule as it is still under negotiation. Therefore, it is unlikely that the timing of these expenditures were -- will occur as presented. At the bottom of the slide, we recap the estimated new nuclear equip from July 1 through June 30 to correspond to the periods on which the BLRA rate increases are historically calculated. 
Slide 10 presents information regarding certain transitional payments being made in 2016 as it pertains to the construction payment milestone schedule and the settlement agreement. Once the construction payment milestone schedule is complete, we will update the CapEx schedule and the corresponding financing plan. 
Now please turn to Slide 11 to review our estimated financing plan through 2018. In June of this year, SCE&G issued $425 million of 30-year bonds at 4.1%, and reopened and issued $75 million of bonds as part of a previous 4.5% series due June 1, 2064. Additionally, PSNC issued a 30-year private placement of $100 million at 4.13%. I would like to thank our banks and fixed income investors for their support of our liquidity needs. 
As a reminder, we have switched to open market purchases instead of issuing new shares to fulfill our 401(k) and DRIP plans at least until we fully utilized the net cash proceeds from the sales of CGT and SCI. We do not anticipate the need for further equity issuances until 2017. It is unlikely that these issuances will occur in the exact amounts or timing as presented, as they are subject to changes in our funding needs for planned project expenses. We continue to adjust the financing to match the related project CapEx on a 50-50 debt and equity basis. Again, this financing plan does not represent the election of the fixed price option. And we will conform this plan and the CapEx plan once we reach agreement on the construction payment milestone schedule later this year. 
On Slide 12, we're reaffirming our 2016 GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized earnings guidance as $3.90 per share to $4.10 per share with an internal target of $4 per share. However, I did want to take a moment and revise our operation and maintenance expense projection for the year. We previously issued O&M guidance for 2016 of approximately 2% higher than 2015. O&M has since outpaced that guidance rate, primarily due to increasing pension expense, which is offset with the pension rider in revenues and higher incentive compensation accruals as a result of the year-to-date stock performance. 
Pension expense has increased due to the lower discount rate associated with falling interest rates, which is applied to the projected liability. Although this incremental pension expense has no net effect on bottom line earnings, we are updating our O&M guidance for 2016 to approximate 4% higher than 2015. Our long-term GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized average annual growth guidance target remains unchanged as we plan to deliver 4% to 6% earnings growth over 3 to 5 years using a base of 2015's GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized EPS of $3.73 per share. 
And I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project."

I'd like to begin by addressing the status of our current regulatory proceedings. 
Slide 13 presents the relative schedules for 2 filings. The first is an update petition, which includes our selection of the fixed-price option and the second is our annual request for revised rates. At the beginning of July, we filed our direct testimony for our update petition and anticipate a hearing in October with an order in late November. The Office of Regulatory Staff, or ORS, will be issuing their report sometime in the next month or so regarding our annual request for revised rates. And we also anticipate that concluding in late November. 
Slide 14 presents the projected cost associated with our update petition. Please note that we have removed the additional transmission cost originally requested in the petition from our testimony filing, as we are evaluating other alternatives to installing additional capacitors in the Unit 1 switch chart.
Moving on to some of the activities at the new nuclear construction site. Slide 15 presents an aerial photo of what we call the tabletop from June of this year. This photo gives you a view of the layout of the site and have labeled both Units 2 and 3 as well as many of the other areas of the construction site. 
Slide 16 presents a schematic view of the 5 large structural modules that are located inside the containment vessel. As you will recall, we have previously placed module CA01, 04 and 05 for Unit 2, and CA04 and 05 for Unit 3. And more recently, we placed module CA03 for Unit 2, which you'll see shortly. 
Slide 17 shows an aerial view of the Unit 2 nuclear round and containment from last week. Looking down in the containment vessel, you can see the first ring section as well as modules CA01, 03, 04 and 05. Outside the containment vessel, you can see auxillary building module CA20, the shield building, which surrounds the containment vessel and the battery room. 
Slide 18 shows a few pictures of the Unit 2 CA02 module. CA02 is a wall section that forms part of the in-containment refilling water storage tank. CA02 is structurally complete and should be installed this quarter. 
Slide 19 shows a picture of the Unit 2 CA03 module, which is the west wall of the in-containment refilling water storage tank. This module was set in place last week. 
Slide 20 shows the continued fabrication of subassemblies 1 and 2 for the Unit 3 module CA20. This is an auxiliary building module that is located outside and adjacent to the containment vessel. As you may recall, this module consists of 4 subassemblies, and subassemblies 3 and 4 were previously placed in an effort to move forward with the shield building erection, which is the next critical path item. All required submodules for subassemblies 1 and 2 are on-site and they'll be placed once fabrication is complete. 
Slide 21 shows a picture of the fabrication of the Unit 3 module CA01. This module houses the steam generators and the pressurizer, and forms a refueling canal inside the containment vessel. Currently, all 47 submodules are on-site, and 21 of those submodules are upright and being welded together in the Module Assembly Building. 
On Slide 22, you can see one of the 2 steam generators for Unit 3 that arrived on the construction site in late April. It was transported from the Port of Charleston on a specifically designed rail car. This steam generator weighs approximately 1.3 million pounds. It's about 20 feet in diameter and it's almost 82 feet long. The other Unit 3 steam generator and the last one for the project is scheduled to be delivered during the fourth quarter of this year. 
Slide 23 shows a picture of the Sanmen plant in China. This past May, Westinghouse completed the coal hydrostatic testing at Sanmen Unit 1. The successful completion of this test confirms that the reactive systems meet design pressures under operating and excellent conditions. This is great news for the AP1000 design, and Sanmen Unit 1 is expected to load fuel by the end of the year. Another Chinese AP1000 unit, Haiyang Unit 1, completed its cold hydro test in early July. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now be glad to respond to any questions you might have."

And remember that on the project now, we're dealing just with Westinghouse. Fluor is a subcontractor to Westinghouse. I don't expect anything necessarily to change from that review, save for perhaps the number of hours it might take and shifts that they would have to put on, that kind of thing. So we're -- the goal of that schedule review was to hold the dates constant and see what it would take to accomplish those dates. So I don't expect anything dramatic to come from that. With respect to milestones, the CA03 lift and set for Unit 2 was completed last week, as I think you saw in the photographs. We would intend to set the second half of auxiliary building module CA20 probably next week, if not, then the week after. So we're actually taking the end off the Module Assembly Building as we speak in order to get that module out. So that will be another large lift. That will be for Unit 3. We've got a module stock called CA02, which should be the last of the big 5 modules to go in the Unit 2 containment building. That should come later in August. And then we've got condenser sections that we'll be setting for Unit 3, that's the turbine building side. And one of our goals this year is to set and align the reactor vessel for Unit 2, and we hope to do that sometime in September."

Year-to-date for SCANA from the electric side of the business for 2016, there's no impact from weather compared to our plan. Now there is impact compared to 2015's first half of the year because it was very cold in Q1 of '15 and very warm in Q2 of '15. But for 2016, the weather has been ""normal"" on a net basis. We were -- it was mild in Q1, but it was warmer in Q2. So we're kind of on plan from a weather standpoint through midyear. Now I don't really pay a lot of attention to trailing 12 months when it straddles year-end like that because there's so much difference in our business with the BLRA increases that are near calendar year end. In the past, it's been around 1st of November. Now they'll be a little later than that as well as our RSA increases when they occur in the LDC in South Carolina.

Electric margins benefited from a Ba",1857,"Thanks, Susan, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. Earnings in the second quarter of 2016 were $0.74 per share compared to $0.69 per share in the same quarter of 2015. Electric margins benefited from a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth, but were partially offset by milder weather in the second quarter of 2016 when compared to the same quarter of last year and slightly lower average use. Results also improved due to increased gas margins at SCANA Energy and the positive impact of the depreciation study. As you will recall, this is the last quarter that a positive bottom line impact will be realized from this study on a comparative basis. 
Additionally, increases in O&M and property taxes had a negative impact on earnings. At the bottom of the slide, you will note that abnormal weather increased electric margins by $0.05 per share in the second quarter of 2016 and $0.06 per share in the second quarter 2015, resulting in a negative $0.01 per share impact to earnings quarter-over-quarter. 
Please turn to Slide 4. Earnings per share for the 6 months ended June 30, 2016, were $1.97 versus $3.49 in 2015. The decline in results is mainly attributable to the net of tax gains on the sale of CGT and SCI, and the negative year-over-year impact from weather. Otherwise, higher electric margins due primarily to a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth as well as the depreciation study impact were offset by lower gas margins and expected increases in O&M and CapEx-related items, including interest and property taxes. Electric margins through the first 2 quarters of 2016 were unaffected on a net basis by abnormal weather, which is down $0.11 when compared to the benefit from abnormal weather through June 30, 2015. 
Now on Slide 5, I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. South Carolina Electric and Gas Company second quarter 2016 earnings were up $0.02 per share compared to the same period of 2015. The increase in earnings is due to higher electric margins, principally as a result of the continued recovery of financing cost through the BLRA and customer growth, partially offset by milder weather during the second quarter of 2016 versus the same period of 2015 and lower average use. The impact of the previously mentioned depreciation study also contributed to earnings for the quarter. These items were partially offset by an increase in operation and maintenance expenses as well as increases in expenses related to our capital program, including interest expense and property taxes. Year-to-date, SCE&G's earnings were down by $0.06 due primarily to milder weather that was experienced in 2015. PSNC Energy’s reported seasonal flat earnings in the second quarter of 2016, consistent with the same quarter of the prior year. For the 6-month period ended June 30, earnings were up $0.01 per share in 2016 over the comparative period of 2015. 
SCANA Energy, which includes SCANA Energy Marketing and SCANA Energy Georgia, showed an increase in second quarter earnings of $0.02 per share, primarily due to higher margins during the second quarter of 2016 as compared to 2015. Year-to-date earnings are $0.17 per share compared to $0.21 per share in the prior year, down primarily due to milder weather in the first quarter. Additionally, I'm pleased to report that SCANA Energy has been granted a 1-year extension to serve as the regulated provider for the state of Georgia. This additional year will be added on to the current term and will end in August 2018. SCANA Energy has served as a regulated provider since the program's inception in 2002. 
SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported a loss of $0.05 per share in the second quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $0.06 per share in the comparative quarter. For the 6-month period, these businesses reported a loss of $0.05 per share in 2016 compared to earnings of $1.38 in 2015, primarily due to the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI of $1.41 per share as well as the foregone earnings contributed by CGT and SCI prior to the closing of the sales in the first quarter of 2015. 
I would now like to touch on economic trends and our service territory on Slide 6. The Carolinas' environment continues to prosper and we are pleased by the continuous growth in our service territories, as evidenced by announcements to invest approximately $1.5 billion with the expectation of creating approximately 3,300 jobs. At the bottom of the slide, you can see the national unemployment rate, along with the rates for the 3 states where SCANA has a presence and the SCE&G Electric territory. South Carolina's unemployment rate is now at 5.4% and the rate in SCE&G's Electric territory is estimated at 4.4%. Attesting to our state's strong economic growth, almost 70,000 more South Carolinians are working today than a year ago. 
Slide 7 presents customer growth and electric sales statistics. On the top half of the slide is the customer growth rate for each of our regulated businesses. SCE&G's Electric business added customers at a year-over-year rate of 1.6%. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina added customers at a rate of 3% and 2.9%, respectively. This is the first time PSNC's growth rate has hit 3% since the early stages of the 2008 recession. We continue to see strong customer growth in our businesses and in the region, which is a key fundamental. The bottom table outlines our actual and weather normalized kilowatt-hour sales for the 12 months ended June 30, 2016, overall, where the normalized total retail sales are up 0.3% on a 12-month ended basis. 
Now please turn to Slide 8, which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $9.7 billion. As denoted in the 2 shades of blue, approximately 85% of this rate base is related to the electric business. In the block on the right, you will see SCE&G's base electric business from which we're allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The earned return for the 12 months ended June 30, 2016, in the base electric business continues to meet our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA rated base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. We continue to be pleased with the execution of our strategy. 
As a reminder, we're allowed a return on equity of 10.25% in our gas LDC in South Carolina. If the earned ROE of the gas business for the 12 months ended March 31 falls outside the range of 50 basis points above or below the allowed ROE, then we file to adjust rates under the Rate Stabilization Act. As of March 31, 2016, the 12-month earned return was below the band and we recently filed for an annual increase of approximately $4 million in mid-June. 
As you are also aware, during the first quarter of 2016, we filed an application with the North Carolina Utilities Commission requesting annual revenue increases of $41.6 million at PSNC Energy in response to the normal attrition and the earned returns in that business. This rate increase is the result of PSNC's need to recover cost to operate and expand its pipeline system and to implement a pipeline integrity management rider. The rider would allow PSNC to track and receive ongoing recovery of capital expenses related to its distribution and transmission pipeline integrity management programs. A hearing with the North Carolina Utilities Commission on this rate case is scheduled for August 30. 
Slide 9 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast reflects the company's current estimate of new nuclear spending through 2018 and reflects the fixed price option spending as represented in the petition testimony and is filed on July 1. As a reminder, these schedules reflect the existing payment plan and do not incorporate the construction payment milestone schedule as it is still under negotiation. Therefore, it is unlikely that the timing of these expenditures were -- will occur as presented. At the bottom of the slide, we recap the estimated new nuclear equip from July 1 through June 30 to correspond to the periods on which the BLRA rate increases are historically calculated. 
Slide 10 presents information regarding certain transitional payments being made in 2016 as it pertains to the construction payment milestone schedule and the settlement agreement. Once the construction payment milestone schedule is complete, we will update the CapEx schedule and the corresponding financing plan. 
Now please turn to Slide 11 to review our estimated financing plan through 2018. In June of this year, SCE&G issued $425 million of 30-year bonds at 4.1%, and reopened and issued $75 million of bonds as part of a previous 4.5% series due June 1, 2064. Additionally, PSNC issued a 30-year private placement of $100 million at 4.13%. I would like to thank our banks and fixed income investors for their support of our liquidity needs. 
As a reminder, we have switched to open market purchases instead of issuing new shares to fulfill our 401(k) and DRIP plans at least until we fully utilized the net cash proceeds from the sales of CGT and SCI. We do not anticipate the need for further equity issuances until 2017. It is unlikely that these issuances will occur in the exact amounts or timing as presented, as they are subject to changes in our funding needs for planned project expenses. We continue to adjust the financing to match the related project CapEx on a 50-50 debt and equity basis. Again, this financing plan does not represent the election of the fixed price option. And we will conform this plan and the CapEx plan once we reach agreement on the construction payment milestone schedule later this year. 
On Slide 12, we're reaffirming our 2016 GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized earnings guidance as $3.90 per share to $4.10 per share with an internal target of $4 per share. However, I did want to take a moment and revise our operation and maintenance expense projection for the year. We previously issued O&M guidance for 2016 of approximately 2% higher than 2015. O&M has since outpaced that guidance rate, primarily due to increasing pension expense, which is offset with the pension rider in revenues and higher incentive compensation accruals as a result of the year-to-date stock performance. 
Pension expense has increased due to the lower discount rate associated with falling interest rates, which is applied to the projected liability. Although this incremental pension expense has no net effect on bottom line earnings, we are updating our O&M guidance for 2016 to approximate 4% higher than 2015. Our long-term GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized average annual growth guidance target remains unchanged as we plan to deliver 4% to 6% earnings growth over 3 to 5 years using a base of 2015's GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized EPS of $3.73 per share. 
And I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project."

I'd like to begin by addressing the status of our current regulatory proceedings. 
Slide 13 presents the relative schedules for 2 filings. The first is an update petition, which includes our selection of the fixed-price option and the second is our annual request for revised rates. At the beginning of July, we filed our direct testimony for our update petition and anticipate a hearing in October with an order in late November. The Office of Regulatory Staff, or ORS, will be issuing their report sometime in the next month or so regarding our annual request for revised rates. And we also anticipate that concluding in late November. 
Slide 14 presents the projected cost associated with our update petition. Please note that we have removed the additional transmission cost originally requested in the petition from our testimony filing, as we are evaluating other alternatives to installing additional capacitors in the Unit 1 switch chart.
Moving on to some of the activities at the new nuclear construction site. Slide 15 presents an aerial photo of what we call the tabletop from June of this year. This photo gives you a view of the layout of the site and have labeled both Units 2 and 3 as well as many of the other areas of the construction site. 
Slide 16 presents a schematic view of the 5 large structural modules that are located inside the containment vessel. As you will recall, we have previously placed module CA01, 04 and 05 for Unit 2, and CA04 and 05 for Unit 3. And more recently, we placed module CA03 for Unit 2, which you'll see shortly. 
Slide 17 shows an aerial view of the Unit 2 nuclear round and containment from last week. Looking down in the containment vessel, you can see the first ring section as well as modules CA01, 03, 04 and 05. Outside the containment vessel, you can see auxillary building module CA20, the shield building, which surrounds the containment vessel and the battery room. 
Slide 18 shows a few pictures of the Unit 2 CA02 module. CA02 is a wall section that forms part of the in-containment refilling water storage tank. CA02 is structurally complete and should be installed this quarter. 
Slide 19 shows a picture of the Unit 2 CA03 module, which is the west wall of the in-containment refilling water storage tank. This module was set in place last week. 
Slide 20 shows the continued fabrication of subassemblies 1 and 2 for the Unit 3 module CA20. This is an auxiliary building module that is located outside and adjacent to the containment vessel. As you may recall, this module consists of 4 subassemblies, and subassemblies 3 and 4 were previously placed in an effort to move forward with the shield building erection, which is the next critical path item. All required submodules for subassemblies 1 and 2 are on-site and they'll be placed once fabrication is complete. 
Slide 21 shows a picture of the fabrication of the Unit 3 module CA01. This module houses the steam generators and the pressurizer, and forms a refueling canal inside the containment vessel. Currently, all 47 submodules are on-site, and 21 of those submodules are upright and being welded together in the Module Assembly Building. 
On Slide 22, you can see one of the 2 steam generators for Unit 3 that arrived on the construction site in late April. It was transported from the Port of Charleston on a specifically designed rail car. This steam generator weighs approximately 1.3 million pounds. It's about 20 feet in diameter and it's almost 82 feet long. The other Unit 3 steam generator and the last one for the project is scheduled to be delivered during the fourth quarter of this year. 
Slide 23 shows a picture of the Sanmen plant in China. This past May, Westinghouse completed the coal hydrostatic testing at Sanmen Unit 1. The successful completion of this test confirms that the reactive systems meet design pressures under operating and excellent conditions. This is great news for the AP1000 design, and Sanmen Unit 1 is expected to load fuel by the end of the year. Another Chinese AP1000 unit, Haiyang Unit 1, completed its cold hydro test in early July. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now be glad to respond to any questions you might have."

Fluor's review of the schedule is really something that should conclude somewhere in the third quarter. And then they will be giving that to Westinghouse. And remember that on the project now, we're dealing just with Westinghouse. Fluor is a subcontractor to Westinghouse. I don't expect anything necessarily to change from that review, save for perhaps the number of hours it might take and shifts that they would have to put on, that kind of thing. So we're -- the goal of that schedule review was to hold the dates constant and see what it would take to accomplish those dates. So I don't expect anything dramatic to come from that. With respect to milestones, the CA03 lift and set for Unit 2 was completed last week, as I think you saw in the photographs. We would intend to set the second half of auxiliary building module CA20 probably next week, if not, then the week after. So we're actually taking the end off the Module Assembly Building as we speak in order to get that module out. So that will be another large lift. That will be for Unit 3. We've got a module stock called CA02, which should be the last of the big 5 modules to go in the Unit 2 containment building. That should come later in August. And then we've got condenser sections that we'll be setting for Unit 3, that's the turbine building side. And one of our goals this year is to set and align the reactor vessel for Unit 2, and we hope to do that sometime in September."

Year-to-date for SCANA from the electric side of the business for 2016, there's no impact from weather compared to our plan.

We were -- it was mild in Q1, but it was warmer in Q2. So we're kind of on plan from a weather standpoint through midyear.

So the housing growth -- you might look at it like this. In the electric growth is 1.6%.

I like it for heater, a water heater, clothes dryer, et cetera. But then on top of that you've got penetration of existing homes. Because of the price, it's so much more affordable with the price of shale gas today in the market for folks to use it for heating and water heating and things of that nature. So you've got kind of the double benefit of that, if you will. So -- and I think it's kind of interesting. I was looking at some stats earlier today about the economic projections for the Carolinas. And for the first time in several years, the multiunit housing is projected over the next couple of years to drop as far as the number of units and single-family housing is projected to increase. In South Carolina, single-family permits are projected over the next couple of years to go up 20% while multi-family is projected to go down to 20% -- down 20% North Carolina is even more exaggerated, up 25% and down 35%. I think what we're reaching is more of this kind of a relative saturation of these multiunit on a relative basis. I'm not saying there won't be more built.  But compared to the single-family units, you're starting to see single families grow faster than the multi-family.

Earnings in the third quarter of 2016 were $1.32 per share compared to $1.04 per share in the same quarter of 2015. Electric margins benefited from a Base Load Review Act rate increase, customer growth and extremely hot weather in the third quarter of 2016 when compared to the same quarter of last year. As an example. Charleston, South Carolina one of our largest metropolitan areas registered their hottest month on record in July. 
Results also improved due to increased gas margins. As a reminder, during the third quarter of 2015, SCE&G adopted new depreciation rates for electric plant as a result of the study. These new rates, which produced an annual decrease in depreciation expense of approximately $29 million were effective as of January 1, 2015, resulting in the application of 3 quarters worth of depreciation savings being applied during the third quarter of 2015. 
Additionally, increases in O&M, interest and property taxes had a negative impact on earnings. At the bottom of the slide, you will note that abnormal weather increased Electric margins by $0.27 per share in the third quarter of 2016 and $0.11 per share in the third quarter of 2015, resulting in a positive $0.16 per share impact to earnings quarter-over-quarter. 
Slide 4 shows earnings per share for the 9 months ended September 30, 2016 with $3.29 per share versus $4.23 per share in 2015. The decline is mainly attributable to the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI. Otherwise, power electric margins due primarily to a Base Load Review Act rate increase, customer growth and the positive impact of abnormal weather year-to-date would have resulted in an improved comparative results. 
These increases were partially offset by lower gas margins and expected increases in O&M and CapEx-related items, including depreciation interest and property taxes. Abnormal weather increased electric margins by $0.27 per share for the 3 quarter ended September 30, 2016, and $0.22 per share for the same period in 2015, resulting in a favorable $0.05 per share impact to earnings. 
Now on Slide 5. I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. South Carolina Electric & Gas Company's third quarter 2016 earnings were up $0.26 per share compared to the same period of 2015. The increase in earnings is due to higher electric margins, principally as a result of the continued recovery of financing cost through the BLRA and customer growth in addition to normally hot weather. These items were partially offset by an increase in operations and maintenance expenses as well as increasings in expenses related to our capital program including interest, depreciation and property taxes. 
Year-to-date, SCE&G's earnings were up by $0.20 per share in 2016 over the same period 2015. PSNC Energy reported a seasonal loss of $0.05 per share in the third quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $0.04 per share in the same quarter the prior year, primarily due to higher interest expense and depreciation related to the expansion of PSNC Energy system. For the 9 months ended September 30, earnings were down $0.01 per share in 2016 over the comparative period of 2016. 
SCANA Energy provided a $0.02 per share increase in third quarter earnings over the previous year, primarily due to higher margins during the third quarter of 2016 as compared to 2015. Year-to-date earnings were $0.16 per share compared to $0.17 per share in the prior year, down primarily due to milder weather in the first quarter. SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported a loss of $0.05 per share in the third quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $0.06 per share in the comparative quarter. 
For the 9-month period, these businesses reported a loss of $0.10 per share in 2016 compared to earnings of $1.32 in 2015, primarily due to the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI at $1.41 as well as the foregone earnings contributed by CGT and SCI prior to the closing of the sales in the first quarter of 2015. 
I would now like to touch on economic trends and our service territory on Slide 6. We're pleased by the continued economic growth in our service territories, as evidenced by announcements to invest approximately $1.2 billion with the expectation of creating approximately 4,600 jobs. At the bottom of the slide, you can see the national and employment rate along with the rates for the 3 states where SCANA has a presence, and SCE&G's Electric territory. South Carolina's unemployment rate is now at 4.9% and it is the estimated rate in SCE&G Electric territory. 
Attesting to our state's strong economic growth, almost 56,000 more South Carolinians are working today than a year ago. Slide 7 presents customer growth in electric sales statistics. On the top half of the slide is the customer growth rate of each of our regulated businesses. SCE&G Electric business added customers at a year-over-year rate of 1.5%. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina added customers at a rate of 2.8% and 2.9%, respectively. As you can see, the rates are trending fairly consistent over the year. The bottom table outlines our actual and weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales for the 12 months ended September 30, 2016. 
Overall, weather-normalized total retail sales were basically flat on a 12-month ended basis. Now please look at Slide 8, which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $10.6 billion. As denoted in the 2 shades of blue, approximately 86% of this rate base is related to the Electric business. And the block on the right, you will see SCE&G base electric business in which we're [indiscernible] 10.25% return on equity. The earned return for the 12 months ended September 30, 2016 and the base electric business continues to be our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. We're continued to be pleased with the execution of our strategy. 
Continuing down the page on our new nuclear business, we were allowed an 11% return on equity under the Base Load Review Act for all annual request for revised rates that were approved prior to 2016. The approval of our 2015 petition revised this allowed ROE down to 10.5% for a prospective request for revised rates, which apply to the request that was approved last week and will become effective in November. Under the terms of our recently announced settlement agreement with the LRS and 4 other intervenors, and which Steve will discuss in more depth shortly, the allowed ROE for the new nuclear business will be 10.25% for all prospective requests for revised rates beginning in 2017, if approved by the Public Service Commission of South Carolina. 
As a reminder, we're allowed a return on equity of 10.25% on gas LDC in South Carolina. If the earned ROE of the gas business for the 12 months ended March 31, falls outside of range of 50 basis points above or below that allowed ROE, then we file to adjust rates under the Rate Stabilization Act. As of March 31, 2016, the 12-month earned return for SCE&G gas was below the band, and we filed for an annual increase in mid-June. The Public Service Commission approved an annual increase of $4.1 million in September with rates going into effect with the first billing cycle in November. 
As you are also aware, In the first quarter 2016, we filed an application with the North Carolina Facilities Commission requesting an annual revenue increase at PSNC Energy in response to the normal attrition in the earned returns in that business. In late August, PSNC Energy entered into a settlement agreement with the public staff and we expect the decision from the MCUC to be made sometime shortly. As part of the settlement agreement, PSNC Energy agreed to a $19 million revenue increase and an authorized ROE of 9.7%. 
In addition, the settlement agreement allows PSNC Energy to track and receive ongoing recovery of capital expenses related to its distribution and transmission pipeline integrity management programs. We estimate that slightly more than 20% of our CapEx over the next 3 years will be subject to this integrity management writer. The new rates associated with the effective beginning November 1, 2016. 
Slide 9 presents our Capex forecast. This forecast reflects the company's current estimate of new nuclear spending for 2018 and reflects the fixed price option spending as represented in the ORS settlement agreement as filed September 1. As a reminder, these schedules reflect the existing payment plan and do not incorporate the construction milestone payment schedule as it is still being addressed through the Dispute Resolution Board process. Therefore, it is unlikely that the timing of these expenditures will occur exactly as presented. 
At the bottom of the slide, we recapped the estimated new nuclear quip from July 1 through June 30, to correspond on the periods on which the BLRA rate increases aren't historically calculated. Next on Slide 10. I would like to mention the recent tax election made to claim Section 174, Research and Experimentation Deductions for some of our nuclear costs. After evaluating this section of the tax code, including recent court decisions and recently issued final regulations, and after obtaining extensive external advise, we concluded that the regulations allow application of Section 174, Research and Experimentation Deductions to our AP1000 units as a pilot model. 
We first claimed these deductions on our 2015 return, which was filed last month and plan to make similar claims on our prospective returns. Essentially, this code section allows the current tax deduction for certain costs incurred in the year they are incurred rather than waiting to receive the deduction through accelerated Obama's tax depreciation once units are placed in service. By claiming these deductions as costs or incurred, we will forego the depreciation deduction later. In short, it functions much like bonus depreciation in that the deduction is simply accelerated. Although in this case, it is accelerated and has realized as the money is spent rather than at the time the units are placed into service. 
This selection will result in an increase in available cash in the near term and will therefore, lessen the need for debt and equity issuances. This should benefits customers in several ways, and also benefit existing shareholders to lower dilution. While the exact amounts are not completely known, we have estimated the impact by year through 2018. While at a minimum, customers will benefit from the impact of this cash source in the form of enhanced credit metrics supporting credit ratings. These deductions will also result in accumulation of a deferred tax credit. 
Deferred taxes are not contemplated by the BLRA law. And will therefore, be associated with our base electric business as a reduction to rate base. As such, we have proposed to the ORS that as this credit to retail electric rate base bills and our resulting retail earned returns increase, we will also flow back benefits directly to customers through a credit or decrement writer to base electrical rates. We also plan to propose this to the PSC in accounting petition for their approval. This strategy does not change the timing or amounts of the BLRA revised rate increases for the remainder of the new nuclear destruction.
We believe this detriment writer treatment will allow us to offset some of the BLRA rate increases our customers will see during the peak construction years. Additionally, it allows for market ROEs for our shareholders consistent with our stated strategy of earning a reasonable return on the base business while avoiding rate increases other than those associated with the BLRA. We do not project this election and proposed treatment will change our earnings guidance as lower dilution and the rate decrements essentially offset one another from an EPS perspective. 
Now please look at Slide 11 to review our estimated financing plan through 2018. This plan has been updated to reflect our results year-to-date. The election of the fixed-price option as well as the expected impact of the Section 174 deductions. Note that we have completed all of our plan financings for 2016. As a reminder, we have switched to open market purchases instead of issuing new shares to fulfill our 401(k) and DRIP plans until we have incremental equity needs, which we currently estimate to be in 2018. Again, it is unlikely that these issuances will occur in the exact amounts or timing as presented, as they are suffixes changes in our funding needs, for plans funding expenses and may change based upon the outcome of the petition filing, the dispute and resolution board and the actual achievement of milestones. 
We continue to adjust the financing to match the related project CapEx on a 50-50 debt to equity basis. On Slide 12 we are reaffirming our 2016 GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized earnings guidance as $3.90 per share to $4.10 per share with an internal target of $4 per share. Our long-term GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized average annual growth [indiscernible] target remains unchanged as we plan to deliver 4% to 6% earnings growth over 3 to 5 years using a base of 2015's GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized EPS of $3.73 per share. 
We plan to address 2017 earnings guidance on the fourth quarter call after the receipt of the construction milestone payment schedule and the conclusion of the petition process. 
I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project."

On Slide 13, you can see a photo of hurricane Matthew making landfall on the South Carolina coast, almost a year to the date of the historic flooding that hit South Carolina in 2015. I'd like to thank those of you who reached out and appreciate your thoughts and prayers for those who are affected by the storm, or in some cases are still trying to recover from last year's flood. 
I'd also like to thank our alignment, tree crews and support staff as well as those who were dispatched from other areas as far away as Oklahoma, Texas and Mississippi. Immediately following the impact of the storm, we had approximately 290,000 customers who reported outages. Within 48 hours, we had restored power to 190,000, and 72 hours have restored power to 250,000 customers. Restoration was completed within 8 days. Over the next few months, we'll try to measure the company's impact from the storm, but it will not compare to the significant upheaval in the lives of those who were ultimately affected. 
Please now turn to Slide 14. I'd like to discuss the petition that SCE&G filed with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina on May 26 of this year, seeking the approval to update the construction milestone schedule as well as the capital cost schedule for the 2 new nuclear units. We're hopeful that the PSC will approve the settlement agreement we entered into with the RFs and 4 other intervenors related to the aforementioned petition. This settlement agreement signifies that no contested issues exist among the 7 parties and supports the approval of the revised construction and capital cost schedules. 
As Jimmy already mentioned, the 7 parties also agreed to revise the allowed return on equity to 10.25% from 10.5%, calculating prospective revised rates sought under the BLRA on or after January 1, 2017. In addition, SCE&G will not file for future requests to capital cost schedules until after January 28, 2019. 
Slide 15 presents the relative schedule for the petition file. We filed our direct testimony at the beginning of July, and the ORS followed suit with their testimony and settlement agreement at the beginning of September. Our hearing with the PSC took place at the beginning of this month, including after a minor delay due to hurricane Matthew. The ORS presented the terms of the settlement agreement at the hearing. A decision by the PSC will come no later than November 28. 
Moving to some activities at the new nuclear construction site. Slide 16 prevents an aerial photo of the construction table top from June of this year. Here, you can see the significant progress that has been made so far on the project, as labeled both Units 2 and 3 as well as many other areas of the construction site. Slide 17 presents a schematic view of the 5 large structural CA modules that are located inside the containment vessel. We've now placed all of the major CA modules for Unit 2, as we have previously placed CA-01, 03, 04 and 05 and more recently placed CA-02. We have also placed CA-04 and 05 for Unit 3. 
Slide 18 shows an aerial view of Unit 2 nuclear island and containment vessel. Looking down into the containment vessel, you can see the first ring section and the aforementioned structural modules as well as the reactor vessel, which was recently placed and which I'll discuss more shortly. Outside of the containment vessel, you can see the [indiscernible] modules CA20 and the shield building, which surrounds the containment vessel. 
Slide 19 shows a picture of the Unit 2 CA-02 module being placed back in early August. CA-02 is a wall section that forms part of the infotainment refueling water storage tank. On Slide 20, you'll see picture of the Unit 2 reactor vessel being placed. On August 30, this reactor vessel was placed on top of module CA-04 inside the containment vessel. This is a significant milestone for our project as this is the first reactor vessel to be set at a new nuclear plant in the United States in more than 30 years. 
Slide 21 shows the placement of the second half of Unit 3's module, CA20 which is an auxilliary building module that is located outside and adjacent to the containment vessel. As you may recall, the first half of this module was previously placed in order to move forward with shield building interruption. 
Slide 22 shows a picture of the fabrication of the Unit 3 module CA-01. This module houses the generators and pressurizer by forms of canal inside of the containment vessel. Currently, all 47 sub modules are on-site and 44 of those submodules are upright and being levered together, the module building or MAB. 
Slide 23 shows a picture of the Unit 3 module, CA-02 being fabricated in the MAB. Currently, 2 of the 5 submodules has been up ended and all 5 submodules are on-site. 
On Slide 24. You can see a photo of the reader being placed in the Unit 2 turbine building in late August. We have previously shown pictures of this massive 140-foot long, 18-foot [ph] [indiscernible] in the component as it was transported to the site by truck. This component. purifies speed water by removing dissolved gases. 
Slide 25 shows the generators starter being lifted up to the Unit 2 turbine deck. This is the stationary portion of the main generator on the set of Tuesday this week. 
Lastly, on Slide 26. You can see the Unit 3 turbine building, replaced the upper and lower sections of [indiscernible] 3 [ph] low pressure turbine condensers in September. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now be glad to respond to any questions you might have."

Earnings in the third quarter of 2016 were $1.32 per share compared to $1.04 per share in the same quarter of 2015. Electric margins benefited from a Base Load Review Act rate increase, customer growth and extremely hot weather in the third quarter of 2016 when compared to the same quarter of last year. As an example, Charleston, South Carolina, one of our largest metropolitan areas, registered their hottest month on record in July.
Results also improved due to increased gas margins. As a reminder, during the third quarter of 2015, SCE&G adopted new depreciation rates for electric plant as a result of a study. These new rates, which produced an annual decrease in depreciation expense of approximately $29 million, were effective as of January 1, 2015, resulting in the application of 3 quarters' worth of depreciation savings being applied during the third quarter of 2015.
Additionally, increases in O&M, interest and property taxes had a negative impact on earnings. At the bottom of the slide, you will note that abnormal weather increased electric margins by $0.27 per share in the third quarter of 2016 and $0.11 per share in the third quarter of 2015, resulting in a positive $0.16 per share impact to earnings quarter-over-quarter.
Slide 4 shows earnings per share for the 9 months ended September 30, 2016, were $3.29 per share versus $4.53 per share in 2015. The decline is mainly attributable to the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI. Otherwise, higher electric margins due primarily to a Base Load Review Act rate increase, customer growth and the positive impact of abnormal weather year-to-date would have resulted in improved comparative results. These increases were partially offset by lower gas margins and expected increases in O&M and CapEx-related items, including depreciation, interest and property taxes. Abnormal weather increased electric margins by $0.27 per share for the 3 quarters ended September 30, 2016, and $0.22 per share for the same period in 2015, resulting in a favorable $0.05 per share impact to earnings.
Now on Slide 5, I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. South Carolina Electric & Gas Company's third quarter 2016 earnings were up $0.26 per share compared to the same period of 2015. The increase in earnings is due to higher electric margins, principally as a result of the continued recovery of financing cost through the BLRA and customer growth in addition to abnormally hot weather. These items were partially offset by an increase in operations and maintenance expenses as well as increases in expenses related to our capital program, including interest, depreciation and property taxes. Year-to-date, SCE&G's earnings were up by $0.20 per share in 2016 over the same period of 2015.
PSNC Energy reported a seasonal loss of $0.05 per share in the third quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $0.04 per share in the same quarter of the prior year, primarily due to higher interest expense and depreciation related to the expansion of PSNC Energy's system. For the 9 months ended September 30, earnings were down $0.01 per share in 2016 over the comparative period of 2015.
SCANA Energy provided a $0.02 per share increase in third quarter earnings over the previous year, primarily due to higher margins during the third quarter of 2016 as compared to 2015. Year-to-date, earnings were $0.16 per share compared to $0.17 per share in the prior year, down primarily due to milder weather in the first quarter. 
SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported a loss of $0.05 per share in the third quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $0.06 per share in the comparative quarter. For the 9-month period, these businesses reported a loss of $0.10 per share in 2016 compared to earnings of $1.32 in 2015, primarily due to the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI of $1.41 per share as well as the foregone earnings contributed by CGT and SCI prior to the closing of the sales in the first quarter of 2015.
I would now like to touch on economic trends in our service territory on Slide 6. We're pleased by the continued economic growth in our service territories as evidenced by announcements to invest approximately $1.2 billion, with the expectation of creating approximately 4,600 jobs. At the bottom of the slide, you can see the national unemployment rate, along with the rates for the 3 states where SCANA has a presence and SCE&G's electric territory. South Carolina's unemployment rate is now at 4.9% as is the estimated rate in SCE&G's electric territory. Attesting to our state's strong economic growth, almost 56,000 more South Carolinians are working today than a year ago.
Slide 7 presents customer growth and electric sales statistics. On the top half of the slide is the customer growth rate for each of our regulated businesses. SCE&G's electric business added customers at a year-over-year rate of 1.5%. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina added customers at a rate of 2.8% and 2.9%, respectively. As you can see, the rates are trending fairly consistent over the year. 
The bottom table outlines our actual and weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales for the 12 months ended September 30, 2016. Overall, weather-normalized total retail sales were basically flat on a 12-month-ended basis.
Now please look at Slide 8, which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $10.6 billion. As denoted in the 2 shades of blue, approximately 86% of this rate base is related to the electric business. In the block on the right, you will see SCE&G's base electric business, in which we're allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The earned return for the 12 months ended September 30, 2016, in the base electric business continues to meet our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA-related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. We continue to be pleased with the execution of our strategy.
Continuing down the page, on our new nuclear business, we were allowed an 11% return on equity under the Base Load Review Act for all annual requests for revised rates that were approved prior to 2016. The approval of our 2015 petition revised this allowed ROE down to 10.5% for prospective requests for revised rates, which apply to the request that was approved last week and will become effective in November. Under the terms of our recently announced settlement agreement with the ORS and 4 other intervenors and which Steve will discuss in more depth shortly, the allowed ROE for the new nuclear business will be 10.25% for all prospective requests for revised rates beginning in 2017, if approved by the Public Service Commission of South Carolina. As a reminder, we're allowed a return on equity of 10.25% on gas LDC in South Carolina. If the earned ROE of the gas business for the 12 months ended March 31 falls outside the range of 50 basis points above or below that allowed ROE, then we file to adjust rates under the Rate Stabilization Act.
As of March 31, 2016, the 12-month earned return for SCE&G gas was below the band, and we filed for an annual increase in mid-June. The Public Service Commission approved an annual increase of $4.1 million in September, with rates going into effect for the first billing cycle in November.
As you are also aware, during the first quarter of 2016, we filed an application with the North Carolina Utilities Commission requesting an annual revenue increase at PSNC Energy, in response to the normal attrition in the earned returns in that business. In late August, PSNC Energy entered into a settlement agreement with the public staff, and we expect the decision from the NCUC to be made sometime shortly. As part of the settlement agreement, PSNC Energy agreed to a $19 million revenue increase and an authorized ROE of 9.7%. In addition, the settlement agreement allows PSNC Energy to track and receive ongoing recovery of capital expenses related to its distribution and transmission pipeline integrity management programs. We estimate that slightly more than 20% of our CapEx over the next 3 years will be subject to this integrity management writer. The new rates associated would be effective beginning November 1, 2016.
Slide 9 presents our Capex forecast. This forecast reflects the company's current estimate of new nuclear spending through 2018 and reflects the fixed-price option spending as represented in the ORS settlement agreement that's filed September 1. As a reminder, these schedules reflect the existing payment plan and do not incorporate the construction milestone payment schedule as it is still being addressed through the dispute resolution board process. Therefore, it is unlikely that the timing of these expenditures will occur exactly as presented.
At the bottom of the slide, we'll recap the estimated new nuclear CWIP from July 1 through June 30 to correspond to the periods on which the BLRA rate increases are historically calculated. 
Next, on Slide 10, I would like to mention a recent tax election we made to claim Section 174, research and experimentation deductions, for some of our new nuclear costs. After evaluating this section of the tax code, including recent court decisions and recently issued final regulations, and thereafter obtaining extensive external advise, we concluded that the regulations allow application of Section 174, research and experimentation deductions, to our AP1000 units as a pilot model.
We first claimed these deductions on our 2015 return, which was filed last month, and plan to make similar claims on our prospective returns. Essentially, this code section allows a current tax deduction for certain costs incurred in the year they are incurred rather than waiting to receive the deduction through accelerated or bonus tax depreciation once the units are placed in service. By claiming these deductions as costs are incurred, we will forego the depreciation deduction later. In short, it functions much like bonus depreciation in that the deduction is simply accelerated, although in this case it is accelerated and is realized as the money spent rather than at the time the units are placed into service. This election will result in an increase in available cash in the near term and will therefore lessen the need for debt and equity issuances. This should benefit customers in several ways and also benefit existing shareholders to lower dilution. While the exact amounts are not completely known, we have estimated the impact by year through 2018. While at a minimum, customers will benefit from the impact of this cash source in the form of enhanced credit metrics supporting credit ratings. These deductions will also result in accumulation of a deferred tax credit.
Deferred taxes are not contemplated by the BLRA law and will therefore be associated with our base electric business as a reduction to rate base. As such, we have proposed to the ORS that as this credit to retail electric rate base bills and our resulting retail-earned returns increase, we will also flow back benefits directly to customers through a credit or decrement writer to base electric rates. We also plan to propose this to the PSC an accounting petition for their approval. This strategy does not change the timing or amounts of the BLRA revised rate increases for the remainder of the new nuclear construction.
We believe this decrement writer treatment will allow us to offset some of the BLRA rate increases our customers will see during the peak construction years. Additionally, it allows for market ROEs for our shareholders, consistent with our stated strategy of earning a reasonable return on the base business, while avoiding rate increases other than those associated with the BLRA. We do not project this election and proposed treatment will change our earnings guidance as lower dilution and the rate decrements essentially offset one another from an EPS perspective.
Now please look at Slide 11 to review our estimated financing plan through 2018. This plan has been updated to reflect our results year-to-date, the election of the fixed-price option as well as the expected impact of the Section 174 deductions. Note that we have completed all of our planned financings for 2016. As a reminder, we have switched to open-market purchases instead of issuing new shares to fulfill our 401(k) and DRIP plans until we have incremental equity needs, which we currently estimate to be in 2018. Again, it is unlikely that these issuances will occur in the exact amounts or timing as presented as they are subject to changes in our funding needs for planned project expenses and may change based upon the outcome of the petition filing, the dispute resolution board and the actual achievement of milestones. We continue to adjust the financing to match the related project CapEx on a 50-50 debt and equity basis. 
On Slide 12, we are reaffirming our 2016 GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized earnings guidance as $3.90 per share to $4.10 per share with an internal target of $4 per share. Our long-term GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized average annual growth guidance target remains unchanged as we plan to deliver 4% to 6% earnings growth over 3 to 5 years using a base of 2015's GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized EPS of $3.73 per share. 
We plan to address 2017 earnings guidance on the fourth quarter call after the receipt of the construction milestone payment schedule and the conclusion of the petition process.
I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project."

On Slide 13, you can see a photo of Hurricane Matthew making landfall on the South Carolina coast, almost a year to the date of the historic flooding that happened in South Carolina in 2015. I'd like to thank those of you who reached out, and appreciate your thoughts and prayers for those who are affected by the storm and, in some cases, are still trying to recover from last year's flood. I'd also like to thank our linemen, tree crews and support staff as well as those who were dispatched from other areas as far away as Oklahoma, Texas and Mississippi.
Immediately following the impact of the storm, we had approximately 290,000 customers who reported outages. Within 48 hours, we had restored power to 190,000 and 72 hours, had restored power to 250,000 customers. Restoration was complete within 8 days. Over the next few months, we will try to measure the company's impact from the storm, but it will not compare to the significant upheaval in the lives of those who are ultimately affected.
Please now turn to Slide 14. I'd like to discuss the petition that SCE&G filed with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina on May 26 of this year, seeking approval to update the construction milestone schedule as well as the capital cost schedule for the 2 new nuclear units. We are hopeful that the PSC will approve the settlement agreement we entered into with the ORS and 4 other intervenors related to the aforementioned petition. This settlement agreement signifies that no contested issues exist among the settling parties and supports the approval of the revised construction and capital cost schedules.
As Jimmy already mentioned, the settling parties also agreed to revise the allowed return on equity to 10.25% from 10.5%, calculating prospective revised rates sought under the BLRA on or after January 1, 2017. In addition, SCE&G will not file for future requests to amend capital cost schedules until after January 28, 2019.
Slide 15 presents the relative schedule for the petition filing. We filed our direct testimony at the beginning of July, and the ORS followed suit with their testimony and settlement agreement at the beginning of September. Our hearing with the PSC took place at the beginning of this month, including after a minor delay due to Hurricane Matthew. The ORS presented the terms of the settlement agreement at the hearing. A decision by the PSC will come no later than November 28.
Moving to some activities at the new nuclear construction site. Slide 16 prevents an aerial photo of the construction table top from June of this year. Here, you can see the significant progress that has been made so far on the project. I have labeled both Units 2 and 3 as well as many other areas of the construction site.
Slide 17 presents a schematic view of the 5 large structural or CA modules that were located inside the containment vessel. We have now placed all of the major CA modules for Unit 2 as we have previously placed CA-01, 03, 04 and 05, and more recently placed CA-02. We have also placed CA-04 and 05 for Unit 3.
Slide 18 shows an aerial view of the Unit 2 nuclear island and containment vessel. Looking down into the containment vessel, you can see the first ring section and the aforementioned structural modules as well as the reactor vessel, which was recently placed and which I'll discuss more shortly. Outside of the containment vessel, you can see the auxilliary building module, CA20, and the shield building, which surrounds the containment vessel.
Slide 19 shows a picture of Unit 2 CA-02 module being placed back in early August. CA-02 is a wall section that forms part of the in-containment refueling water storage tank. 
On Slide 20, you see a picture of Unit 2 reactor vessel being placed. On August 30, this reactor vessel was placed on top of module CA-04 inside the containment vessel. This is a significant milestone for our project as this is the first reactor vessel to be set at a new nuclear plant in the United States in more than 30 years.
Slide 21 shows the placement of the second half of Unit 3's module, CA20, which is an auxilliary building module that is located outside and adjacent to the containment vessel. As you may recall, the first half of this module was previously placed in order to move forward with shield building erection. 
Slide 22 shows a picture of the fabrication of the Unit 3 module, CA-01. This module houses the steam generators and the pressurizer and forms a fueling canal inside of the containment vessel. Currently, all 47 sub-modules are on site, and 44 of those sub-modules are upright and being welded together the module assembly building or MAB. 
Slide 23 shows a picture of the Unit 3 module, CA-02, being fabricated in the MAB. Currently, 2 of the 5 sub-modules has been -- have been upended, and all 5 sub-modules are on site. 
On Slide 24, you can see a photo of the Unit 2 deaereator being placed on the Unit 2 turbine building in late August. We have previously shown pictures of this massive 140-foot-long, 18-foot-diameter component as it was transported to the site by truck. This component purifies feedwater by removing dissolved gases.
Slide 25 shows the generator stator being lifted up to the Unit 2 turbine deck. This is the stationary portion of the main generator and was set on Tuesday of this week.
Lastly, on Slide 26, you can see the Unit 3 turbine building will be placed in the upper and lower sections of all 3 low-pressure turbine condensers in September. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now be glad to respond to any questions you might have."

Electric margins benefited from a Bas",2285,"Thanks, Susan, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. Earnings in the third quarter of 2016 were $1.32 per share compared to $1.04 per share in the same quarter of 2015. Electric margins benefited from a Base Load Review Act rate increase, customer growth and extremely hot weather in the third quarter of 2016 when compared to the same quarter of last year. As an example, Charleston, South Carolina, one of our largest metropolitan areas, registered their hottest month on record in July.
Results also improved due to increased gas margins. As a reminder, during the third quarter of 2015, SCE&G adopted new depreciation rates for electric plant as a result of a study. These new rates, which produced an annual decrease in depreciation expense of approximately $29 million, were effective as of January 1, 2015, resulting in the application of 3 quarters' worth of depreciation savings being applied during the third quarter of 2015.
Additionally, increases in O&M, interest and property taxes had a negative impact on earnings. At the bottom of the slide, you will note that abnormal weather increased electric margins by $0.27 per share in the third quarter of 2016 and $0.11 per share in the third quarter of 2015, resulting in a positive $0.16 per share impact to earnings quarter-over-quarter.
Slide 4 shows earnings per share for the 9 months ended September 30, 2016, were $3.29 per share versus $4.53 per share in 2015. The decline is mainly attributable to the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI. Otherwise, higher electric margins due primarily to a Base Load Review Act rate increase, customer growth and the positive impact of abnormal weather year-to-date would have resulted in improved comparative results. These increases were partially offset by lower gas margins and expected increases in O&M and CapEx-related items, including depreciation, interest and property taxes. Abnormal weather increased electric margins by $0.27 per share for the 3 quarters ended September 30, 2016, and $0.22 per share for the same period in 2015, resulting in a favorable $0.05 per share impact to earnings.
Now on Slide 5, I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. South Carolina Electric & Gas Company's third quarter 2016 earnings were up $0.26 per share compared to the same period of 2015. The increase in earnings is due to higher electric margins, principally as a result of the continued recovery of financing cost through the BLRA and customer growth in addition to abnormally hot weather. These items were partially offset by an increase in operations and maintenance expenses as well as increases in expenses related to our capital program, including interest, depreciation and property taxes. Year-to-date, SCE&G's earnings were up by $0.20 per share in 2016 over the same period of 2015.
PSNC Energy reported a seasonal loss of $0.05 per share in the third quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $0.04 per share in the same quarter of the prior year, primarily due to higher interest expense and depreciation related to the expansion of PSNC Energy's system. For the 9 months ended September 30, earnings were down $0.01 per share in 2016 over the comparative period of 2015.
SCANA Energy provided a $0.02 per share increase in third quarter earnings over the previous year, primarily due to higher margins during the third quarter of 2016 as compared to 2015. Year-to-date, earnings were $0.16 per share compared to $0.17 per share in the prior year, down primarily due to milder weather in the first quarter. 
SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported a loss of $0.05 per share in the third quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $0.06 per share in the comparative quarter. For the 9-month period, these businesses reported a loss of $0.10 per share in 2016 compared to earnings of $1.32 in 2015, primarily due to the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI of $1.41 per share as well as the foregone earnings contributed by CGT and SCI prior to the closing of the sales in the first quarter of 2015.
I would now like to touch on economic trends in our service territory on Slide 6. We're pleased by the continued economic growth in our service territories as evidenced by announcements to invest approximately $1.2 billion, with the expectation of creating approximately 4,600 jobs. At the bottom of the slide, you can see the national unemployment rate, along with the rates for the 3 states where SCANA has a presence and SCE&G's electric territory. South Carolina's unemployment rate is now at 4.9% as is the estimated rate in SCE&G's electric territory. Attesting to our state's strong economic growth, almost 56,000 more South Carolinians are working today than a year ago.
Slide 7 presents customer growth and electric sales statistics. On the top half of the slide is the customer growth rate for each of our regulated businesses. SCE&G's electric business added customers at a year-over-year rate of 1.5%. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina added customers at a rate of 2.8% and 2.9%, respectively. As you can see, the rates are trending fairly consistent over the year. 
The bottom table outlines our actual and weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales for the 12 months ended September 30, 2016. Overall, weather-normalized total retail sales were basically flat on a 12-month-ended basis.
Now please look at Slide 8, which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $10.6 billion. As denoted in the 2 shades of blue, approximately 86% of this rate base is related to the electric business. In the block on the right, you will see SCE&G's base electric business, in which we're allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The earned return for the 12 months ended September 30, 2016, in the base electric business continues to meet our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA-related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. We continue to be pleased with the execution of our strategy.
Continuing down the page, on our new nuclear business, we were allowed an 11% return on equity under the Base Load Review Act for all annual requests for revised rates that were approved prior to 2016. The approval of our 2015 petition revised this allowed ROE down to 10.5% for prospective requests for revised rates, which apply to the request that was approved last week and will become effective in November. Under the terms of our recently announced settlement agreement with the ORS and 4 other intervenors and which Steve will discuss in more depth shortly, the allowed ROE for the new nuclear business will be 10.25% for all prospective requests for revised rates beginning in 2017, if approved by the Public Service Commission of South Carolina. As a reminder, we're allowed a return on equity of 10.25% on gas LDC in South Carolina. If the earned ROE of the gas business for the 12 months ended March 31 falls outside the range of 50 basis points above or below that allowed ROE, then we file to adjust rates under the Rate Stabilization Act.
As of March 31, 2016, the 12-month earned return for SCE&G gas was below the band, and we filed for an annual increase in mid-June. The Public Service Commission approved an annual increase of $4.1 million in September, with rates going into effect for the first billing cycle in November.
As you are also aware, during the first quarter of 2016, we filed an application with the North Carolina Utilities Commission requesting an annual revenue increase at PSNC Energy, in response to the normal attrition in the earned returns in that business. In late August, PSNC Energy entered into a settlement agreement with the public staff, and we expect the decision from the NCUC to be made sometime shortly. As part of the settlement agreement, PSNC Energy agreed to a $19 million revenue increase and an authorized ROE of 9.7%. In addition, the settlement agreement allows PSNC Energy to track and receive ongoing recovery of capital expenses related to its distribution and transmission pipeline integrity management programs. We estimate that slightly more than 20% of our CapEx over the next 3 years will be subject to this integrity management writer. The new rates associated would be effective beginning November 1, 2016.
Slide 9 presents our Capex forecast. This forecast reflects the company's current estimate of new nuclear spending through 2018 and reflects the fixed-price option spending as represented in the ORS settlement agreement as filed September 1. As a reminder, these schedules reflect the existing payment plan and do not incorporate the construction milestone payment schedule as it is still being addressed through the dispute resolution board process. Therefore, it is unlikely that the timing of these expenditures will occur exactly as presented.
At the bottom of the slide, we'll recap the estimated new nuclear CWIP from July 1 through June 30 to correspond to the periods on which the BLRA rate increases are historically calculated. 
Next, on Slide 10, I would like to mention a recent tax election we made to claim Section 174, research and experimentation deductions, for some of our new nuclear costs. After evaluating this section of the tax code, including recent court decisions and recently issued final regulations, and thereafter obtaining extensive external advise, we concluded that the regulations allow application of Section 174, research and experimentation deductions, to our AP1000 units as a pilot model.
We first claimed these deductions on our 2015 return, which was filed last month, and plan to make similar claims on our prospective returns. Essentially, this code section allows a current tax deduction for certain costs incurred in the year they are incurred rather than waiting to receive the deduction through accelerated or bonus tax depreciation once the units are placed in service. By claiming these deductions as costs are incurred, we will forego the depreciation deduction later. In short, it functions much like bonus depreciation in that the deduction is simply accelerated, although in this case it is accelerated and is realized as the money spent rather than at the time the units are placed into service. This election will result in an increase in available cash in the near term and will therefore lessen the need for debt and equity issuances. This should benefit customers in several ways and also benefit existing shareholders to lower dilution. While the exact amounts are not completely known, we have estimated the impact by year through 2018. While at a minimum, customers will benefit from the impact of this cash source in the form of enhanced credit metrics supporting credit ratings. These deductions will also result in accumulation of a deferred tax credit.
Deferred taxes are not contemplated by the BLRA law and will therefore be associated with our base electric business as a reduction to rate base. As such, we have proposed to the ORS that as this credit to retail electric rate base bills and our resulting retail-earned returns increase, we will also flow back benefits directly to customers through a credit or decrement writer to base electric rates. We also plan to propose this to the PSC an accounting petition for their approval. This strategy does not change the timing or amounts of the BLRA revised rate increases for the remainder of the new nuclear construction.
We believe this decrement writer treatment will allow us to offset some of the BLRA rate increases our customers will see during the peak construction years. Additionally, it allows for market ROEs for our shareholders, consistent with our stated strategy of earning a reasonable return on the base business, while avoiding rate increases other than those associated with the BLRA. We do not project this election and proposed treatment will change our earnings guidance as lower dilution and the rate decrements essentially offset one another from an EPS perspective.
Now please look at Slide 11 to review our estimated financing plan through 2018. This plan has been updated to reflect our results year-to-date, the election of the fixed-price option as well as the expected impact of the Section 174 deductions. Note that we have completed all of our planned financings for 2016. As a reminder, we have switched to open-market purchases instead of issuing new shares to fulfill our 401(k) and DRIP plans until we have incremental equity needs, which we currently estimate to be in 2018. Again, it is unlikely that these issuances will occur in the exact amounts or timing as presented as they are subject to changes in our funding needs for planned project expenses and may change based upon the outcome of the petition filing, the dispute resolution board and the actual achievement of milestones. We continue to adjust the financing to match the related project CapEx on a 50-50 debt and equity basis. 
On Slide 12, we are reaffirming our 2016 GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized earnings guidance as $3.90 per share to $4.10 per share with an internal target of $4 per share. Our long-term GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized average annual growth guidance target remains unchanged as we plan to deliver 4% to 6% earnings growth over 3 to 5 years using a base of 2015's GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized EPS of $3.73 per share. 
We plan to address 2017 earnings guidance on the fourth quarter call after the receipt of the construction milestone payment schedule and the conclusion of the petition process.
I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project."

On Slide 13, you can see a photo of Hurricane Matthew making landfall on the South Carolina coast, almost a year to the date of the historic flooding that happened in South Carolina in 2015. I'd like to thank those of you who reached out, and appreciate your thoughts and prayers for those who are affected by the storm and, in some cases, are still trying to recover from last year's flood. I'd also like to thank our linemen, tree crews and support staff as well as those who were dispatched from other areas as far away as Oklahoma, Texas and Mississippi.
Immediately following the impact of the storm, we had approximately 290,000 customers who reported outages. Within 48 hours, we had restored power to 190,000 and 72 hours, had restored power to 250,000 customers. Restoration was complete within 8 days. Over the next few months, we will try to measure the company's impact from the storm, but it will not compare to the significant upheaval in the lives of those who are ultimately affected.
Please now turn to Slide 14. I'd like to discuss the petition that SCE&G filed with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina on May 26 of this year, seeking approval to update the construction milestone schedule as well as the capital cost schedule for the 2 new nuclear units. We are hopeful that the PSC will approve the settlement agreement we entered into with the ORS and 4 other intervenors related to the aforementioned petition. This settlement agreement signifies that no contested issues exist among the settling parties and supports the approval of the revised construction and capital cost schedules.
As Jimmy already mentioned, the settling parties also agreed to revise the allowed return on equity to 10.25% from 10.5%, calculating prospective revised rates sought under the BLRA on or after January 1, 2017. In addition, SCE&G will not file for future requests to amend capital cost schedules until after January 28, 2019.
Slide 15 presents the relative schedule for the petition filing. We filed our direct testimony at the beginning of July, and the ORS followed suit with their testimony and settlement agreement at the beginning of September. Our hearing with the PSC took place at the beginning of this month, including after a minor delay due to Hurricane Matthew. The ORS presented the terms of the settlement agreement at the hearing. A decision by the PSC will come no later than November 28.
Moving to some activities at the new nuclear construction site. Slide 16 presents an aerial photo of the construction table top from June of this year. Here, you can see the significant progress that has been made so far on the project. I have labeled both Units 2 and 3 as well as many other areas of the construction site.
Slide 17 presents a schematic view of the 5 large structural or CA modules that were located inside the containment vessel. We have now placed all of the major CA modules for Unit 2 as we have previously placed CA-01, 03, 04 and 05, and more recently placed CA-02. We have also placed CA-04 and 05 for Unit 3.
Slide 18 shows an aerial view of the Unit 2 nuclear island and containment vessel. Looking down into the containment vessel, you can see the first ring section and the aforementioned structural modules as well as the reactor vessel, which was recently placed and which I'll discuss more shortly. Outside of the containment vessel, you can see the auxilliary building module, CA20, and the shield building, which surrounds the containment vessel.
Slide 19 shows a picture of Unit 2 CA-02 module being placed back in early August. CA-02 is a wall section that forms part of the in-containment refueling water storage tank. 
On Slide 20, you see a picture of Unit 2 reactor vessel being placed. On August 30, this reactor vessel was placed on top of module CA-04 inside the containment vessel. This is a significant milestone for our project as this is the first reactor vessel to be set at a new nuclear plant in the United States in more than 30 years.
Slide 21 shows the placement of the second half of Unit 3's module, CA20, which is an auxilliary building module that is located outside and adjacent to the containment vessel. As you may recall, the first half of this module was previously placed in order to move forward with shield building erection. 
Slide 22 shows a picture of the fabrication of the Unit 3 module, CA-01. This module houses the steam generators and the pressurizer and forms a fueling canal inside of the containment vessel. Currently, all 47 sub-modules are on site, and 44 of those sub-modules are upright and being welded together the module assembly building or MAB. 
Slide 23 shows a picture of the Unit 3 module, CA-02, being fabricated in the MAB. Currently, 2 of the 5 sub-modules has been -- have been upended, and all 5 sub-modules are on site. 
On Slide 24, you can see a photo of the Unit 2 deaereator being placed on the Unit 2 turbine building in late August. We have previously shown pictures of this massive 140-foot-long, 18-foot-diameter component as it was transported to the site by truck. This component purifies feedwater by removing dissolved gases.
Slide 25 shows the generator stator being lifted up to the Unit 2 turbine deck. This is the stationary portion of the main generator and was set on Tuesday of this week.
Lastly, on Slide 26, you can see the Unit 3 turbine building will replace the upper and lower sections of all 3 low-pressure turbine condensers in September. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now be glad to respond to any questions you might have."

I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. Earnings in the third quarter of 2016 were $1.32 per share compared to $1.04 per share in the same quarter of 2015. Electric margins benefited from a Bas",2285,"Thanks, Susan, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. Earnings in the third quarter of 2016 were $1.32 per share compared to $1.04 per share in the same quarter of 2015. Electric margins benefited from a Base Load Review Act rate increase, customer growth and extremely hot weather in the third quarter of 2016 when compared to the same quarter of last year. As an example, Charleston, South Carolina, one of our largest metropolitan areas, registered their hottest month on record in July.
Results also improved due to increased gas margins. As a reminder, during the third quarter of 2015, SCE&G adopted new depreciation rates for electric plant as a result of a study. These new rates, which produced an annual decrease in depreciation expense of approximately $29 million, were effective as of January 1, 2015, resulting in the application of 3 quarters' worth of depreciation savings being applied during the third quarter of 2015.
Additionally, increases in O&M, interest and property taxes had a negative impact on earnings. At the bottom of the slide, you will note that abnormal weather increased electric margins by $0.27 per share in the third quarter of 2016 and $0.11 per share in the third quarter of 2015, resulting in a positive $0.16 per share impact to earnings quarter-over-quarter.
Slide 4 shows earnings per share for the 9 months ended September 30, 2016, were $3.29 per share versus $4.53 per share in 2015. The decline is mainly attributable to the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI. Otherwise, higher electric margins due primarily to a Base Load Review Act rate increase, customer growth and the positive impact of abnormal weather year-to-date would have resulted in improved comparative results. These increases were partially offset by lower gas margins and expected increases in O&M and CapEx-related items, including depreciation, interest and property taxes. Abnormal weather increased electric margins by $0.27 per share for the 3 quarters ended September 30, 2016, and $0.22 per share for the same period in 2015, resulting in a favorable $0.05 per share impact to earnings.
Now on Slide 5, I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. South Carolina Electric & Gas Company's third quarter 2016 earnings were up $0.26 per share compared to the same period of 2015. The increase in earnings is due to higher electric margins, principally as a result of the continued recovery of financing cost through the BLRA and customer growth in addition to abnormally hot weather. These items were partially offset by an increase in operations and maintenance expenses as well as increases in expenses related to our capital program, including interest, depreciation and property taxes. Year-to-date, SCE&G's earnings were up by $0.20 per share in 2016 over the same period of 2015.
PSNC Energy reported a seasonal loss of $0.05 per share in the third quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $0.04 per share in the same quarter of the prior year, primarily due to higher interest expense and depreciation related to the expansion of PSNC Energy's system. For the 9 months ended September 30, earnings were down $0.01 per share in 2016 over the comparative period of 2015.
SCANA Energy provided a $0.02 per share increase in third quarter earnings over the previous year, primarily due to higher margins during the third quarter of 2016 as compared to 2015. Year-to-date, earnings were $0.16 per share compared to $0.17 per share in the prior year, down primarily due to milder weather in the first quarter. 
SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported a loss of $0.05 per share in the third quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $0.06 per share in the comparative quarter. For the 9-month period, these businesses reported a loss of $0.10 per share in 2016 compared to earnings of $1.32 in 2015, primarily due to the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI of $1.41 per share as well as the foregone earnings contributed by CGT and SCI prior to the closing of the sales in the first quarter of 2015.
I would now like to touch on economic trends in our service territory on Slide 6. We're pleased by the continued economic growth in our service territories as evidenced by announcements to invest approximately $1.2 billion, with the expectation of creating approximately 4,600 jobs. At the bottom of the slide, you can see the national unemployment rate, along with the rates for the 3 states where SCANA has a presence and SCE&G's electric territory. South Carolina's unemployment rate is now at 4.9% as is the estimated rate in SCE&G's electric territory. Attesting to our state's strong economic growth, almost 56,000 more South Carolinians are working today than a year ago.
Slide 7 presents customer growth and electric sales statistics. On the top half of the slide is the customer growth rate for each of our regulated businesses. SCE&G's electric business added customers at a year-over-year rate of 1.5%. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina added customers at a rate of 2.8% and 2.9%, respectively. As you can see, the rates are trending fairly consistent over the year. 
The bottom table outlines our actual and weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales for the 12 months ended September 30, 2016. Overall, weather-normalized total retail sales were basically flat on a 12-month-ended basis.
Now please look at Slide 8, which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $10.6 billion. As denoted in the 2 shades of blue, approximately 86% of this rate base is related to the electric business. In the block on the right, you will see SCE&G's base electric business, in which we're allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The earned return for the 12 months ended September 30, 2016, in the base electric business continues to meet our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA-related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. We continue to be pleased with the execution of our strategy.
Continuing down the page, on our new nuclear business, we were allowed an 11% return on equity under the Base Load Review Act for all annual requests for revised rates that were approved prior to 2016. The approval of our 2015 petition revised this allowed ROE down to 10.5% for prospective requests for revised rates, which apply to the request that was approved last week and will become effective in November. Under the terms of our recently announced settlement agreement with the ORS and 4 other intervenors and which Steve will discuss in more depth shortly, the allowed ROE for the new nuclear business will be 10.25% for all prospective requests for revised rates beginning in 2017, if approved by the Public Service Commission of South Carolina. As a reminder, we're allowed a return on equity of 10.25% on gas LDC in South Carolina. If the earned ROE of the gas business for the 12 months ended March 31 falls outside the range of 50 basis points above or below that allowed ROE, then we file to adjust rates under the Rate Stabilization Act.
As of March 31, 2016, the 12-month earned return for SCE&G gas was below the band, and we filed for an annual increase in mid-June. The Public Service Commission approved an annual increase of $4.1 million in September, with rates going into effect for the first billing cycle in November.
As you are also aware, during the first quarter of 2016, we filed an application with the North Carolina Utilities Commission requesting an annual revenue increase at PSNC Energy, in response to the normal attrition in the earned returns in that business. In late August, PSNC Energy entered into a settlement agreement with the public staff, and we expect the decision from the NCUC to be made sometime shortly. As part of the settlement agreement, PSNC Energy agreed to a $19 million revenue increase and an authorized ROE of 9.7%. In addition, the settlement agreement allows PSNC Energy to track and receive ongoing recovery of capital expenses related to its distribution and transmission pipeline integrity management programs. We estimate that slightly more than 20% of our CapEx over the next 3 years will be subject to this integrity management writer. The new rates associated would be effective beginning November 1, 2016.
Slide 9 presents our Capex forecast. This forecast reflects the company's current estimate of new nuclear spending through 2018 and reflects the fixed-price option spending as represented in the ORS settlement agreement as filed September 1. As a reminder, these schedules reflect the existing payment plan and do not incorporate the construction milestone payment schedule as it is still being addressed through the dispute resolution board process. Therefore, it is unlikely that the timing of these expenditures will occur exactly as presented.
At the bottom of the slide, we'll recap the estimated new nuclear CWIP from July 1 through June 30 to correspond to the periods on which the BLRA rate increases are historically calculated. 
Next, on Slide 10, I would like to mention a recent tax election we made to claim Section 174, research and experimentation deductions, for some of our new nuclear costs. After evaluating this section of the tax code, including recent court decisions and recently issued final regulations, and thereafter obtaining extensive external advise, we concluded that the regulations allow application of Section 174, research and experimentation deductions, to our AP1000 units as a pilot model.
We first claimed these deductions on our 2015 return, which was filed last month, and plan to make similar claims on our prospective returns. Essentially, this code section allows a current tax deduction for certain costs incurred in the year they are incurred rather than waiting to receive the deduction through accelerated or bonus tax depreciation once the units are placed in service. By claiming these deductions as costs are incurred, we will forego the depreciation deduction later. In short, it functions much like bonus depreciation in that the deduction is simply accelerated, although in this case it is accelerated and is realized as the money spent rather than at the time the units are placed into service. This election will result in an increase in available cash in the near term and will therefore lessen the need for debt and equity issuances. This should benefit customers in several ways and also benefit existing shareholders to lower dilution. While the exact amounts are not completely known, we have estimated the impact by year through 2018. While at a minimum, customers will benefit from the impact of this cash source in the form of enhanced credit metrics supporting credit ratings. These deductions will also result in accumulation of a deferred tax credit.
Deferred taxes are not contemplated by the BLRA law and will therefore be associated with our base electric business as a reduction to rate base. As such, we have proposed to the ORS that as this credit to retail electric rate base bills and our resulting retail-earned returns increase, we will also flow back benefits directly to customers through a credit or decrement writer to base electric rates. We also plan to propose this to the PSC an accounting petition for their approval. This strategy does not change the timing or amounts of the BLRA revised rate increases for the remainder of the new nuclear construction.
We believe this decrement writer treatment will allow us to offset some of the BLRA rate increases our customers will see during the peak construction years. Additionally, it allows for market ROEs for our shareholders, consistent with our stated strategy of earning a reasonable return on the base business, while avoiding rate increases other than those associated with the BLRA. We do not project this election and proposed treatment will change our earnings guidance as lower dilution and the rate decrements essentially offset one another from an EPS perspective.
Now please look at Slide 11 to review our estimated financing plan through 2018. This plan has been updated to reflect our results year-to-date, the election of the fixed-price option as well as the expected impact of the Section 174 deductions. Note that we have completed all of our planned financings for 2016. As a reminder, we have switched to open-market purchases instead of issuing new shares to fulfill our 401(k) and DRIP plans until we have incremental equity needs, which we currently estimate to be in 2018. Again, it is unlikely that these issuances will occur in the exact amounts or timing as presented as they are subject to changes in our funding needs for planned project expenses and may change based upon the outcome of the petition filing, the dispute resolution board and the actual achievement of milestones. We continue to adjust the financing to match the related project CapEx on a 50-50 debt and equity basis. 
On Slide 12, we are reaffirming our 2016 GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized earnings guidance as $3.90 per share to $4.10 per share with an internal target of $4 per share. Our long-term GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized average annual growth guidance target remains unchanged as we plan to deliver 4% to 6% earnings growth over 3 to 5 years using a base of 2015's GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized EPS of $3.73 per share. 
We plan to address 2017 earnings guidance on the fourth quarter call after the receipt of the construction milestone payment schedule and the conclusion of the petition process.
I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project."

On Slide 13, you can see a photo of Hurricane Matthew making landfall on the South Carolina coast, almost a year to the date of the historic flooding that happened in South Carolina in 2015. I'd like to thank those of you who reached out, and appreciate your thoughts and prayers for those who are affected by the storm and, in some cases, are still trying to recover from last year's flood. I'd also like to thank our linemen, tree crews and support staff as well as those who were dispatched from other areas as far away as Oklahoma, Texas and Mississippi.
Immediately following the impact of the storm, we had approximately 290,000 customers who reported outages. Within 48 hours, we had restored power to 190,000 and 72 hours, had restored power to 250,000 customers. Restoration was complete within 8 days. Over the next few months, we will try to measure the company's impact from the storm, but it will not compare to the significant upheaval in the lives of those who are ultimately affected.
Please now turn to Slide 14. I'd like to discuss the petition that SCE&G filed with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina on May 26 of this year, seeking approval to update the construction milestone schedule as well as the capital cost schedule for the 2 new nuclear units. We are hopeful that the PSC will approve the settlement agreement we entered into with the ORS and 4 other intervenors related to the aforementioned petition. This settlement agreement signifies that no contested issues exist among the settling parties and supports the approval of the revised construction and capital cost schedules.
As Jimmy already mentioned, the settling parties also agreed to revise the allowed return on equity to 10.25% from 10.5%, calculating prospective revised rates sought under the BLRA on or after January 1, 2017. In addition, SCE&G will not file for future requests to amend capital cost schedules until after January 28, 2019.
Slide 15 presents the relative schedule for the petition filing. We filed our direct testimony at the beginning of July, and the ORS followed suit with their testimony and settlement agreement at the beginning of September. Our hearing with the PSC took place at the beginning of this month, including after a minor delay due to Hurricane Matthew. The ORS presented the terms of the settlement agreement at the hearing. A decision by the PSC will come no later than November 28.
Moving to some activities at the new nuclear construction site. Slide 16 presents an aerial photo of the construction table top from June of this year. Here, you can see the significant progress that has been made so far on the project. I have labeled both Units 2 and 3 as well as many other areas of the construction site.
Slide 17 presents a schematic view of the 5 large structural or CA modules that were located inside the containment vessel. We have now placed all of the major CA modules for Unit 2 as we have previously placed CA-01, 03, 04 and 05, and more recently placed CA-02. We have also placed CA-04 and 05 for Unit 3.
Slide 18 shows an aerial view of the Unit 2 nuclear island and containment vessel. Looking down into the containment vessel, you can see the first ring section and the aforementioned structural modules as well as the reactor vessel, which was recently placed and which I'll discuss more shortly. Outside of the containment vessel, you can see the auxilliary building module, CA20, and the shield building, which surrounds the containment vessel.
Slide 19 shows a picture of Unit 2 CA-02 module being placed back in early August. CA-02 is a wall section that forms part of the in-containment refueling water storage tank. 
On Slide 20, you see a picture of Unit 2 reactor vessel being placed. On August 30, this reactor vessel was placed on top of module CA-04 inside the containment vessel. This is a significant milestone for our project as this is the first reactor vessel to be set at a new nuclear plant in the United States in more than 30 years.
Slide 21 shows the placement of the second half of Unit 3's module, CA20, which is an auxilliary building module that is located outside and adjacent to the containment vessel. As you may recall, the first half of this module was previously placed in order to move forward with shield building erection. 
Slide 22 shows a picture of the fabrication of the Unit 3 module, CA-01. This module houses the steam generators and the pressurizer and forms a fueling canal inside of the containment vessel. Currently, all 47 sub-modules are on site, and 44 of those sub-modules are upright and being welded together the module assembly building or MAB. 
Slide 23 shows a picture of the Unit 3 module, CA-02, being fabricated in the MAB. Currently, 2 of the 5 sub-modules has been -- have been upended, and all 5 sub-modules are on site. 
On Slide 24, you can see a photo of the Unit 2 deaereator being placed on the Unit 2 turbine building in late August. We have previously shown pictures of this massive 140-foot-long, 18-foot-diameter component as it was transported to the site by truck. This component purifies feedwater by removing dissolved gases.
Slide 25 shows the generator stator being lifted up to the Unit 2 turbine deck. This is the stationary portion of the main generator and was set on Tuesday of this week.
Lastly, on Slide 26, you can see the Unit 3 turbine building will replace the upper and lower sections of all 3 low-pressure turbine condensers in September. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now be glad to respond to any questions you might have."

Electric margins benefited from a Bas",2285,"Thanks, Susan, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. Earnings in the third quarter of 2016 were $1.32 per share compared to $1.04 per share in the same quarter of 2015. Electric margins benefited from a Base Load Review Act rate increase, customer growth and extremely hot weather in the third quarter of 2016 when compared to the same quarter of last year. As an example, Charleston, South Carolina, one of our largest metropolitan areas, registered their hottest month on record in July.
Results also improved due to increased gas margins. As a reminder, during the third quarter of 2015, SCE&G adopted new depreciation rates for electric plant as a result of a study. These new rates, which produced an annual decrease in depreciation expense of approximately $29 million, were effective as of January 1, 2015, resulting in the application of 3 quarters' worth of depreciation savings being applied during the third quarter of 2015.
Additionally, increases in O&M, interest and property taxes had a negative impact on earnings. At the bottom of the slide, you will note that abnormal weather increased electric margins by $0.27 per share in the third quarter of 2016 and $0.11 per share in the third quarter of 2015, resulting in a positive $0.16 per share impact to earnings quarter-over-quarter.
Slide 4 shows earnings per share for the 9 months ended September 30, 2016, were $3.29 per share versus $4.53 per share in 2015. The decline is mainly attributable to the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI. Otherwise, higher electric margins due primarily to a Base Load Review Act rate increase, customer growth and the positive impact of abnormal weather year-to-date would have resulted in improved comparative results. These increases were partially offset by lower gas margins and expected increases in O&M and CapEx-related items, including depreciation, interest and property taxes. Abnormal weather increased electric margins by $0.27 per share for the 3 quarters ended September 30, 2016, and $0.22 per share for the same period in 2015, resulting in a favorable $0.05 per share impact to earnings.
Now on Slide 5, I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. South Carolina Electric & Gas Company's third quarter 2016 earnings were up $0.26 per share compared to the same period of 2015. The increase in earnings is due to higher electric margins, principally as a result of the continued recovery of financing cost through the BLRA and customer growth in addition to abnormally hot weather. These items were partially offset by an increase in operations and maintenance expenses as well as increases in expenses related to our capital program, including interest, depreciation and property taxes. Year-to-date, SCE&G's earnings were up by $0.20 per share in 2016 over the same period of 2015.
PSNC Energy reported a seasonal loss of $0.05 per share in the third quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $0.04 per share in the same quarter of the prior year, primarily due to higher interest expense and depreciation related to the expansion of PSNC Energy's system. For the 9 months ended September 30, earnings were down $0.01 per share in 2016 over the comparative period of 2015.
SCANA Energy provided a $0.02 per share increase in third quarter earnings over the previous year, primarily due to higher margins during the third quarter of 2016 as compared to 2015. Year-to-date, earnings were $0.16 per share compared to $0.17 per share in the prior year, down primarily due to milder weather in the first quarter. 
SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported a loss of $0.05 per share in the third quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $0.06 per share in the comparative quarter. For the 9-month period, these businesses reported a loss of $0.10 per share in 2016 compared to earnings of $1.32 in 2015, primarily due to the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI of $1.41 per share as well as the foregone earnings contributed by CGT and SCI prior to the closing of the sales in the first quarter of 2015.
I would now like to touch on economic trends in our service territory on Slide 6. We're pleased by the continued economic growth in our service territories as evidenced by announcements to invest approximately $1.2 billion, with the expectation of creating approximately 4,600 jobs. At the bottom of the slide, you can see the national unemployment rate, along with the rates for the 3 states where SCANA has a presence and SCE&G's electric territory. South Carolina's unemployment rate is now at 4.9% as is the estimated rate in SCE&G's electric territory. Attesting to our state's strong economic growth, almost 56,000 more South Carolinians are working today than a year ago.
Slide 7 presents customer growth and electric sales statistics. On the top half of the slide is the customer growth rate for each of our regulated businesses. SCE&G's electric business added customers at a year-over-year rate of 1.5%. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina added customers at a rate of 2.8% and 2.9%, respectively. As you can see, the rates are trending fairly consistent over the year. 
The bottom table outlines our actual and weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales for the 12 months ended September 30, 2016. Overall, weather-normalized total retail sales were basically flat on a 12-month-ended basis.
Now please look at Slide 8, which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $10.6 billion. As denoted in the 2 shades of blue, approximately 86% of this rate base is related to the electric business. In the block on the right, you will see SCE&G's base electric business, in which we're allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The earned return for the 12 months ended September 30, 2016, in the base electric business continues to meet our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA-related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. We continue to be pleased with the execution of our strategy.
Continuing down the page, on our new nuclear business, we were allowed an 11% return on equity under the Base Load Review Act for all annual requests for revised rates that were approved prior to 2016. The approval of our 2015 petition revised this allowed ROE down to 10.5% for prospective requests for revised rates, which apply to the request that was approved last week and will become effective in November. Under the terms of our recently announced settlement agreement with the ORS and 4 other intervenors and which Steve will discuss in more depth shortly, the allowed ROE for the new nuclear business will be 10.25% for all prospective requests for revised rates beginning in 2017, if approved by the Public Service Commission of South Carolina. As a reminder, we're allowed a return on equity of 10.25% on gas LDC in South Carolina. If the earned ROE of the gas business for the 12 months ended March 31 falls outside the range of 50 basis points above or below that allowed ROE, then we file to adjust rates under the Rate Stabilization Act.
As of March 31, 2016, the 12-month earned return for SCE&G gas was below the band, and we filed for an annual increase in mid-June. The Public Service Commission approved an annual increase of $4.1 million in September, with rates going into effect for the first billing cycle in November.
As you are also aware, during the first quarter of 2016, we filed an application with the North Carolina Utilities Commission requesting an annual revenue increase at PSNC Energy, in response to the normal attrition in the earned returns in that business. In late August, PSNC Energy entered into a settlement agreement with the public staff, and we expect the decision from the NCUC to be made sometime shortly. As part of the settlement agreement, PSNC Energy agreed to a $19 million revenue increase and an authorized ROE of 9.7%. In addition, the settlement agreement allows PSNC Energy to track and receive ongoing recovery of capital expenses related to its distribution and transmission pipeline integrity management programs. We estimate that slightly more than 20% of our CapEx over the next 3 years will be subject to this integrity management writer. The new rates associated would be effective beginning November 1, 2016.
Slide 9 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast reflects the company's current estimate of new nuclear spending through 2018 and reflects the fixed-price option spending as represented in the ORS settlement agreement as filed September 1. As a reminder, these schedules reflect the existing payment plan and do not incorporate the construction milestone payment schedule as it is still being addressed through the dispute resolution board process. Therefore, it is unlikely that the timing of these expenditures will occur exactly as presented.
At the bottom of the slide, we'll recap the estimated new nuclear CWIP from July 1 through June 30 to correspond to the periods on which the BLRA rate increases are historically calculated. 
Next, on Slide 10, I would like to mention a recent tax election we made to claim Section 174, research and experimentation deductions, for some of our new nuclear costs. After evaluating this section of the tax code, including recent court decisions and recently issued final regulations, and thereafter obtaining extensive external advise, we concluded that the regulations allow application of Section 174, research and experimentation deductions, to our AP1000 units as a pilot model.
We first claimed these deductions on our 2015 return, which was filed last month, and plan to make similar claims on our prospective returns. Essentially, this code section allows a current tax deduction for certain costs incurred in the year they are incurred rather than waiting to receive the deduction through accelerated or bonus tax depreciation once the units are placed in service. By claiming these deductions as costs are incurred, we will forego the depreciation deduction later. In short, it functions much like bonus depreciation in that the deduction is simply accelerated, although in this case it is accelerated and is realized as the money spent rather than at the time the units are placed into service. This election will result in an increase in available cash in the near term and will therefore lessen the need for debt and equity issuances. This should benefit customers in several ways and also benefit existing shareholders to lower dilution. While the exact amounts are not completely known, we have estimated the impact by year through 2018. While at a minimum, customers will benefit from the impact of this cash source in the form of enhanced credit metrics supporting credit ratings. These deductions will also result in accumulation of a deferred tax credit.
Deferred taxes are not contemplated by the BLRA law and will therefore be associated with our base electric business as a reduction to rate base. As such, we have proposed to the ORS that as this credit to retail electric rate base bills and our resulting retail-earned returns increase, we will also flow back benefits directly to customers through a credit or decrement writer to base electric rates. We also plan to propose this to the PSC an accounting petition for their approval. This strategy does not change the timing or amounts of the BLRA revised rate increases for the remainder of the new nuclear construction.
We believe this decrement writer treatment will allow us to offset some of the BLRA rate increases our customers will see during the peak construction years. Additionally, it allows for market ROEs for our shareholders, consistent with our stated strategy of earning a reasonable return on the base business, while avoiding rate increases other than those associated with the BLRA. We do not project this election and proposed treatment will change our earnings guidance as lower dilution and the rate decrements essentially offset one another from an EPS perspective.
Now please look at Slide 11 to review our estimated financing plan through 2018. This plan has been updated to reflect our results year-to-date, the election of the fixed-price option as well as the expected impact of the Section 174 deductions. Note that we have completed all of our planned financings for 2016. As a reminder, we have switched to open-market purchases instead of issuing new shares to fulfill our 401(k) and DRIP plans until we have incremental equity needs, which we currently estimate to be in 2018. Again, it is unlikely that these issuances will occur in the exact amounts or timing as presented as they are subject to changes in our funding needs for planned project expenses and may change based upon the outcome of the petition filing, the dispute resolution board and the actual achievement of milestones. We continue to adjust the financing to match the related project CapEx on a 50-50 debt and equity basis. 
On Slide 12, we are reaffirming our 2016 GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized earnings guidance as $3.90 per share to $4.10 per share with an internal target of $4 per share. Our long-term GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized average annual growth guidance target remains unchanged as we plan to deliver 4% to 6% earnings growth over 3 to 5 years using a base of 2015's GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized EPS of $3.73 per share. 
We plan to address 2017 earnings guidance on the fourth quarter call after the receipt of the construction milestone payment schedule and the conclusion of the petition process.
I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project."

I'd also like to thank our linemen, tree crews and support staff as well as those who were dispatched from other areas as far away as Oklahoma, Texas and Mississippi.
Immediately following the impact of the storm, we had approximately 290,000 customers who reported outages. Within 48 hours, we had restored power to 190,000 and 72 hours, had restored power to 250,000 customers. Restoration was complete within 8 days. Over the next few months, we will try to measure the company's impact from the storm, but it will not compare to the significant upheaval in the lives of those who are ultimately affected.
Please now turn to Slide 14. I'd like to discuss the petition that SCE&G filed with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina on May 26 of this year, seeking approval to update the construction milestone schedule as well as the capital cost schedule for the 2 new nuclear units. We are hopeful that the PSC will approve the settlement agreement we entered into with the ORS and 4 other intervenors related to the aforementioned petition. This settlement agreement signifies that no contested issues exist among the settling parties and supports the approval of the revised construction and capital cost schedules.
As Jimmy already mentioned, the settling parties also agreed to revise the allowed return on equity to 10.25% from 10.5%, calculating prospective revised rates sought under the BLRA on or after January 1, 2017. In addition, SCE&G will not file for future requests to amend capital cost schedules until after January 28, 2019.
Slide 15 presents the relative schedule for the petition filing. We filed our direct testimony at the beginning of July, and the ORS followed suit with their testimony and settlement agreement at the beginning of September. Our hearing with the PSC took place at the beginning of this month, including after a minor delay due to Hurricane Matthew. The ORS presented the terms of the settlement agreement at the hearing. A decision by the PSC will come no later than November 28.
Moving to some activities at the new nuclear construction site. Slide 16 presents an aerial photo of the construction table top from June of this year. Here, you can see the significant progress that has been made so far on the project. I have labeled both Units 2 and 3 as well as many other areas of the construction site.
Slide 17 presents a schematic view of the 5 large structural or CA modules that were located inside the containment vessel. We have now placed all of the major CA modules for Unit 2 as we have previously placed CA-01, 03, 04 and 05, and more recently placed CA-02. We have also placed CA-04 and 05 for Unit 3.
Slide 18 shows an aerial view of the Unit 2 nuclear island and containment vessel. Looking down into the containment vessel, you can see the first ring section and the aforementioned structural modules as well as the reactor vessel, which was recently placed and which I'll discuss more shortly. Outside of the containment vessel, you can see the auxiliary building module, CA20, and the shield building, which surrounds the containment vessel.
Slide 19 shows a picture of Unit 2 CA-02 module being placed back in early August. CA-02 is a wall section that forms part of the in-containment refueling water storage tank. 
On Slide 20, you see a picture of Unit 2 reactor vessel being placed. On August 30, this reactor vessel was placed on top of module CA-04 inside the containment vessel. This is a significant milestone for our project as this is the first reactor vessel to be set at a new nuclear plant in the United States in more than 30 years.
Slide 21 shows the placement of the second half of Unit 3's module, CA20, which is an auxiliary building module that is located outside and adjacent to the containment vessel. As you may recall, the first half of this module was previously placed in order to move forward with shield building erection. 
Slide 22 shows a picture of the fabrication of the Unit 3 module, CA-01. This module houses the steam generators and the pressurizer and forms a fueling canal inside of the containment vessel. Currently, all 47 sub-modules are on site, and 44 of those sub-modules are upright and being welded together the module assembly building or MAB. 
Slide 23 shows a picture of the Unit 3 module, CA-02, being fabricated in the MAB. Currently, 2 of the 5 sub-modules has been -- have been upended, and all 5 sub-modules are on site. 
On Slide 24, you can see a photo of the Unit 2 deaereator being placed on the Unit 2 turbine building in late August. We have previously shown pictures of this massive 140-foot-long, 18-foot-diameter component as it was transported to the site by truck. This component purifies feedwater by removing dissolved gases.
Slide 25 shows the generator stator being lifted up to the Unit 2 turbine deck. This is the stationary portion of the main generator and was set on Tuesday of this week.
Lastly, on Slide 26, you can see the Unit 3 turbine building will replace the upper and lower sections of all 3 low-pressure turbine condensers in September. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now be glad to respond to any questions you might have."

Earnings in the third quarter of 2016 were $1.32 per share compared to $1.04 per share in the same quarter of 2015. Electric margins benefited from a Base Load Review Act rate increase, customer growth and extremely hot weather in the third quarter of 2016 when compared to the same quarter of last year. As an example, Charleston, South Carolina, one of our largest metropolitan areas, registered their hottest month on record in July.
Results also improved due to increased gas margins. As a reminder, during the third quarter of 2015, SCE&G adopted new depreciation rates for electric plant as a result of a study. These new rates, which produced an annual decrease in depreciation expense of approximately $29 million, were effective as of January 1, 2015, resulting in the application of 3 quarters' worth of depreciation savings being applied during the third quarter of 2015.
Additionally, increases in O&M, interest and property taxes had a negative impact on earnings. At the bottom of the slide, you will note that abnormal weather increased electric margins by $0.27 per share in the third quarter of 2016 and $0.11 per share in the third quarter of 2015, resulting in a positive $0.16 per share impact to earnings quarter-over-quarter.
Slide 4 shows earnings per share for the 9 months ended September 30, 2016, were $3.29 per share versus $4.53 per share in 2015. The decline is mainly attributable to the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI. Otherwise, higher electric margins due primarily to a Base Load Review Act rate increase, customer growth and the positive impact of abnormal weather year-to-date would have resulted in improved comparative results. These increases were partially offset by lower gas margins and expected increases in O&M and CapEx-related items, including depreciation, interest and property taxes. Abnormal weather increased electric margins by $0.27 per share for the 3 quarters ended September 30, 2016, and $0.22 per share for the same period in 2015, resulting in a favorable $0.05 per share impact to earnings.
Now on Slide 5, I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. South Carolina Electric & Gas Company's third quarter 2016 earnings were up $0.26 per share compared to the same period of 2015. The increase in earnings is due to higher electric margins, principally as a result of the continued recovery of financing cost through the BLRA and customer growth in addition to abnormally hot weather. These items were partially offset by an increase in operations and maintenance expenses as well as increases in expenses related to our capital program, including interest, depreciation and property taxes. Year-to-date, SCE&G's earnings were up by $0.20 per share in 2016 over the same period of 2015.
PSNC Energy reported a seasonal loss of $0.05 per share in the third quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $0.04 per share in the same quarter of the prior year, primarily due to higher interest expense and depreciation related to the expansion of PSNC Energy's system. For the 9 months ended September 30, earnings were down $0.01 per share in 2016 over the comparative period of 2015.
SCANA Energy provided a $0.02 per share increase in third quarter earnings over the previous year, primarily due to higher margins during the third quarter of 2016 as compared to 2015. Year-to-date, earnings were $0.16 per share compared to $0.17 per share in the prior year, down primarily due to milder weather in the first quarter. 
SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported a loss of $0.05 per share in the third quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $0.06 per share in the comparative quarter. For the 9-month period, these businesses reported a loss of $0.10 per share in 2016 compared to earnings of $1.32 in 2015, primarily due to the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI of $1.41 per share as well as the foregone earnings contributed by CGT and SCI prior to the closing of the sales in the first quarter of 2015.
I would now like to touch on economic trends in our service territory on Slide 6. We're pleased by the continued economic growth in our service territories as evidenced by announcements to invest approximately $1.2 billion, with the expectation of creating approximately 4,600 jobs. At the bottom of the slide, you can see the national unemployment rate, along with the rates for the 3 states where SCANA has a presence and SCE&G's electric territory. South Carolina's unemployment rate is now at 4.9% as is the estimated rate in SCE&G's electric territory. Attesting to our state's strong economic growth, almost 56,000 more South Carolinians are working today than a year ago.
Slide 7 presents customer growth and electric sales statistics. On the top half of the slide is the customer growth rate for each of our regulated businesses. SCE&G's electric business added customers at a year-over-year rate of 1.5%. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina added customers at a rate of 2.8% and 2.9%, respectively. As you can see, the rates are trending fairly consistent over the year. 
The bottom table outlines our actual and weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales for the 12 months ended September 30, 2016. Overall, weather-normalized total retail sales were basically flat on a 12-month-ended basis.
Now please look at Slide 8, which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $10.6 billion. As denoted in the 2 shades of blue, approximately 86% of this rate base is related to the electric business. In the block on the right, you will see SCE&G's base electric business, in which we're allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The earned return for the 12 months ended September 30, 2016, in the base electric business continues to meet our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA-related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. We continue to be pleased with the execution of our strategy.
Continuing down the page, on our new nuclear business, we were allowed an 11% return on equity under the Base Load Review Act for all annual requests for revised rates that were approved prior to 2016. The approval of our 2015 petition revised this allowed ROE down to 10.5% for prospective requests for revised rates, which apply to the request that was approved last week and will become effective in November. Under the terms of our recently announced settlement agreement with the ORS and 4 other intervenors and which Steve will discuss in more depth shortly, the allowed ROE for the new nuclear business will be 10.25% for all prospective requests for revised rates beginning in 2017, if approved by the Public Service Commission of South Carolina. As a reminder, we're allowed a return on equity of 10.25% on gas LDC in South Carolina. If the earned ROE of the gas business for the 12 months ended March 31 falls outside the range of 50 basis points above or below that allowed ROE, then we file to adjust rates under the Rate Stabilization Act.
As of March 31, 2016, the 12-month earned return for SCE&G gas was below the band, and we filed for an annual increase in mid-June. The Public Service Commission approved an annual increase of $4.1 million in September, with rates going into effect for the first billing cycle in November.
As you are also aware, during the first quarter of 2016, we filed an application with the North Carolina Utilities Commission requesting an annual revenue increase at PSNC Energy, in response to the normal attrition in the earned returns in that business. In late August, PSNC Energy entered into a settlement agreement with the public staff, and we expect the decision from the NCUC to be made sometime shortly. As part of the settlement agreement, PSNC Energy agreed to a $19 million revenue increase and an authorized ROE of 9.7%. In addition, the settlement agreement allows PSNC Energy to track and receive ongoing recovery of capital expenses related to its distribution and transmission pipeline integrity management programs. We estimate that slightly more than 20% of our CapEx over the next 3 years will be subject to this integrity management writer. The new rates associated would be effective beginning November 1, 2016.
Slide 9 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast reflects the company's current estimate of new nuclear spending through 2018 and reflects the fixed-price option spending as represented in the ORS settlement agreement as filed September 1. As a reminder, these schedules reflect the existing payment plan and do not incorporate the construction milestone payment schedule as it is still being addressed through the dispute resolution board process. Therefore, it is unlikely that the timing of these expenditures will occur exactly as presented.
At the bottom of the slide, we'll recap the estimated new nuclear CWIP from July 1 through June 30 to correspond to the periods on which the BLRA rate increases are historically calculated. 
Next, on Slide 10, I would like to mention a recent tax election we made to claim Section 174, research and experimentation deductions, for some of our new nuclear costs. After evaluating this section of the tax code, including recent court decisions and recently issued final regulations, and thereafter obtaining extensive external advise, we concluded that the regulations allow application of Section 174, research and experimentation deductions, to our AP1000 units as a pilot model.
We first claimed these deductions on our 2015 return, which was filed last month, and plan to make similar claims on our prospective returns. Essentially, this code section allows a current tax deduction for certain costs incurred in the year they are incurred rather than waiting to receive the deduction through accelerated or bonus tax depreciation once the units are placed in service. By claiming these deductions as costs are incurred, we will forego the depreciation deduction later. In short, it functions much like bonus depreciation in that the deduction is simply accelerated, although in this case it is accelerated and is realized as the money spent rather than at the time the units are placed into service. This election will result in an increase in available cash in the near term and will therefore lessen the need for debt and equity issuances. This should benefit customers in several ways and also benefit existing shareholders to lower dilution. While the exact amounts are not completely known, we have estimated the impact by year through 2018. While at a minimum, customers will benefit from the impact of this cash source in the form of enhanced credit metrics supporting credit ratings. These deductions will also result in accumulation of a deferred tax credit.
Deferred taxes are not contemplated by the BLRA law and will therefore be associated with our base electric business as a reduction to rate base. As such, we have proposed to the ORS that as this credit to retail electric rate base bills and our resulting retail-earned returns increase, we will also flow back benefits directly to customers through a credit or decrement writer to base electric rates. We also plan to propose this to the PSC an accounting petition for their approval. This strategy does not change the timing or amounts of the BLRA revised rate increases for the remainder of the new nuclear construction.
We believe this decrement writer treatment will allow us to offset some of the BLRA rate increases our customers will see during the peak construction years. Additionally, it allows for market ROEs for our shareholders, consistent with our stated strategy of earning a reasonable return on the base business, while avoiding rate increases other than those associated with the BLRA. We do not project this election and proposed treatment will change our earnings guidance as lower dilution and the rate decrements essentially offset one another from an EPS perspective.
Now please look at Slide 11 to review our estimated financing plan through 2018. This plan has been updated to reflect our results year-to-date, the election of the fixed-price option as well as the expected impact of the Section 174 deductions. Note that we have completed all of our planned financings for 2016. As a reminder, we have switched to open-market purchases instead of issuing new shares to fulfill our 401(k) and DRIP plans until we have incremental equity needs, which we currently estimate to be in 2018. Again, it is unlikely that these issuances will occur in the exact amounts or timing as presented as they are subject to changes in our funding needs for planned project expenses and may change based upon the outcome of the petition filing, the dispute resolution board and the actual achievement of milestones. We continue to adjust the financing to match the related project CapEx on a 50-50 debt and equity basis. 
On Slide 12, we are reaffirming our 2016 GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized earnings guidance as $3.90 per share to $4.10 per share with an internal target of $4 per share. Our long-term GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized average annual growth guidance target remains unchanged as we plan to deliver 4% to 6% earnings growth over 3 to 5 years using a base of 2015's GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized EPS of $3.73 per share. 
We plan to address 2017 earnings guidance on the fourth quarter call after the receipt of the construction milestone payment schedule and the conclusion of the petition process.
I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project."

On Slide 13, you can see a photo of Hurricane Matthew making landfall on the South Carolina coast, almost a year to the date of the historic flooding that happened in South Carolina in 2015. I'd like to thank those of you who reached out, and appreciate your thoughts and prayers for those who are affected by the storm and, in some cases, are still trying to recover from last year's flood. I'd also like to thank our linemen, tree crews and support staff as well as those who were dispatched from other areas as far away as Oklahoma, Texas and Mississippi.
Immediately following the impact of the storm, we had approximately 290,000 customers who reported outages. Within 48 hours, we had restored power to 190,000 and 72 hours, had restored power to 250,000 customers. Restoration was complete within 8 days. Over the next few months, we will try to measure the company's impact from the storm, but it will not compare to the significant upheaval in the lives of those who are ultimately affected.
Please now turn to Slide 14. I'd like to discuss the petition that SCE&G filed with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina on May 26 of this year, seeking approval to update the construction milestone schedule as well as the capital cost schedule for the 2 new nuclear units. We are hopeful that the PSC will approve the settlement agreement we entered into with the ORS and 4 other intervenors related to the aforementioned petition. This settlement agreement signifies that no contested issues exist among the settling parties and supports the approval of the revised construction and capital cost schedules.
As Jimmy already mentioned, the settling parties also agreed to revise the allowed return on equity to 10.25% from 10.5%, calculating prospective revised rates sought under the BLRA on or after January 1, 2017. In addition, SCE&G will not file for future requests to amend capital cost schedules until after January 28, 2019.
Slide 15 presents the relative schedule for the petition filing. We filed our direct testimony at the beginning of July, and the ORS followed suit with their testimony and settlement agreement at the beginning of September. Our hearing with the PSC took place at the beginning of this month, including after a minor delay due to Hurricane Matthew. The ORS presented the terms of the settlement agreement at the hearing. A decision by the PSC will come no later than November 28.
Moving to some activities at the new nuclear construction site. Slide 16 presents an aerial photo of the construction table top from June of this year. Here, you can see the significant progress that has been made so far on the project. I have labeled both Units 2 and 3 as well as many other areas of the construction site.
Slide 17 presents a schematic view of the 5 large structural or CA modules that were located inside the containment vessel. We have now placed all of the major CA modules for Unit 2 as we have previously placed CA-01, 03, 04 and 05, and more recently placed CA-02. We have also placed CA-04 and 05 for Unit 3.
Slide 18 shows an aerial view of the Unit 2 nuclear island and containment vessel. Looking down into the containment vessel, you can see the first ring section and the aforementioned structural modules as well as the reactor vessel, which was recently placed and which I'll discuss more shortly. Outside of the containment vessel, you can see the auxiliary building module, CA20, and the shield building, which surrounds the containment vessel.
Slide 19 shows a picture of Unit 2 CA-02 module being placed back in early August. CA-02 is a wall section that forms part of the in-containment refueling water storage tank. 
On Slide 20, you see a picture of Unit 2 reactor vessel being placed. On August 30, this reactor vessel was placed on top of module CA-04 inside the containment vessel. This is a significant milestone for our project as this is the first reactor vessel to be set at a new nuclear plant in the United States in more than 30 years.
Slide 21 shows the placement of the second half of Unit 3's module, CA20, which is an auxiliary building module that is located outside and adjacent to the containment vessel. As you may recall, the first half of this module was previously placed in order to move forward with shield building erection. 
Slide 22 shows a picture of the fabrication of the Unit 3 module, CA-01. This module houses the steam generators and the pressurizer and forms a fueling canal inside of the containment vessel. Currently, all 47 sub-modules are on site, and 44 of those sub-modules are upright and being welded together the module assembly building or MAB. 
Slide 23 shows a picture of the Unit 3 module, CA-02, being fabricated in the MAB. Currently, 2 of the 5 sub-modules has been -- have been upended, and all 5 sub-modules are on site. 
On Slide 24, you can see a photo of the Unit 2 deaereator being placed on the Unit 2 turbine building in late August. We have previously shown pictures of this massive 140-foot-long, 18-foot-diameter component as it was transported to the site by truck. This component purifies feedwater by removing dissolved gases.
Slide 25 shows the generator stator being lifted up to the Unit 2 turbine deck. This is the stationary portion of the main generator and was set on Tuesday of this week.
Lastly, on Slide 26, you can see the Unit 3 turbine building will replace the upper and lower sections of all 3 low-pressure turbine condensers in September. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now be glad to respond to any questions you might have."
