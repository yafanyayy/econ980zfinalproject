Thanks for joining us. We have a lot of great news to share with you today. We'll be discussing the Meda transaction, reviewing highlights from 2015 and providing guidance for 2016 with or without Meda, give",1390,"Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us. We have a lot of great news to share with you today. We'll be discussing the Meda transaction, reviewing highlights from 2015 and providing guidance for 2016 with or without Meda, given that we expect to close by the end of Q3 this year. Turning first to the transaction we just announced. 
We have agreed to acquire Meda, a leading international specialty pharmaceutical company, via a recommended public offer and a transaction valued at $9.9 billion. We are receiving, including synergies, approximately $1.1 billion in EBITDA. In addition to the Meda Board's recommendation I'm pleased that Meda's 2 largest shareholders, representing approximately 30% of outstanding shares, had irrevocably committed to tender into the offer and intend to remain long-term shareholders of the combined company. 
The strategic rationale for a combination of Mylan and Meda has long been very clear. In addition to being partners since 2011 on EpiPen in Europe, we have had numerous discussions over the years about other ways to collaborate, including our proposal to acquire the company in 2014. Since 2014, the rationale for this combination has only been further enhanced by Meda's acquisition of Roda form and our acquisition of EPD, with the ability to leverage this infrastructure, especially in Europe and emerging markets. 
This combination continues to accelerate the execution of the vision and strategy we made out over a decade ago. The global competitiveness of our industry and consolidation of our customer base continues to drive the importance of scale, and this combination creates a global pharmaceutical leader with 2015 combined revenues of $11.8 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $3.8 billion, a portfolio of more than 2,000 products and critical mass across all commercial channels, including a $1 billion OTC business. 
By offering one of the industry's broadest portfolios of products across all customer channels, including Rx, GX and OTC, we'll be able to meet even more to our customers, which is increasingly important in light of the evolving payer and distributor environment. Geographically, we're gaining more balance and expanded footprint with an even stronger presence across Europe, a leading U.S. specialty business and an expanded presence in emerging markets, including several new and attractive ones, such as China, Southeast Asia, Russia, the Middle East and Mexico. 
Together, we will also become a leader in the global respiratory allergy market and achieve scale in many other therapeutic areas, including dermatology and pain, offering us even greater opportunities for growth in these categories. As you know, we have always been very active in looking at various opportunities. We revisited the Meda opportunity this past summer and continued conversations throughout the fall. During this time, the fundamentals and the inherent value from this combination become even more apparent the more we dug into the business during due diligence, leading to our announcement today. 
This combination will create tremendous value for our shareholders, as well as other stakeholders. On a cash flow basis, at 12.9x 2015 adjusted EBITDA and 8.9x adjusted EBITDA with synergy, we expect to achieve substantial annual operational synergies of approximately $350 million in year 4. We believe we are paying an attractive multiple that is in line with market precedents for such scarce, high-quality assets. 
The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to Mylan earnings with accretion increasing significantly after the first full year 2017 as synergies are realized. Most importantly, the transaction create the opportunity to achieve $0.35 to $0.40 accretion in 2017 and to accelerate achievement of our previously stated $6 adjusted diluted EPS target to 2015 versus 2018. 
We expect to see accelerated earnings and EBITDA growth going forward, as well as substantial cash flows and enhanced margin. Even with the financial commitment to this transaction, we still have ample financial flexibility for business development activity for additional share buyback, all while keeping our commitment to investment grade. 
Given our long history together, we know Meda's business, their people and their culture extremely well, and we believe that we'll be able to quickly and smoothly integrate this business. I look forward to working with and welcoming Meda's leadership team and talented workforce to our organization. They have built a terrific company, and I believe we will be able to achieve great things together. 
With that, let me turn out to the highlights of our performance during 2015. Mylan again had an outstanding year, delivering exceptional financial results while continuing to execute on our long-term growth drivers. 
On the top line, we generated adjusted total revenues of approximately $9.4 billion despite considerable FX headwind, representing a year-over-year constant-currency increase of 28%. On the bottom line, adjusted diluted EPS came in at $4.30, a 21% year-over-year increase even after absorbing $0.11 of that FX headwind, which put us at the high-end of our guidance range. We also had a record year with respect to cash. Adjusted free cash flow more than doubled and adjusted free cash flow stood at 87% of adjusted net income. 
In addition, we closed on 2 strategic acquisitions during the year. First was Abbotts EBD business, which has surpassed our growth expectation and is proving to be a solid revenue contributor. Second, was the Family Care transaction, which we are now well underway to creating a leading women's health care franchise. 
Also noteworthy during 2015 was the further strengthening of our EpiPen franchise and our continued efforts to increase awareness and expand access to the anaphylaxis market. One point of note. While we saw higher sales of EpiPen due to higher volumes that resulted in part from the on Lake you recall, we saw the same net payer pricing dynamics that existed throughout 2015, and we don't expect material changes to the environment in 2016. 
We also continued to make good progress across our strategic growth drivers. In our respiratory program, we recently announced that we submitted our ANDA for generic Advair. We are extremely excited about this opportunity, and we continue to believe that Mylan will be the first company to bring generic Advair to the U.S. market in 2017. 
And building on our successful Biocon partnership, we announced earlier this year an exclusive global agreement with momentum of the expense our portfolio Biologics with up to 6 additional products and broadens the scope and scale of our capability. The combination of this program and our Biocon partnership positions Mylan as a worldwide leader in the Biologics space. 
In summary, 2015 underscores the power of the exceptional global platform we've built and our ability to absorb volatility and maximize opportunity. It also reflects the superb execution and teamwork by Mylan's employees around the world. And on behalf of the Board of Directors and our entire leadership team, I'd like to thank them for an outstanding year and a job very well done. 
Now turning to 2016. We look forward to delivering yet another year of outstanding financial performance. On the top line, we expect growth of approximately 16% compared to 2015 and a guidance range of $10.5 billion to $11.5 billion. On the bottom line, we expect growth of approximately 16% year-over-year with guidance range for adjusted diluted EPS of $4.85 to $5.15. Our guidance ranges include a quarter's worth of contribution from Meda. However, we are also committed to these ranges without Meda. 
And as mentioned earlier, we see opportunity to accelerate the achievement of our $6 adjusted diluted EPS target for 2017. I'd now like to take a minute to thank John, who's retiring from Mylan on April 1, for his service to our company. During his 6 years with us, John helped shape the company's ongoing transformation into a global leader in health care. We are all wishing him the very best as he enters this new chapter of his life. 
Before I turn the call over to Tony, I'd also like to take a moment to congratulate him on being appointed Mylan's chief commercial Officer, which became effective earlier this year. Tony's been with the company for nearly 20 years and was recently successfully led our largest commercial business in North American region for the last 4 years. In his new role, Tony oversees all of our commercial businesses around the world. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to him to discuss the performance of our core business during 2015."

As mentioned earlier, Mylan had a phenomenal year with constant-currency adjusted total revenues rising 28% compared to 2014, coming from 9% growth in our legacy business and 19% from EPD. All of our regions and businesses contributed to the strong performance. 
In our North America generic segments, revenues totaled nearly $4 billion, a 16% increase compared to 2014. Growth came mainly from sales of new products and to a lesser extent, from the EPD business. Also contributing were higher volumes on existing products, partially offset by lower pricing. 
In Europe, sales totaled $2.2 billion in 2015, a year-over-year constant increase of 67%. Growth came primarily from sales generated by EPD and to a lesser extent, from new products. Higher volumes on existing products, mainly in France and Italy, were offset by lower pricing throughout the region. 
In the rest of world, sales totaled $2 billion, a year-over-year increase of 38% constant-currency. The growth came from EPD, new product launches in Australia and Japan and higher volumes in India, predominantly of ARVs, and in Brazil. Increases were offset somewhat by lower volumes on existing products in Japan and lower pricing in the region. 
Our specialty business delivered revenues of $1.2 billion in 2015, an increase of 1% compared to 2014. In addition to the strong performance of EpiPen, as Heather referenced, sales of performance in all Kiva increased by double-digit percentage points from the prior year. 
I would also like to note that our EPD Business grew 2% year-over-year, demonstrating again our ability to take a declining business and drive growth ahead of our expectations. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to John."
290203,322781001,930856,"Mylan N.V., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2016",2016-02-10,"Earnings Calls","Viatris Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tony. Good afternoon, everyone. As Heather and Tony both mentioned, we're extremely pleased with our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015, highlighted by the strong growth in our Generics segment and the exceptional adjusted",906,"Thanks, Tony. Good afternoon, everyone. As Heather and Tony both mentioned, we're extremely pleased with our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015, highlighted by the strong growth in our Generics segment and the exceptional adjusted free cash flow we generated. 
Our total revenues for the fourth quarter of 2015 were $2.5 billion, an increase of 24% on a constant-currency basis from the prior year period. Revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign currency translation by approximately $91 million in the current quarter when compared to the prior year period. 
Adjusted total revenues for 2015 were $9.4 billion, an increase of 28% on a constant-currency basis from the prior year, which includes revenues from the EPD Business of approximately $1.5 billion. Revenues for the full year 2015 were unfavorably impacted by foreign currency translation by approximately $433 million when compared to the prior year period and more than $300 million compared to the FX rates we use for providing our financial guidance at the beginning of the year. 
For the fourth quarter, third party net sales were positively impacted by the contribution from the acquired EPD Business of approximately $456 million, of which approximately $286 million was in Europe and $123 million was in our Rest of World region, with the remainder coming from EPD Canada. 
As a reminder, beginning in 2016, the EPD Business and Mylan commercial businesses are operating as one. As such, separate revenue information will no longer be reported. Adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter and full year of 2015 was a very strong 56%, up 200 basis points for the quarter and approximately 320 basis points for the full year. 
Our strong margins are primarily the result of the positive contribution from the acquired EPD Business combined with new product introductions. R&D expense on an adjusted basis was approximately 6% of total revenues for the fourth quarter and approximately 7% of total adjusted revenues for the full year. R&D expense for the quarter and full year increased due to the impact of the acquired EPD Business, as well as the continued development of our respiratory, insulin and biologics programs. 
At the same time, SG&A of, also on an adjusted basis, was approximately 20% of total adjusted revenues for the quarter and full year, which includes the impact of the EPD Business. Throughout 2015, we continue to realize additional tax benefits from the EPD transaction. And as a result of our ongoing efforts to optimize our tax structure, we had an adjusted effective tax rate for the full year of approximately 17%. We continue to look at additional tax planning strategies for opportunities to further reduce our annual effective tax rate in 2016 and beyond. 
Also this quarter, adjusted net earnings were $620 million or $1.22 per share, a 16% increase from our Q4 2014 adjusted diluted EPS of $1.05 per share. For the full year 2015, our adjusted net earnings were $2.14 billion or $4.30 per share, a 21% increase from 2014 adjusted diluted EPS of $3.56 and at the high end of our previously communicated guidance. 
It's important to note that U.S. GAAP requires EPS to be calculated for each individual period based on the average outstanding share count for that period. As a result of the issuance of shares to Abbott in the first quarter of 2015, our adjusted diluted EPS for the calendar year and the sum of the quarters does not add by $0.04 per share. Our 2015 EPS growth was achieved in spite of unrelenting foreign currency headwinds, which reduced our calendar year adjusted diluted EPS by $0.11 per share versus our guidance rates at the beginning of the year and by $0.18 per share versus 2014's actual FX rate. 
Our very strong 2015 adjusted diluted EPS resulted from the strength of our global operating platform, including the acquired EPD Business, and the organic revenue growth across our legacy generics business. 
Turning to our cash flow and liquidity metrics. Adjusted cash provided by operating activities was an impressive $2.2 billion for the calendar year, representing an increase of approximately $1 billion from the prior year, which is the result of the growth in the adjusted earnings combined with our ongoing working capital initiatives. Through diligent cash flow management, our adjusted free cash flow totaled $1.9 billion through 2015. 
As a result of our strong operating cash flow at the end of the year, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was less than 2x. We have no amounts outstanding on our $400 million AR facility or our $1.6 billion revolving credit facility, and we have full access to the more than $1 billion of cash on our balance sheet. As we look towards 2016, we remain fully committed to our investment grade credit rating, including after the successful completion of the offer to acquire Meda, and we continue to have ample borrowing capacity and financial flexibility. 
As a reminder, we have fully committed financing to fund the acquisition of Meda. To summarize, we finished the year stronger than ever and begin 2016 with ample financial flexibility. Our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results were outstanding as we continue to expense the positive impact of the EPD Business combined with the continued organic growth of our legacy business and the strength of our global operating platform. 
I'll now turn the call over to Rajiv to review the Meda transaction in more detail"

At the outset, I would like to echo Heather's sentiments and say that I very much look forward to welcoming and working with Meda's leadership team and workforce. As Heather noted earlier, this transaction to us because Meda is an excerpt on a highly strategic for Mylan. We have always been active in evaluating many different strategic opportunities, looking for companies and assets that would compliment our existing stance and capabilities, make our company financially stronger and better position us to achieve our mission, strategy and sustainable growth. This acquisition delivers on all of those categories in a powerful way. Meda is a highly profitable and durable business, delivering total sales of about $2.3 billion in 2015 and with estimated growth through 2018 of about 3% in revenues and about 5% in adjusted EBITDA. Meda brings us a very attractive portfolio, including about 900 branded OTC and generic products with strong positions in respiratory, allergy, dermatology, pain and GII. Through this transaction, we are adding nearly 4,500 employees, including Meda's robust sales and marketing organization of more than 2,600 people with strong businesses in Europe, U.S. and exciting businesses in key emerging markets. Meda also brings a complementary network of 7 manufacturing facilities in Europe, U.S.A. and India, which further strengthens our operating platform and provides us with nice capabilities in that is, topicals, leakers and DPI. 
While you can see that this is a very attractive asset, this not just about what Meda is delivering on a stand-alone basis, but what we can do together. Let's look at that now. On the next slide, you can begin to see what Mylan and Meda look like on a combined basis and see how Meda further diversifies and strengthens our business by both geography and by channel. 
On a 2015 combined basis, we'll go from having 2/3 of our revenues from generics to generics making up just more than half of our business. Combined, our specialty business would represent more than 1/3 of the business and OTC, about 10%. As you can see, combined company will have a diversified portfolio of more than 2,000 branded, OTC and generic products and the addition of Meda's portfolio, the strength of my Lance branded and OTC portfolio in all regions. 
Geographically, we continue to enhance the balance of our business between North America, Europe and emerging markets, with an even larger European business and more diversified emerging markets business. Our continued focus on diversification across portfolio, channel and geography, helps to both [indiscernible] platform and strengthen our ability to capitalize on our high-value future launches. 
Turning to the next slide. You can see the diversity of this combined portfolio broken out by the sales contribution of each therapeutic area. To give you a sense of the enhanced scale, we'll have in key therapeutic categories, we expect to have 6 -- $1 billion franchises at close. Respiratory allergy, GII, cardio, CNS, deputies and metabolic and infectious disease. Further, we will have significantly enhanced our presence in other areas, such as dermatology, women's health, anesthesia and pain. We see a great deal of opportunity to begin building total patient and pharmacy solution around these franchises, given the breadth of our presence and ability to meet customer and patient needs. 
On this next slide, you can get a sense of this portfolio and pipeline that -- and kept in some of these large, strategic therapeutic categories across branded, generic and OTC products. 
First and foremost is our combined allergies respiratory franchise, where we see opportunities to really leverage our breadth and scale commercially with products, including EpiPen and Dimesta, and position ourselves to maximize upcoming launches such as generic Advair and represents an.'S storm is another exciting opportunity for us in one Mylan has been either to expanding. 
As you can see, Meda some branded portfolio, with market leaders like Elidel, nicely complements Mylan's largely generics portfolio and provides opportunity to enhance our presence in the space across channels. Similarly, in pain, the Meda portfolio is complementary to Mylan's portfolio which was enhance significantly through the acquisition of our Albert EPD Business. 
As you can see, these are leading, durable brands that lie in Mylan score areas of strategic focus. Meda enhances our already strong expertise in market luggage in these areas and together, we of the platform, capabilities, speed and agility to maximize these portfolios. In addition, the Meda business will benefit from our steadfast dedication to our robust R&D efforts, thorough innovation in the combined business will be fueled by Mylan's commitment to R&D and expansion of our product portfolio. 
Again, this transaction delivers on one of Mylan's key strategic imperatives: Expansion, in the OTC market, and Meda's strength in this area was an important differentiating factor for us when evaluating this transaction. Meda has a substantial OTC presence in Europe and emerging markets and an exciting platform for growth in U.S. This combination instantly creates a $1 billion global OTC business and a foundation for further expansion. I would like to note that met META's portfolio is not a private-label business. It's all branded OTC product, which yield much higher margins and it contains some very well established and differentiated OTC brands. We see many opportunities to leverage this OTC portfolio through our combined global platform and we are confident in our ability to accelerate growth in this business through marketing and line extensions. 
Further, we see exciting possibilities for future business development and M&A. We'll continue to maintain our strategic and opportunistic approach in this regard. Turning to the next slide. You can see how Meda will expand Mylan's geographic footprint. Meda provides us with 16 new countries and builds real critical mass commercially across Europe and emerging markets, while deepening our presence in Americas. 
The combined company will sell into more than 165 countries around the world with the direct commercial presence in about 60 markets. Our combined sales force will number approximately 5,900 people. Looking at this map, you can see that we are increasing our sales headcount by about 50% in both Americas and Europe and nearly doubling it in emerging markets. 
Especially in Europe, we are adding very significantly to our manpower in critical growth markets, giving us the breadth and scale we need to continue building our entire portfolio of products and services. As we look at our enhanced and diversified geographic profile, we also believe we have an opportunity to optimize this infrastructure and accelerate our growth, especially our EPD business and across emerging markets. 
On the next slide, you can see another differentiating factor for Mylan and for the combined business, our OnDemand manufacturing and supply chain platform. We are excited to deploy this platform to Meda and see opportunities for efficiencies and integration along the supply chain, providing opportunities for synergies. 
With that, I would like to turn it back over to Tony to walk through in greater detail the geographies we are strengthening to this transaction."

I, too, would like to expose enthusiasm to welcoming Meda's team to our organization and working alongside them to deliver help better health for a better world. As you've seen, this combination grates an even stronger commercial platform around the world. On the next slide, you can see how Meda adds considerable strength and scale to our already robust business in Europe. The combined company generated about $3.8 billion in 2015 revenues from Europe. About 60% more than Mylan would've had on a stand-alone basis. As you know, scale is very important this region given the highly competitive market dynamics. On the chart on the right, you can see that we have increase scale across each of our key European countries with significant enhancements to our businesses in Germany, the Nordics, Italy and France, among others. Meda's business, women's and builds on the strengths of our EPD asset to create a deeper, stronger and more diversified platform across Europe that can further maximize market opportunities and whether challenges. Meda also provides us with a strong and durable OTC business in Europe, which makes us a leader across all channels. 
I also note that the transaction consolidates EpiPen for us in Europe. Meda has been marketing this key product for us in the region for several years, and we believe that bringing this product into our combined commercial infrastructure with a greater ability to leverage our global expertise in this area, will allow us to drive greater performance from this product. 
On the next slide, you will get a sense of how this transaction automatically accelerate Mylan's growth in emerging markets by creating a diversified scale business a $1.5 billion in 2015 pro forma revenues. The 16 new countries we were adding to this transaction are in the emerging market area with Meda providing us entry to exciting new markets, such as China, Russia, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Turkey and Mexico. China has long been an area of interest for us, but we have been very deliberate about how we get into this market. We are pleased that Meda has a strong history in China, having established its business there in 1994 and that it has operates the business is an owned affiliate since 2011. 
Importantly, Meda has a direct sales presence in many of these key markets, not relying on a contract sales organization in these important countries. For instance, Meda has reps on the ground in China, Russia and Turkey, among other countries. Meda also has done a great job of establishing strong brands in these markets. Some of the key ones are listed here. And we look for to leveraging our combined portfolio across the region. 
We see longer-term opportunities to bring Mylan's differentiated portfolio into these new markets, especially in infectious disease, Biologics, insulins and women's health. While our presence in many of these markets is still small, it provides an exciting foothold and opportunity to build upon. On the next slide, we come back to our core mission of providing access to 7 billion people. This combination means we will be better able to serve the evolving needs of our customers across all channels by being able to offer them a greater diversity of products and by selling one Mylan around the world. We've already seen the value of our one Mylan approach with EPD in our existing specialty generics businesses in terms of being able to leverage our powerful platform to bring more value to our customers through a broader range of products and services and total patient and pharmacy solutions. 
Further, by working together across all our channels, we've been able to leverage commercial best practices in customer relationships to deliver more. Now John will walk you through the deal structure and resulting financial profile of Mylan."

In announcement, the value is equal to SEK",1134,"Thanks, Tony. Let me start by providing a critical review of the transactions turn. This transaction is structured as a recommended public offer to the shareholders of Meda to tender all of their shares to Mylan. In announcement, the value is equal to SEK 165 per Meda share, consisting of SEK 132 in cash and the remainder in Mylan ordinary shares for a transaction value of approximately $9.9 billion. The Meda board has recommended the offer and Meda shareholders representing approximately 30% of the outstanding shares irrevocably committed to accept the offer. 
As I mentioned earlier, we expect the transaction will close at the end of the third quarter of 2016, subject to receipt a typical regulatory clearances, acceptance of the offer by more than 90% of Meda's shareholders and satisfaction of other customary conditions. The offer is not subject to any financing conditions or approval by Mylan shareholders. 
As Heather outlined earlier, this transaction provides compelling financial benefits for shareholders and other stakeholders of both companies. 
As mentioned earlier, we see opportunities to accelerate the achievement of our $6 adjusted diluted EPS target to 2017. We also will complete the integration by the end of year 3, realizing the full financial benefit of approximately $350 million in synergies in year 4. 
As you know, we have a proven track record of achieving our synergy targets and we are confident that these synergies are highly achievable. As you can see on this next slide, the transaction will deliver significant accretion with a CAGR from 2015 to 2017 of more than 18%. 
Moving to the next slide. The implied multiples for this transaction are inclined with relevant market presidents for scarce, high-quality assets like Meda. As you can see, we expect a trailing synergize multiple of 8.9x. 
On the following slide, you see just how Mylan will continue to have a very strong financial profile post transaction and that we are positioned for continued growth. We expect our pro forma leverage to be approximately 3.8x debt to adjusted EBITDA at transaction close. We also expect we will maintain our investment-grade credit rating, which again, is an important attribute for any deal we pursue. As you can see on the charts, we expect just debt to adjusted EBITDA of less than 3x by the end of 2017. With our significant free cash flow's, highly leverage about infrastructure and a competitive global pack structure, we continue to have the financial flexibility to competitively pursue the right additional opportunities as they arise. 
We intend to continue to serve as the leading consolidator in our industry in a way that meets our mission and business strategy and continues to deliver value to our shareholders. 
I would now like to walk through our financial guidance for 2016 in further detail. At the bottom line, we are projecting adjusted diluted EPS between $4.85 and $5.15 per share, the midpoint of which is an increase of 16% from 2015 adjusted diluted EPS. This EPS guidance range is based on the following income statement line item guidance metrics, all of which are on unadjusted basis with the exception of total revenue. Total revenues are projected to be between $10.5 billion and $11.5 billion. The midpoint of which is an increase of 16% from 2015 total adjusted revenues. This guidance range includes a quarter's worth of contribution from Meda. However, we're also committed to these ranges without Meda. 
Excluding Meda, our generics business is expected to generate revenue growth of approximately 20% in 2016, while specialty is expected to generate revenue growth of approximately 8%. Revenues from new business, including Meda and EPD for the full year, are expected to be between $800 million and $900 million, and the remaining increase in revenue will come equally from increased volumes on existing products and new product launches. 
Adjusted gross margins will increase again to be between 55% and 57%. Drivers of the increase include new product revenues and the strength of our North American generics business, as we continue to benefit from an improved product mix. 
Adjusted SG&A will be between 19% and 20% of total revenues, which includes a full year impact of the EPD Business. Adjusted R&D will be between 6% and 7% of total revenues, as we continue to invest in our future biologics, insulin and respiratory programs. 
Using these guidance metrics, we project adjusted EBITDA of between $3.5 billion and $4 billion. Also, we expect our adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 15% to 17%. Based upon the 2016 guidance metrics for adjusted operating cash flow of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion and capital expenditures between $400 million and $500 million, we're projecting adjusted free cash flow in the range of $2 billion to $2.1 billion. 
Finally, we are projecting an average diluted share count of between 520 million and 530 million shares, which includes the weighted average shares issued for the acquisition of Meda and the settlement this April of the warrants related to cash convertible notes, which were cash settled in 2015. 
As this chart demonstrates, our 2016 financial guidance provide significant operating leverage, including increasing adjusted gross and EBITDA margins and declining adjusted R&D and SG&A as a percent of revenue, resulting in our adjusted diluted EPS growth of 16%. 
Looking at the bridge to 2016 revenue guidance, revenues from new product launches, combined with volume growth in our base business, will serve to offset price erosion on existing products. In terms of base pricing assumptions in the Generics segment, as we traditionally have, we assume low to mid single-digit price erosion. 
In specialty, we've assumed high single-digit growth in terms of pricing. We expect revenue from the Meda acquisition to contribute approximately $500 million to $600 million of incremental revenue in 2016. In addition, revenue from new business includes the full year impact of the EPD Business. 
As mentioned previously, our 2016 guidance FX rate do not result in a significant year-over-year foreign currency translation impacts on our 2016 revenue guidance range. 
This chart provides the projected bridge between our 2015, actual 2015 adjusted diluted EPS of $4.30, and the midpoint of our 2016 guidance range of $5, showing a year-over-year increase of 16%. New product launches from our legacy business and to a lesser extent, margin expansion, will drive our earnings growth in 2016. Partially offsetting this earnings growth will be increased investments in R&D, spending and higher interest expense, largely due to the financing of the Meda acquisition. 
From a phasing perspective, we expect the quarterly development of our EPS for 2016 to be similar to 2015, with Q1 being relatively flat to the prior year, Q3 being our highest quarter of the year and followed next by Q4. 
That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Heather"

Further, by successfully executing on our vision and strategy for the past decade, we have delivered exceptional results for our shareholders with an earnings CAGR of 26% to 2016. Again, with this Meda transaction, we have the opportunity to accelerate our 2018 earnings target of $6 and adjusted diluted EPS of 2017. I now look forward for taking your questions. Thank you."

And I think that, certainly, there is significant macro dynamics at play with the market today. I think we see that systemically across, especially the health care sector. And I think that we were fortunate to have a very high-quality process and have the ability to do due diligence. And the more we dug, the more comfortable we are, not only with the strategic and the compelling rationale, but as I mentioned, it even then was much more enhanced with their addition of Rocky farm, which we had looked at several years ago and very much like that asset, as well as our EPD Business and how that's going to allow us to really leverage infrastructure in Europe, as well as bringing on 16 additional countries, where we'll be able to now have infrastructure to lever the Mylan current portfolio, as well as pipeline. So the strategic and fundamentals of the company have not changed. And when you look at just over the last couple of months, like I've said, think it's much more to the macro dynamics and we believe the long term decisions are much Mylan when you look at the multiples, they're very much in line for assets such as this, scarce, high-quality. And so we believe the value really speaks for itself of what we're creating for shareholders and what this combination can do going forward. And like you said, immediately accretive. Rajiv?"

That, by no means, that's just the beginning of what the Meda, Mylan combination will bear. I think importantly, not only does it accelerate near-term accretion and shareholder value. But over the longer term, I think, as we've said, the strategic rationale speaks for itself. The complementary nature of the product portfolio will now have over 2,000 products across multiple geographies, expansion into emerging markets that allow us more leverage. Our portfolio, when you look over the next 10 years to our Biologics, insulin. I mean, the opportunities to truly maximize these launches this territories with this infrastructure is just, in our opinion, going to be unparalleled. I think that Mylan will be positioned as a truly diversified global generics and specialty pharmaceutical company that's able to deliver through our unprecedented global supply chain to be able now to apply that and in addition, to now have the kind of commercial infrastructure and operational infrastructure that will allow us to continue to add on whether it's other dosage forms. We've talked about everything from terms to a sonic to new therapeutic categories. So honestly, we just see the $6 in 2017 as the beginning to continuing the growth trajectory that our shareholders have enjoyed over the last 10 years. And certainly, as we close the transaction and we move forward, we'll be giving continued guidance and updating the longer-term trajectory. But I can assure you, it will continue -- this platform will continue to deliver, as it has in the past. As far as EpiPen, Jami, I think that I've tried throughout 2015, especially the beginning of the year, to point out that Mylan have been very proactive in maintaining our market share in a very competitive, multi for an marketplace, and that involved entering contracts with our players, long-term, multiyear contracts. And I think then when the unprecedented event of a of queue having to do a complete product recall. While we absolutely enjoyed volume increases and we see obviously that continuing through 2016, what I pointed out is the net price from the payer was mainly what it had been throughout 2015, and we don't see that materially changing. I mean, I think it's important to remember that we're dealing with a whole portfolio of products with these payers, that is not about any one product. And while we continue to be opportunistic, I think that, as I've said, EpiPen is a very important brand for us and brand franchise going forward that it more and more represents -- is a much smaller part of Mylan. And certainly now, as the Mylan-Meda combination, again, is the diversification is taken away from any concentration from any one product. Thank you."

As far as the contracts that I mentioned, look, we were, as I mentioned in 2015, the aggressiveness came from the current multiethnic market and the players that were in there, including Auvi-Q and Sanofi. So like I've said, we were maintaining market share. And I think where a bit of a disconnect came is that people believe that once Auvi-Q was recalled, that the world would go back to treat or number Auvi-Q in the market. And it's a very unprecedented event that I don't know that really has ever happened before. And so I think, as we look forward, as we said, we're managing a whole portfolio of products with these payers. The contracts are all different in nature. And so certainly, we're not going to comment on any individual contract. I'm just trying to give some flavor to and feeling that EpiPen is an extremely important brand franchise. We think it has great brand equity and it will be an important franchise for us for years to come. It's just more and more represents a much less portion of Mylan's overall business and especially, on now a combined Mylan and Meda front."

First, I would say we're taking -- sharing this product between 3 companies. Pfizer manufactures the product, and then Mylan owns, the EpiPen; and then Meda was our partner in Europe. So just the opportunity to contract back down to 2 certainly makes the financial dynamics much more attractive. And obviously, throughout Europe, the certain dynamics around pricing and again, being multi-FNA for in market places in many of those countries certainly had made challenges and continue to grow that product. I think now in our hands, when you look at the infrastructure with the combined Abbott EPD Business and now with Meda, we're going to have much further reach and be able to, I think truly invest in a much different way than Meda as the third-party partner was able to do. So it's not only divisive throughout Europe as an opportunity, but as we continue to look and that enhancements and how we bring EpiPen to the market in various other regions around the world, we do see, like I said, a lot of opportunity even outside of Europe with the rest of the world as we continue to invest around EpiPen and the awareness of meaningful access. Well, thank you, everyone. Appreciated all the questions and look forward to seeing you soon."

Thanks for joining us. We have a lot of great news to share with you today.

Thanks for joining us. We have a lot of great news to share with you today. We'll be discussing the Meda transaction, reviewing highlights from 2015 and providing guidance for 2016 with or without Meda, given that we expect to close by the end of Q3 this year. 
Turning first to the transaction we just announced. We have agreed to acquire Meda, a leading international specialty pharmaceutical company, via a recommended public offer and a transaction valued at $9.9 billion. We are receiving, including synergies, approximately $1.1 billion in EBITDA. In addition to the Meda Board's recommendation, I'm pleased that Meda's 2 largest shareholders, representing approximately 30% of outstanding shares, had irrevocably committed to tender into the offer and intend to remain long-term shareholders of the combined company. 
The strategic rationale for a combination of Mylan and Meda has long been very clear. In addition to being partners since 2011 on EpiPen in Europe, we have had numerous discussions over the years about other ways to collaborate, including our proposal to acquire the company in 2014. Since 2014, the rationale for this combination has only been further enhanced by Meda's acquisition of Rottapharm and our acquisition of EPD, with the ability to leverage this infrastructure, especially in Europe and emerging markets. 
This combination continues to accelerate the execution of the vision and strategy we've laid out over a decade ago. The global competitiveness of our industry and consolidation of our customer base continues to drive the importance of scale, and this combination creates a global pharmaceutical leader with 2015 combined revenues of $11.8 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $3.8 billion, a portfolio of more than 2,000 products and critical mass across all commercial channels, including a $1 billion OTC business. 
By offering one of the industry's broadest portfolios of products across all customer channels, including Rx, GX and OTC, we'll be able to mean even more to our customers, which is increasingly important in light of the evolving payer and distributor environment. Geographically, we're gaining more balance and expanded global footprint with an even stronger presence across Europe, a leading U.S. specialty business and an expanded presence in emerging markets, including several new and attractive ones such as China, Southeast Asia, Russia, the Middle East and Mexico. 
Together, we will also become a leader in the global respiratory allergy market and achieve scale in many other therapeutic areas, including dermatology and pain, offering us even greater opportunities for growth in these categories. As you know, we have always been very active in looking at various opportunities. We revisited the Meda opportunity this past summer and continued conversations throughout the fall. During this time, the fundamentals and the inherent value from this combination become even more apparent the more we dug into the business during due diligence, leading to our announcement today. 
This combination will create tremendous value for our shareholders as well as other stakeholders. On a cash flow basis, at 12.9x 2015 adjusted EBITDA and 8.9x adjusted EBITDA with synergies, we expect to achieve substantial annual operational synergies of approximately $350 million in year 4. We believe we are paying an attractive multiple that is in line with market precedents for such scarce, high-quality assets. 
The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to Mylan earnings, with accretion increasing significantly after the first full year 2017 as synergies are realized. Most importantly, the transaction creates the opportunity to achieve $0.35 to $0.40 accretion in 2017 and to accelerate achievement of our previously stated $6 adjusted diluted EPS target to 2017 versus 2018. 
We expect to see accelerated earnings and EBITDA growth going forward as well as substantial cash flows and enhanced margin. Even with the financial commitment to this transaction, we still have ample financial flexibility for business development activity for additional share buyback, all while keeping our commitment to investment grade. 
Giving our long history together, we know Meda's business, their people and their culture extremely well, and we believe that we will be able to quickly and smoothly integrate this business. I look forward to working with and welcoming Meda's leadership team and talented workforce to our organization. They have built a terrific company, and I believe we will be able to achieve great things together. 
With that, let me turn now to the highlights of our performance during 2015. Mylan again had an outstanding year, delivering exceptional financial results, while continuing to execute on our long-term growth drivers. 
On the top line, we generated adjusted total revenues of approximately $9.4 billion despite considerable FX headwinds, representing a year-over-year constant currency increase of 28%. On the bottom line, adjusted diluted EPS came in at $4.30, a 21% year-over-year increase even after absorbing $0.11 of that FX headwinds, which put us at the high end of our guidance range. We also had a record year with respect to cash. Adjusted free cash flow more than doubled, and adjusted free cash flow stood at 87% of adjusted net income. 
In addition, we closed on 2 strategic acquisitions during the year. First was Abbott's EPD Business, which has surpassed our growth expectation and is proving to be a solid revenue contributor. Second was the Famy Care transaction through which we are now well on our way to creating a leading women's health care franchise. 
Also noteworthy during 2015 was the further strengthening of our EpiPen franchise and our continued efforts to increase awareness and expand access to the anaphylaxis market. One point of note, while we saw higher sales of EpiPen due to higher volumes that resulted in part from the Auvi-Q recall. We saw the same net payer pricing dynamics that existed throughout 2015, and we don't expect material changes to the environment in 2016. 
We also continued to make good progress across our strategic growth drivers. In our respiratory program, we recently announced that we submitted our ANDA for generic Advair. We are extremely excited about this opportunity, and we continue to believe that Mylan will be the first company to bring generic Advair to the U.S. market in 2017. 
And building on our successful Biocon partnership, we announced earlier this year an exclusive global agreement with Momenta that expands our portfolio of biologics with up to 6 additional products and broadens the scope and scale of our capability. The combination of this program and our Biocon partnership positions Mylan as a worldwide leader in the biologics space. 
In summary, 2015 underscores the power of the exceptional global platform we have built and our ability to absorb volatility and maximize opportunities. It also reflects the superb execution and teamwork by Mylan's employees around the world. And on behalf of the Board of Directors and our entire leadership team, I'd like to thank them for an outstanding year and a job very well done. 
Now, turning to 2016. We look forward to delivering yet another year of outstanding financial performance. On the top line, we expect growth of approximately 16% compared to 2015, and a guidance range of $10.5 billion to $11.5 billion. On the bottom line, we expect growth of approximately 16% year-over-year, with guidance range for adjusted diluted EPS of $4.85 to $5.15. Our guidance ranges include a quarter's worth of contribution from Meda. However, we are also committed to these ranges without Meda. 
And as mentioned earlier, we see opportunity to accelerate the achievement of our $6 adjusted diluted EPS target to 2017. I'd now like to take a minute to thank John, who is retiring from Mylan on April 1, for his service to our company. During his 6 years with us, John helped shape the company's ongoing transformation into a global leader in health care. We are all wishing him the very best as he enters this new chapter of his life. 
Before I turn the call over to Tony, I'd also like to take a moment to congratulate him on being appointed Mylan's Chief Commercial Officer, which became effective earlier this year. Tony has been with the company for nearly 20 years and most recently successfully led our largest commercial business in the North American region for the last 4 years. In his new role, Tony oversees all of our commercial businesses around the world. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to him to discuss the performance of our core business during 2015."

As mentioned earlier, Mylan had a phenomenal year with constant currency adjusted total revenues rising 28% compared to 2014, coming from 9% growth in our legacy business and 19% from EPD. All of our regions and businesses contributed to the strong performance. 
In our North America generic segments, revenues totaled nearly $4 billion, a 16% increase compared to 2014. Growth came mainly from sales of new products, and to a lesser extent, from the EPD Business. Also contributing were higher volumes on existing products, partially offset by lower pricing. 
In Europe, sales totaled $2.2 billion in 2015, a year-over-year constant currency increase of 67%. Growth came primarily from sales generated by EPD, and to a lesser extent, from new products. Higher volumes on existing products mainly in France and Italy were offset by lower pricing throughout the region. 
In the Rest of World, sales totaled $2 billion, a year-over-year increase of 38% constant currency. The growth came from EPD, new product launches in Australia and Japan and higher volumes in India, predominantly of ARVs, and in Brazil. Increases were offset somewhat by lower volumes on existing products in Japan and lower pricing in the region. 
Our specialty business delivered revenues of $1.2 billion in 2015, an increase of 1% compared to 2014. In addition to the strong performance of EpiPen, as Heather referenced, sales of Perforomist and Ultiva increased by double-digit percentage points from the prior year. 
I would also like to note that our EPD Business grew 2% year-over-year, demonstrating again our ability to take a declining business and drive growth ahead of our expectations.

290203,322781001,930998,"Mylan N.V., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2016",2016-02-10,"Earnings Calls","Viatris Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tony. Good afternoon, everyone. As Heather and Tony both mentioned, we're extremely pleased with our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015, highlighted by the strong growth in our Generics segment and the exceptional adjusted",906,"Thanks, Tony. Good afternoon, everyone. As Heather and Tony both mentioned, we're extremely pleased with our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015, highlighted by the strong growth in our Generics segment and the exceptional adjusted free cash flow we generated. 
Our total revenues for the fourth quarter of 2015 were $2.5 billion, an increase of 24% on a constant currency basis from the prior year period. Revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign currency translation by approximately $91 million in the current quarter when compared to the prior year period. 
Adjusted total revenues for 2015 were $9.4 billion, an increase of 28% on a constant currency basis from the prior year, which includes revenues from the EPD Business of approximately $1.5 billion. Revenues for the full year 2015 were unfavorably impacted by foreign currency translation by approximately $433 million when compared to the prior year period and more than $300 million compared to the FX rates we used for providing our financial guidance at the beginning of the year. 
For the fourth quarter, third party net sales were positively impacted by the contribution from the acquired EPD Business of approximately $456 million, of which approximately $286 million was in Europe and $123 million was in our Rest of World region, with the remainder coming from EPD Canada. 
As a reminder, beginning in 2016, the EPD Business and Mylan commercial businesses are operating as one. As such, separate revenue information will no longer be reported. Adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter and full year of 2015 was a very strong 56%, up 200 basis points for the quarter and approximately 320 basis points for the full year. 
Our strong margins are primarily the result of the positive contribution from the acquired EPD Business combined with new product introductions. R&D expense on an adjusted basis was approximately 6% of total revenues for the fourth quarter and approximately 7% of total adjusted revenues for the full year. R&D expense for the quarter and full year increased due to the impact of the acquired EPD Business as well as the continued development of our respiratory, insulin and biologics programs. 
At the same time, SG&A, also on an adjusted basis, was approximately 20% of total adjusted revenues for the quarter and full year, which includes the impact of the EPD Business. Throughout 2015, we continued to realize additional tax benefits from the EPD transaction. And as a result of our ongoing efforts to optimize our tax structure, we had an adjusted effective tax rate for the full year of approximately 17%. We continue to look at additional tax planning strategies for opportunities to further reduce our annual effective tax rate in 2016 and beyond. 
Our fourth quarter adjusted net earnings were $620 million or $1.22 per share, a 16% increase from our Q4 2014 adjusted diluted EPS of $1.05 per share. For the full year 2015, our adjusted net earnings were $2.14 billion or $4.30 per share, a 21% increase from 2014 adjusted diluted EPS of $3.56 and at the high end of our previously communicated guidance. 
It's important to note that U.S. GAAP requires EPS to be calculated for each individual period based on the average outstanding share count for that period. As a result of the issuance of shares to Abbott in the first quarter of 2015, our adjusted diluted EPS for the calendar year and the sum of the quarters does not add by $0.04 per share. Our 2015 EPS growth was achieved in spite of unrelenting foreign currency headwinds, which reduced our calendar year adjusted diluted EPS by $0.11 per share versus our guidance rates at the beginning of the year, and by $0.18 per share versus 2014's actual FX rate. 
Our very strong 2015 adjusted diluted EPS resulted from the strength of our global operating platform, including the acquired EPD Business, and the organic revenue growth across our legacy generics business. 
Turning to our cash flow and liquidity metrics. Adjusted cash provided by operating activities was an impressive $2.2 billion for the calendar year, representing an increase of approximately $1 billion from the prior year, which is the result of the growth in the adjusted earnings combined with our ongoing working capital initiatives. Through diligent cash flow management, our adjusted free cash flow totaled $1.9 billion for 2015. 
As a result of our strong operating cash flow at the end of the year, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was less than 2x. We have no amounts outstanding on our $400 million AR facility or our $1.6 billion revolving credit facility, and we have full access to the more than $1 billion of cash on our balance sheet. As we look towards 2016, we remain fully committed to our investment-grade credit rating, including after the successful completion of the offer to acquire Meda, and we continue to have ample borrowing capacity and financial flexibility. 
As a reminder, we have fully committed financing to fund the acquisition of Meda. To summarize, we finished the year stronger than ever and begin 2016 with ample financial flexibility. Our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results were outstanding as we continue to experience the positive impacts of the EPD Business, combined with the continued organic growth of our legacy business and the strength of our global operating platform. 
I'll now turn the call over to Rajiv to review the Meda transaction in more detail."
290203,322781001,930998,"Mylan N.V., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2016",2016-02-10,"Earnings Calls","Viatris Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. At the outset, I would like to echo Heather's sentiments and say that I very much look forward to welcoming and working with Meda's leadership team and workforce. As Heather noted earlier, this transaction sold out to us because Meda is a",1160,"Thank you, John. At the outset, I would like to echo Heather's sentiments and say that I very much look forward to welcoming and working with Meda's leadership team and workforce. As Heather noted earlier, this transaction sold out to us because Meda is an extraordinarily attractive strategic fit for Mylan. We have always been active in evaluating many different strategic opportunities, looking for companies and assets that would complement our existing strengths and capabilities, make our company financially stronger and better position us to achieve our mission, strategy and sustainable growth. This acquisition delivers on all of those categories in a powerful way. 
Meda is a highly profitable and durable business, delivering total sales of about $2.3 billion in 2015, and with estimated growth through 2018 of about 3% in revenues and about 5% in adjusted EBITDA. Meda brings us a very attractive portfolio, including about 900 branded OTC and generic products with strong positions in respiratory, allergy, dermatology, pain and GI. Through this transaction, we are adding nearly 4,500 employees, including Meda's robust sales and marketing organization of more than 2,600 people with strong businesses in Europe, U.S. and exciting businesses in key emerging markets. 
Meda also brings a complementary network of 7 manufacturing facilities in Europe, U.S. and India, which further strengthens our operating platform and provides us with nice capabilities in nasals, topicals, liquids and DPIs. 
While you can see that this is a very attractive asset, this is not just about what Meda is delivering on a stand-alone basis, but what we can do together. Let's look at that now. On the next slide, you can begin to see what Mylan and Meda look like on a combined basis and see how Meda further diversifies and strengthens our business by both geography and by channel. 
On a 2015 combined basis, we'll go from having 2/3 of our revenues from generics to generics making up just more than half of our business. Combined, our specialty business would represent more than 1/3 of the business and OTC about 10%. As you can see, the combined company will have a diversified portfolio of more than 2,000 branded, OTC and generic products. And the addition of Meda's portfolio expands Mylan's branded and OTC portfolio in all regions. 
Geographically, we continue to enhance the balance of our business between North America, Europe and emerging markets, with an even larger European business and more diversified emerging markets business. Our continued focus on diversification across portfolio, channel and geography, helps to both derisk our platform and strengthen our ability to capitalize on our high-value future launches. 
Turning to the next slide. You can see the diversity of this combined portfolio broken out by the sales contribution of each therapeutic area. To give you a sense of the enhanced scale we'll have in key therapeutic categories, we expect to have 6 $1 billion franchises at close: respiratory allergy, GI, cardio, CNS, diabetes and metabolic and infectious disease. 
Further, we will have significantly enhanced our presence in other areas such as dermatology, women's health, anesthesia and pain. We see a great deal of opportunity to begin building total patient and pharmacy solution around these franchises, given the breadth of our presence and ability to meet customer and patient needs. 
On this next slide, you can get a sense of this portfolio and pipeline depth -- and depth in some of these large, strategic therapeutic categories across branded, generic and OTC products. 
First and foremost is our combined allergy respiratory franchise, where we see opportunities to really leverage our breadth and scale commercially with products, including EpiPen and Dymista, and position ourselves to maximize upcoming launches such as generic Advair and revefenacin. Derm is another exciting opportunity for us, and one Mylan has been eager to expand in.
As you can see, Meda's branded portfolio, with market leaders like Elidel, nicely complements Mylan's largely generics portfolio and provides opportunity to enhance our presence in this space across channels. Similarly, in pain, the Meda portfolio is complementary to Mylan's portfolio, which was enhanced significantly through the acquisition of our Abbott EPD Business. 
As you can see, these are leading, durable brands that lie in Mylan's core areas of strategic focus. Meda enhances our already strong expertise and market knowledge in these areas. And together, we have the platform, capabilities, speed and agility to maximize these portfolios. In addition, the Meda business will benefit from our steadfast dedication to our robust R&D efforts, product innovation, and the combined business will be fueled by Mylan's commitment to R&D and expansion of our product portfolio. 
Again, this transaction delivers on one of Mylan's key strategic imperatives. Expansion in the OTC market and Meda's strength in this area was an important differentiating factor for us when evaluating this transaction. Meda has a substantial OTC presence in Europe and emerging markets and an exciting platform for growth in U.S. This combination instantly creates billion-dollar global OTC business and a foundation for further expansion. 
I would like to note that Meda's portfolio is not a private-label business. It's all branded OTC products, which yield much higher margins, and it contains some very well-established and differentiated OTC brands. We see many opportunities to leverage this OTC portfolio through our combined global platform and we are confident in our ability to accelerate growth in this business through marketing and line extensions. Further, we see exciting possibilities for future business development and M&A. We'll continue to maintain our strategic and opportunistic approach in this regard. 
Turning to the next slide. You can see how Meda will expand Mylan's geographic footprint. Meda provides us with entry into 16 new countries and builds real critical mass commercially across Europe and emerging markets, while deepening our presence in Americas. 
The combined company will sell into more than 165 countries around the world with a direct commercial presence in about 60 markets. Our combined sales force will number approximately 5,900 people. Looking at this map, you can see that we are increasing our sales headcount by about 50% in both Americas and Europe and nearly doubling in emerging markets. 
Especially in Europe, we are adding very significantly to our manpower in critical growth markets, giving us the breadth and scale we need to continue building out our portfolio of products and services. As we look at our enhanced and diversified geographic profile, we also believe we have an opportunity to optimize this infrastructure and accelerate our growth, especially our EPD Business and across emerging markets. 
On the next slide, you can see another differentiating factor for Mylan and for the combined business, our unmatched manufacturing and supply chain platform. We are excited to deploy this platform to Meda and see opportunities for efficiencies and integration along the supply chain, providing opportunities for synergies. 
With that, I would like to turn it back over to Tony to walk through in greater detail the geographies we are strengthening through this transaction."

I, too, would like to express enthusiasm for welcoming Meda's team to our organization and working alongside them to deliver better health for a better world. As you have seen, this combination creates an even stronger commercial platform around the world. 
On the next slide, you can see how Meda adds considerable strength and scale to already robust business in Europe. The combined company generated about $3.8 billion in 2015 revenues from Europe, about 60% more than Mylan would have had on a stand-alone basis. As you know, scale is very important in this region giving the highly competitive market dynamics. 
On the chart on the right, you can see that we have increased scale across each of our key European countries with significant enhancements to our businesses in Germany, the Nordics, Italy and France, among others. Meda's business complements and builds on the strengths of our EPD asset to create a deeper, stronger and more diversified platform across Europe that can further maximize market opportunities and weather challenges. Meda also provides us with a strong and durable OTC business in Europe, which makes us a leader across all channels. 
I also note that the transaction consolidates EpiPen for us in Europe. Meda has been marketing this key product for us in the region for several years, and we believe that bringing this product into our combined commercial infrastructure, with a greater ability to leverage our global expertise in this area, will allow us to drive greater performance from this product. 
On the next slide, you will get a sense of how this transaction will dramatically accelerate Mylan's growth in emerging markets by creating a diversified scale business of $1.5 billion in 2015 pro forma revenues. The 16 new countries we're adding to this transaction are in the emerging market area, with Meda providing us entry into exciting new markets such as China, Russia, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Turkey and Mexico. 
China has long been an area of interest for us, but we have been very deliberate about how we get into this market. We are pleased that Meda has a strong history in China, having established its business there in 1994 and that it has operated the business as an owned affiliate since 2011. 
Importantly, Meda has a direct sales presence in many of these key markets, not relying on a contract sales organization in these important countries. For instance, Meda has reps on the ground in China, Russia and Turkey, among other countries. Meda also has done a great job establishing strong brands in these markets. Some of the key ones are listed here, and we look forward to leveraging our combined portfolio across the region. 
We see longer-term opportunities to bring Mylan's differentiated portfolio into these new markets, especially in infectious disease, biologics, insulins and women's health. While our presence in many of these markets is still small, it provides an exciting foothold and opportunity to build upon. 
On the next slide, we come back to our core mission of providing access to 7 billion people. This combination means we will be better able to serve the evolving needs of our customers across all channels by being able to offer them a greater diversity of products and by selling One Mylan around the world. We have already seen the value of our One Mylan approach with EPD and our existing specialty and generic businesses in terms of being able to leverage our powerful platform to bring more value to our customers through a broader range of products and services and total patient and pharmacy solutions. 
Further, by working together across all our channels, we have been able to leverage commercial best practices in customer relationships to deliver more. Now, John will walk you through the deal structure and resulting financial profile of Mylan."

Let me start by providing a quick overview of the transaction's terms. This transaction is structured as a recommended public offer to the shareholders of Meda to tender all of their shares to Mylan. At announcement, the value is equal to SE",1141,"Thanks, Tony. Let me start by providing a quick overview of the transaction's terms. This transaction is structured as a recommended public offer to the shareholders of Meda to tender all of their shares to Mylan. At announcement, the value is equal to SEK 165 per Meda share, consisting of SEK 132 in cash and the remainder in Mylan ordinary shares for a transaction value of approximately $9.9 billion. The Meda board has recommended the offer, and Meda shareholders representing approximately 30% of the outstanding shares have irrevocably committed to accept the offer. 
As I mentioned earlier, we expect the transaction will close at the end of the third quarter of 2016, subject to receipt of typical regulatory clearances, acceptance of the offer by more than 90% of Meda's shareholders and satisfaction of other customary conditions. The offer is not subject to any financing conditions or approval by Mylan shareholders. 
As Heather outlined earlier, this transaction provides compelling financial benefits for shareholders and other stakeholders of both companies. 
As mentioned earlier, we see opportunities to accelerate the achievement of our $6 adjusted diluted EPS target to 2017. We also will complete the integration by the end of year 3, realizing the full financial benefit of approximately $350 million in synergies in year 4. 
As you know, we have a proven track record of achieving our synergy targets, and we are confident that these synergies are highly achievable. As you can see on this next slide, the transaction will deliver significant accretion with a CAGR from 2015 to 2017 of more than 18%. 
Flipping to the next slide. The implied multiples for this transaction are in line with relevant market precedence for scarce, highly -- high-quality assets like Meda. As you can see, we expect a trailing synergized multiple of 8.9x. 
On the following slide, you see just how Mylan will continue to have a very strong financial profile post-transaction, and that we are positioned for continued growth. We expect our pro forma leverage to be approximately 3.8x debt to adjusted EBITDA at transaction close. We also expect we will maintain our investment-grade credit rating, which again is an important attribute for any deal we pursue. As you can see on the charts, we expect just debt to adjusted EBITDA of less than 3x by the end of 2017. 
With our significant free cash flows, highly leverageable infrastructure and a competitive global tax structure, we continue to have the financial flexibility to competitively pursue the right additional opportunities as they arise. 
We intend to continue to serve as the leading consolidator in our industry in a way that meets our mission and business strategy and continues to deliver value to our shareholders. 
I would now like to walk through our financial guidance for 2016 in further detail. At the bottom line, we are projecting adjusted diluted EPS between $4.85 and $5.15 per share. The midpoint of which is an increase of 16% from 2015 adjusted diluted EPS. This EPS guidance range is based on the following income statement line item guidance metrics, all of which are on an adjusted basis with the exception of total revenues. 
Total revenues are projected to be between $10.5 billion and $11.5 billion. The midpoint of which is an increase of 16% from 2015 total adjusted revenues. This guidance range includes a quarter's worth of contribution from Meda. However, we're also committed to these ranges without Meda. 
Excluding Meda, our generics business is expected to generate revenue growth of approximately 20% in 2016, while specialty is expected to generate revenue growth of approximately 8%. Revenues from new business, including Meda and the EPD -- and EPD for the full year, are expected to be between $800 million and $900 million, and the remaining increase in revenue will come equally from increased volumes on existing products and new product launches. 
Adjusted gross margins will increase again to be between 55% and 57%. Drivers of the increase include new product revenues and the strength of our North American generics business as we continue to benefit from an improved product mix. 
Adjusted SG&A will be between 19% and 20% of total revenues, which includes a full year impact of the EPD Business. Adjusted R&D will be between 6% and 7% of total revenues as we continue to invest in our future biologics, insulin and respiratory programs.
Using these guidance metrics, we project adjusted EBITDA of between $3.5 billion and $4 billion. Also, we expect our adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 15% to 17%. Based upon the 2016 guidance metrics for adjusted operating cash flow of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion and capital expenditures between $400 million and $500 million, we're projecting adjusted free cash flow in the range of $2 billion to $2.1 billion.
Finally, we are projecting an average diluted share count of between 520 million and 530 million shares, which includes the weighted average shares issued for the acquisition of Meda and the settlement this April of the warrants related to cash convertible notes, which were cash settled in 2015.
As this chart demonstrates, our 2016 financial guidance provides significant operating leverage, including increasing adjusted gross and EBITDA margins and declining adjusted R&D and SG&A as a percent of revenue, resulting in our adjusted diluted EPS growth of 16%.
Looking at the bridge to 2016 revenue guidance, revenues from new product launches, combined with volume growth in our base business, will serve to offset price erosion on existing products. In terms of base pricing assumptions, in the Generics segment, as we traditionally have, we assume low to mid-single-digit price erosion.
In Specialty, we've assumed high single-digit growth in terms of pricing. We expect revenue from the Meda acquisition to contribute approximately $500 million to $600 million of incremental revenue in 2016. In addition, revenue from new business includes the full year impact of the EPD Business.
As mentioned previously, our 2016 guidance FX rate do not result in a significant year-over-year foreign currency translation impact on our 2016 revenue guidance range.
This chart provides the projected bridge between our 2015 -- actual 2015 adjusted diluted EPS of $4.30 and the midpoint of our 2016 guidance range of $5, showing a year-over-year increase of 16%. New product launches from our legacy business and, to a lesser extent, margin expansion will drive our earnings growth in 2016. Partially offsetting this earnings growth will be increased investments in R&D spending and higher interest expense, largely due to the financing of the Meda acquisition.
From a phasing perspective, we expect the quarterly development of our EPS for 2016 to be similar to 2015, with Q1 being relatively flat to the prior year, Q3 being our highest quarter of the year and followed next by Q4.
That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Heather."

Further, by successfully executing on our vision and strategy for the past decade, we have delivered exceptional results for our shareholders with an earnings CAGR of 26% through 2016. Again, with this Meda transaction, we have the opportunity to accelerate our 2018 earnings target of $6 and adjusted diluted EPS to 2017.

I think it's important to first point out that we certainly don't make long-term decisions that will create shareholder value on short-term price fluctuations. And I think that, certainly, there is significant macro dynamics at play with the market today. I think we see that systemically across, especially the health care sector. And I think that we were fortunate to have a very high-quality process and have the ability to do due diligence. And the more we dug, the more comfortable we are not only with the strategic and the compelling rationale, but as I mentioned, it even then was much more enhanced with their addition of Rottapharm, which we had looked at several years ago and very much like that asset, as well as our Abbott EPD Business and how that's going to allow us to really leverage infrastructure in Europe as well as bringing on 16 additional countries where we'll be able to now have the infrastructure to lever the Mylan current portfolio as well as pipeline. So the strategic and fundamentals of the company have not changed. And when you look at just over the last couple of months, like I said, I think it's much more to the macro dynamics, and we believe the long-term decisions are much more in line when you look at the multiples. They're very much in line for assets such as this, scarce, high quality. And so we believe the value really speaks for itself of what we're creating for shareholders and what this combination can do going forward and, like you said, immediately accretive. Rajiv?"

That, by no means, that's just the beginning of what the Meda-Mylan combination will bear. I think importantly, not only does it accelerate near-term accretion and shareholder value. But over the longer term, I think, as we've said, the strategic rationale speaks for itself. The complementary nature of the product portfolio. We'll now have over 2,000 products across multiple geographies, expansion into emerging markets that let us more leverage our portfolio. When you look over the next 10 years to our biologics, insulin, I mean, the opportunities to truly maximize these launches in these territories with this infrastructure is just, in our opinion, going to be unparalleled. I think that Mylan will be positioned as a truly diversified global generics and specialty pharmaceutical company that's able to deliver through our unprecedented global supply chain to be able now to apply that and, in addition, to now have the kind of commercial infrastructure and operational infrastructure that will allow us to continue to add on whether it's other dosage forms. We've talked about everything from derms to ophthalmic to new therapeutic categories. So honestly, we just see the $6 in 2017 as the beginning to continuing the growth trajectory that our shareholders have enjoyed over the last 10 years. And certainly, as we close the transaction and we move forward, we'll be giving continued guidance and updating the longer-term trajectory. But I can assure you that it will continue -- this platform will continue to deliver as it has in the past. As far as EpiPen, Jami, I think that I tried throughout 2015, especially the beginning of the year, to point out that Mylan has been very proactive in maintaining our market share in a very competitive, multi-epinephrine marketplace. And that involved entering contracts with our payers, long-term, multiyear contracts. And I think then when the unprecedented event of Auvi-Q having to do a complete product recall, while we absolutely enjoyed volume increases and we see obviously that continuing through 2016, what I pointed out is the net price from the payer was mainly what it had been throughout 2015. And we don't see that materially changing. I mean, I think it's important to remember that we're dealing with a whole portfolio of products with these payers, that it's not about any one product. And while we will continue to be opportunistic, I think that -- as I've said, EpiPen, a very important brand for us and brand franchise going forward but it more and more represents -- is a much smaller part of Mylan. And certainly now, with the Mylan-Meda combination, again, the diversification is taking away from any concentration from any one product."

So I'm kind of struggling with this. Unless you are seeing some fantastic growth going forward for the Meda asset, it's hard for me to see it working. Then if you don't mind, 2 -- I'll sneak in 2 more. On EpiPen, I distinctly remember a conversation with the management team, including Robert, when I was told specifically by you guys that now that Auvi-Q is out of the market, you're in a great position to drive a higher net price from EpiPen. So is this -- if you can comment more broadly on what has changed from that perspective. And last, and this is more for Rajiv.

I'm assuming that you may have contracted more aggressively to potentially blunt the risk of a Teva-generic EpiPen launch. Just wondering if that is a realistic assumption that I'm making, that you are considering that when you priced more aggressively. And then just a quick tidbit of a question.

Yes, in the third quarter, we saw year-over-year for that quarter alone 5% growth. But as we said at that time, one quarter does not make a trend make.

But I want to focus on another issue and just go back to some of Rajiv's commentary with respect to growth and make sure that I understand this correctly. So the business basically currently is doing about USD 2.3 billion and then projected growth is around 3% top line and 5% adjusted EBITDA. I want to confirm those metrics, see whether that adjusted EBITDA growth, in fact, does include -- that's a fully synergized growth target.

When you look from an operational, a supply chain, a commercial, I mean, now that expertise and experience across the multiple geographies and including giving us a foothold in these 16 new markets, it truly just becomes a portal for us to leverage every launch, every asset, every acquisition from this point forward that much more. So truly, the long-term value of this is the continuation of what we've done over the last 10 years.

First, I would say we're taking -- sharing this product between 3 companies. Pfizer manufactures the product and then Mylan owns the EpiPen and then Meda was our partner in Europe. So just the opportunity to contract back down to 2 certainly makes the financial dynamics much more attractive. And obviously, throughout Europe, the certain dynamics around pricing and, again, being multi-epinephrine marketplaces in many of those countries certainly had made challenges in continuing to grow that product. I think now in our hands, when you look at the infrastructure with the combined Abbott EPD Business and now with Meda, we're going to have much further reach and be able to, I think, do [ph] and invest in a much different way than Meda as a third-party partner was able to do. So not only do I see it throughout Europe as an opportunity. But as we continue to look and add enhancements and how we bring EpiPen to the market in various other regions around the world, we do see, like I said, a lot of opportunity even outside of Europe with the rest of the world as we continue to invest around EpiPen and the awareness of anaphylaxis.

Thanks for joining us. We have a lot of great news to share with you today. We'll be discussing the Meda transaction, reviewing highlights from 2015 and providing guidance for 2016 with or without Meda, given that we expect to close by the end of Q3 this year. 
Turning first to the transaction we just announced. We have agreed to acquire Meda, a leading international specialty pharmaceutical company, via a recommended public offer and a transaction valued at $9.9 billion. We are receiving, including synergies, approximately $1.1 billion in EBITDA. In addition to the Meda Board's recommendation, I'm pleased that Meda's 2 largest shareholders, representing approximately 30% of outstanding shares, had irrevocably committed to tender into the offer and intend to remain long-term shareholders of the combined company. 
The strategic rationale for a combination of Mylan and Meda has long been very clear. In addition to being partners since 2011 on EpiPen in Europe, we have had numerous discussions over the years about other ways to collaborate, including our proposal to acquire the company in 2014. Since 2014, the rationale for this combination has only been further enhanced by Meda's acquisition of Rottapharm and our acquisition of EPD, with the ability to leverage this infrastructure, especially in Europe and emerging markets. 
This combination continues to accelerate the execution of the vision and strategy we've laid out over a decade ago. The global competitiveness of our industry and consolidation of our customer base continues to drive the importance of scale, and this combination creates a global pharmaceutical leader with 2015 combined revenues of $11.8 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $3.8 billion, a portfolio of more than 2,000 products and critical mass across all commercial channels, including a $1 billion OTC business. 
By offering one of the industry's broadest portfolios of products across all customer channels, including Rx, GX and OTC, we'll be able to mean even more to our customers, which is increasingly important in light of the evolving payer and distributor environment. Geographically, we're gaining more balance and expanded global footprint with an even stronger presence across Europe, a leading U.S. specialty business and an expanded presence in emerging markets, including several new and attractive ones such as China, Southeast Asia, Russia, the Middle East and Mexico. 
Together, we will also become a leader in the global respiratory allergy market and achieve scale in many other therapeutic areas, including dermatology and pain, offering us even greater opportunities for growth in these categories. As you know, we have always been very active in looking at various opportunities. We revisited the Meda opportunity this past summer and continued conversations throughout the fall. During this time, the fundamentals and the inherent value from this combination become even more apparent the more we dug into the business during due diligence, leading to our announcement today. 
This combination will create tremendous value for our shareholders as well as other stakeholders. On a cash flow basis, at 12.9x 2015 adjusted EBITDA and 8.9x adjusted EBITDA with synergies, we expect to achieve substantial annual operational synergies of approximately $350 million in year 4. We believe we are paying an attractive multiple that is in line with market precedents for such scarce, high-quality assets. 
The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to Mylan earnings, with accretion increasing significantly after the first full year 2017 as synergies are realized. Most importantly, the transaction creates the opportunity to achieve $0.35 to $0.40 accretion in 2017 and to accelerate achievement of our previously stated $6 adjusted diluted EPS target to 2017 versus 2018. 
We expect to see accelerated earnings and EBITDA growth going forward as well as substantial cash flows and enhanced margins. Even with the financial commitment to this transaction, we still have ample financial flexibility for business development activity, for additional share buyback, all while keeping our commitment to investment grade. 
Giving our long history together, we know Meda's business, their people and their culture extremely well, and we believe that we will be able to quickly and smoothly integrate this business. I look forward to working with and welcoming Meda's leadership team and talented workforce to our organization. They have built a terrific company, and I believe we will be able to achieve great things together. 
With that, let me turn now to the highlights of our performance during 2015. Mylan again had an outstanding year, delivering exceptional financial results, while continuing to execute on our long-term growth drivers. 
On the top line, we generated adjusted total revenues of approximately $9.4 billion despite considerable FX headwinds, representing a year-over-year constant currency increase of 28%. On the bottom line, adjusted diluted EPS came in at $4.30, a 21% year-over-year increase even after absorbing $0.11 of that FX headwinds, which put us at the high end of our guidance range. We also had a record year with respect to cash. Adjusted free cash flow more than doubled, and adjusted free cash flow stood at 87% of adjusted net income. 
In addition, we closed on 2 strategic acquisitions during the year. First was Abbott's EPD Business, which has surpassed our growth expectation and is proving to be a solid revenue contributor. Second was the Famy Care transaction through which we are now well on our way to creating a leading women's health care franchise. 
Also noteworthy during 2015 was the further strengthening of our EpiPen franchise and our continued efforts to increase awareness and expand access to the anaphylaxis market. One point of note, while we saw higher sales of EpiPen due to higher volumes that resulted in part from the Auvi-Q recall. We saw the same net payer pricing dynamics that existed throughout 2015, and we don't expect material changes to the environment in 2016. 
We also continued to make good progress across our strategic growth drivers. In our respiratory program, we recently announced that we submitted our ANDA for generic Advair. We are extremely excited about this opportunity, and we continue to believe that Mylan will be the first company to bring generic Advair to the U.S. market in 2017. 
And building on our successful Biocon partnership, we announced earlier this year an exclusive global agreement with Momenta that expands our portfolio of biologics with up to 6 additional products and broadens the scope and scale of our capability. The combination of this program and our Biocon partnership positions Mylan as a worldwide leader in the biologics space. 
In summary, 2015 underscores the power of the exceptional global platform we have built and our ability to absorb volatility and maximize opportunities. It also reflects the superb execution and teamwork by Mylan's employees around the world. And on behalf of the Board of Directors and our entire leadership team, I'd like to thank them for an outstanding year and a job very well done. 
Now, turning to 2016. We look forward to delivering yet another year of outstanding financial performance. On the top line, we expect growth of approximately 16% compared to 2015, and a guidance range of $10.5 billion to $11.5 billion. On the bottom line, we expect growth of approximately 16% year-over-year, with guidance range for adjusted diluted EPS of $4.85 to $5.15. Our guidance ranges include a quarter's worth of contribution from Meda. However, we are also committed to these ranges without Meda. 
And as mentioned earlier, we see opportunity to accelerate the achievement of our $6 adjusted diluted EPS target to 2017. I'd now like to take a minute to thank John, who is retiring from Mylan on April 1, for his service to our company. During his 6 years with us, John helped shape the company's ongoing transformation into a global leader in health care. We are all wishing him the very best as he enters this new chapter of his life. 
Before I turn the call over to Tony, I'd also like to take a moment to congratulate him on being appointed Mylan's Chief Commercial Officer, which became effective earlier this year. Tony has been with the company for nearly 20 years and most recently successfully led our largest commercial business, the North American region, for the last 4 years. In his new role, Tony oversees all of our commercial businesses around the world. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to him to discuss the performance of our core business during 2015."

As mentioned earlier, Mylan had a phenomenal year with constant currency adjusted total revenues rising 28% compared to 2014, coming from 9% growth in our legacy business and 19% from EPD. All of our regions and businesses contributed to the strong performance. 
In our North America generic segments, revenues totaled nearly $4 billion, a 16% increase compared to 2014. Growth came mainly from sales of new products, and to a lesser extent, from the EPD Business. Also contributing were higher volumes on existing products, partially offset by lower pricing. 
In Europe, sales totaled $2.2 billion in 2015, a year-over-year constant currency increase of 67%. Growth came primarily from sales generated by EPD, and to a lesser extent, from new products. Higher volumes on existing products mainly in France and Italy were offset by lower pricing throughout the region. 
In the Rest of World, sales totaled $2 billion, a year-over-year increase of 38% constant currency. The growth came from EPD, new product launches in Australia and Japan and higher volumes in India, predominantly of ARVs, and in Brazil. Increases were offset somewhat by lower volumes on existing products in Japan and lower pricing in the region. 
Our specialty business delivered revenues of $1.2 billion in 2015, an increase of 1% compared to 2014. In addition to the strong performance of EpiPen, as Heather referenced, sales of Perforomist and Ultiva increased by double-digit percentage points from the prior year. 
I would also like to note that our EPD Business grew 2% year-over-year, demonstrating again our ability to take a declining business and drive growth ahead of our expectations. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to John."
290203,322781001,931130,"Mylan N.V., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2016",2016-02-10,"Earnings Calls","Viatris Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tony. Good afternoon, everyone. As Heather and Tony both mentioned, we're extremely pleased with our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015, highlighted by the strong growth in our Generics segment and the exceptional adjusted",906,"Thanks, Tony. Good afternoon, everyone. As Heather and Tony both mentioned, we're extremely pleased with our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015, highlighted by the strong growth in our Generics segment and the exceptional adjusted free cash flow we generated. 
Our total revenues for the fourth quarter of 2015 were $2.5 billion, an increase of 24% on a constant currency basis from the prior year period. Revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign currency translation by approximately $91 million in the current quarter when compared to the prior year period. 
Adjusted total revenues for 2015 were $9.4 billion, an increase of 28% on a constant currency basis from the prior year, which includes revenues from the EPD Business of approximately $1.5 billion. Revenues for the full year 2015 were unfavorably impacted by foreign currency translation by approximately $433 million when compared to the prior year period and more than $300 million compared to the FX rates we used for providing our financial guidance at the beginning of the year. 
For the fourth quarter, third party net sales were positively impacted by the contribution from the acquired EPD Business of approximately $456 million, of which approximately $286 million was in Europe and $123 million was in our Rest of World region, with the remainder coming from EPD Canada. 
As a reminder, beginning in 2016, the EPD Business and Mylan commercial businesses are operating as one. As such, separate revenue information will no longer be reported. Adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter and full year of 2015 was a very strong 56%, up 200 basis points for the quarter and approximately 320 basis points for the full year. 
Our strong margins are primarily the result of the positive contribution from the acquired EPD Business combined with new product introductions. R&D expense on an adjusted basis was approximately 6% of total revenues for the fourth quarter and approximately 7% of total adjusted revenues for the full year. R&D expense for the quarter and full year increased due to the impact of the acquired EPD Business as well as the continued development of our respiratory, insulin and biologics programs. 
At the same time, SG&A, also on an adjusted basis, was approximately 20% of total adjusted revenues for the quarter and full year, which includes the impact of the EPD Business. Throughout 2015, we continued to realize additional tax benefits from the EPD transaction. And as a result of our ongoing efforts to optimize our tax structure, we had an adjusted effective tax rate for the full year of approximately 17%. We continue to look at additional tax planning strategies for opportunities to further reduce our annual effective tax rate in 2016 and beyond. 
Our fourth quarter adjusted net earnings were $620 million or $1.22 per share, a 16% increase from our Q4 2014 adjusted diluted EPS of $1.05 per share. For the full year 2015, our adjusted net earnings were $2.14 billion or $4.30 per share, a 21% increase from 2014 adjusted diluted EPS of $3.56 and at the high end of our previously communicated guidance. 
It's important to note that U.S. GAAP requires EPS to be calculated for each individual period based on the average outstanding share count for that period. As a result of the issuance of shares to Abbott in the first quarter of 2015, our adjusted diluted EPS for the calendar year and the sum of the quarters does not add by $0.04 per share. Our 2015 EPS growth was achieved in spite of unrelenting foreign currency headwinds, which reduced our calendar year adjusted diluted EPS by $0.11 per share versus our guidance rates at the beginning of the year, and by $0.18 per share versus 2014's actual FX rate. 
Our very strong 2015 adjusted diluted EPS resulted from the strength of our global operating platform, including the acquired EPD Business, and the organic revenue growth across our legacy generics business. 
Turning to our cash flow and liquidity metrics. Adjusted cash provided by operating activities was an impressive $2.2 billion for the calendar year, representing an increase of approximately $1 billion from the prior year, which is the result of the growth in the adjusted earnings combined with our ongoing working capital initiatives. Through diligent cash flow management, our adjusted free cash flow totaled $1.9 billion for 2015. 
As a result of our strong operating cash flow at the end of the year, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was less than 2x. We have no amounts outstanding on our $400 million AR facility or our $1.6 billion revolving credit facility, and we have full access to the more than $1 billion of cash on our balance sheet. As we look towards 2016, we remain fully committed to our investment-grade credit rating, including after the successful completion of the offer to acquire Meda, and we continue to have ample borrowing capacity and financial flexibility. 
As a reminder, we have fully committed financing to fund the acquisition of Meda. To summarize, we finished the year stronger than ever and begin 2016 with ample financial flexibility. Our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results were outstanding as we continue to experience the positive impacts of the EPD Business, combined with the continued organic growth of our legacy business and the strength of our global operating platform. 
I'll now turn the call over to Rajiv to review the Meda transaction in more detail."
290203,322781001,931130,"Mylan N.V., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2016",2016-02-10,"Earnings Calls","Viatris Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. At the outset, I would like to echo Heather's sentiments and say that I very much look forward to welcoming and working with Meda's leadership team and workforce. As Heather noted earlier, this transaction sold out to us because Meda is a",1160,"Thank you, John. At the outset, I would like to echo Heather's sentiments and say that I very much look forward to welcoming and working with Meda's leadership team and workforce. As Heather noted earlier, this transaction sold out to us because Meda is an extraordinarily attractive strategic fit for Mylan. We have always been active in evaluating many different strategic opportunities, looking for companies and assets that would complement our existing strengths and capabilities, make our company financially stronger and better position us to achieve our mission, strategy and sustainable growth. This acquisition delivers on all of those categories in a powerful way. 
Meda is a highly profitable and durable business, delivering total sales of about $2.3 billion in 2015, and with estimated growth through 2018 of about 3% in revenues and about 5% in adjusted EBITDA. Meda brings us a very attractive portfolio, including about 900 branded OTC and generic products with strong positions in respiratory, allergy, dermatology, pain and GI. Through this transaction, we are adding nearly 4,500 employees, including Meda's robust sales and marketing organization of more than 2,600 people with strong businesses in Europe, U.S. and exciting businesses in key emerging markets. 
Meda also brings a complementary network of 7 manufacturing facilities in Europe, U.S. and India, which further strengthens our operating platform and provides us with nice capabilities in nasals, topicals, liquids and DPIs. 
While you can see that this is a very attractive asset, this is not just about what Meda is delivering on a stand-alone basis, but what we can do together. Let's look at that now. On the next slide, you can begin to see what Mylan and Meda look like on a combined basis and see how Meda further diversifies and strengthens our business by both geography and by channel. 
On a 2015 combined basis, we'll go from having 2/3 of our revenues from generics to generics making up just more than half of our business. Combined, our specialty business would represent more than 1/3 of the business and OTC about 10%. As you can see, the combined company will have a diversified portfolio of more than 2,000 branded, OTC and generic products. And the addition of Meda's portfolio expands Mylan's branded and OTC portfolio in all regions. 
Geographically, we continue to enhance the balance of our business between North America, Europe and emerging markets, with an even larger European business and more diversified emerging markets business. Our continued focus on diversification across portfolio, channel and geography, helps to both derisk our platform and strengthen our ability to capitalize on our high-value future launches. 
Turning to the next slide. You can see the diversity of this combined portfolio broken out by the sales contribution of each therapeutic area. To give you a sense of the enhanced scale we'll have in key therapeutic categories, we expect to have 6 $1 billion franchises at close: respiratory allergy, GI, cardio, CNS, diabetes and metabolic and infectious disease. 
Further, we will have significantly enhanced our presence in other areas such as dermatology, women's health, anesthesia and pain. We see a great deal of opportunity to begin building total patient and pharmacy solution around these franchises, given the breadth of our presence and ability to meet customer and patient needs. 
On this next slide, you can get a sense of this portfolio and pipeline depth -- and depth in some of these large, strategic therapeutic categories across branded, generic and OTC products. 
First and foremost is our combined allergy respiratory franchise, where we see opportunities to really leverage our breadth and scale commercially with products, including EpiPen and Dymista, and position ourselves to maximize upcoming launches such as generic Advair and revefenacin. Derm is another exciting opportunity for us, and one Mylan has been eager to expand in.
As you can see, Meda's branded portfolio, with market leaders like Elidel, nicely complements Mylan's largely generics portfolio and provides opportunity to enhance our presence in this space across channels. Similarly, in pain, the Meda portfolio is complementary to Mylan's portfolio, which was enhanced significantly through the acquisition of our Abbott EPD Business. 
As you can see, these are leading, durable brands that lie in Mylan's core areas of strategic focus. Meda enhances our already strong expertise and market knowledge in these areas. And together, we have the platform, capabilities, speed and agility to maximize these portfolios. In addition, the Meda business will benefit from our steadfast dedication to our robust R&D efforts, product innovation, and the combined business will be fueled by Mylan's commitment to R&D and expansion of our product portfolio. 
Again, this transaction delivers on one of Mylan's key strategic imperatives. Expansion in the OTC market and Meda's strength in this area was an important differentiating factor for us when evaluating this transaction. Meda has a substantial OTC presence in Europe and emerging markets and an exciting platform for growth in U.S. This combination instantly creates billion-dollar global OTC business and a foundation for further expansion. 
I would like to note that Meda's portfolio is not a private-label business. It's all branded OTC products, which yield much higher margins, and it contains some very well-established and differentiated OTC brands. We see many opportunities to leverage this OTC portfolio through our combined global platform and we are confident in our ability to accelerate growth in this business through marketing and line extensions. Further, we see exciting possibilities for future business development and M&A. We'll continue to maintain our strategic and opportunistic approach in this regard. 
Turning to the next slide. You can see how Meda will expand Mylan's geographic footprint. Meda provides us with entry into 16 new countries and builds real critical mass commercially across Europe and emerging markets, while deepening our presence in Americas. 
The combined company will sell into more than 165 countries around the world with a direct commercial presence in about 60 markets. Our combined sales force will number approximately 5,900 people. Looking at this map, you can see that we are increasing our sales headcount by about 50% in both Americas and Europe and nearly doubling in emerging markets. 
Especially in Europe, we are adding very significantly to our manpower in critical growth markets, giving us the breadth and scale we need to continue building out our portfolio of products and services. As we look at our enhanced and diversified geographic profile, we also believe we have an opportunity to optimize this infrastructure and accelerate our growth, especially our EPD Business and across emerging markets. 
On the next slide, you can see another differentiating factor for Mylan and for the combined business, our unmatched manufacturing and supply chain platform. We are excited to deploy this platform to Meda and see opportunities for efficiencies and integration along the supply chain, providing opportunities for synergies. 
With that, I would like to turn it back over to Tony to walk through in greater detail the geographies we are strengthening through this transaction."

I, too, would like to express enthusiasm for welcoming Meda's team to our organization and working alongside them to deliver better health for a better world. As you have seen, this combination creates an even stronger commercial platform around the world. 
On the next slide, you can see how Meda adds considerable strength and scale to already robust business in Europe. The combined company generated about $3.8 billion in 2015 revenues from Europe, about 60% more than Mylan would have had on a stand-alone basis. As you know, scale is very important in this region giving the highly competitive market dynamics. 
On the chart on the right, you can see that we have increased scale across each of our key European countries with significant enhancements to our businesses in Germany, the Nordics, Italy and France, among others. Meda's business complements and builds on the strengths of our EPD asset to create a deeper, stronger and more diversified platform across Europe that can further maximize market opportunities and weather challenges. Meda also provides us with a strong and durable OTC business in Europe, which makes us a leader across all channels. 
I also note that the transaction consolidates EpiPen for us in Europe. Meda has been marketing this key product for us in the region for several years, and we believe that bringing this product into our combined commercial infrastructure, with a greater ability to leverage our global expertise in this area, will allow us to drive greater performance from this product. 
On the next slide, you will get a sense of how this transaction will dramatically accelerate Mylan's growth in emerging markets by creating a diversified scale business of $1.5 billion in 2015 pro forma revenues. The 16 new countries we're adding to this transaction are in the emerging market area, with Meda providing us entry into exciting new markets such as China, Russia, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Turkey and Mexico. 
China has long been an area of interest for us, but we have been very deliberate about how we get into this market. We are pleased that Meda has a strong history in China, having established its business there in 1994 and that it has operated the business as an owned affiliate since 2011. 
Importantly, Meda has a direct sales presence in many of these key markets, not relying on a contract sales organization in these important countries. For instance, Meda has reps on the ground in China, Russia and Turkey, among other countries. Meda also has done a great job establishing strong brands in these markets. Some of the key ones are listed here, and we look forward to leveraging our combined portfolio across the region. 
We see longer-term opportunities to bring Mylan's differentiated portfolio into these new markets, especially in infectious disease, biologics, insulins and women's health. While our presence in many of these markets is still small, it provides an exciting foothold and opportunity to build upon. 
On the next slide, we come back to our core mission of providing access to 7 billion people. This combination means we will be better able to serve the evolving needs of our customers across all channels by being able to offer them a greater diversity of products and by selling One Mylan around the world. We have already seen the value of our One Mylan approach with EPD and our existing specialty and generic businesses in terms of being able to leverage our powerful platform to bring more value to our customers through a broader range of products and services and total patient and pharmacy solutions. 
Further, by working together across all our channels, we have been able to leverage commercial best practices in customer relationships to deliver more. Now, John will walk you through the deal structure and resulting financial profile of Mylan."

Let me start by providing a quick overview of the transaction's terms. This transaction is structured as a recommended public offer to the shareholders of Meda to tender all of their shares to Mylan.

This transaction is structured as a recommended public offer to the shareholders of Meda to tender all of their shares to Mylan. At announcement, the value is equal to SEK 165 per Meda share, consisting of SEK 132 in cash and the remainder in Mylan ordinary shares for a transaction value of approximately $9.9 billion. The Meda board has recommended the offer, and Meda shareholders representing approximately 30% of the outstanding shares have irrevocably committed to accept the offer. 
As I mentioned earlier, we expect the transaction will close at the end of the third quarter of 2016, subject to receipt of typical regulatory clearances, acceptance of the offer by more than 90% of Meda's shareholders and satisfaction of other customary conditions. The offer is not subject to any financing conditions or approval by Mylan shareholders. 
As Heather outlined earlier, this transaction provides compelling financial benefits for shareholders and other stakeholders of both companies. 
As mentioned earlier, we see opportunities to accelerate the achievement of our $6 adjusted diluted EPS target to 2017. We also will complete the integration by the end of year 3, realizing the full financial benefit of approximately $350 million in synergies in year 4. 
As you know, we have a proven track record of achieving our synergy targets, and we are confident that these synergies are highly achievable. As you can see on this next slide, the transaction will deliver significant accretion with a CAGR from 2015 to 2017 of more than 18%. 
Flipping to the next slide. The implied multiples for this transaction are in line with relevant market precedence for scarce, highly -- high-quality assets like Meda. As you can see, we expect a trailing synergized multiple of 8.9x. 
On the following slide, you see just how Mylan will continue to have a very strong financial profile post-transaction, and that we are positioned for continued growth. We expect our pro forma leverage to be approximately 3.8x debt to adjusted EBITDA at transaction close. We also expect we will maintain our investment-grade credit rating, which again is an important attribute for any deal we pursue. As you can see on the charts, we expect just debt to adjusted EBITDA of less than 3x by the end of 2017. 
With our significant free cash flows, highly leverageable infrastructure and a competitive global tax structure, we continue to have the financial flexibility to competitively pursue the right additional opportunities as they arise. 
We intend to continue to serve as the leading consolidator in our industry in a way that meets our mission and business strategy and continues to deliver value to our shareholders. 
I would now like to walk through our financial guidance for 2016 in further detail. At the bottom line, we are projecting adjusted diluted EPS between $4.85 and $5.15 per share. The midpoint of which is an increase of 16% from 2015 adjusted diluted EPS. This EPS guidance range is based on the following income statement line item guidance metrics, all of which are on an adjusted basis with the exception of total revenues. 
Total revenues are projected to be between $10.5 billion and $11.5 billion. The midpoint of which is an increase of 16% from 2015 total adjusted revenues. This guidance range includes a quarter's worth of contribution from Meda. However, we're also committed to these ranges without Meda. 
Excluding Meda, our generics business is expected to generate revenue growth of approximately 20% in 2016, while specialty is expected to generate revenue growth of approximately 8%. Revenues from new business, including Meda and the EPD -- and EPD for the full year, are expected to be between $800 million and $900 million, and the remaining increase in revenue will come equally from increased volumes on existing products and new product launches. 
Adjusted gross margins will increase again to be between 55% and 57%. Drivers of the increase include new product revenues and the strength of our North American generics business as we continue to benefit from an improved product mix. 
Adjusted SG&A will be between 19% and 20% of total revenues, which includes a full year impact of the EPD Business. Adjusted R&D will be between 6% and 7% of total revenues as we continue to invest in our future biologics, insulin and respiratory programs.
Using these guidance metrics, we project adjusted EBITDA of between $3.5 billion and $4 billion. Also, we expect our adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 15% to 17%. Based upon the 2016 guidance metrics for adjusted operating cash flow of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion and capital expenditures between $400 million and $500 million, we're projecting adjusted free cash flow in the range of $2 billion to $2.1 billion.
Finally, we are projecting an average diluted share count of between 520 million and 530 million shares, which includes the weighted average shares issued for the acquisition of Meda and the settlement this April of the warrants related to cash convertible notes, which were cash settled in 2015.
As this chart demonstrates, our 2016 financial guidance provides significant operating leverage, including increasing adjusted gross and EBITDA margins and declining adjusted R&D and SG&A as a percent of revenue, resulting in our adjusted diluted EPS growth of 16%.
Looking at the bridge to 2016 revenue guidance, revenues from new product launches, combined with volume growth in our base business, will serve to offset price erosion on existing products. In terms of base pricing assumptions, in the Generics segment, as we traditionally have, we assume low to mid-single-digit price erosion.
In Specialty, we've assumed high single-digit growth in terms of pricing. We expect revenue from the Meda acquisition to contribute approximately $500 million to $600 million of incremental revenue in 2016. In addition, revenue from new business includes the full year impact of the EPD Business.
As mentioned previously, our 2016 guidance FX rate do not result in a significant year-over-year foreign currency translation impact on our 2016 revenue guidance range.
This chart provides the projected bridge between our 2015 -- actual 2015 adjusted diluted EPS of $4.30 and the midpoint of our 2016 guidance range of $5, showing a year-over-year increase of 16%. New product launches from our legacy business and, to a lesser extent, margin expansion will drive our earnings growth in 2016. Partially offsetting this earnings growth will be increased investments in R&D spending and higher interest expense, largely due to the financing of the Meda acquisition.
From a phasing perspective, we expect the quarterly development of our EPS for 2016 to be similar to 2015, with Q1 being relatively flat to the prior year, Q3 being our highest quarter of the year and followed next by Q4.
That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Heather."

Further, by successfully executing on our vision and strategy for the past decade, we have delivered exceptional results for our shareholders with an earnings CAGR of 26% through 2016. Again, with this Meda transaction, we have the opportunity to accelerate our 2018 earnings target of $6 and adjusted diluted EPS to 2017.

And I think that we were fortunate to have a very high-quality process and have the ability to do due diligence. And the more we dug, the more comfortable we are not only with the strategic and the compelling rationale, but as I mentioned, it even then was much more enhanced with their addition of Rottapharm, which we had looked at several years ago and very much liked that asset, as well as our Abbott EPD Business and how that's going to allow us to really leverage infrastructure in Europe as well as bringing on 16 additional countries where we'll be able to now have the infrastructure to lever the Mylan current portfolio as well as pipeline. So the strategic and fundamentals of the company have not changed. And when you look at just over the last couple of months, like I said, I think it's much more to the macro dynamics, and we believe the long-term decisions are much more in line when you look at the multiples. They're very much in line for assets such as this, scarce, high quality. And so we believe the value really speaks for itself of what we're creating for shareholders and what this combination can do going forward and, like you said, immediately accretive. Rajiv?"

That, by no means, that's just the beginning of what the Meda-Mylan combination will bear. I think importantly, not only does it accelerate near-term accretion and shareholder value. But over the longer term, I think, as we've said, the strategic rationale speaks for itself. The complementary nature of the product portfolio. We'll now have over 2,000 products across multiple geographies, expansion into emerging markets that let us more leverage our portfolio. When you look over the next 10 years to our biologics, insulin, I mean, the opportunities to truly maximize these launches in these territories with this infrastructure is just, in our opinion, going to be unparalleled. I think that Mylan will be positioned as a truly diversified global generics and specialty pharmaceutical company that's able to deliver through our unprecedented global supply chain to be able now to apply that and, in addition, to now have the kind of commercial infrastructure and operational infrastructure that will allow us to continue to add on whether it's other dosage forms. We've talked about everything from derms to ophthalmic to new therapeutic categories. So honestly, we just see the $6 in 2017 as the beginning to continuing the growth trajectory that our shareholders have enjoyed over the last 10 years. And certainly, as we close the transaction and we move forward, we'll be giving continued guidance and updating the longer-term trajectory. But I can assure you that it will continue -- this platform will continue to deliver as it has in the past. As far as EpiPen, Jami, I think that I tried throughout 2015, especially the beginning of the year, to point out that Mylan has been very proactive in maintaining our market share in a very competitive, multi-epinephrine marketplace. And that involved entering contracts with our payers, long-term, multiyear contracts. And I think then when the unprecedented event of Auvi-Q having to do a complete product recall, while we absolutely enjoyed volume increases and we see obviously that continuing through 2016, what I pointed out is the net price from the payer was mainly what it had been throughout 2015. And we don't see that materially changing. I mean, I think it's important to remember that we're dealing with a whole portfolio of products with these payers, that it's not about any one product. And while we will continue to be opportunistic, I think that -- as I've said, EpiPen, a very important brand for us and brand franchise going forward but it more and more represents -- is a much smaller part of Mylan. And certainly now, with the Mylan-Meda combination, again, the diversification is taking away from any concentration from any one product."

So yes, maybe it's not that efficient, but it looks like there's a huge mis-adjustment here between what you can do with the shares -- buying back shares and what you do with your transaction. So I'm kind of struggling with this. Unless you are seeing some fantastic growth going forward for the Meda asset, it's hard for me to see it working. Then if you don't mind, 2 -- I'll sneak in 2 more. On EpiPen, I distinctly remember a conversation with the management team, including Robert, when I was told specifically by you guys that now that Auvi-Q is out of the market, you're in a great position to drive a higher net price from EpiPen. So is this -- if you can comment more broadly on what has changed from that perspective. And last, and this is more for Rajiv. Rajiv, you guys kind of mentioned -- or Tony, you guys kind of mentioned a beachhead in additional market. I kind of took a look through the Meda statements -- presentation for the third quarter. I mean, they got $60 million of sale in Mexico if we just take the third quarter and multiply it by 4. They got $30 million in Russia. It sounds like all those businesses are kind of like borderline profitable. Is that enough of a beachhead for you?

So are we looking to just shop for a while but not buy? What are your priorities over the next 6, 12 months on M&A beyond convincing folks that Meda is the right deal?"

And I think where a bit of a disconnect came is that people believed that once Auvi-Q was recalled, that the world would go back to pre-there never have been an Auvi-Q in the market. And it was a very unprecedented event that I don't know that really has ever happened before.

And quite honestly, we did that in less than a year. And so at 2% growth year-over-year on a constant currency basis for that business, I think we're very pleased with that. Yes, in the third quarter, we saw year-over-year for that quarter alone 5% growth. But as we said at that time, one quarter does not make a trend make.

But I want to focus on another issue and just go back to some of Rajiv's commentary with respect to growth and make sure that I understand this correctly. So the business basically currently is doing about USD 2.3 billion and then projected growth is around 3% top line and 5% adjusted EBITDA. I want to confirm those metrics, see whether that adjusted EBITDA growth, in fact, does include -- that's a fully synergized growth target.

When you look from an operational, a supply chain, a commercial, I mean, now that expertise and experience across the multiple geographies and including giving us a foothold in these 16 new markets, it truly just becomes a portal for us to leverage every launch, every asset, every acquisition from this point forward that much more.

Do we see upsides? Absolutely. We have not been able to put our arms around what's that number, but we believe in -- that there will be a huge pulling effect. We'll be able to cross-leverage the portfolio, do more with these markets, and we'll come back to you as we learn more about the asset."

First, I would say we're taking -- sharing this product between 3 companies. Pfizer manufactures the product and then Mylan owns the EpiPen and then Meda was our partner in Europe. So just the opportunity to contract back down to 2 certainly makes the financial dynamics much more attractive. And obviously, throughout Europe, there's certain dynamics around pricing and, again, being multi-epinephrine marketplaces in many of those countries certainly had made challenges in continuing to grow that product. I think now in our hands, when you look at the infrastructure with the combined Abbott EPD Business and now with Meda, we're going to have much further reach and be able to, I think, do [ph] and invest in a much different way than Meda as a third-party partner was able to do. So not only do I see it throughout Europe as an opportunity. But as we continue to look and add enhancements and how we bring EpiPen to the market in various other regions around the world, we do see, like I said, a lot of opportunity even outside of Europe with the rest of the world as we continue to invest around EpiPen and the awareness of anaphylaxis.

290203,331408563,970534,"Mylan N.V., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 03, 2016",2016-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Viatris Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Kris, and good morning, everyone. Mylan's results during the first quarter marked a great start to what we believe will be another year of double-digit growth. However, before we walk through our results I'd like to make a few comments regarding t",981,"Thanks, Kris, and good morning, everyone. Mylan's results during the first quarter marked a great start to what we believe will be another year of double-digit growth. However, before we walk through our results I'd like to make a few comments regarding the macro environment surrounding our industry. 
First, I strongly believe that the rebasing of our sector was not only necessary but help draw distinction and differentiation amongst our peers. For far too long, one brush has been used across our industry and business models when in fact, the business models have been very diverse. The investment community has taking -- has taken a flawed approach of one-size-fits-all when it comes to the Generics industry. The echo chamber around too good to be true results, stock prices and multiples have finally been silenced enough to allow investors to refocus on fundamentals and investment thesis. 
While not always popular, Mylan has always been consistent. We have been steadfast that a great company cannot be built quarter-by-quarter and that well-run companies return great results for shareholders and other stakeholders. We laid out a vision almost a decade ago that our growth will come from creating scale and manufacturing and expanding the breadth of our portfolio to better serve patients around the world, and every acquisition we've done has complemented this strategy. 
Our results have demonstrated that our continued organic investments coupled with inorganic opportunities have delivered short, middle and long-term growth. We appreciate that when applying a broad brush, there is investor concern of little to no growth in the Generics industry. 
With that said, our strategy has resulted in Mylan delivering consistent double-digit earnings growth. Most importantly, it is on the back of our last decade of hard work to vertically integrate our products, build out our manufacturing capability, invest in one of the broadest portfolios of complex molecules, all while maximizing our geographic footprint and commercial excellence in all distribution channels that we have managed to differentiate ourselves from that pack and position ourselves for continued growth well into the future as the true leader in our space today. 
In other words, we have not built a company on any one product or one practice. Instead, we have focused on diversifying and building one of the industry's most efficient and effective engines, one that's just getting started. The reality of health care is that access to medicine is needed now more than ever around the globe from our aging population to living longer, healthier lives, making access the fundamental pillar for future growth. 
This is precisely why Meda is the right next strategic addition to our platforms. Geographically, we will gain a more balanced and expanded presence, and we will become a leader in the global respiratory allergy market and achieve scale in many other therapeutic areas, including $1 billion OTC business. 
With that, I'd now like to turn to our performance during the quarter. On the top line, we delivered total revenues of $2.2 billion, a year-over-year increase of 19% on constant currency basis that was fueled by double-digit revenue growth in our Generics and Specialty segment, including positive growth in all of our regions. 
Total revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign currency translation by approximately $33 million compared to last year's first quarter. On the bottom line, we delivered adjusted net earnings of $386 million or $0.76 per adjusted diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 9%. This strong quarter was achieved despite delays in certain product approvals as we continue to leverage our unique global operating platform and diverse mix of assets to take advantage of opportunities in markets around the world. 
Given our strong first quarter performance and strong momentum, we remain committed to our 2016 guidance metrics, including our adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $4.85 to $5.15. 
Turning to Meda for a moment. Many of you know that the company reported first quarter results this morning. They were very much in line with our modeled expectations for the business as its dynamics were well known and understood by us. Notably, Meda reported strong performance from top products such as Dymista and Betadine as well as nice turnaround performance in Elidel and solid execution in emerging markets. 
We continue to believe that Meda is a scarce, high-quality asset, and we remain fully committed to look to and look forward to completing the deal. Further, there is no change whatsoever to any of our expectations for the combined business. As stated previously, we expect the deal to be immediately accretive to Mylan's adjusted earnings with accretion increasing significantly after the first full year as synergies are realized. 
All of our public and private filings with respect to Meda deal remain on track, and we expect to publish the offer document later this month. In addition, we expect to obtain all relevant clearances prior to the end of the acceptance period, which would keep us on track to close the transaction by the end of the third quarter. We also look forward to hosting our next Investor Day event after the close. 
I'd like to now take the opportunity on behalf of Mylan's board and entire leadership team to thank all of our employees around the world for their outstanding teamwork and execution during the quarter and for their continued commitment to our cause. 
I also note that we continue to attract exceptional leaders from outside as well, and today, we announced that Ken Parks will join our team as Chief Financial Officer effective June 6. Ken's deep functional expertise, strong leadership ability, experience, leading organizations through changed, including overseeing significant acquisitions and expansion into emerging markets and his impressive track record operating complex global cultures and manufacturing environments will make him an outstanding addition, not only to our very strong global finance team but to Mylan overall. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Rajiv."

As Heather indicated, our business continues to perform strongly across all areas, reflecting that powerful global manufacturing, R&D and commercial infrastructure we have in place and the opportunities we are seeing to leverage our expansive product portfolio across our geographies and channels as One Mylan. 
In our North America Generics business, sales totaled $920 million, a year-over-year increase of 8%. Growth came primarily from sales of new products and, to a lesser extent, from incremental sales of established products while the pricing environment was consistent with our expectations and guidance to you. 
In Europe, sales totaled $588 million, this strong year-over-year constant currency increase of 47%. This result was mainly due to incremental sales from established products and, to a lesser extent, sales from new products. 
In rest of the world, sales totaled $421 million, a year-over-year constant currency increase of 15%, driven by incremental sales from established products, new product launches and volume growth in Japan and Australia. Increases were partially offset by lower pricing throughout the region and a decrease in sales volume from our operations in India on account of some delays in HIV tenders. 
Specialty segment revenues totaled $248 million, a year-over-year increase of 17% that resulted from higher sales of EpiPen and Perforomist Inhalation Solution. 
We were happy to see that in the most recent quarter, each of our commercial regions increased their market share in terms of volume as they continue to outpace market growth. This shows again how the vertically integrated, diversified platform, strong product portfolio and commercial scale across our regions is truly differentiating Mylan from the competition. 
We also continue to make good progress on leveraging the opportunities from established products business acquired from Abbott as well as women's health care businesses acquired from Famy Care, and we are now preparing for the expected completion of the proposed Meda acquisition in the third quarter. 
I would like to note that similar to all of our past transactions, we will apply Mylan's distinct approach to our integration of Meda. We believe that this approach, which is built on a foundation of mutual respect for people, the markets we operate in and the stakeholders we serve is part of what makes Mylan so special and what has made our transactions so successful. By doing things this way, we'll once again quickly and efficiently integrate the Meda platform to our One Mylan approach. 
With the addition of Meda to all of the other strategic assets we have put in place over the past decade, we believe we now have in place the essential components key to successfully delivering on our mission and strategy and our goal of continuing to create exceptional value for shareholders and stakeholders. While we continue to look for opportunities to further enhance our business to certain geographies, our product areas such as dermatology, the foundation we have in place is second to none, and we are very excited to demonstrate what we can do with this exceptional platform. Finally, we continue to execute on our strategic growth drivers and made good progress against many of these during the quarter. 
Let me highlight just a few of these. Turning to our biosimilars portfolio, which is one of the industry's most robust and diverse. With our Biocon partnership and Momenta collaboration announced in January, we have a combined portfolio of 15 biosimilars and insulin analog generic products in development with a current total brand market value of more than $75 billion in worldwide sales, positioning us to be a potential global leader in the biosimilars space. 
We continue to operationalize our partnership with Momenta and have commenced scientific collaboration and kicked off [indiscernible] programs. These interactions have further reinforced the excellent culture of this partnership. 
We also continue to successfully execute on our various programs with Biocon. The pegfilgrastim products met its primary endpoint in global Phase III clinical studies. While our insulin Glargine products, the 24-week data from the site 1 clinical study is now available, and we met the primary and secondary endpoints, whereas the data from the type 2 diabetes clinical study will be available in the near future. 
The results for the clinical study with trastuzumab products are now available and will be presented as a late-breaking abstract in an oral presentation session at ASCO 2016. We look forward to providing you with additional updates as these applications are filed. In the respiratory space, most notably, we announced during the quarter that our ANDA for our generic has been accepted by FDA and FDA has provided a GDUFA goal date of March 28, 2017. While we note that there has been one more subsequent filer, our ongoing dialogue with FDA and the progress of our program gives us continued confidence that Mylan will be the first to bring to market a substitutable generic form of Advair Diskus. 
Finally, I also would like to thank our committed and talented global workforce for their significant contributions to our business and mission during the quarter. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Tony Mauro, our Chief Commercial Officer, for some additional perspective on commercial landscape and pricing environment."

As you heard, our commercial platform continues to deliver for us in each of our key regions, demonstrated by the continued strength and resilience of the Mylan business around the world as well as our ability to continue to grow. Becaus",379,"Thank you, Rajiv. As you heard, our commercial platform continues to deliver for us in each of our key regions, demonstrated by the continued strength and resilience of the Mylan business around the world as well as our ability to continue to grow. Because there's been much talk about the pricing environment throughout our industry across both the generic and Specialty segment, especially here in the U.S., I would like to address this right upfront. 
As Heather noted, not all generic companies are created equally. For our part, we expect to continue to benefit from the scale and diversity of our business and portfolio, our reach across customer channels and our unmatched operating platform and supply chain infrastructure, which gives us greater scale and control of our cost of goods sold in our time-to-market. We have created this highly differentiated model through focused execution against our strategic plan over the last 10 years and investment in scale and diversification, which will become even more important going forward. 
Therefore, I'd like to make clear that consistent with the guidance we laid out for 2016, we continue to see nothing out of the ordinary to change our generic pricing assumptions of low- to mid-single-digit erosion for the full year. Our performance this quarter, both in the U.S. and globally, was right in line with these expectations. 
With regard to EpiPen, we continue to maintain our strong leadership position in the marketplace through the first quarter. We are very pleased with the strong volume growth in this product as we continue to grow throughout the year. 
We also see significant opportunities to continue to expand this market to tap into more than 20 million patients at risk. Looking ahead, we believe Mylan continues to be uniquely positioned to compete within today's market environment. We have found both our global and domestic customer needs to be closely aligned with what Mylan offers in terms of product resin quality and our ability to consistently deliver service and reliability around the world. 
We also continue to believe in the benefits of our One Mylan approach and have created a unique commercial operating platform to cross-sell our portfolio across therapeutic franchises and customer channels. 
Thank you, and I will now turn the call back to Heather."

I'd like to take you through a few additional financial highlights for the quarter before turning to Q&A. 
Adjusted gross margin for the first quarter of 2016 was 54%, up approximately 100 basis points from the prior year quarter due to the positive incremental contribution from established products and new product introductions. We expect our full year adjusted gross margin to be in line with our previously communicated guidance range. 
R&D expense on an adjusted basis was approximately 8.6% of total revenues for the first quarter and an increase as a result of incremental expense from our investment in established products as well as continued investment in our respiratory insulin and Biologics program. At the same time, SG&A, also on an adjusted basis, was approximately 23% of total revenues for the quarter. The increase in SG&A from the prior year period is due primarily to incremental expense from established products in this year's first quarter. We anticipate R&D and SG&A each on an adjusted basis and as a percentage of total revenues for the full year of 2016 to be within the guidance metrics we communicated in February. 
Turning to cash flow and liquidity. Adjusted cash provided by operating activities totaled $202 million for the first quarter. Capital spending was up slightly as compared to the prior year of $52 million as we continue to invest in our businesses and growth drivers. 
As of the quarter's end, our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 2.4x. We have no amount outstanding on our accounts receivable securitization and revolving credit facility, and we have full access to the $1.2 billion of cash on our balance sheet. We continue to have ample borrowing capacity and financial flexibility, and as a reminder, we have fully committed financing to fund the proposed acquisition of Meda. 
Subsequent to March 31 of this year, the warrants associated with our cash convertible notes, which matured in September of 2015 were settled, resulting in the issuance of 17 million ordinary shares. The dilutive impact of the warrant is included in our diluted share count for the quarter ended March 31 and was assumed in our guidance.

As we stated, their results were very much in line with our expectation. I think one of the disconnects is that The Street or here in the United States have not followed Meda's business all that closely, and then certainly post our announcement of acquiring them, I think there's been no following of the business. So I think there was such real disconnect with consensus as to what Meda was expected to do. As far as the businesses, I would differ that Meda and Omega don't look alike really at all. Meda, as we said when we announced the acquisition, is a very diverse company with no concentration in any one country or any one product portfolio. It's really spread out over hundreds of products that allow us to truly build critical mass and some continued very important countries before us especially throughout Europe and then as we mentioned, emerging markets, the presence that we have not been in. So I would first start out with the business has looked totally different. But that being said, I think we've been very clear that Omega was a great asset that you can put a wrong in charge of that asset. So I can't comment on Perrigo or Omega, but I can tell you is that our track record of integrating peer a large diverse European business started almost 10 years ago with our acquisition of Merck KGA, which I would hope that we would all sit back and say that we did a great job of not only integrating them but continuing to deliver double-digit growth over the last 10 years. So look, we are committed a billion percent to bringing the Meda asset in. As we've always said, it's not what the company's doing on a stand-alone basis. It's what we're going to do as a combined platform, and we believe the Mylan-Meda platform will continue to be one of the most diversified and differentiated ones in our industry. As far as pricing, look, I agree there is pressure. There is pressure on companies that have had a very, very niche concentration on a portfolio and have, I think, in many cases, executed practices that are not sustainable, and I think we've talked about that for a long time, and I think as we -- as I once said in my opening comments, to really resonate I hope with the investment community to say to really step back and take a look at companies who have -- are making most of the products they sell, integrated a true global supply chain, meaning we control our own destiny versus companies that are doing nothing but in license products for all of their new products or acquiring products and after they acquire them, cutting all of the R&D the people, everything associated with it. So what I really was trying to call out this morning is over the last decade of us investing in products, R&D and people, manufacturing, CapEx, over the years, I won't say that we didn't take our fair share of criticism that we may be were investing too much, maybe we were investing too much capital on our manufacturing operations in Paragraph 4, in injectables in complex products, and I would stand here and hope that as we look back at the last 10 years of growth that we've achieved and more importantly, the growth that we see going forward, we put targets out there that continue to show a very robust growth platform. And we believe, as I said earlier, we're just getting started. The runway out there for us to add more products, more dosage forms, more therapeutic areas to truly leverage now the platform we have in place is just again going to accelerate that growth trajectory. Thank you."

You had talked about, I think, essentially 20% top line growth in the entire Generics segment. And then thinking about based on what you guys put up today and what that implies for the remaining 3 quarters of the year, certainly implies a pretty significant acceleration in terms of year-over-year growth, essentially a doubling of the rate in the first quarter. And I guess, one of the key dynamics there or the largest factor in terms of bridging revenue growth was new product launches. Maybe you can just talk a little bit about kind of where you are versus your original expectations on the product cycle at the beginning of the year and just sort of remind us the balance of the year what are the some of the key new product drivers?"

Their need to have a global partner that can truly marry up an effective and efficient supply chain cost of goods, the breadth of portfolio while not losing sight of investing in the complex products like a generic Advair bring into the market. So I believe that there will be a continued consolidation around the globe, and we absolutely plan to continue to participate. What we've said is that given the platform, both operational and commercial platform that we've built today that it's easy to now complement it with bolt ons that allow us to continue to grow critical mass just like we're doing with over-the-counter business as we bring in the Meda and now have $1 billion franchise, we'll be able to continue to think about the best ways to continue to grow that channel throughout the globe.

Look, I think there's been significant confusion, both with the investment community and Washington when it comes between Generics and Specialty products. I think that as we look at some of the hearings that have taken place and some of the dynamics and some of the discussions have all been around Specialty product or one player product. So when you step back and look at the Generics portfolio, the generic industry today represents 88% of the volume of all drugs dispensed in the United States. We've saved over $1.5 trillion over the last 10 years for the U.S. health care system, and we today represent 28% of the pharmaceutical spend, which is only 10% of our health care spend. So when you really drill down to Generics have continued to be the backbone of the system, we have continued to have products that continue to face competition, and that's why we said mid-single digits have been our price expectation. It's been that way for the last several years. It's been very stable, and as we came into this year, we said we see that remaining the same that stability around pricing but not for everybody, and this is again why I think we're trying to do the best we can to help everyone understand and distinguish between companies. Companies who are focused on very small niche areas, focused on practices that are not sustainable, practices that they now had to take out of their future guidance, which is showing no growth for certain companies, has no bearing on a Mylan and a platform that we've built with having hundreds of products here in the United States, continuing to launch many, many new products both that are high barrier to entry and have afford the opportunity to continue to have whether it's higher gross margin or complement our current platform is why we believe it's the right inflection point and why I truly believe the rebasing of this entire sector was needed to allow, I think, this refocus and the visibility around truly individual business models. I think the investment community did a pretty good job beginning to differentiate between brand pharmas expertise from an R&D perspective, from a manufacturing perspective. And I truly believe that when you apply that same lens into our industry, it's going to become much more clear about the companies who do have a sustainable long-term growth future ahead of them, and we believe Mylan leads that space. As far as customers go, the consolidation and their needs completely marry up and nurture our benefit. Our global customers have global demands. The needs to be able to have high-quality effective and efficient as supply chain have products where they need it when they need it, that time to market has never been more critical, and we again have put a global supply chain to meet those demands. I think our customers are recognizing it, and I think that it's about looking at our whole basket of products. So yes, the FDA is going to continue to approve products. Mylan's got one of the largest pipelines waiting for approval with the FDA. So we're looking forward to them hitting that backlog and getting products to the market. And again, we believe we'll get our just disproportionate benefit because of the breadth of our current basket of business that we do with our customers today."

I think that both from a vertical integration as well as just our manufacturing operating platform. So there's 2 aspects of that. Vertical integration means that we're producing our own API that goes into the finished usage form and then manufacturing our finished dosage form or we're acquiring API from a third party but still manufacturing our finished dosage form and our -- the multitude of finished dosage forms that we now are capable of span by the dozen. So from oral solid to injectables to extended release to topicals. So we've continued to really invest and build out that capability, and so what we see again as being this differentiator, being -- controlling our own destiny through being able to manufacture, perhaps vertically integrate as well as our global supply chain is what really gives that -- gives us that head start or that advantage from a cost of goods perspective and the efficiency around it. So just like we did with the Merck business, we were able to look at products that we could either consolidate that by. We could bring alternate manufacturing in-house and be able to really leverage again our platform today, even more so than 8 years ago because our manufacturing footprint has expanded dramatically 10-fold since we did the Merck acquisition. So our ability to bring the Meda line, which they do very, very little manufacturing. Most of their products are in license. Again, that's just another added benefit of Mylan and Meda joining forces to really be able to optimize the operational and commercial platform that we put in place.

290203,331408563,970843,"Mylan N.V., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 03, 2016",2016-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Viatris Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Kris, and good morning, everyone. Mylan's results during the first quarter marked a great start to what we believe will be another year of double-digit growth. However, before we walk through our results, I'd like to make a few comments regarding",985,"Thanks, Kris, and good morning, everyone. Mylan's results during the first quarter marked a great start to what we believe will be another year of double-digit growth. However, before we walk through our results, I'd like to make a few comments regarding the macro environment surrounding our industry.
First, I strongly believe that the rebasing of our sector was not only necessary, but helped draw distinction and differentiation amongst our peers. For far too long, one brush has been used across our industry and business models when, in fact, the business models have been very diverse. The investment community has taking a -- has taken a flawed approach of one-size-fits-all when it comes to the generics industry. The echo chamber around too good to be true results, stock prices and multiples has finally been silenced enough to allow investors to refocus on fundamentals and investment thesis.
While not always popular, Mylan has always been consistent. We had been steadfast that a great company cannot be built quarter-by-quarter and that well-run companies return great results for shareholders and other stakeholders. We laid out a vision almost a decade ago that our growth would come from creating scale and manufacturing and expanding the breadth of our portfolio to better serve patients around the world. And every acquisition we've done has complemented this strategy.
Our results have demonstrated that our continued organic investments, coupled with inorganic opportunities, have delivered short-, middle- and long-term growth. We appreciate that when applying a broad brush, there is investor concern of little to no growth in the generics industry.
With that said, our strategy has resulted in Mylan delivering consistent double-digit earnings growth. Most importantly, it is on the back of our last decade of hard work to vertically integrate our products, build out our manufacturing capability, invest in one of the broadest portfolios of complex molecules, all while maximizing our geographic footprint and commercial excellence in all distribution channels, that we have managed to differentiate ourselves from the pack and position ourselves for continued growth well into the future as the true leader in our space today.
In other words, we have not built a company on any one product or one practice. Instead, we have focused on diversifying and building one of the industry's most efficient and effective engines, one that's just getting started. 
The reality of health care is that access to medicine is needed now more than ever around the globe from our aging population to living longer, healthier lives, making access the fundamental pillar for future growth. This is precisely why Meda is the right next strategic addition to our platform. Geographically, we will gain a more balanced and expanded presence, and we will become a leader in the global respiratory allergy market and achieve scale in many other therapeutic areas, including a $1 billion OTC business.
With that, I'd now like to turn to our performance during the quarter. On the top line, we delivered total revenues of $2.2 billion, a year-over-year increase of 19% on a constant currency basis, that was fueled by double-digit revenue growth in our Generics and Specialty segments, including positive growth in all of our regions. Total revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign currency translation by approximately $33 million compared to last year's first quarter. 
On the bottom line, we delivered adjusted net earnings of $386 million or $0.76 per adjusted diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 9%. This strong quarter was achieved despite delays in certain product approvals as we continue to leverage our unique global operating platform and diverse mix of assets to take advantage of opportunities in markets around the world. Given our strong first quarter performance and strong momentum, we remain committed to our 2016 guidance metrics, including our adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $4.85 to $5.15.
Turning to Meda for a moment. Many of you know that the company reported first quarter results this morning. They were very much in line with our modeled expectations for the business as its dynamics were well known and understood by us. Notably, Meda reported strong performance from top products such as Dymista and Betadine as well as nice turnaround performance in Elidel and solid execution in emerging markets.
We continue to believe that Meda is a scarce, high-quality asset, and we remain fully committed to look to and look forward to completing the deal. Further, there is no change whatsoever to any of our expectations for the combined business. As stated previously, we expect the deal to be immediately accretive to Mylan's adjusted earnings, with accretion increasing significantly after the first full year as synergies are realized.
All of our public and private filings with respect to Meda deal remain on track, and we expect to publish the offer document later this month. In addition, we expect to obtain all relevant clearances prior to the end of the acceptance period, which would keep us on track to close the transaction by the end of the third quarter. We also look forward to hosting our next Investor Day event after the close.
I'd like to now take the opportunity, on behalf of Mylan's board and entire leadership team, to thank all of our employees around the world for their outstanding teamwork and execution during the quarter and for their continued commitment to our cause.
I also note that we continue to attract exceptional leaders from outside as well. And today, we announced that Ken Parks will join our team as Chief Financial Officer effective June 6. Ken's deep functional expertise, strong leadership ability, experience leading organizations through change, including overseeing significant acquisitions and expansion into emerging markets and his impressive track record operating in complex, global cultures and manufacturing environments will make him an outstanding addition not only to our very strong global finance team, but to Mylan overall.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Rajiv."

As Heather indicated, our business continues to perform strongly across all areas, reflecting the powerful global manufacturing, R&D and commercial infrastructure we have in place and the opportunities we are seeing to leverage our expansive product portfolio across all geographies and channels as One Mylan.
In our North America Generics business, sales totaled $920 million, a year-over-year increase of 8%. Growth came primarily from sales of new products, and to a lesser extent, from incremental sales of established products while the pricing environment was consistent with our expectations and guidance view.
In Europe, sales totaled $588 million, a strong year-over-year constant currency increase of 47%. This result was mainly due to incremental sales from established products, and to a lesser extent, sales from new products.
In Rest of World, sales totaled $421 million, a year-over-year constant currency increase of 15%, driven by incremental sales from established products, new product launches and volume growth in Japan and Australia. Increases were partially offset by lower pricing throughout the region and a decrease in sales volume from our operations in India on account of some delays in HIV tenders.  
Specialty segment revenues totaled $248 million, a year-over-year increase of 17% that resulted from higher sales of EpiPen and Perforomist Inhalation Solution. We were happy to see that in the most recent quarter, each of our commercial regions increased their market share in terms of volume as they continue to outpace market growth. This shows again how the vertically integrated, diversified platform, strong product portfolio and commercial scale across our regions is truly differentiating Mylan from the competition.
We also continue to make good progress on leveraging the opportunities from established products business acquired from Abbott as well as women's health care businesses acquired from Famy Care. And we are now preparing for the expected completion of the proposed Meda acquisition in the third quarter.
I would like to note that similar to all of our past transactions, we will apply Mylan's distinct approach to our integration of Meda. We believe that this approach, which is built on a foundation of mutual respect for people, the markets we operate in and the stakeholders we serve, is part of what makes Mylan so special and what has made our transactions so successful. By doing things this way, we'll once again quickly and efficiently integrate the Meda platform to our One Mylan approach. 
With the addition of Meda to all of the other strategic assets we have put in place over the past decade, we believe we now have in place the essential components key to successfully delivering on our mission and strategy and our goal of continuing to create exceptional value for shareholders and stakeholders. While we continue to look for opportunities to further enhance our business in certain geographies or product areas such as dermatology, the foundation we have in place is second to none, and we are very excited to demonstrate what we can do with this exceptional platform. Finally, we continue to execute on our strategic growth drivers and made good progress against many of these during the quarter. 
Let me highlight just a few of these. Turning to our biosimilars portfolio, which is one of the industry's most robust and diverse. With our Biocon partnership and Momenta collaboration announced in January, we have a combined portfolio of 15 biosimilars and insulin analog generic products in development with a current total brand market value of more than $75 billion in worldwide sales, positioning us to be a potential global leader in the biosimilars space.
We continue to operationalize our partnership with Momenta and have commenced scientific collaboration and kicked off [indiscernible] of these programs. These interactions have further reinforced the excellent cultural suite of this partnership. 
We also continue to successfully execute on our various programs with Biocon. The pegfilgrastim products met its primary endpoint in global Phase III clinical studies. While our insulin Glargine product's 24-week data from the type 1 diabetes clinical study is now available and we met the primary and secondary endpoints, whereas the data from the type 2 diabetes clinical study will be available in the near future.
The results for the [indiscernible] clinical study with trastuzumab product are now available and will be presented as a late-breaking abstract in an oral presentation session at ASCO 2016. We look forward to providing you with additional updates as these applications are filed. 
In the respiratory space, most notably, we announced during the quarter that our ANDA for our generic Advair Diskus has been accepted by FDA and FDA has provided a GDUFA goal date of March 28, 2017. While we note that there has been one more subsequent filer, our ongoing dialogue with FDA and the progress of our program gives us continued confidence that Mylan will be the first to bring to market an AB-rated, substitutable generic form of Advair Diskus.
Finally, I also would like to thank our committed and talented global workforce for their significant contributions to our business and mission during the quarter.
With that, I will turn the call over to Tony Mauro, our Chief Commercial Officer, for some additional perspective on commercial landscape and pricing environment."

As you heard, our commercial platforms continue to deliver for us in each of our key regions, demonstrated by the continued strength and resilience of the Mylan business around the world as well as our ability to continue to grow. Beca",380,"Thank you, Rajiv. As you heard, our commercial platforms continue to deliver for us in each of our key regions, demonstrated by the continued strength and resilience of the Mylan business around the world as well as our ability to continue to grow. 
Because there's been much talk about the pricing environment throughout our industry across both the Generic and Specialty segments, especially here in the U.S., I would like to address this right up-front. As Heather noted, not all generic companies are created equally. For our part, we expect to continue to benefit from the scale and diversity of our business and portfolio, our reach across customer channels and our unmatched operating platform and supply chain infrastructure, which gives us greater scale and control of our cost of goods sold and our time-to-market. We have created this highly differentiated model through focused execution against our strategic plan over the last 10 years and investment in scale and diversification, which will become even more important going forward.
Therefore, I'd like to make clear that consistent with the guidance we laid out for 2016, we continue to see nothing out of the ordinary that changed our generic pricing assumptions of low to mid-single-digit erosion for the full year. Our performance this quarter, both in the U.S. and globally, was right in line with these expectations.
With regard to EpiPen, we continue to maintain our strong leadership position in the marketplace through the first quarter. We are very pleased with the strong volume growth in this product as it continues to grow throughout the year. We also see significant opportunities to continue to expand this market to tap into more than 20 million patients at risk. 
Looking ahead, we believe Mylan continues to be uniquely positioned to compete within today's market environment. We have found both our global and domestic customer needs to be closely aligned with what Mylan offers in terms of product breadth and quality and our ability to consistently deliver service and reliability around the world.
We also continue to believe in the benefits of our One Mylan approach and have created a unique commercial operating platform to cross-sell our portfolio across therapeutic franchises and customer channels.
Thank you, and I will now turn the call back to Heather."

I'd like to take you through a few additional financial highlights for the quarter before turning to Q&A.
Adjusted gross margin for the first quarter of 2016 was 54%, up approximately 100 basis points from the prior year quarter due to the positive incremental contribution from established products and new product introductions. We expect our full year adjusted gross margin to be in line with our previously communicated guidance range.
R&D expense, on an adjusted basis, was approximately 8.6% of total revenues for the first quarter. And it increased as a result of incremental expense from our investment in established products as well as continued investment in our respiratory insulin and biologics program. 
At the same time, SG&A, also on an adjusted basis, was approximately 23% of total revenues for the quarter. The increase in SG&A from the prior year period is due primarily to incremental expense from established products in this year's first quarter. We anticipate R&D and SG&A each on an adjusted basis and as a percentage of total revenues for the full year of 2016 to be within the guidance metrics we communicated in February.
Turning to cash flow and liquidity. Adjusted cash provided by operating activities totaled $202 million for the first quarter. Capital spending was up slightly as compared to the prior year of $52 million as we continue to invest in our businesses and growth drivers.
As of the quarter's end, our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 2.4x. We have no amount outstanding on our accounts receivable securitization and revolving credit facility, and we have full access to the $1.2 billion of cash on our balance sheet. We continue to have ample borrowing capacity and financial flexibility. And as a reminder, we have fully committed financing to fund the proposed acquisition of Meda.
Subsequent to March 31 of this year, the warrants associated with our cash convertible notes, which matured in September of 2015, were settled, resulting in the issuance of 17 million ordinary shares. The dilutive impact of the warrant is included in our diluted share count for the quarter ended March 31 and was assumed in our guidance.

You did mention that they were in line with your expectations. But I guess, if you can just give us a little bit of comfort that we saw Perrigo lower their earnings expectations in part due to Omega. Omega's business is not that much different from Meda. So why are you so confident that Meda is not -- Meda to Mylan is not Omega to Perrigo? If you can give us a little bit more color around your thoughts as to why you can turn that business around? And then secondly, back on the U.S. pricing dynamics, why is the environment different from you than it is for some of the niche players such as companies focused mostly on dermatology or narcotics. It seems that that's where the pressure is coming from, but maybe you could comment on that further."

As we stated, their results were very much in line with our expectations. I think one of the disconnects is that the street here in the United States have not followed Meda's business all",647,"Sure, Jami. Thank you. So first, let me address your Meda question. As we stated, their results were very much in line with our expectations. I think one of the disconnects is that the street here in the United States have not followed Meda's business all that closely. And then certainly, post our announcement of acquiring them, I think there has been no following of the business. So I think there was just a real disconnect with consensus as to what Meda was expected to do. As far as the businesses, I would differ that Meda and Omega don't look alike really at all. Meda, as we said when we announced the acquisition, is a very diverse company with no concentration in any one country or any one product portfolio. It's truly spread out over hundreds of products that allow us to truly build critical mass and some continued very important countries for us, especially throughout Europe and, then as we mentioned, emerging markets, a presence that we had not been in. So I would first start out with the business has looked totally different. With that being said, I think we've been very clear that Omega was a great asset, that you can put a wrong driver in charge of that asset. So I can't comment. I'm not running Perrigo or Omega. What I can tell you is that our track record of integrating very large, diverse European business started almost 10 years ago with our acquisition of Merck KGaA, which I would hope that we would all sit back and say that we did a great job of not only integrating them, but continuing to deliver double-digit growth over the last 10 years. So look, we are committed a billion percent to bringing the Meda asset in. As we've always said, it's not what the company's doing on a stand-alone basis; it's what we're going to do as a combined platform. And we believe the Mylan-Meda platform will continue to be one of the most diversified and differentiated ones in our industry. As far as pricing, look, I agree there's pressure. There's pressure on companies that have had a very, very niche concentration on the portfolio and have, I think, in many cases, executed practices that are not sustainable. And I think we have talked about that for a long time. And I think as we -- as I once said in my opening comments, to really resonate I hope with the investment community to say to really step back and take a look at companies who have -- are making most of the products they sell, integrated a true global supply chain, meaning, we control our own destiny, versus companies that are doing nothing but in-license products for all of their new products or acquiring products, and after they acquire them, cutting all of the R&D, the people, everything associated with it. So what I really was trying to call out this morning is over the last decade of us investing in products, R&D and people, manufacturing, CapEx, over the years, I won't say that we didn't take our fair share of criticism that we -- maybe we're investing too much. Maybe we were investing too much capital on our manufacturing operations in Paragraph IV, in injectables, in complex products. And I would stand here and hope that as we look back at the last 10 years of growth that we've achieved, and more importantly, the growth that we see going forward, we put targets out there that continue to show a very robust growth platform. And we believe, as I said earlier, we're just getting started. The runway out there for us to add more products, more dosage forms, more therapeutic areas to truly leverage now the platform we have in place is just again going to accelerate that growth trajectory. Thank you."

You had talked about, I think, essentially 20% top line growth in the entire Generics segment. And then thinking about based on what you guys put out today and what that implies for the remaining 3 quarters of the year, it certainly implies a pretty significant acceleration in terms of year-over-year growth, essentially a doubling of the rate in the first quarter. And I guess, one of the key dynamics there or the largest factor in terms of bridging revenue growth was new product launches. Maybe if you could just talk a little bit about kind of where you are versus original expectations on the product cycle at the beginning of the year and just sort of remind us in the balance of the year, what are some of the key known new product drivers?"

So we continue, as Tony mentioned in his commentary, continue to be very excited in EpiPen. We've continued to invest in that product. We continue to educate, build awareness. And I think if you just look at the amount of -- if you look at just our school program and the amount of EpiPens that we've been able to distribute to the public school system and the amount of lives that had been saved due to it, I mean, so we believe the investments have been well worthwhile and that the community continues to resonate to the education and awareness and as we said, there's over 20 million lives at risk.

Their needs to have a global partner that can truly marry up an effective and efficient supply chain cost of goods, the breadth of portfolio, while not losing sight of investing in the complex products like a generic Advair bring into the market. So I believe that there will be a continued consolidation around the globe, and we absolutely plan to continue to participate.

Look, I think there's been significant confusion, both with the investment community and Washington when it comes between generics and specialty products. I think that as we look at some of the hearings that have taken place, at some of the dynamics and some of the discussions have all been around specialty product for one-player product. So when you step back and look at the Generics portfolio, the generic industry today represents 88% of the volume of all drugs dispensed in the United States. We have saved over $1.5 trillion over the last 10 years for the U.S. health care system. And we today represent 28% of the pharmaceutical spend, which is only 10% of our health care spend. So when you really drill down to generics has continued to be the backbone of the system, we have continued to have products that continue to face competition. And that's why we said mid-single digits has been our price expectation. It's been that way for the last several years. It's been very stable. And as we came into this year, we said we see that remaining the same that stability around pricing, but not for everybody. And this is again why I think we're trying to do the best we can to help everyone understand and distinguish between companies. Companies who are focused on very small niche areas, focused on practices that are not sustainable, practices that they now have to take out of their future guidance, which is showing no growth for certain companies, has no bearing on a Mylan and a platform that we've built with having hundreds of products here in the United States, continuing to launch many, many new products, both that are high barrier to entry and have afford the opportunity to continue to have -- whether it's higher gross margin or complement our current platform, is why we believe it's the right inflection point and why I truly believe the rebasing of this entire sector was needed to allow, I think, this refocus and the visibility around truly individual business models. I think the investment community did a pretty good job beginning to differentiate between brand pharmas whose expertise was from an R&D perspective, from a manufacturing perspective. And I truly believe that when you apply that same lens to our industry, it's going to become much more clear about the companies who do have a sustainable long-term growth future ahead of them, and we believe Mylan leads that space. As far as our customers go, the consolidation and their needs completely marry up and enlarge our benefit. Our global customers have global demands. The needs to be able to have high-quality, effective and efficient supply chain, have products where they need it when they need it, that time to market has never been more critical. And we again have put a global supply chain to meet those demands. I think our customers are recognizing it. And I think that it's about looking at our whole basket of products. So yes, the FDA is going to continue to approve products. Mylan's got one of the largest pipelines waiting for approval with the FDA. So we're looking forward to them hitting that backlog and getting products to the market. And again, we believe we'll get our disproportionate benefit because of the breadth of our current basket of business that we do with our customers today."

I think that both from a vertical integration as well as just our manufacturing operating platform. So there's 2 aspects of that. Vertical integration means that we're producing our own API that goes into the finished dosage form and then manufacturing our finished dosage form. Or we're acquiring API from a third party, but still manufacturing our finished dosage form. And our -- the multitude of finished dosage forms that we now are capable of span by the dozen, so from oral solids to injectables to extended release to topicals. So we've continued to really invest and build out that capability. And so what we see again as being this differentiator, being -- controlling our own destiny through being able to manufacture, perhaps vertically integrate as well as our global supply chain, is what really gives that -- gives us that head start or that advantage from a cost of goods perspective and the efficiency around it. So just like we did with the Merck business, we were able to look at products that we could either consolidate that by. We could bring alternate manufacturing in-house and be able to really leverage again our platform today, even more so than 8 years ago, because our manufacturing footprint has expanded dramatically tenfold since we did the Merck acquisition. So our ability to bring the Meda's line, which they do very, very little manufacturing, most of their products are in-licensed, again, that's just another added benefit of Mylan and Meda joining forces to really be able to optimize the operational and commercial platform that we put in place.

290203,331408563,971527,"Mylan N.V., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 03, 2016",2016-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Viatris Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Kris, and good morning, everyone. Mylan's results during the first quarter marked a great start to what we believe will be another year of double-digit growth. However, before we walk through our results, I'd like to make a few comments regarding",984,"Thanks, Kris, and good morning, everyone. Mylan's results during the first quarter marked a great start to what we believe will be another year of double-digit growth. However, before we walk through our results, I'd like to make a few comments regarding the macro environment surrounding our industry.
First, I strongly believe that the rebasing of our sector was not only necessary, but helped draw distinction and differentiation amongst our peers. For far too long, one brush has been used across our industry and business models when, in fact, the business models have been very diverse. The investment community has taking a -- has taken a flawed approach of one-size-fits-all when it comes to the generics industry. The echo chamber around too good to be true results, stock prices and multiples has finally been silenced enough to allow investors to refocus on fundamentals and investment theses.
While not always popular, Mylan has always been consistent. We have been steadfast that a great company cannot be built quarter-by-quarter and that well-run companies return great results for shareholders and other stakeholders. We laid out a vision almost a decade ago that our growth would come from creating scale in manufacturing and expanding the breadth of our portfolio to better serve patients around the world. And every acquisition we've done has complemented this strategy.
Our results have demonstrated that our continued organic investments, coupled with inorganic opportunities, have delivered short-, middle- and long-term growth. We appreciate that when applying a broad brush, there is investor concern of little to no growth in the generics industry.
But that said, our strategy has resulted in Mylan delivering consistent double-digit earnings growth. Most importantly, it is on the back of our last decade of hard work to vertically integrate our products, build out our manufacturing capabilities, invest in one of the broadest portfolios of complex molecules, all while maximizing our geographic footprint and commercial excellence in all distribution channels that we have managed to differentiate ourselves from the pack and position ourselves for continued growth well into the future as the true leader in our space today.
In other words, we have not built a company on any one product or one practice. Instead, we have focused on diversifying and building one of the industry's most efficient and effective engines, one that's just getting started. 
The reality of health care is that access to medicine is needed now more than ever around the globe from our aging population to living longer, healthier lives, making access the fundamental pillar for future growth. This is precisely why Meda is the right next strategic addition to our platform. Geographically, we will gain a more balanced and expanded presence, and we will become a leader in the global respiratory allergy market and achieve scale in many other therapeutic areas, including a $1 billion OTC business.
With that, I'd now like to turn to our performance during the quarter. On the top line, we delivered total revenues of $2.2 billion, a year-over-year increase of 19% on constant currency basis, that was fueled by double-digit revenue growth in our Generics and Specialty segments, including positive growth in all of our regions. Total revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign currency translation by approximately $33 million compared to last year's first quarter. 
On the bottom line, we delivered adjusted net earnings of $386 million or $0.76 per adjusted diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 9%. This strong quarter was achieved despite delays in certain product approvals as we continued to leverage our unique global operating platform and diverse mix of assets to take advantage of opportunities in markets around the world. Given our strong first quarter performance and strong momentum, we remain committed to our 2016 guidance metrics, including our adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $4.85 to $5.15.
Turning to Meda for a moment. Many of you know that the company reported first quarter results this morning. They were very much in line with our modeled expectations for the business as its dynamics were well known and understood by us. Notably, Meda reported strong performance from top products such as Dymista and Betadine as well as nice turnaround performance in Italy and solid execution in emerging markets.
We continue to believe that Meda is a scarce, high-quality asset, and we remain fully committed to look to and look forward to completing the deal. Further, there is no change whatsoever to any of our expectations for the combined business. As stated previously, we expect the deal to be immediately accretive to Mylan's adjusted earnings, with accretion increasing significantly after the first full year, as synergies are realized.
All of our public and private filings with respect to Meda deal remain on track, and we expect to publish the offer document later this month. In addition, we expect to obtain all relevant clearances prior to the end of the acceptance period, which would keep us on track to close the transaction by the end of the third quarter. We also look forward to hosting our next Investor Day event after the close.
I'd like to now take the opportunity, on behalf of Mylan's Board and entire leadership team, to thank all of our employees around the world for their outstanding teamwork and execution during the quarter and for their continued commitment to our cause.
I also note that we continue to attract exceptional leaders from outside as well. And today, we announced that Ken Parks will join our team as Chief Financial Officer effective June 6. Ken's deep functional expertise, strong leadership ability, experience leading organizations through change, including overseeing significant acquisitions and expansion into emerging markets, and his impressive track record operating in complex, global cultures and manufacturing environments will make him an outstanding addition not only to our very strong global finance team, but to Mylan overall.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Rajiv."

As Heather indicated, our business continues to perform strongly across all areas, reflecting the powerful global manufacturing, R&D and commercial infrastructure we have in place and the opportunities we are seeing to leverage our expansive product portfolio across all geographies and channels as One Mylan.
In our North America Generics business, sales totaled $920 million, a year-over-year increase of 8%. Growth came primarily from sales of new products, and to a lesser extent, from incremental sales of established products, while the pricing environment was consistent with our expectations and guidance view.
In Europe, sales totaled $588 million, a strong year-over-year constant currency increase of 47%. This result was mainly due to incremental sales from established products, and to a lesser extent, sales from new products.
In Rest of the World, sales totaled $421 million, a year-over-year constant currency increase of 15%, driven by incremental sales from established products, new product launches and volume growth in Japan and Australia. Increases were partially offset by lower pricing throughout the region and a decrease in sales volume from our operations in India on account of some delays in HIV tenders.  
Specialty segment revenues totaled $248 million, a year-over-year increase of 17% that resulted from higher sales of EpiPen and Perforomist Inhalation Solution. We were happy to see that in the most recent quarter, each of our commercial divisions increased their market share in terms of volume as they continued to outpace market growth. This shows again how the vertically integrated, diversified platform, strong product portfolio and commercial scale across our regions is truly differentiating Mylan from the competition.
We also continue to make good progress on leveraging the opportunities from the established products business acquired from Abbott as well as women's health care businesses acquired from Famy Care. And we are now preparing for the expected completion of the proposed Meda acquisition in the third quarter.
I would like to note that similar to all of our past transactions, we will apply Mylan's distinct approach to our integration of Meda. We believe that this approach, which is built on a foundation of mutual respect for people, the markets we operate in and the stakeholders we serve, is part of what makes Mylan so special and what has made our transactions so successful. By doing things this way, we'll once again quickly and efficiently integrate the Meda platform to our One Mylan approach. 
With the addition of Meda to all of the other strategic assets we have put in place over the past decade, we believe we now have in place the essential components key to successfully delivering on our mission and strategy and our goal of continuing to create exceptional value for shareholders and stakeholders. While we continue to look for opportunities to further enhance our business in certain geographies or product areas such as dermatology, the foundation we have in place is second to none, and we are very excited to demonstrate what we can do with this exceptional platform. Finally, we continue to execute on our strategic growth drivers and made good progress against many of these during the quarter. 
Let me highlight just a few of these. Turning to our biosimilars portfolio, which is one of the industry's most robust and diverse. With our Biocon partnership and Momenta collaboration announced in January, we have a combined portfolio of 15 biosimilars and insulin analog generic products in development with a current total brand market value of more than $75 billion in worldwide sales, positioning us to be a potential global leader in the biosimilars space.
We continue to operationalize our partnership with Momenta and have commenced scientific collaboration and kicked off the joint governance of these programs. These interactions have further reinforced the excellent cultural fit of this partnership. 
We also continue to successfully execute on our various programs with Biocon. The pegfilgrastim product met its primary endpoint in global Phase III clinical studies. While our insulin glargine product, the 24-week data from the type 1 diabetes clinical study is now available and we met the primary and secondary endpoints, whereas the data from the type 2 diabetes clinical study will be available in the near future.
The results for the inherited [ph] clinical study with trastuzumab product are now available and will be presented as a late-breaking abstract in an oral presentation session at ASCO 2016. We look forward to providing you with additional updates as these applications are filed. 
In the respiratory space, most notably, we announced during the quarter that our ANDA for our generic Advair Diskus has been accepted by FDA, and FDA has provided a GDUFA goal date of March 28, 2017. While we note that there has been one more subsequent filer, our ongoing dialogue with FDA and the progress of our program gives us continued confidence that Mylan will be the first to bring to market an AB-rated, substitutable generic form of Advair Diskus.
Finally, I also would like to thank our committed and talented global workforce for their significant contributions to our business and mission during the quarter.
With that, I will turn the call over to Tony Mauro, our Chief Commercial Officer, for some additional perspective on commercial landscape and pricing environments."

As you heard, our commercial platform continued to deliver for us in each of our key regions, demonstrated by the continued strength and resilience of the Mylan business around the world as well as our ability to continue to grow. Beca",380,"Thank you, Rajiv. As you heard, our commercial platform continued to deliver for us in each of our key regions, demonstrated by the continued strength and resilience of the Mylan business around the world as well as our ability to continue to grow. 
Because there's been much talk about the pricing environment throughout our industry across both the Generic and Specialty segments, especially here in the U.S., I would like to address this right up front. As Heather noted, not all generic companies are created equally. For our part, we expect to continue to benefit from the scale and diversity of our business and portfolio, our reach across customer channels and our unmatched operating platform and supply chain infrastructure, which gives us greater scale and control of our cost of goods sold and our time-to-market. We have created this highly differentiated model through focused execution against our strategic plan over the last 10 years and investment in scale and diversification, which will become even more important going forward.
Therefore, I'd like to make clear that consistent with the guidance we laid out for 2016, we continue to see nothing out of the ordinary that change our generic pricing assumptions of low to mid-single-digit erosion for the full year. Our performance this quarter, both in the U.S. and globally, was right in line with these expectations.
With regard to EpiPen, we continued to maintain our strong leadership position in the marketplace through the first quarter. We are very pleased with the strong volume growth in this product as it continued growth throughout the year. We also see significant opportunities to continue to expand this market to tap into more than 20 million patients at risk. 
Looking ahead, we believe Mylan continues to be uniquely positioned to compete within today's market environment. We have found both our global and domestic customer needs to be closely aligned with what Mylan offers in terms of product breadth and quality and our ability to consistently deliver service and reliability around the world.
We also continue to believe in the benefits of our One Mylan approach and have created a unique commercial operating platform to cross-sell our portfolio across therapeutic franchises and customer channels.
Thank you, and I will now turn the call back to Heather."

I'd like to take you through a few additional financial highlights for the quarter before turning to Q&A.
Adjusted gross margin for the first quarter of 2016 was 54%, up approximately 100 basis points from the prior year quarter due to the positive incremental contribution from established products and new product introductions. We expect our full year adjusted gross margin to be in line with our previously communicated guidance range.
R&D expense, on an adjusted basis, was approximately 8.6% of total revenues for the first quarter. And it increased as a result of incremental expense from our investment in established products as well as continued investment in our respiratory, insulin and biologics programs. 
At the same time, SG&A, also on an adjusted basis, was approximately 23% of total revenues for the quarter. The increase in SG&A from the prior year period is due primarily to incremental expense from established products in this year's first quarter. We anticipate R&D and SG&A, each on an adjusted basis and as a percentage of total revenues for the full year of 2016, to be within the guidance metrics we communicated in February.
Turning to cash flow and liquidity. Adjusted cash provided by operating activities totaled $202 million for the first quarter. Capital spending was up slightly as compared to the prior year at $52 million as we continued to invest in our businesses and growth drivers.
As of the quarter's end, our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 2.4x. We have no amounts outstanding on our accounts receivables securitization and revolving credit facility, and we have full access to the $1.2 billion of cash on our balance sheet. We continue to have ample borrowing capacity and financial flexibility. And as a reminder, we have fully committed financing to fund the proposed acquisition of Meda.
Subsequent to March 31 of this year, the warrants associated with our cash convertible notes, which matured in September of 2015, were settled, resulting in the issuance of 17 million ordinary shares.

So we continue to see opportunity as we bring more and more complex products, as we bring more and more strategic products internally to vertically integrate, we see more opportunities. Now from -- on the dermatology, other than having many organic R&D incubated opportunities, which we're already seeing coming to life, we continue to look out for enhancing and strengthening this portfolio in a strategic way. So we are looking for a group of portfolio -- product portfolio families around dermatology to further strengthen this line of the business and are out there to look for more and more opportunities in this space."

And then secondly, back on the U.S. pricing dynamics, why is the environment different from you than it is for some of the niche players such as companies focused mostly on dermatology or narcotics.

As we stated, their results were very much in line with our expectations. I think one of the disconnects is that the Street -- or here in the United States have not followed Meda's busine",645,"Sure, Jami. Thank you. So first, let me address your Meda question. As we stated, their results were very much in line with our expectations. I think one of the disconnects is that the Street -- or here in the United States have not followed Meda's business all that closely. And then certainly, post our announcement of acquiring them, I think there's been no following of the business. So I think there was just a real disconnect with consensus as to what Meda was expected to do. As far as the businesses, I would differ that Meda and Omega don't look alike really at all. Meda, as we said when we announced the acquisition, is a very diverse company with no concentration in any one country or any one product portfolio. It's truly spread out over hundreds of products that allow us to truly build critical mass in some continued very important countries for us, especially throughout Europe, and then as we mentioned, emerging markets, a presence that we had not been in. So I would first start out with the businesses look totally different. With that being said, I think we've been very clear that Omega was a great asset, but you can put a wrong driver in charge of that asset. So I can't comment. I'm not running Perrigo or Omega. What I can tell you is that our track record of integrating very large, diverse European business started almost 10 years ago with our acquisition of Merck KGaA, which I would hope that we would all sit back and say that we did a great job of not only integrating them, but continuing to deliver double-digit growth over the last 10 years. So look, we are committed a billion percent to bringing the Meda asset in. As we've always said, it's not what the company's doing on a stand-alone basis, it's what we're going to do as a combined platform. And we believe the Mylan-Meda platform will continue to be one of the most diversified and differentiated ones in our industry. As far as pricing, look, I agree there's pressure. There's pressure on companies that have had a very, very niche concentration on a portfolio and have, I think, in many cases, executed practices that are not sustainable. And I think we've talked about that for a long time. And I think as we -- as I once said in my opening comments, to really resonate I hope with the investment community, to say to really step back and take a look at companies who have -- are making most of the products they sell, integrated a true global supply chain, meaning we control our own destiny, versus companies that are doing nothing but end license products for all of their products or acquiring products, and after they acquire them, cutting all of the R&D, the people, everything associated with it. So what I really was trying to call out this morning is over the last decade of us investing in products, R&D and people, manufacturing, CapEx, over the years, I won't say that we didn't take our fair share of criticisms that we maybe were investing too much. Maybe we were investing too much capital on our manufacturing operations in Paragraph IVs, in injectables, in complex products. And I would stand here and hope that as we look back at the last 10 years of growth that we've achieved, and more importantly, the growth that we see going forward, we've put targets out there that continue to show a very robust growth platform. And we believe, as I said earlier, we're just getting started. The runway out there for us to add more products, more dosage forms, more therapeutic areas to truly leverage now the platform we have in place is just, again, going to accelerate that growth trajectory. Thank you."

I think even to their most recent commentary, they've really taken that off the table to, at the earliest, the end of the year, if not 2017. So we continue, as Tony mentioned in his commentary, continue to be very excited on EpiPen. We've continued to invest in that product to continue to educate, build awareness. And I think if you just look at the amount of -- if you look at just our school program and the amount of EpiPens that we've been able to distribute to the public school system and the amount of lives that had been saved due to it, I mean, so we believe the investment has been well worthwhile and that the community continues to resonate to the education and awareness, and as we've said, there's over 20 million lives at risk.

There are needs to have a global partner that can truly marry up an effective and efficient supply chain cost of goods, the breadth of portfolio, while not losing sight of investing in the complex products like a generic Advair bring into the market. So I believe that there will be a continued consolidation around the globe, and we absolutely plan to continue to participate. What we've said is that given the platform, both operational and commercial platform that we've built today, that it's easy to now complement it with bolt-ons that allow us to continue to grow critical mass, just like we're doing with over-the-counter business.

But is the price erosion you're seeing or product mix a bigger factor in the gross margin development, particularly as we look on a year-on-year basis? And then as we're in this environment where the customer picture has changed, how do you feel about the visibility on results for the rest of the year, given we are seeing an increase in -- and approvals out of FDA, which could mean new competition on some of your existing products over the course of the year, how much does that affect your planning assumptions for what the base portfolio is going to provide?"

Look, I think there's been significant confusion, both with the investment community and Washington when it comes between generics and specialty products. I think that as we look at some of the hearings that have taken place, at some of the dynamics and some of the discussions have all been around specialty product or one-player product. So when you step back and look at the Generics portfolio, the generic industry today represents 88% of the volume of all drugs dispensed in the United States. We've saved over $1.5 trillion over the last 10 years for the U.S. health care system. And we today represent 28% of the pharmaceutical spend, which is only 10% of our health care spend. So when you really drill down to generics have continued to be the backbone of the system. We have continued to have products that continue to face competition, and that's why we said mid to single digits has been our price expectation. It's been that way for the last several years. It's been very stable. And as we came into this year, we said we'd see that remaining the same, that stability around pricing, but not for everybody. And this is again why I think we're trying to do the best we can to help everyone understand and distinguish between companies. Companies who are focused on very small niche areas, focused on practices that are not sustainable, practices that they now have to take out of their future guidance, which is showing no growth for certain companies have no bearing on a Mylan and the platform that we've built, with having hundreds of products here in the United States, continuing to launch many, many new products, both that are high barrier to entry and have -- afford the opportunity to continue to have whether it's higher gross margin or complement our current platform is why we believe it's the right inflection point and why I truly believe the rebasing of this entire sector was needed to allow, I think, this refocus in the visibility around truly individual business models. I think the investment community did a pretty good job beginning to differentiate between brand pharmas, whose expertise was in what from an R&D perspective, from a manufacturing perspective. And I truly believe that when you apply that same lens to our industry, it's going to become much more clear about the companies who do have a sustainable long-term growth future ahead of them, and we believe Mylan leads that space. As far as our customers go, the consolidation and their needs completely marry up and inure to our benefit. Our global customers have global demands. The needs to be able to have high-quality, effective and efficient supply chain, have products where they need it when they need it, that time to market has never been more critical. And we again have got a global supply chain to meet those demands. I think our customers are recognizing it. And I think that it's about looking at our whole basket of products. So yes, the FDA is going to continue to approve products. Mylan's got one of the largest pipelines waiting for approval with the FDA. So we're looking forward to them hitting that backlog and getting products to the market. And again, we believe we'll get our disproportionate benefit because of the breadth of our current basket of business that we do with our customers today."

I think that it both from a vertical integration as well as just our manufacturing operating platform. So there's 2 aspects of that. Vertical integration means that we're producing our own API that goes into the finished dosage form and then manufacturing our finished dosage form. Or we're acquiring API from a third party, but still manufacturing our finished dosage form. And our -- the multitude of finished dosage forms that we now are capable of span by the dozens, so from oral solids to injectables to extended release to topicals. So we've continued to really invest and build out that capability. And so what we see, again, as being a differentiator, being -- controlling our own destiny through being able to manufacture, perhaps vertically integrate as well as our global supply chain, is what really gives that -- gives us that head start or that advantage from a cost of goods perspective and the efficiency around it. So just like we did with the Merck business, we were able to look at products that we could either consolidate that by, we could bring alternate manufacturing in-house and be able to really leverage again our platform today, even more so than 8 years ago, because our manufacturing footprint has expanded dramatically, tenfold since we did the Merck acquisition. So our ability to bring the Meda's line, which they do very, very little manufacturing, most of their products are end licensed, again, that's just another added benefit of Mylan and Meda joining forces to really be able to optimize the operational and commercial platform that we've put in place.

I'd also like to take a moment to welcome Ken Parks, who joined Mylan as CFO on June 6. And he's here today for his first earnings call with us. In addition, I'd like to welcome to the call all of our employees around the word, including the most recent addition to our family, the Great King we required in June 15 from Renaissance and on Friday, the terrific team at Meda. 
We're excited about both of these transactions. With the Renaissance business bringing us a complimentary portfolio of about 25 branded and generic topical products, which combined with Meda's offerings, positions us to be a leader in dermatology. 
The Meda transaction will allow us to build even greater scale across our operations and expand the breadth and diversity of our product portfolio, geographies and sales channels around the world. Meda also positions us to be a leader in the global respiratory and allergy market. In addition, these transactions further strengthen our already very strong cash flows.
As with any transaction, we believe people are the most important asset, and we're delighted with how engaged the teams of both organizations are as we now focus on fully integrating these organizations so that we can increasingly go-to-market as one Mylan and maximize the potential of our expanded global platform. 
With that, I'd like to elaborate a bit on the commentary I provided during our call in May, namely that we believe that the rebasing of our sector has been a healthy exercise for the industry. It has helped investors draw meaningful distinction among the different types of business model in our sector. Because as we have mentioned many times in the past, it simply makes no sense to paint the industry with a broad, one-size-fits-all brush, particularly when it comes to generics and specialty, which vary widely in terms of product and geography mix. In Mylan's case, we have spent the last decade differentiating, diversifying and derisking by expanding through organic growth and strategic acquisitions.
As a result, we now have extensive manufacturing operation to technologies range from API to oral solids, to injectables, transdermals and respiratory expertise. We have a portfolio that now stands at more than 2,700 separate products, including generics, branded generics, brands and over-the-counter medicine. 
We also have positioned ourselves such that we have no significant concentration in any single product, channel or business segment. Moreover, we have continued to grow scale throughout North America, Europe and Rest of World. All of this has enhanced our financial strength and flexibility, positioning us to continue investing and growing for many years to come. 
It's for these reasons we're so proud of our performance during second quarter. On the top line, we generated total revenues of more than $2.5 billion year-over-year, an increase of 8% on a constant currency basis that was fueled by solid growth in our North America and Europe generics regions and strong double-digit growth in our specialty business.
On the bottom line, we delivered adjusted net earnings of $592 million or $1.16 per adjusted diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 28%. I'd also like to underscore that on a sequential basis, our revenues rose by 17 [indiscernible], adjusted EPS increased by 52% and cash flows increased 240% on the strength across all geographies, all of our business units including new launches, demonstrating the power of us truly maximizing all of our assets. 
Consistent with our historic track record of delivering stronger growth in the second half and on the strength of new product launches, EpiPen seasonality and our recently completed acquisitions, we are committed to our 2016 EPS guidance range of $4.85 to $5.15. 
As I've indicated, we could not be more excited about Mylan's longer-term prospects and look forward to discussing our bright future at our Investor Day event, which we will host in conjunction with third quarter earnings. 
In behalf of Mylan's Board and our entire leadership team, I'd like to thank our employees for their but outstanding teamwork and execution during the quarter and for their continued commitment to our cause. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rajiv."

We continue to see solid performance across our businesses during the second quarter, once again demonstrating that the scale and diversity we have created provides us with strength, consistency and resilience to ever evolving market conditions, further differentiating us from our competitors. 
We launched more than 100 new products across our global platform. And with Meda, we now sell approximately 2,700 products around the world. 
Overall, our Generics business is a third-party net sales of approximately $2.1 billion for the quarter, an increase of 4% compared to prior year quarter. In North America, our Generics business grew approximately 6% to just over $1 billion. Growth came primarily from a significant number of new product introductions leveraging our strong global platform. 
We launched 18 new products during this quarter. The generic pricing environment was again consistent with our expectations and guidance to you. Tony will elaborate on this topic shortly. 
In Europe, sales totaled $604 million, an increase of approximately 6% over the prior year period. This result was mainly due to sales of new products and higher volumes on existing products as we continue to benefit from integrated approach of selling our established products, assets under One Mylan. Pricing was essentially flat in the second quarter because of our diversified product portfolio.
In the rest the world, sales totaled $423 million, a year-over-year decrease of approximately 2%. Our operations in India improved throughout the quarter as we saw HIV tender volumes return towards our expected levels, resulting in growth of more than 30% on sequential basis compared to Q1, additionally, Japan, Australia and the rest of the emerging markets showed favorable sales on existing products. With that said, we continue to remain confident in the strength of these businesses. 
Our specialty dividend delivered revenue of $403 million in the quarter, a year-over-year increase of 33% as a result of higher sales of EpiPen, performance and Altiva. Tony will provide more details on this.
Our global platform has been further strengthen and diversified by the growth of our global established brand and branded generics business, as these key brands continued to perform at or above our expectations. These established brands and branded business will be even further enhanced by the addition of the Meda brands. 
Meda's attractive portfolio is just one of the reasons why I share Heather's excitement about the recent completion of the transaction. The addition of Meda strengthens our position in several franchises, significantly expands our over-the-counter business and accelerate our expansion in several attractive emerging markets, which will help us further maximize our efficient, high-quality operating performance and a broad product portfolio. 
During this quarter, we also completed our acquisition of Renaissance topical business. By bringing together the Renaissance business with Mylan's and Meda's strong dermatology portfolio, we are confident that we will be able to drive significant growth from this franchise, especially by taking the combined portfolio and pipeline into the new markets outside of North America. 
We are looking forward to now moving from pre integration planning to truly integrating these businesses into Mylan family. We are very excited as we will be moving into integration phase along with the key leaders retained from Meda and Renaissance leadership. While we remain focused on business continuity, we also are very excited and upbeat to realize the potential and value of bringing together the best of these organizations and our combined efforts. We also continue to execute our strategic growth drivers, and let me highlight a few of the moments during the quarter.
Turning first to our portfolio. We are pleased to report that we remain on track to file just to sum up, pegfilgrastim and Glargine to U.S. FDA and European medical agency in 2016. Our 24 weeks data from our heritage study for our biosimilar trastuzumab confirm the efficacy safety and immunogenicity of our product being developed in partnership with by Bioapharm. This study was presented at the as go meeting in June. And we are now expecting to present our results for the 48-week extension of the HERITAGE study at the important European Society for Medical Oncology Congress in October. 
Recently, European medicine agency has also accepted for review Mylan's marketing application for our proposed biosimilar factor pegfilgrastim, also being developed by Biocon. In addition to analytical, functional and pre clinical data, the application also includes clinical data from PK PD and confirmatory efficacy, safety and immunogenicity studies completed earlier this year. 
The results from the studies are also expected to be presented at a small in October. In addition to this, we continue to make progress on our other program and will continue to provide further updates as our filings are accepted. As a reminder, we embarked on Momenta collaboration, we have accept with combined portfolio of 15 biosimilar and ancillary analog generic products in the development. This is one offering that the industry's most global and diverse portfolio.
As we continue to invest in this important global area, we are continuing to differentiate the structure of our partnerships. For instance, with Momenta, we are archery dealer product optionality. On the rest Momenta respirator front, our partner, to have us biopharma announced that enrollment of more than 2,300 patients has been completed in the 3 ongoing clinical trials comprising companies program for every person and investigational pharma into voting for the treatment of COPD. The replicate studies are expected to be read out in early fourth quarter of this year to be followed by a 12-month long-term safety study and plan for an NDA filing in 2017.
Regarding generic Advair. We remain confident in our obligation as we continue to be actively engaged with everyday towards the execution of this very important ANDA. 
Finally, I also would like to take our commit ed and talented global workforce for their significant contributions to our business and mission during this quarter. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tony for some additional perspective on the commercial landscape."

As Rajiv noted, we continue to see strong growth in our global Generics business, including in the U.S. with the pricing environment continue to be a topic of much focus. Let me reiterate that we continue to see pricing across our very broad product portfolio to be line with our expectations, demonstrating the importance of scale and diversity. For example, during the first 6 months, both our global generics business and specifically, our North American core Generics business, saw year-over-year price erosion in the mid single-digits.
Given the continued strength of this core business, we continue to anticipate price erosion in the mid single-digit for the remainder of the year. Our North American generic business also benefited from a large number of new product launches, including the first to mark losses of modafinil, cycline 50-milligram and doxycycline 200 milligram, representing a combined IMS total market value of $660 million. 
Our specialty business also saw double-digit growth across all our major brands. With respect to EpiPen, revenues were driven by net price favorability due in part to payer pricing dynamics year-over-year, as well as strong sales volume in anticipation of the peak business. We begin realizing the benefit of customer contract negotiations over the last several quarters. I note that year-over-year comps will continue to evolve until we pass the 1-year mark of the recall. 
I want to stress that we continue to invest in expanding size the overall market by increasing awareness and access to this important product. We also continue to educate stakeholders about the complex supply chain dynamics as a greater share of cost are being shifted from employers to patients.
Finally, I would like to echo Heather and Rajiv's enthusiasm for the completion of the Meda transaction. Commercially, we see significant opportunities to maximize our robust product portfolio, which now covers an even more diverse array of Rx, GX and OTT products across customer channels and geographies. We see many opportunities to do more with these products across to the Mylan platform as we optimize our sales force, bring new products into new countries and maximize high potential brands.
We also continue to be uniquely positioned to reliably supply our growing global customers increasing demands. EpiPen is just one example of where we can do more by consolidating our expertise across Mylan and Meda. 
With that, we'll turn the call over to Ken."

Second quarter revenues grew to $2.6 billion, and that's an i",646,"Thanks, Tony, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start off by saying that I'm extremely pleased to be a part of this call and a part of the Mylan team. I'll now turn to our financial results. 
Second quarter revenues grew to $2.6 billion, and that's an increase of 8% over the second quarter last year. As Rajiv already noted, our Generics segment grew 4% and our specialty segment grew 33%.
The generics pricing environment was consistent with our expectations and decline at a mid single-digit rate overall in the quarter. While foreign currency movements were volatility following the outcome of the Brexit vote in late June, the year-over-year impact to currency translation on our second quarter result revenues was insignificant due to the diversity of our portfolio of businesses across all geographies. As Heather noted, second quarter revenues increased 17% sequentially with growth in both of our segments and all 3 geographies.
adjusted gross margins for the second quarter were 56%, that's up approximately 200 basis points from the prior year and the prior quarter as a result of the new product introductions and favorable specialty sales.
Moving on to operating expenses on an adjusted basis, R&D expense increased slightly over the prior year as we continue to invest in our respiratory, insulin and biologics programs. As a percentage of revenues, second quarter R&D declined by approximately 50 basis points from the prior year to 6.6% of total revenues. 
SG&A expense also won an adjusted basis remains essentially unchanged at approximately 21% of total revenues in the second quarter. As a result of our strong operating performance, adjusted net earnings increased by $118 million from the prior year quarter to reach $592 million and adjusted diluted EPS increased 28% to $1.16 compared to $0.91 in the prior year. I'll also point out that adjusted diluted EPS grew 52% sequentially from the first quarter of this year.
For the 6 months ended June 30, total revenues grew to $4.8 billion. That's a year-over-year increase of 13% on a constant currency basis and includes an additional 2 months of sales from our established products business. 
Adjusted gross margins for the 6 months ended June 30 were 55% or up approximately 100 basis points from the prior year period. Adjusted R&D and adjusted SG&A expense were approximately 7.5% and 22% of total revenues, respectively, for the year-to-date period. As a result, adjusted earnings for the 6 months ended June 30 increased by $195 million to reach $979 million and adjusted diluted EPS therefore increased 19% to $1.92.
Turning to our cash flow and liquidity metrics. Adjusted cash provided by operating activities was strong at $485 million for the quarter, which drove the first half adjusted operating cash flow to reach $687 million. The strong performance in the quarter reflects improvements in our operating results combined with our continued focus on effectively managing working capital.
During the second quarter of 2016, we issued $6.5 billion of senior notes in anticipation of the completion of the Meda offer and repaid $500 million of senior notes, which became due in June 2016. We have no amounts outstanding on our accounts receivables securitization or our revolving credit facilities. At the end of Q2, our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 2.2x.
We remain fully committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating and reducing our leverage subsequent to the closing of the Meda transaction. 
Looking ahead, we feel confident with our ability to continue to leverage our outstanding global operating platform, which now includes the recent acquisitions of both Renaissance and Meda. And we are committed to our 2016 outlook of adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $4.85 to $5.15. In terms of phasing of our earnings for the remainder of 2016. Q3 will again be our strongest quarter and slightly higher than Q4. 
With that, we'll open the call up to your questions."

First, on the U.S. generic environment, and thanks for the color on the call. Is there any concern on your part that some the weakness that you're so model competitors are expressing results in more aggressive in less rational behavior from those companies in that could ultimately impact our franchise if the market gets a little bit destabilize by that dynamic? The second question is between the very strong EpiPen trends you're seeing right now and the earlier expected Meda close. It seems like there could be upside to the guidance range. Is there any offsets we should be thinking about? Or are you just being either cautious or conservative now in terms of the range?"

So I'll start on the U.S. generics and then I'll turn over to Rajiv if he want to add anything. I guess, from my perspective, as we've continued the dialogue around the diversifying and the differentiation in product mix and the breadth of portfolio, certainly, as you look at some the smaller players, I think we can assess that from the niche product, as well as perhaps, how they were playing their business and positioning it. 
And I think that the other thing you has to take into consideration is balancing that to your point about does this drive more rationality, is our customers that are continuing to get more global and their demands and needs are getting far greater. And I know Tony touched on this in his remarks. But I really think that shouldn't be underestimated. The need for a reliable supply is continuing to, I think, again, be a differentiator for Mylan and our ability to meet these global needs in a very reliable. 
We've touted before through sheer hard work that last decade is a supply chain that we. It's second to none. And I think you see some value, continued value being placed on that by our customers. So I can't speak, as we've always said. Our business is going to be competitive. It always has and it always will be. But I don't sense I would say that hyper competitiveness that we've seen say 5 years ago when our customers were much more willing to change just based on price and not necessarily be focused on that company but actually supply their needs. So I think it continues to shift towards being a, not only a differentiator for us, but a real value driver in growth driver for us, which is why you have the confidence around the stability in the market. 
As far as EpiPen goes, Chris, here's what I'd say you heard me say about this a thousand times. All good things don't happen at once. All bad things don't happen at once. When you're looking at the complexity of our company, globally across geographies, across channels, across products, we believe that when we came out with our guidance this year, we anticipated obviously the Meda transaction. We anticipated a lot of probability waiting on launches and so forth. And with all that being said, I think when you look at our guidance range be within a 3% each way the mid-point that we believe that's a very tight range and we believe it's taking a lot in consideration. And we've always said when we feel that, that we should update or remove that guidance you know where the first to come and do that for the market. But the believe right know that it is absolutely taking a lot into consideration given all the moving pieces across our platform."

And what are you currently doing in terms of your business operations to try to help us -- the patients that's a lot. But that is, some confidence that, that issue will not begin to impact your earnings in the next few quarters. And then the second I guess to Rajiv. On Advair, I remember the GPhA people presenting from of they mention of that only 12% of and applications gets approved first round. I know Ad is very important to you, but you can just give us a feel for what makes you confident that you can get such a complex product approved first round, given the rate of approved at FDA at the first round."

So Ronny, I love the opportunity to clarify this point around insurance and the changing dynamic and the payer landscape. It really is not -- the point is not being made from our earnings perspective or what we see with EpiPen. I will continue to say that we couldn't be more proud of our investment to expand and increase access and continue to see EpiPen as an important product to the community. And as again, Tony mentioned, our opportunity to even enhance of that throughout Europe now with the Meda transaction. But this point, I think, there's been a lot of discussion and some headlines around patients going from paying a copay to now paying the entire cost of a product. 
And where EpiPen falls because if you look on an annual basis as a life-saving drug to have a W ACC price of just under $600, I think that you can see it falls. It's not an extensive product. And so employers through high deductible plans were incentivized to increase high deductible plans for Obama Care. As people, as employee, employer shift more cost employees and makes that everything product, but bucket before you hit your deductible is where you're seeing a lot of noise around EpiPen. So from our perspective, where continue to trying to do on the part on educating of that supply chain and we all know its complex and our health care and insurance is complicated. But we are just continue try to do our part messaging and continue to do everything we can to ensure patients have access to our products. And so that really is a point on the insurance, not at all, from what we are projecting from a business perspective around EpiPen."

I think you have $1 billion or so authorized for share buyback. And when you announced the Meda deal earlier this year, you had to suspend the buyback because of the pending deal. And now that the deal is closed, and if you still believe in your 6 seller number next year, the stock does look pretty cheap. What is -- should we expect that you implement step buyback? And secondly, just a question around the IPR process, which we will hear about in the next couple of weeks. You guys filled on Copaxone 20 on the market. Just wondering if you can kind of share with us your expectations for what the market opportunity might look like for you for Copaxone 40? When you plan to launch? And without Copaxone 20 on the market, what does that say about your confidence level with Copaxone 40?"

And absolutely, the share buyback is an option as how we are being part the mix. So we absolutely sit back on the table as an option of that we have just as we're looking at many other ways. I can tell you though our priority is really to delever. It is about really making sure we're balancing all of that. 
But I -- it's absolutely back on the table as an option. And as far as the fixed dollars, I guess I just want to because sometimes you guys saw these little flippers in there. What we've committed to is $6 in '18. What do said since announcing the Meda transaction is we have the opportunity to hit that earlier. But what we are absolutely committed to is the $6 in '18.
And as far as ITR, I mean, I'll speak to the confidence and then, Rajiv, anything you want to add on the -- on the market opportunity? We couldn't be more confident in the IPR, the process and where we stand in that, and are anxiously awaiting the results of that next week. And I would just remind on our confidence to get the product approved. 
Look, the reality is that the transformation that FDA has gone through and is going through these last couple of years with GDUFA, there have been casualties to that. There's been casualties in the backlog and how they're being able to handle them as they move towards GDUFA goal dates. And obviously, co-packs and though prior to getting a GDUFA goal date like our generic Ad there. So all I can say is speaking on the science and speaking to our application, on both the 20 and 40, that we absolutely have all the confidence in the world of getting it. But as you know, I said, I will love the fact would were it not talking when we're going Copaxone approval."

So let me start with the rebasing because I do feel passionately about the rebates industry for as long as I've been. Look, I'm hopeful that the rebasing continue, but this is not memory loss in about a month and hot air starts floating back up again. Because I think that what we found ourselves in the generic specialty sector is and sustainable business practices. And I think that it just comes. It's just that simple. And I think individual companies are now having, however, much it affected they may have been by unsustainable business practice, they're having to re-group, we organize, rebates in themselves. My hope is that as I mentioned, that has driven, I think, forcing a much more thoughtful look at businesses in understanding the mix because all companies aren't created equally. And like I said, I'm hopeful that will be doesn't see her short-term memory loss and goes back to trying to paint all with one or trying to support what I don't believe is sustainable long term. So we believe there's been a lot of short-term focus. We have said you can't build a great company quarter-over-quarter. It's over the longer term. The last decade, we have continued to hopefully, show that, that has pays off in both the near, mid and long-term. And we look forward to coming back out to you guys an Investor Day and showing you how once that the ability for us now to take this significant financial flexibility, we have and continue to build and complement this platform we put in place, which will, to your point, continue to consolidate, I think those assets are the company's need to let go of products and small like tuck-ins, like we just did with Renaissance. And as far as OTC, I have to ask you to wait for Q3. Because I think we really want to come out in the holistic way talk about our geographies, these channels and how truly we believe approaching these markets with the One Mylan approach. We're going to be able to do more. So anyway, look forward to that."

Thank you, Andrew. So I'll start with integration. Look, hopefully by now, the fact of our business continuity and our track record would let you realize the fact that we're not only very focused on integration, but has a very disciplined approach. That it's not just about bringing company into the fold, it is truly about integrating businesses, people, best practices. And so as we are now doing that over these acquisitions, most recently Meda, we absolutely, I can assure you, have multiple work streams as we had reported last quarter actually, our preplanning phase of that allows us to hit that ground running once we hit Day 1. And I can tell you, I'm confident that when we do lay out those plans and those opportunities, they're very robust, they cut across all geographies. So we are not prioritizing one over the other. I mean, the benefit of having great people and bringing their management team into the fold of our management team, we're able to really divide and conquer across the globe, across channels and across these great brands and especially this new channel of OTC. So we couldn't look more forward to coming and highlighting all of that. And I guess, I don't give much more of a teaser than that for Investor Day. As far as guidance is concerned, look, I -- we've got -- when you look at the complexity of not only our business in general in the generics business, both here in the U.S. but around the globe, that's why us we've continued to grow specialty, grow brand generics, grow our brand, grow OTC, it is just for that reason of complexity and volatility that we've said the diversification and differentiation let's us observed that now. Our scale, our sheer size and scale, is able to observe that volatility and manage this business. And hopefully, when I look -- and that's why, I said it couldn't be more proud of Q2 that we were able to be right on top of revenue, beats our -- the EPS consensus and all sequentially because I know many of you that I've had discussions with after the last quarter, everybody felt that we were taking such a big leap you want [indiscernible] that if you could show that this business could perform of what we said that is going to that certainly would certainly pave the way for the kind of growth. And hopefully, market multiple that should respond to that accordingly. So that's why I highlighted the sequential growth of not only top line top line 17%, bottom line, 52% and the strength of our cash flows. So like I said, I think that hopefully, year realizing our guidance takes a lot into consideration and our ability to manage that and perform and deliver. Again, this quarter, is just underscores this management team's ability to do that."

I believe that EpiPen will be a very, very important product for a very long time. But that being said, I think, as I said earlier in my remarks, we don't have significant concentration from any one product or business segment at Mylan today. And as we continue to grow, just as the we're bringing Meda into the fold, EpiPen, from a true dollar contribution, will just continue to shrink. So again, there's no overreliance on EpiPen as a brand. But I can tell you that there is every bit of focus on the role EpiPen place in the lives and saving lives and then getting to as many patients as we possibly can.

I'd also like to take a moment to welcome Ken Parks, who joined Mylan as CFO on June 6. And he's here today for his first earnings call with us. In addition, I'd like to welcome to the call all of our employees around the word, including the most recent addition to our family, the great team we required in June 15 from Renaissance and on Friday, the terrific team at Meda. 
We're excited about both of these transactions. With the Renaissance business bringing us a complementary portfolio of about 25 branded and generic topical products, which combined with Meda's offerings, positions us to be a leader in dermatology. The Meda transaction will allow us to build even greater scale across our operations and expand the breadth and diversity of our product portfolio, geographies and sales channels around the world. Meda also positions us to be a leader in the global respiratory and allergy market. In addition, these transactions further strengthen our already very strong cash flows.
As with any transaction, we believe people are the most important asset and we're delighted with how engaged the teams of both organizations are as we now focus on fully integrating these organizations so that we can increasingly go to market as One Mylan and maximize the potential of our expanded global platform. 
With that, I'd like to elaborate a bit on the commentary I provided during our call in May, namely that we believe that the rebasing of our sector has been a healthy exercise for the industry. It has helped investors more draw meaningful distinction among the different types of business models in our sector. Because as we have mentioned many times in the past, it simply makes no sense to paint the industry with a broad, one-size-fits-all brush, particularly when it comes to generics and specialty, which vary widely in terms of product and geography mix. 
In Mylan's case, we have spent the last decade differentiating, diversifying and derisking by expanding through organic growth and strategic acquisitions. As a result, we now have extensive manufacturing operation whose technologies range from API to oral solids, to injectables, transdermals and respiratory expertise. We have a portfolio that now stands at more than 2,700 separate products, including generics, branded generics, brands and over-the-counter medicine. 
We also have positioned ourselves such that we have no significant concentration in any single product, channel or business segment. Moreover, we have continued to grow scale throughout North America, Europe and Rest of World. All of this has enhanced our financial strength and flexibility, positioning us to continue investing and growing for many years to come. 
It's for these reasons we're so proud of our performance during second quarter. On the top line, we generated total revenues of more than $2.5 billion year-over-year, an increase of 8% on a constant currency basis that was fueled by solid growth in our North America and Europe generics  and strong double-digit growth on our Specialty business. On the bottom line, we delivered adjusted net earnings of $592 million or $1.16 per adjusted diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 28%. 
I'd also like to underscore that on a sequential basis, our revenues rose by 17%, adjusted EPS increased by 52% and cash flows increased 240% on the strength across all geographies, all of our business units including new launches, demonstrating the power of us truly maximizing all of our assets.  Consistent with our historic track record of delivering stronger growth in the second half and on the strength of new product launches, EpiPen seasonality and our recently completed acquisitions, we are committed to our 2016 EPS guidance range of $4.85 to $5.15. 
As I've indicated, we could not be more excited about Mylan's longer-term prospects and look forward to discussing our bright future at our Investor Day event, which we will host in conjunction with third quarter earnings. On behalf of Mylan's board and our entire leadership team, I'd like to thank our employees for their outstanding teamwork and execution during the quarter and for their continued commitment to our cause. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rajiv."

We continue to see solid performance across our businesses during the second quarter, once again demonstrating that the scale and diversity we have created provides us with strength, consistency and resilience to ever evolving market conditions, further differentiating us from our competitors. We launched more than 100 new products across our global platform. And with Meda, we now sell approximately 2,700 products around the world. 
Overall, our Generics business delivered third-party net sales of approximately $2.1 billion for the quarter, an increase of 4% compared to prior year quarter. In North America, our Generics business grew approximately 6% to just over $1 billion. Growth came primarily from a significant number of new product introductions leveraging our strong global platform. We launched 18 new products during this quarter. The generic pricing environment was again consistent with our expectations and guidance to you. Tony will elaborate on this topic shortly. 
In Europe, sales totaled $604 million, an increase of approximately 6% over the prior year period. This result was mainly due to sales of new products and higher volumes on existing products as we continue to benefit from integrated approach of selling our established products, assets under One Mylan. Pricing was essentially flat in the second quarter because of our diversified product portfolio.
In the Rest of the World, sales totaled $423 million, a year-over-year decrease of approximately 2%. Our operations in India improved throughout the quarter as we saw HIV tender volumes return towards our expected levels, resulting in growth of more than 30% on sequential basis compared to Q1. Additionally, Japan, Australia and the rest of the emerging markets showed favorable sales on existing products. 
With that said, we continue to remain confident in the strength of these businesses. Our specialty dividend delivered revenue of $403 million in the quarter, a year-over-year increase of 33% as a result of higher sales of EpiPen, Performist and Ultiva. Tony will provide more details on this.
Our global platform has been further strengthened and diversified by the growth of our global established brands and branded generics business, as these key brands continue to perform at or above our expectations. These established brands and branded business will be even further enhanced by the addition of the Meda brands. 
Meda's attractive portfolio is just one of the reasons why I share Heather's excitement about the recent completion of the transaction. The addition of Meda strengthens our position in several [indiscernible] franchises, significantly expands our over-the-counter business and accelerate our expansion in several attractive emerging markets, which will help us further maximize our efficient, high-quality operating platform and a broad product portfolio. 
During this quarter, we also completed our acquisition of Renaissance topicals business. By bringing together the Renaissance business with Mylan's and Meda's strong dermatology portfolio, we are confident that we will be able to drive significant growth from this franchise, especially by taking the combined portfolio and pipeline into the new markets outside of North America. 
We are looking forward to now moving from pre-integration planning to truly integrating these businesses into Mylan family. We are very excited as we will be moving into integration phase along with the key leaders retained from Meda and Renaissance leadership. While we remain focused on business continuity, we also are very excited and upbeat to realize the potential and value of bringing together the best of these organizations and our combined efforts. We also continue to execute our strategic growth drivers, and let me highlight a few of the developments during the quarter.
Turning first to our biosimilars portfolio. We are pleased to report that we remain on track to file trastuzumab, pegfilgrastim and Glargine to U.S. FDA and European Medical Agency (sic) [European Medicines Agency] in 2016. Our 24 weeks data from our heritage study for our biosimilar trastuzumab confirm the efficacy safety and immunogenicity of our product being developed in partnership with by Biocon. This study was presented at the ASCO meeting in June. And we are now expecting to present our results for the 48-week extension of the HERITAGE study at the important European Society for Medical Oncology Congress in October. 
Recently, European Medicines Agency has also accepted for review Mylan's marketing authorization application for our proposed biosimilar pegfilgrastim, also being developed with Biocon. In addition to analytical, functional and preclinical data, the application also includes clinical data from pivotal  PK/PD and confirmatory efficacy, safety and immunogenicity studies completed earlier this year. The results from the studies are also expected to be presented at ESMO in October. 
In addition to this, we continue to make progress on our other programs and will continue to provide further updates as our filings are accepted. As a reminder, with our Biocon partnership and Momenta collaboration, we have accept with a combined portfolio of 15 biosimilar and insulin analog generic products in the development. This is one of the industry's most robust and diverse portfolios.
As we continue to invest in this important global area, we are continuing to differentiate the structure of our partnerships. For instance, with Momenta, we have a great deal of product by product optionality. On the respiratory front, our partner, Theravance Biopharma, announced that enrollment of more than 2,300 patients has been completed in the 3 ongoing clinical trials comprising the company's Phase III program for revefenacin and investigational pharma LAMA in development for the treatment of COPD. The replicate efficacy studies are expected to be read out in early fourth quarter of this year to be followed by a 12-month long-term safety study and plan for an NDA filing in 2017.
Regarding generic Advair. We remain confident in our application as we continue to be actively engaged with FDA towards the execution of this very important ANDA. Finally, I also would like to thank our committed and talented global workforce for their significant contributions to our business and mission during this quarter. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tony for some additional perspective on the commercial landscape."
290203,372496078,1032094,"Mylan N.V., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2016",2016-08-09,"Earnings Calls","Viatris Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rajiv.

As Rajiv noted, we continue to see strong growth in our global Generics business, including in the U.S. where the pricing environment continues to be a topic of much focus. Let me reiterate that we continue to see pricing across our very broad product portfolio to be in line with our expectations, demonstrating the importance of scale and diversity. 
For example, during the first 6 months, both our global Generics business and specifically our North American core Generics business, saw year-over-year price erosion in the mid-single digits. Given the continued strength of this core business, we continue to anticipate price erosion in the mid-single digit for the remainder of the year. 
Our North American Generic business also benefited from a large number of new product launches, including the first-to-market launches of our Modafinil, Doxycycline 50 milligram and doxycycline 200 milligram, representing a combined IMS total market value of $650 million. Our Specialty business also saw double-digit growth across all our major brands. 
With respect to EpiPen, revenues were driven by net price favorability due in part to payer pricing dynamics year-over-year, as well as strong sales volume in anticipation of the peak season. We began realizing the benefit of customer contract negotiations over the last several quarters. I note that year-over-year comps will continue to evolve until we pass the 1-year mark of the Auvi-Q recall. 
I want to stress that we continue to invest in expanding the size of the overall market by increasing awareness and access to this important product. We also continue to educate stakeholders about the complex supply chain dynamics as a greater share of cost are being shifted from employers to patients.
Finally, I would like to echo Heather and Rajiv's enthusiasm for the completion of the Meda transaction. Commercially, we see significant opportunities to maximize our robust product portfolio, which now covers an even more diverse array of Rx, Gx and OTT products across customer channels and geographies. We see many opportunities to do more with these products across the Mylan platform as we optimize our sales force, bring new products into new countries and maximize high potential brands.
We also continue to be uniquely positioned to reliably supply our growing global customers' increasing demands. EpiPen is just one example of where we can do more by consolidating our expertise across Mylan and Meda. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Ken."

I'll start out by saying that I'm extremely pleased to be a part of this call and a part of the Mylan team. I'll now turn to our financial results.

I'll start out by saying that I'm extremely pleased to be a part of this call and a part of the Mylan team. I'll now turn to our financial results. 
Second quarter revenues grew to $2.6 billion, and that's an increase of 8% over the second quarter last year. As Rajiv already noted, our Generics segment grew 4% and our Specialty segment grew 33%. The generics pricing environment was consistent with our expectations and decline at a mid-single-digit rate overall in the quarter. 
While foreign currency movements were volatility following the outcome of the Brexit vote in late June, the year-over-year impact to currency translation on our second quarter result revenues was insignificant due to the diversity of our portfolio of businesses across all geographies. 
As Heather noted, second quarter revenues increased 17% sequentially with growth in both of our segments and all 3 geographies. Adjusted gross margins for the second quarter were 56%, that's up approximately 200 basis points from the prior year and the prior quarter as a result of the new product introductions and favorable specialty sales.
Moving on to operating expenses. On an adjusted basis, R&D expense increased slightly over the prior year as we continue to invest in our respiratory, insulin and biologics programs. As a percentage of revenues, second quarter R&D declined by approximately 50 basis points from the prior year to 6.6% of total revenues. 
SG&A expense, also on an adjusted basis, remains essentially unchanged at approximately 21% of total revenues in the second quarter. As a result of our strong operating performance, adjusted net earnings increased by $118 million from the prior year quarter to reach $592 million and adjusted diluted EPS increased 28% to $1.16 compared to $0.91 in the prior year. I will also point out that adjusted diluted EPS grew 52% sequentially from the first quarter of this year.
For the 6 months ended June 30, total revenues grew to $4.8 billion. That's a year-over-year increase of 13% on a constant currency basis and includes an additional 2 months of sales from our established products business. 
Adjusted gross margins for the 6 months ended June 30 were 55% or up approximately 100 basis points from the prior year period. Adjusted R&D and adjusted SG&A expense were approximately 7.5% and 22% of total revenues, respectively, for the year-to-date period. As a result, adjusted earnings for the 6 months ended June 30 increased by $195 million to reach $979 million and adjusted diluted EPS therefore increased 19% to $1.92.
Turning to our cash flow and liquidity metrics. Adjusted cash provided by operating activities was strong at $485 million for the quarter, which drove the first half adjusted operating cash flow to reach $687 million. The strong performance in the quarter reflects improvements in our operating results combined with our continued focus on effectively managing working capital.
During the second quarter of 2016, we issued $6.5 billion of senior notes in anticipation of the completion of the Meda offer and repaid $500 million of senior notes, which became due in June 2016. We have no amounts outstanding on our accounts receivables securitization or our revolving credit facilities. At the end of Q2, our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 2.2x. We remain fully committed to maintaining our investment grade rating and reducing our leverage subsequent to the closing of the Meda transaction. 
Looking ahead, we feel confident with our ability to continue to leverage our outstanding global operating platform, which now includes the recent acquisitions of both Renaissance and Meda. And we're committed to our 2016 outlook of adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $4.85 to $5.15. In terms of phasing of our earnings for the remainder of 2016, Q3 will again be our strongest quarter and slightly higher than Q4. 
With that, we'll open the call up to your questions."

First, on the U.S. generic environment -- and thanks for all the color on the call. Is there any concern on your part that some the weakness that your smaller competitors are experiencing results in more aggressive and less rational behavior from those companies and that could ultimately impact your franchise if the market gets a little bit destabilize by that dynamic? The second question is between the very strong EpiPen trends you're seeing right now and the earlier expected Meda close. It seems like there could be upside to the guidance range. Is there any offsets we should be thinking about? Or are you just being neither cautious or conservative now in terms of the range?"

So I'll start on the U.S. generics and then if Tony and Rajiv want to add anything. I guess from my perspective, as we've continued the dialogue around the diversifying and the differentiation in product mix and the breadth of portfolio, certainly, as you look at some of the smaller players, I think weaknesses from the niche products, as well as perhaps how they were playing their business and positioning it. And I think that the other thing you have to take into consideration is balancing that to your point about does it drive more irrationality, is our customers that are continuing to get more global and their demands and needs are getting far greater. And I know Tony touched on this in his remarks, but I really think that shouldn't be underestimated. The need for a reliable supply is continuing to, I think, again, be a differentiator for Mylan and our ability to meet these global needs and are very reliable. As We've touted before, through sheer hard work that has been put together this last decade, is the supply chain that we believe is second to none. And I think you see some value, continued value being placed on that by our customers. So I can't speak -- as we've always said, our business is going to be competitive. It always has and it always will be. But I don't sense I would say that hyper competitiveness that we've seen, say, 5 years ago when our customers were much more willing to change just based on price and not necessarily be focused on if that company could actually supply their needs. So I think it continues to shift towards being a, not only a differentiator for us, but a real value driver and growth driver for us, which is why you have the confidence around the stability in the market. As far as EpiPen goes, Chris, here's what I'd say, you've heard me say this a thousand times. All good things don't happen at once. All bad things don't happen at once. When you're looking at the complexity of our company, globally, across geographies, across channels, across products, we believe that when we came out with our guidance this year, we anticipated, obviously, the Meda transaction. We anticipated a lot of probability waiting on launches and so forth. And with all that being said, I think when you look at our guidance range is being within a 3% each way of the midpoint, that we believe that's a very tight range and we believe it's taking a lot in consideration. And we've always said when we feel that, that we should update or move that guidance, you know we're the first to come and do that to the market. But we believe, right know, that it is absolutely taking a lot into consideration given all the moving pieces across our platform."

On Advair, I remember the GPhA, the people presenting from FDA mentioned that only 12% of end applications gets approved first round. I know Advair is very important to you, but you can just give us a feel for what makes you confident that you can get such a complex product approved first round, given the rate of approved at FDA at first round."

I will continue to say that we couldn't be more proud of our investment to expand and increase access and continue to see EpiPen as an important product to the community. And as again, Tony mentioned, our opportunity to even enhance that throughout Europe now, with the Meda transaction. But this point, I think, there's been a lot of discussion and some headlines around patients going from paying a co-pay to now paying the entire cost of a product. And where EpiPen falls because if you look on an annual basis as a life-saving drug to have a WACC price just under $600, I think that you can see it falls as not an expensive product. And so when employers through high deductible plans were incentivized to increase high deductible plans for Obamacare. As people, as employee, employers shift more cost employees and makes that everything to try to come out of pocket before you hit your deductible is where you're seeing a lot of noise around EpiPen. And so from our perspective, we're continuing to try to do our part on educating on that supply chain, and we all know its complex and our health care and insurance is complicated. But we are just continuing to try to do our part of messaging and continuing to do everything we can to ensure patients have access to our products. And so that really is the point on the insurance, not at all, from what we're projecting from a business perspective around EpiPen."

And secondly, just a question around the IPR process, which we will hear about in the next couple of weeks. You guys still don't have Copaxone 20 on the market. Just wondering if you can kind of share with us your expectations for what the market opportunity might look like for you for Copaxone 40? When you plan to launch?

It is about really making sure we're balancing all of that, but it's absolutely back on the table as an option. And as far as the $6, I guess, I just want to because sometimes you guys said you've got those slippers in there. What we've committed to is $6 in '18. What we've said, since announcing the Meda transaction, is we have the opportunity to hit that earlier, but what we are absolutely committed to is the $6 in '18. And as far as IPR, I mean, I'll speak to the confidence and then, Rajiv, anything you want to add on the, or so any on the market opportunity? We couldn't be more confident here in the IPR, the process and where we stand in that, and are anxiously awaiting the results of that next week. And I would just remind on our confidence to get the product approved. Look, the reality is that the transformation that FDA has gone through and is going through of these last couple of years with GDUFA, there have been casualties to that. And there's been casualties in the backlog and how they're being able to handle them as they move towards GDUFA goal date and then obviously, Copaxone sell prior to getting a GDUFA goal date like our generic Advair. So all I can say is speaking on the science and speaking to our application, on both the 20 and 40 that we absolutely have all the confidence in the world of getting it. But as you know, I've said, I'll love the fact from what we're not talking about when we're going to get Copaxone approval."

And what Tony spoke about is that our realizing these renegotiated contracts, which we've now said, starting at the end of last year that those wouldn't happen overnight. But as we've continued to renegotiate and as we've said, it's not just about one product. It's a whole portfolio of products. We've been able to continue to see that increase.

So let me start with the rebasing because I do feel passionately about this be in this industry for as long as I've been. Look, I'm hopeful that the rebasing continues, but this is not memory loss in about a month and hot air starts building back up again. Because I think that what we found ourselves in the generic specialty sector is unsustainable business practices. And I think that it just comes. It's just that simple. And I think individual companies are now having to, however, much affected they may have been by an unsustainable business practice, they're having to re-group, reorganize, rebase themselves. My hope is that as I mentioned that, that has driven, I think, forcing a much more thoughtful look at businesses and understanding the mix because all companies aren't created equally. And like I said, I'm hopeful that Wall Street doesn't have short-term memory loss and goes back to trying to paint all with one or trying to support what I don't believe is sustainable long term. So we believe there's been a lot of short-term focus. We have said you can't build a great company quarter-by-quarter. It's over the longer term. The last decade, we have continued to hopefully, show that, that has paid off in both the near, mid and long term. And we look forward to coming back out to you guys on Investor Day and showing you how once that the ability for us, now to take this significant financial flexibility, we have and continue to build and complement this platform we put in place, which will, to your point, continue to consolidate, I think those assets the company's need to let go of products and small nice tuck-ins, like we just did with Renaissance. And as far as OTC, I have to ask you to wait for Q3. Because I think we really want to come out in the holistic way, talk about our geographies, these channels and how truly we believe approaching these markets with the One Mylan approach.

Thank you, Andrew. So I'll start with integration. Look, hopefully by now, the fact of our business continuity and our track record would let you realize the fact that we're not only very focused on integration, but have a very disciplined approach. But it's not just about bringing company into the fold, it is truly about integrating businesses, people, best practices. And so as we are now doing that over these acquisitions, most recently Meda, we absolutely, I can assure you, have multiple work streams as we had reported last quarter, actually, our preplanning phase of that allows us to hit that ground running once we hit Day 1. And I can tell you, I'm confident that when we do lay out those plans and those opportunities, they're very robust, they cut across all geographies. So we're not prioritizing one over the other. I mean, the benefit of having great people and bringing their management team into the fold of our management team, we're able to really divide and conquer across the globe, across channels and across these great brands and especially this new channel of OTC. So we couldn't look more forward to coming and highlighting all of that. And I guess, I don't provide and give much more of a teaser than that for Investor Day. As far as guidance is concerned, look, I -- we've got -- when you look at the complexity of not only our business in general, in the generics business, both here in the U.S. but around the globe, that's why as we've continued to grow specialty, grow brand generics, grow our brand, grow OTC, it is just for that reason of complexity and volatility that we've said the diversification and differentiation lets us absorb that now. Our scale, our sheer size and scale, is able to absorb that volatility and manage this business. And hopefully, when I look -- and that's why, I said, I couldn't be more proud of Q2 that we were able to be right on top of revenue. It beats our -- the EPS consensus and all -- sequentially because I know many of you that I have discussions with after our last quarter, everybody felt that we were taking such a big leap from Q1 to Q2 that if we could show that this business could perform as what we said it was going to that certainly would pave the way for the kind of growth. And hopefully, a market multiple that should respond to that accordingly. So that's why I highlighted the sequential growth of not only top line, 17%, bottom line, 52% and the strength of our cash flows. So like I said, I think that hopefully, you're realizing our guidance takes a lot into consideration and our ability to manage that and perform and deliver. Again, I think this quarter, is just underscores this management team's ability to do that."

I believe that EpiPen will be a very, very important product for a very long time. With that being said, I think, as I said earlier in my remarks, we don't have significant concentration from any one product or business segment at Mylan today. And as we continue to grow, just as now we're bringing Meda into the fold, EpiPen, from a true dollar contribution, will just continue to shrink. So again, there's no overreliance on EpiPen as a brand. But I can tell you that there's every bit of focus on the role EpiPen plays in the lives and saving lives, and then getting to as many patients as we possibly can.

And as I said, when you look at that combined with now the Meda assets in turn that we're bringing on-board is really going to allow to be a leader in that space. We think the derm space is a nice niche space. It's one that we didn't have critical mass around before. And again, just like all of our other product lines, one, bringing that kind of critical mass and combined with the critical mass we have around all these other therapeutic franchises, we're again just able to leverage them and maximize them from our global customers to meaning the most to our patients. As far as biosimilars, I would challenge that no one's doubled down in this field any more than we have. I -- we now have access to up to 15 products on a global -- optimizing our global commercial platform. So we will continue, obviously, to invest very heavily. But I would suggest that we have more investment in this -- in biosimilars today, and certainly, as we look over the horizon from an R&D perspective.

I'd also like to take a moment to welcome Ken Parks, who joined Mylan as CFO on June 6. And he's here today for his first earnings call with us. In addition, I'd like to welcome to the call all of our employees around the word, including the most recent additions to our family, the great team we required in June 15 from Renaissance and on Friday, the terrific team at Meda. 
We're excited about both of these transactions. With the Renaissance business bringing us a complementary portfolio of about 25 branded and generic topical products, which combined with Meda's offerings, positions us to be a leader in dermatology. The Meda transaction will allow us to build even greater scale across our operations and expand the breadth and diversity of our product portfolio, geographies and sales channels around the world. Meda also positions us to be a leader in the global respiratory and allergy markets. In addition, these transactions further strengthen our already very strong cash flows.
As with any transaction, we believe people are the most important asset and we're delighted with how engaged the teams of both organizations are as we now focus on fully integrating these organizations so that we can increasingly go to market as One Mylan and maximize the potential of our expanded global platform. 
With that, I'd like to elaborate a bit on the commentary I provided during our call in May, namely that we believe that the rebasing of our sector has been a healthy exercise for the industry. It has helped investors draw more meaningful distinctions among the different types of business models in our sector. Because, as we have mentioned many times in the past, it simply makes no sense to paint the industry with a broad, one-size-fits-all brush, particularly when it comes to generics and specialty, which vary widely in terms of product and geography mix. 
In Mylan's case, we have spent the last decade differentiating, diversifying and derisking by expanding through organic growth and strategic acquisitions. As a result, we now have extensive manufacturing operations whose technologies range from API to oral solids, to injectables, transdermals and respiratory expertise. We have a portfolio that now stands at more than 2,700 separate products, including generics, branded generics, brands and over-the-counter medicines. 
We also have positioned ourselves such that we have no significant concentrations in any single product, channel or business segment. Moreover, we have continued to grow scale throughout North America, Europe and Rest of World. All of this has enhanced our financial strength and flexibility, positioning us to continue investing and growing for many years to come. 
It's for these reasons we're so proud of our performance during second quarter. On the top line, we generated total revenues of more than $2.5 billion year-over-year, an increase of 8% on a constant currency basis that was fueled by solid growth in our North America and Europe generics regions and strong double-digit growth in our Specialty business. On the bottom line, we delivered adjusted net earnings of $592 million for $1.16 per adjusted diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 28%. 
I'd also like to underscore that on a sequential basis, our revenues rose by 17%, adjusted EPS increased by 52% and cash flows increased 240% on the strength across all geographies, all of our business units including new launches, demonstrating the power of us truly maximizing all of our assets.  Consistent with our historic track record of delivering stronger growth in the second half and on the strength of new product launches, EpiPen seasonality and our recently completed acquisitions, we are committed to our 2016 EPS guidance range of $4.85 to $5.15. 
As I've indicated, we could not be more excited about Mylan's longer-term prospects and look forward to discussing our bright future at our Investor Day event, which we will host in conjunction with third quarter earnings. On behalf of Mylan's board and our entire leadership team, I'd like to thank our employees for their outstanding teamwork and execution during the quarter and for their continued commitment to our cause. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rajiv."

We continue to see solid performance across our businesses during the second quarter, once again demonstrating that the scale and diversity we have created provides us with strength, consistency and resilience to ever evolving market conditions, further differentiating us from our competitors. We launched more than 100 new products across our global platform. And with Meda, we now sell approximately 2,700 products around the world. 
Overall, our Generics business delivered third-party net sales of approximately $2.1 billion for the quarter, an increase of 4% compared to prior year quarter. In North America, our Generics business grew approximately 6% to just over $1 billion. Growth came primarily from a significant number of new product introductions leveraging our strong global platform. We launched 18 new products during this quarter. The generic pricing environment was again consistent with our expectations and guidance to you. Tony will elaborate on this topic shortly. 
In Europe, sales totaled $604 million, an increase of approximately 6% over the prior year period. This result was mainly due to sales of new products and higher volumes on existing products as we continue to benefit from integrated approach of selling our established product assets under One Mylan. Pricing was essentially flat in the second quarter because of our diversified product portfolio.
In Rest of the World, sales totaled $523 million, a year-over-year decrease of approximately 2%. Our operations in India improved throughout the quarter as we saw HIV tender volumes return towards our expected levels, resulting in growth of more than 30% on a sequential basis compared to Q1. Additionally, Japan, Australia and the rest of the emerging markets showed favorable sales on existing products. 
With that said, we continue to remain confident in the strength of these businesses. Our Specialty division delivered revenue of $403 million in the quarter, a year-over-year increase of 33% as a result of higher sales of EpiPen, Performist and Ultiva. Tony will provide more details on this.
Our global platform has been further strengthened and diversified by the growth of our global established brands and branded generics business, as these key brands continue to perform at or above our expectations. These established brands and branded business will be even further enhanced by the addition of the Meda brands. 
Meda's attractive portfolio is just one of the reasons why I share Heather's excitement about the recent completion of the transaction. The addition of Meda strengthens our position in several [indiscernible] franchises, significantly expands our over-the-counter business and accelerates our expansion in several attractive emerging markets, which will help us further maximize our efficient, high-quality operating platform and a broad product portfolio. 
During this quarter, we also completed our acquisition of Renaissance topicals business. By bringing together the Renaissance business with Mylan's and Meda's strong dermatology portfolio, we are confident that we will be able to drive significant growth from this franchise, especially by taking the combined portfolio and pipeline into the new markets outside of North America. 
We are looking forward to now moving from pre-integration planning to truly integrating these businesses into Mylan's family. We are very excited as we will be moving into integration phase along with the key leaders retained from Meda and Renaissance leadership. While we remain focused on business continuity, we also are very excited and upbeat to realize the potential and value of bringing together the best of these organizations and our combined efforts. We also continue to execute on our strategic growth drivers, and let me highlight a few of the developments during the quarter.
Turning first to our biosimilars portfolio. We are pleased to report that we remain on track to file trastuzumab, pegfilgrastim and Glargine to U.S. FDA and European Medical Agency (sic) [European Medicines Agency] in 2016. Our 24 weeks data from our HERITAGE study for our biosimilar trastuzumab confirms the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of our product being developed in partnership with by Biocon. This study was presented at the ASCO meeting in June. And we are now expecting to present our results for the 48-week extension of the HERITAGE study at the important European Society for Medical Oncology Congress in October. 
Recently, the European Medicines Agency has also accepted for review Mylan's marketing authorization application for our proposed biosimilar pegfilgrastim, also being developed with Biocon. In addition to analytical, functional and preclinical data, the application also includes clinical data from pivotal, PK/PD and confirmatory efficacy, safety and immunogenicity studies completed earlier this year. The results from the studies are also expected to be presented at ESMO in October. 
In addition to this, we continue to make progress on our other programs and will continue to provide further updates as our filings are accepted. As a reminder, with our Biocon partnership and Momenta collaboration, we have access to a combined portfolio of 15 biosimilar and insulin analog generic products in the development. This is one of the industry's most robust and diverse portfolios.
As we continue to invest in this important global area, we are continuing to differentiate the structure of our partnerships. For instance, with Momenta, we have a great deal of product/by product optionality. On the respiratory front, our partner, Theravance Biopharma, announced that enrollment of more than 2,300 patients has been completed in the 3 ongoing clinical trials comprising the company's Phase III program for revefenacin, an investigational LAMA in development for the treatment of COPD. The replicate efficacy studies are expected to be read out in early fourth quarter of this year to be followed by a 12-month long-term safety study and plan for an NDA filing in 2017.
Regarding generic Advair. We remain confident in our application as we continue to be actively engaged with the FDA towards the execution of this very important ANDA. Finally, I also would like to thank our committed and talented global workforce for their significant contributions to our business and mission during this quarter. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tony for some additional perspective on the commercial landscape."

As Rajiv noted, we continue to see strong growth in our global Generics business, including in the U.S. where the pricing environment continues to be a topic of much focus. Let me reiterate that we continue to see pricing across our very broad product portfolio to be in line with our expectations, demonstrating the importance of scale and diversity. 
For example, during the first 6 months, both our global Generics business and, specifically, our North American core Generics business saw year-over-year price erosion in the mid-single digits. Given the continued strength of this core business, we continue to anticipate price erosion in the mid-single digits for the remainder of the year. 
Our North American Generic business also benefited from a large number of new product launches, including the first-to-market launches of armodafinil, doxycycline 50 milligram and doxycycline 200 milligram, representing a combined IMS total market value of $650 million. Our Specialty business also saw double-digit growth across all our major brands. 
With respect to EpiPen, revenues were driven by net price favorability due in part to payer pricing dynamics year-over-year, as well as strong sales volume in anticipation of the peak season. We began realizing the benefits of customer contract negotiations over the last several quarters. I note that year-over-year comps will continue to evolve until we pass the 1-year mark of the Auvi-Q recall. 
I want to stress that we continue to invest in expanding the size of the overall market by increasing awareness and access to this important product. We also continue to educate stakeholders about the complex supply chain dynamics as a greater share of costs are being shifted from employers to patients.
Finally, I would like to echo Heather and Rajiv's enthusiasm for the completion of the Meda transaction. Commercially, we see significant opportunities to maximize our robust product portfolio, which now covers an even more diverse array of Rx, Gx and OTC products across customer channels and geographies. We see many opportunities to do more with these products across the Mylan platform as we optimize our sales force, bring new products into new countries and maximize high potential brands.
We also continue to be uniquely positioned to reliably supply our growing global customers' increasing demands. EpiPen is just one example of where we can do more by consolidating our expertise across Mylan and Meda. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Ken."

I'll start out by saying that I'm extremely pleased to be a part of this call and a part of the Mylan team. I'll now turn to our financial results. 
Second quarter revenues grew to $2.6 billion, and that's an increase of 8% over the second quarter last year. As Rajiv already noted, our Generics segment grew 4% and our Specialty segment grew 33%. The generics pricing environment was consistent with our expectations and declined at a mid-single-digit rate overall in the quarter. 
While foreign currency movements were volatility following the outcome of the Brexit vote in late June, the year-over-year impact of currency translation on our second quarter result revenues was insignificant due to the diversity of our portfolio of businesses across all geographies. 
As Heather noted, second quarter revenues increased 17% sequentially with growth in both of our segments and all 3 geographies. Adjusted gross margins for the second quarter were 56%, that's up approximately 200 basis points from the prior year and the prior quarter as a result of the new product introductions and favorable specialty sales.
Moving on to operating expenses. On an adjusted basis, R&D expense increased slightly over the prior year as we continue to invest in our respiratory, insulin and biologics programs. As a percentage of revenues, second quarter R&D declined by approximately 50 basis points from the prior year to 6.6% of total revenues. 
SG&A expense, also on an adjusted basis, remained essentially unchanged at approximately 21% of total revenues in the second quarter. As a result of our strong operating performance, adjusted net earnings increased by $118 million from the prior year quarter to reach $592 million and adjusted diluted EPS increased 28% to $1.16 compared to $0.91 in the prior year. I will also point out that adjusted diluted EPS grew 52% sequentially from the first quarter of this year.
For the 6 months ended June 30, total revenues grew to $4.8 billion. That's a year-over-year increase of 13% on a constant currency basis and includes an additional 2 months of sales from our established products business. 
Adjusted gross margins for the 6 months ended June 30 were 55% or up approximately 100 basis points from the prior year period. Adjusted R&D and adjusted SG&A expenses were approximately 7.5% and 22% of total revenues, respectively, for the year-to-date period. As a result, adjusted earnings for the 6 months ended June 30 increased by $195 million to reach $979 million and adjusted diluted EPS therefore increased 19% to $1.92.
Turning to our cash flow and liquidity metrics. Adjusted cash provided by operating activities was strong at $485 million for the quarter, which drove the first half adjusted operating cash flow to reach $687 million. The strong performance in the quarter reflects improvements in our operating results combined with our continued focus on effectively managing working capital.
During the second quarter of 2016, we issued $6.5 billion of senior notes in anticipation of the completion of the Meda offer and repaid $500 million of senior notes, which became due in June 2016. We have no amounts outstanding on our accounts receivables securitization or our revolving credit facilities. At the end of Q2, our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 2.2x. We remain fully committed to maintaining our investment grade rating and reducing our leverage subsequent to the closing of the Meda transaction. 
Looking ahead, we feel confident with our ability to continue to leverage our outstanding global operating platform, which now includes the recent acquisitions of both Renaissance and Meda. And we're committed to our 2016 outlook of adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $4.85 to $5.15. In terms of phasing of our earnings for the remainder of 2016, Q3 will again be our strongest quarter and slightly higher than Q4. 
With that, we'll open the call up to your questions."

So I'll start on the U.S. generics and then if Tony or Rajiv want to add anything. I guess from my perspective, as we've continued the dialogue around the diversifying and the differentiation in product mix and the breadth of portfolio, certainly, as you look at some of the smaller players, I think weaknesses from the niche products, as well as perhaps how they were playing their business and positioning it. And I think that the other thing you have to take into consideration is balancing that, to your point about does it drive more irrationality, is our customers that are continuing to get more global and their demands and needs are getting far greater. And I know Tony touched on this in his remarks, but I really think that shouldn't be underestimated. The need for a reliable supply is continuing to, I think, again, be a differentiator for Mylan in our ability to meet these global needs in a very reliable -- as we've touted before, through sheer hard work that has been put together this last decade, is a supply chain that we believe is second to none. And I think you see some value, continued value being placed on that by our customers. So I can't speak -- as we've always said, our business is going to be competitive. It always has been and it always will be. But I don't sense, I would say, that hyper competitiveness that we've seen, say, 5 years ago when our customers were much more willing to change just based on price and not necessarily be focused on if that company could actually supply their needs. So I think it continues to shift towards being a, not only a differentiator for us, but a real value driver and growth driver for us, which is why have the confidence around the stability in the market. As far as EpiPen goes, Chris, here's what I'd say, you've heard me say this a thousand times. All good things don't happen at once. All bad things don't happen at once. When you're looking at the complexity of our company, globally, across geographies, across channels, across products, we believe that when we came out with our guidance this year, we anticipated, obviously, the Meda transaction. We anticipated a lot of probability waiting on launches and so forth. And with all that being said, I think when you look at our guidance range as being within a 3% each way of the midpoint, that we believe that's a very tight range and we believe it's taking a lot in consideration. And we've always said when we feel that we should update or move that guidance, you know we're the first to come and do that to the market. But we believe, right know, that it is absolutely taking a lot into consideration given all the moving pieces across our platform."

I will continue to say that we couldn't be more proud of our investment to expand and increase access and continue to see EpiPen as an important product to the community. And as again, Tony mentioned, our opportunity to even enhance that throughout Europe now, with the Meda transaction. But this point, I think, there's been a lot of discussion and some headlines around patients going from paying a co-pay to now paying the entire cost of a product. And where EpiPen falls because if you look on an annual basis as a life-saving drug to have a WACC price at just under $600, I think that you can see it falls as not an expensive product. And so when employers, through high deductible plans were incentivized to increase high deductible plans through Obamacare, as people, as employee -- employers shift more cost employees and makes that everything has got to come out of pocket before you hit your deductible is where you're seeing a lot of noise around EpiPen. And so from our perspective, we're continuing to try to do our part on educating on that supply chain, and we all know its complex and our health care and insurance is complicated.

Now that the deal is closed, and if you still believe in your $6 number, next year, the stock does look pretty cheap. What is -- should we expect that you implement step [ph] buyback? And secondly, just a question around the IPR process, which we will hear about in the next couple of weeks. You guys still don't have Copaxone 20 on the market. Just wondering if you can kind of share with us your expectations for what the market opportunity might look like for you for Copaxone 40? When you plan to launch?

It is about really making sure we're balancing all of that, but it absolutely is back on the table as an option. And as far as the $6, I guess, I just want to -- because sometimes you guys throw these little slippers in there. What we've committed to is $6 in '18. What we've said, since announcing the Meda transaction, is we have the opportunity to hit that earlier, but what we are absolutely committed to is the $6 in '18. And as far as IPR, I mean, I'll speak to the confidence and then, Rajiv, anything you want to add on the -- or Tony on the market opportunity. We couldn't be more confident in the IPR, the process and where we stand in that, and are anxiously awaiting the results of that next week. And I would just remind on our confidence to get the product approved. Look, the reality is that the transformation that FDA has gone through and is going through of these last couple of years with GDUFA, there have been casualties to that. And there's been casualties in the backlog and how they're being able to handle them as they move towards GDUFA goal dates and, obviously, Copaxone fell prior to getting a GDUFA goal date like our generic Advair. So all I can say is speaking on the science and speaking to our application, on both the 20 and 40 that we absolutely have all the confidence in the world of getting it. But as you know, I've said, I'll love the fact from what we're not talking about when we're going to get Copaxone approval."

Look, I'm hopeful that the rebasing continues, that this is not memory loss in about a month and hot air starts building back up again. Because I think that what we found ourselves in the generic specialty sector is unsustainable business practices. And I think that it just comes. It's just that simple. And I think individual companies are now having to, however, much affected they may have been by an unsustainable business practice, they're having to re-group, reorganize, rebase themselves. My hope is that as I mentioned that, that has driven, I think, forcing a much more thoughtful look at businesses and understanding the mix because all companies aren't created equally. And like I said, I'm hopeful that Wall Street doesn't have short-term memory loss and goes back to trying to paint all with one or trying to support what I don't believe is sustainable, long term.

Thank you, Andrew. So I'll start with integration. Look, hopefully by now, the fact of our business continuity and our track record would let you realize the fact that we're not only very focused on integration but have a very disciplined approach. But it's not just about bringing a company into the fold, it is truly about integrating businesses, people, best practices. And so as we are now doing that over these acquisitions, most recently Meda, we absolutely, I can assure you, have multiple work streams as we had reported last quarter, actually, our preplanning phase of that allows us to hit that ground running once we hit Day 1. And I can tell you, I'm confident that when we do lay out those plans and those opportunities, they're very robust, they cut across all geographies. So we're not prioritizing one over the other. I mean, the benefit of having great people and bringing their management team into the fold of our management team, we're able to really divide and conquer across the globe, across channels and across these great brands and especially this new channel of OTC. So we couldn't look more forward to coming and highlighting all of that. And I guess, I don't [indiscernible] and give much more of a teaser than that for Investor Day. As far as guidance is concerned, look, I -- we've got -- when you look at the complexity of not only our business, in general, in the generics business both here in the U.S. but around the globe, that's why as we've continued to grow specialty, grow brand generics, grow our brands, grow OTC, it is just for that reason of complexity and volatility that we've said the diversification and differentiation lets us absorb that now. Our scale -- our sheer size and scale is able to absorb that volatility and manage this business. And hopefully, when I look -- and that's why, I said, I couldn't be more proud of Q2 that we were able to be right on top of revenue, beat our -- the EPS consensus and all -- sequentially, because I know many of you that I have discussions with after our last quarter, everybody felt that we were taking such a big leap from Q1 to Q2 that if we could show that this business could perform of what we said it was going to that certainly would pave the way for the kind of growth and, hopefully, a market multiple that should respond to that accordingly. So that's why I highlighted the sequential growth of not only top line, 17%, bottom line, 52% and the strength of our cash flows. So like I said, I think that hopefully, you're realizing our guidance takes a lot into consideration and our ability to manage to that and perform and deliver.

I'll also point out that we filed our 10-Q concurrently with this call, and we have those details in there. But primarily, the biggest chunk of that $174 million of cost is really due to the financing-related acquisition cost around Meda. And we've broken out in there that we did some purchase of Swedish krone ahead of time. We had an unrealized loss on that due to the movement in the currency over the time period. And also, the fees related to the financing and the existing bridge loan facility that we took into place. All of that is broken out in the footnote's there, but that is substantially all of the cost. And on the IFRS accounting side, as you know, we also prepare Mylan's books and records on both U.S. GAAP and IFRS basis. We started that process last year. We will continue to basically, just roll the Meda process into that. So we've already done it through -- with the Mylan accounts, and we'll do it the same way with the Meda accounts."

Especially in Q4, that will continue to evolve. As far as just in the overall strength of EpiPen, I think, as we've talked before, the brand equity of EpiPen, the life-saving nature of this important medicine, our continuing to educate and invest in the access to this product. I believe that EpiPen will be a very, very important product for a very long time. With that being said, I think, as I said earlier in my remarks, we don't have a significant concentration from any one product or business segment at Mylan today. And as we continue to grow, just as now we're bringing Meda into the fold, EpiPen, from a true dollar contribution, will just continue to shrink. So again, there's no overreliance on EpiPen as a brand. But I can tell you that there's every bit of focus on the role EpiPen plays in the lives and saving lives, and then getting to as many patients as we possibly can. So that's what I would say about our EpiPen franchise."

So all I can say is that we continue to see robustness around these products that we've brought in, and we've continued to grow them.

During today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements regarding our financial outlook and 2016 guidance, the Meda transaction, the acquisition of Renaissance's non-sterile topical-focused specialty and generics business and other matters related to the company and its business, including regulatory matters, product development and acquisitions.

I'd also like to take a moment to welcome Ken Parks, who joined Mylan as CFO on June 6. And he's here today for his first earnings call with us. In addition, I'd like to welcome to the call all of our employees around the word, including the most recent additions to our family, the great team we required in June 15 from Renaissance and on Friday, the terrific team at Meda. 
We're excited about both of these transactions. With the Renaissance business bringing us a complementary portfolio of about 25 branded and generic topical products, which combined with Meda's offerings, positions us to be a leader in dermatology. The Meda transaction will allow us to build even greater scale across our operations and expand the breadth and diversity of our product portfolio, geographies and sales channels around the world. Meda also positions us to be a leader in the global respiratory and allergy markets. In addition, these transactions further strengthen our already very strong cash flows.
As with any transaction, we believe people are the most important asset and we're delighted with how engaged the teams of both organizations are as we now focus on fully integrating these organizations so that we can increasingly go to market as One Mylan and maximize the potential of our expanded global platform. 
With that, I'd like to elaborate a bit on the commentary I provided during our call in May, namely that we believe that the rebasing of our sector has been a healthy exercise for the industry. It has helped investors draw more meaningful distinctions among the different types of business models in our sector. Because, as we have mentioned many times in the past, it simply makes no sense to paint the industry with a broad, one-size-fits-all brush, particularly when it comes to generics and specialty, which vary widely in terms of product and geography mix. 
In Mylan's case, we have spent the last decade differentiating, diversifying and derisking by expanding through organic growth and strategic acquisitions. As a result, we now have extensive manufacturing operations whose technologies range from API to oral solids, to injectables, transdermals and respiratory expertise. We have a portfolio that now stands at more than 2,700 separate products, including generics, branded generics, brands and over-the-counter medicines. 
We also have positioned ourselves such that we have no significant concentrations in any single product, channel or business segment. Moreover, we have continued to grow scale throughout North America, Europe and Rest of World. All of this has enhanced our financial strength and flexibility, positioning us to continue investing and growing for many years to come. 
It's for these reasons we're so proud of our performance during second quarter. On the top line, we generated total revenues of more than $2.5 billion year-over-year, an increase of 8% on a constant currency basis that was fueled by solid growth in our North America and Europe generics regions and strong double-digit growth in our Specialty business. On the bottom line, we delivered adjusted net earnings of $592 million for $1.16 per adjusted diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 28%. 
I'd also like to underscore that on a sequential basis, our revenues rose by 17%, adjusted EPS increased by 52% and cash flows increased 240% on the strength across all geographies, all of our business units including new launches, demonstrating the power of us truly maximizing all of our assets.  Consistent with our historic track record of delivering stronger growth in the second half and on the strength of new product launches, EpiPen seasonality and our recently completed acquisitions, we are committed to our 2016 EPS guidance range of $4.85 to $5.15. 
As I've indicated, we could not be more excited about Mylan's longer-term prospects and look forward to discussing our bright future at our Investor Day event, which we will host in conjunction with third quarter earnings. On behalf of Mylan's board and our entire leadership team, I'd like to thank our employees for their outstanding teamwork and execution during the quarter and for their continued commitment to our cause. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rajiv."

We continue to see solid performance across our businesses during the second quarter, once again demonstrating that the scale and diversity we have created provides us with strength, consistency and resilience to ever evolving market conditions, further differentiating us from our competitors. We launched more than 100 new products across our global platform. And with Meda, we now sell approximately 2,700 products around the world. 
Overall, our Generics business delivered third-party net sales of approximately $2.1 billion for the quarter, an increase of 4% compared to prior year quarter. In North America, our Generics business grew approximately 6% to just over $1 billion. Growth came primarily from a significant number of new product introductions leveraging our strong global platform. We launched 18 new products during this quarter. The generic pricing environment was again consistent with our expectations and guidance to you. Tony will elaborate on this topic shortly. 
In Europe, sales totaled $604 million, an increase of approximately 6% over the prior year period. This result was mainly due to sales of new products and higher volumes on existing products as we continue to benefit from integrated approach of selling our established product assets under One Mylan. Pricing was essentially flat in the second quarter because of our diversified product portfolio.
In Rest of the World, sales totaled $523 million, a year-over-year decrease of approximately 2%. Our operations in India improved throughout the quarter as we saw HIV tender volumes return towards our expected levels, resulting in growth of more than 30% on a sequential basis compared to Q1. Additionally, Japan, Australia and the rest of the emerging markets showed favorable sales on existing products. 
With that said, we continue to remain confident in the strength of these businesses. Our Specialty division delivered revenue of $403 million in the quarter, a year-over-year increase of 33% as a result of higher sales of EpiPen, Performist and Ultiva. Tony will provide more details on this.
Our global platform has been further strengthened and diversified by the growth of our global established brands and branded generics business, as these key brands continue to perform at or above our expectations. These established brands and branded business will be even further enhanced by the addition of the Meda brands. 
Meda's attractive portfolio is just one of the reasons why I share Heather's excitement about the recent completion of the transaction. The addition of Meda strengthens our position in several [indiscernible] franchises, significantly expands our over-the-counter business and accelerates our expansion in several attractive emerging markets, which will help us further maximize our efficient, high-quality operating platform and a broad product portfolio. 
During this quarter, we also completed our acquisition of Renaissance topicals business. By bringing together the Renaissance business with Mylan's and Meda's strong dermatology portfolio, we are confident that we will be able to drive significant growth from this franchise, especially by taking the combined portfolio and pipeline into the new markets outside of North America. 
We are looking forward to now moving from pre-integration planning to truly integrating these businesses into Mylan's family. We are very excited as we will be moving into integration phase along with the key leaders retained from Meda and Renaissance leadership. While we remain focused on business continuity, we also are very excited and upbeat to realize the potential and value of bringing together the best of these organizations and our combined efforts. We also continue to execute on our strategic growth drivers, and let me highlight a few of the developments during the quarter.
Turning first to our biosimilars portfolio. We are pleased to report that we remain on track to file trastuzumab, pegfilgrastim and Glargine to U.S. FDA and European Medical Agency (sic) [European Medicines Agency] in 2016. Our 24 weeks data from our HERITAGE study for our biosimilar trastuzumab confirms the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of our product being developed in partnership with by Biocon. This study was presented at the ASCO meeting in June. And we are now expecting to present our results for the 48-week extension of the HERITAGE study at the important European Society for Medical Oncology Congress in October. 
Recently, the European Medicines Agency has also accepted for review Mylan's marketing authorization application for our proposed biosimilar pegfilgrastim, also being developed with Biocon. In addition to analytical, functional and preclinical data, the application also includes clinical data from pivotal, PK/PD and confirmatory efficacy, safety and immunogenicity studies completed earlier this year. The results from the studies are also expected to be presented at ESMO in October. 
In addition to this, we continue to make progress on our other programs and will continue to provide further updates as our filings are accepted. As a reminder, with our Biocon partnership and Momenta collaboration, we have access to a combined portfolio of 15 biosimilar and insulin analog generic products in the development. This is one of the industry's most robust and diverse portfolios.
As we continue to invest in this important global area, we are continuing to differentiate the structure of our partnerships. For instance, with Momenta, we have a great deal of product/by product optionality. On the respiratory front, our partner, Theravance Biopharma, announced that enrollment of more than 2,300 patients has been completed in the 3 ongoing clinical trials comprising the company's Phase III program for revefenacin, an investigational LAMA in development for the treatment of COPD. The replicate efficacy studies are expected to be read out in early fourth quarter of this year to be followed by a 12-month long-term safety study and plan for an NDA filing in 2017.
Regarding generic Advair. We remain confident in our application as we continue to be actively engaged with the FDA towards the execution of this very important ANDA. Finally, I also would like to thank our committed and talented global workforce for their significant contributions to our business and mission during this quarter. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tony for some additional perspective on the commercial landscape."

As Rajiv noted, we continue to see strong growth in our global Generics business, including in the U.S. where the pricing environment continues to be a topic of much focus. Let me reiterate that we continue to see pricing across our very broad product portfolio to be in line with our expectations, demonstrating the importance of scale and diversity. 
For example, during the first 6 months, both our global Generics business and, specifically, our North American core Generics business saw year-over-year price erosion in the mid-single digits. Given the continued strength of this core business, we continue to anticipate price erosion in the mid-single digits for the remainder of the year. 
Our North American Generic business also benefited from a large number of new product launches, including the first-to-market launches of armodafinil, doxycycline 50 milligram and doxycycline 200 milligram, representing a combined IMS total market value of $650 million. Our Specialty business also saw double-digit growth across all our major brands. 
With respect to EpiPen, revenues were driven by net price favorability due in part to payer pricing dynamics year-over-year, as well as strong sales volume in anticipation of the peak season. We began realizing the benefits of customer contract negotiations over the last several quarters. I note that year-over-year comps will continue to evolve until we pass the 1-year mark of the Auvi-Q recall. 
I want to stress that we continue to invest in expanding the size of the overall market by increasing awareness and access to this important product. We also continue to educate stakeholders about the complex supply chain dynamics as a greater share of costs are being shifted from employers to patients.
Finally, I would like to echo Heather and Rajiv's enthusiasm for the completion of the Meda transaction. Commercially, we see significant opportunities to maximize our robust product portfolio, which now covers an even more diverse array of Rx, Gx and OTC products across customer channels and geographies. We see many opportunities to do more with these products across the Mylan platform as we optimize our sales force, bring new products into new countries and maximize high potential brands.
We also continue to be uniquely positioned to reliably supply our growing global customers' increasing demands. EpiPen is just one example of where we can do more by consolidating our expertise across Mylan and Meda. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Ken."

I'll start out by saying that I'm extremely pleased to be a part of this call and a part of the Mylan team. I'll now turn to our financial results. 
Second quarter revenues grew to $2.6 billion, and that's an increase of 8% over the second quarter last year. As Rajiv already noted, our Generics segment grew 4% and our Specialty segment grew 33%. The generics pricing environment was consistent with our expectations and declined at a mid-single-digit rate overall in the quarter. 
While foreign currency movements were volatility following the outcome of the Brexit vote in late June, the year-over-year impact of currency translation on our second quarter result revenues was insignificant due to the diversity of our portfolio of businesses across all geographies. 
As Heather noted, second quarter revenues increased 17% sequentially with growth in both of our segments and all 3 geographies. Adjusted gross margins for the second quarter were 56%, that's up approximately 200 basis points from the prior year and the prior quarter as a result of the new product introductions and favorable specialty sales.
Moving on to operating expenses. On an adjusted basis, R&D expense increased slightly over the prior year as we continue to invest in our respiratory, insulin and biologics programs. As a percentage of revenues, second quarter R&D declined by approximately 50 basis points from the prior year to 6.6% of total revenues. 
SG&A expense, also on an adjusted basis, remained essentially unchanged at approximately 21% of total revenues in the second quarter. As a result of our strong operating performance, adjusted net earnings increased by $118 million from the prior year quarter to reach $592 million and adjusted diluted EPS increased 28% to $1.16 compared to $0.91 in the prior year. I will also point out that adjusted diluted EPS grew 52% sequentially from the first quarter of this year.
For the 6 months ended June 30, total revenues grew to $4.8 billion. That's a year-over-year increase of 13% on a constant currency basis and includes an additional 2 months of sales from our established products business. 
Adjusted gross margins for the 6 months ended June 30 were 55% or up approximately 100 basis points from the prior year period. Adjusted R&D and adjusted SG&A expenses were approximately 7.5% and 22% of total revenues, respectively, for the year-to-date period. As a result, adjusted earnings for the 6 months ended June 30 increased by $195 million to reach $979 million and adjusted diluted EPS therefore increased 19% to $1.92.
Turning to our cash flow and liquidity metrics. Adjusted cash provided by operating activities was strong at $485 million for the quarter, which drove the first half adjusted operating cash flow to reach $687 million. The strong performance in the quarter reflects improvements in our operating results combined with our continued focus on effectively managing working capital.
During the second quarter of 2016, we issued $6.5 billion of senior notes in anticipation of the completion of the Meda offer and repaid $500 million of senior notes, which became due in June 2016. We have no amounts outstanding on our accounts receivables securitization or our revolving credit facilities. At the end of Q2, our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 2.2x. We remain fully committed to maintaining our investment grade rating and reducing our leverage subsequent to the closing of the Meda transaction. 
Looking ahead, we feel confident with our ability to continue to leverage our outstanding global operating platform, which now includes the recent acquisitions of both Renaissance and Meda. And we're committed to our 2016 outlook of adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $4.85 to $5.15. In terms of phasing of our earnings for the remainder of 2016, Q3 will again be our strongest quarter and slightly higher than Q4. 
With that, we'll open the call up to your questions."

First, on the U.S. generic environment -- and thanks for all the color on the call. Is there any concern on your part that some the weakness that your smaller competitors are experiencing results in more aggressive and less rational behavior from those companies and that could ultimately impact your franchise if the market gets a little bit destabilize by that dynamic? The second question is between the very strong EpiPen trends you're seeing right now and the earlier expected Meda close. It seems like there could be upside to the guidance range. Is there any offsets we should be thinking about? Or are you just being neither cautious or conservative now in terms of the range?"

So I'll start on the U.S. generics and then if Tony or Rajiv want to add anything. I guess from my perspective, as we've continued the dialogue around the diversifying and the differentiation in product mix and the breadth of portfolio, certainly, as you look at some of the smaller players, I think weaknesses from the niche products, as well as perhaps how they were playing their business and positioning it. And I think that the other thing you have to take into consideration is balancing that, to your point about does it drive more irrationality, is our customers that are continuing to get more global and their demands and needs are getting far greater. And I know Tony touched on this in his remarks, but I really think that shouldn't be underestimated. The need for a reliable supply is continuing to, I think, again, be a differentiator for Mylan in our ability to meet these global needs in a very reliable -- as we've touted before, through sheer hard work that has been put together this last decade, is a supply chain that we believe is second to none. And I think you see some value, continued value being placed on that by our customers. So I can't speak -- as we've always said, our business is going to be competitive. It always has been and it always will be. But I don't sense, I would say, that hyper competitiveness that we've seen, say, 5 years ago when our customers were much more willing to change just based on price and not necessarily be focused on if that company could actually supply their needs. So I think it continues to shift towards being a, not only a differentiator for us, but a real value driver and growth driver for us, which is why have the confidence around the stability in the market. As far as EpiPen goes, Chris, here's what I'd say, you've heard me say this a thousand times. All good things don't happen at once. All bad things don't happen at once. When you're looking at the complexity of our company, globally, across geographies, across channels, across products, we believe that when we came out with our guidance this year, we anticipated, obviously, the Meda transaction. We anticipated a lot of probability waiting on launches and so forth. And with all that being said, I think when you look at our guidance range as being within a 3% each way of the midpoint, that we believe that's a very tight range and we believe it's taking a lot in consideration. And we've always said when we feel that we should update or move that guidance, you know we're the first to come and do that to the market. But we believe, right know, that it is absolutely taking a lot into consideration given all the moving pieces across our platform."

That is, some confidence that, that issue will not begin to impact your earnings in the next few quarters. And then second, I guess, to Rajiv. On Advair, I remember the GPhA, the people presenting from FDA mentioned that only 12% of end applications gets approved first round. I know Advair is very important to you, but you can just give us a feel for what makes you confident that you can get such a complex product approved first round, given the rate of approval at FDA at first round."

So Ronny, I love the opportunity to clarify this point around insurance and the changing dynamic and the payer landscape. It really is not -- the point is not being made from our earnings perspective, or what we see with EpiPen. I will continue to say that we couldn't be more proud of our investment to expand and increase access and continue to see EpiPen as an important product to the community. And as again, Tony mentioned, our opportunity to even enhance that throughout Europe now, with the Meda transaction. But this point, I think, there's been a lot of discussion and some headlines around patients going from paying a co-pay to now paying the entire cost of a product. And where EpiPen falls because if you look on an annual basis as a life-saving drug to have a WACC price at just under $600, I think that you can see it falls as not an expensive product. And so when employers, through high deductible plans were incentivized to increase high deductible plans through Obamacare, as people, as employee -- employers shift more cost employees and makes that everything has got to come out of pocket before you hit your deductible is where you're seeing a lot of noise around EpiPen. And so from our perspective, we're continuing to try to do our part on educating on that supply chain, and we all know its complex and our health care and insurance is complicated. But we are just continuing to try to do our part messaging and continuing to do everything we can to ensure patients have access to our product. And so that really is the point on the insurance, not at all, from what we're projecting from a business perspective around EpiPen."

And secondly, just a question around the IPR process, which we will hear about in the next couple of weeks. You guys still don't have Copaxone 20 on the market. Just wondering if you can kind of share with us your expectations for what the market opportunity might look like for you for Copaxone 40? When you plan to launch?

So we absolutely -- it's back on the table as an option that we have, just as we're looking at many other ways. I can tell you, though, our priority is really to delever. It is about really making sure we're balancing all of that, but it absolutely is back on the table as an option. And as far as the $6, I guess, I just want to -- because sometimes you guys throw these little slippers in there. What we've committed to is $6 in '18. What we've said, since announcing the Meda transaction, is we have the opportunity to hit that earlier, but what we are absolutely committed to is the $6 in '18. And as far as IPR, I mean, I'll speak to the confidence and then, Rajiv, anything you want to add on the -- or Tony on the market opportunity. We couldn't be more confident in the IPR, the process and where we stand in that, and are anxiously awaiting the results of that next week. And I would just remind on our confidence to get the product approved. Look, the reality is that the transformation that FDA has gone through and is going through of these last couple of years with GDUFA, there have been casualties to that. And there's been casualties in the backlog and how they're being able to handle them as they move towards GDUFA goal dates and, obviously, Copaxone fell prior to getting a GDUFA goal date like our generic Advair. So all I can say is speaking on the science and speaking to our application, on both the 20 and 40 that we absolutely have all the confidence in the world of getting it. But as you know, I've said, I'll love the fact from what we're not talking about when we're going to get Copaxone approval."

And we look forward to coming back out to you guys on Investor Day and showing you how, one, that the ability for us, now, to take this significant financial flexibility we have and continue to build and complement this platform we've put in place, which we'll, to your point, continue to consolidate, I think those assets the company's need to let go of, products, and small nice tuck-ins, like we just did with Renaissance. And as far as OTC, I have to ask you to wait for Q3. Because I think we really want to come out in a holistic way, talk about our geographies, these channels and how truly we believe approaching these markets with a One Mylan approach, we're going to be able to do more. So anyway, look forward to that."

Look, hopefully by now, the fact of our business continuity and our track record would let you realize the fact that we're not only very focused on integration but have a very disciplined approach.",490,"Okay. Thank you, Andrew. So I'll start with integration. Look, hopefully by now, the fact of our business continuity and our track record would let you realize the fact that we're not only very focused on integration but have a very disciplined approach. But it's not just about bringing a company into the fold, it is truly about integrating businesses, people, best practices. And so as we are now doing that over these acquisitions, most recently Meda, we absolutely, I can assure you, have multiple work streams as we had reported last quarter, actually, our preplanning phase of that allows us to hit that ground running once we hit Day 1. And I can tell you, I'm confident that when we do lay out those plans and those opportunities, they're very robust, they cut across all geographies. So we're not prioritizing one over the other. I mean, the benefit of having great people and bringing their management team into the fold of our management team, we're able to really divide and conquer across the globe, across channels and across these great brands and especially this new channel of OTC. So we couldn't look more forward to coming and highlighting all of that. And I guess, I don't [indiscernible] and give much more of a teaser than that for Investor Day. As far as guidance is concerned, look, I -- we've got -- when you look at the complexity of not only our business, in general, in the generics business both here in the U.S. but around the globe, that's why as we've continued to grow specialty, grow brand generics, grow our brands, grow OTC, it is just for that reason of complexity and volatility that we've said the diversification and differentiation lets us absorb that now. Our scale -- our sheer size and scale is able to absorb that volatility and manage this business. And hopefully, when I look -- and that's why, I said, I couldn't be more proud of Q2 that we were able to be right on top of revenue, beat our -- the EPS consensus and all -- sequentially, because I know many of you that I have discussions with after our last quarter, everybody felt that we were taking such a big leap from Q1 to Q2 that if we could show that this business could perform of what we said it was going to that certainly would pave the way for the kind of growth and, hopefully, a market multiple that should respond to that accordingly. So that's why I highlighted the sequential growth of not only top line, 17%, bottom line, 52% and the strength of our cash flows. So like I said, I think that hopefully, you're realizing our guidance takes a lot into consideration and our ability to manage to that and perform and deliver. Again, I think this quarter, is just -- underscores this management team's ability to do that."

We're getting new businesses, new business channels, new products, new brands. That it is about learning from each other and really, that's been our success in the past. I look at the Avid EPD [ph] business. We brought that business in. It was different products than we've been in before, some different channel.

And also, the fees related to the financing and the existing bridge loan facility that we took into place. All of that is broken out in the footnote's there, but that is substantially all of the cost. And on the IFRS accounting side, as you know, we also prepare Mylan's books and records on both U.S. GAAP and IFRS basis. We started that process last year.

As far as just in the overall strength of EpiPen, I think, as we've talked before, the brand equity of EpiPen, the life-saving nature of this important medicine, our continuing to educate and invest in the access to this product. I believe that EpiPen will be a very, very important product for a very long time. With that being said, I think, as I said earlier in my remarks, we don't have a significant concentration from any one product or business segment at Mylan today. And as we continue to grow, just as now we're bringing Meda into the fold, EpiPen, from a true dollar contribution, will just continue to shrink. So again, there's no overreliance on EpiPen as a brand. But I can tell you that there's every bit of focus on the role EpiPen plays in the lives and saving lives, and then getting to as many patients as we possibly can. So that's what I would say about our EpiPen franchise."

Before we get into the specifics of the quarter, I'd like to provide some perspective on the current state of affairs. As we've stated many times, Mylan's great strengt",952,"Thanks, Kris, and welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us in this afternoon. Before we get into the specifics of the quarter, I'd like to provide some perspective on the current state of affairs. 
As we've stated many times, Mylan's great strength lies in our highly diversified and differentiated platform and the tremendous operational and commercial scale we felt over the last decade. This foundation is what allows us to continue to successfully withstand headwinds whenever and wherever they occur. Currently, the segments are originating in the U.S. where the health care system is undergoing rapid and extraordinary change. As we see, for instance, greater attention being paid to the complexity of pharmaceutical pricing and the rapidly growing number of high deductible health plans, which are shifting significant out-of-pocket cost to consumers. We've been living this reality firsthand with EpiPen. And as I've said previously, I wish we had better anticipated the magnitude and acceleration of the rising out-of-pocket cost for a growing minority of patients who may have ended up paying full WACC or more when they went to the pharmacy counter. This is why we took this list an unprecedented action of increasing our savings card program from $100 to $300, doubling the eligibility for our patient assistance program and announcing that we will launch a generic at a WACC price of $300. We expect the launch to occur during the first half of December.
I'm also pleased to note that we filed our application for a new formulation that will extend the product shelf life. We believe that these steps where the right ones to ensure immediate and sustainable cost savings directly to patients in the health care system. 
I'd like to reemphasize that Mylan is much more than any one product and our reach goes far beyond any one market. Throughout these past several weeks, we've drove the discussion about how the U.S. health care system and the supply chain operates and the challenges that lie within it. We have acknowledged that the current system, which we didn't create, but which we must compete in, was not built for consumerism, it cannot be fixed overnight and it needs to be completely reinvented.
It's precisely this opportunity to set new standards in health care and fulfill our mission of providing the world's 7 billion people access to high-quality medicine that lead Mylan a decade ago to begin its transformation into the globally diversified organization we've become today. 
Put another way, we've built Mylan to ensure our sustainability for many years to come. We look forward to being an innovative, constructive and powerful change agent with respect to helping shape the industry's future. In the meantime, we're going to continue optimizing our platform for efficiency and leveraging it for growth. 
As a part of this process, we're now focused on what we call Mylan's integration. Rather than merely folding [ph] our recent transaction, meaning EPD, Famy Care, Renaissance and Meda, and to Mylan's existing structure and processes, we're looking for even better ways to organize, optimize and operate our new and expanded company so as to maintain our long-standing track record of delivering strong performance.
For example, for many years, we've been reporting financial performance in terms of 2 segments, generic and specialty. But now that our product portfolio will be effectively integrated across generic, branded and OTC products, we'll move to 3 reporting segments: North America, Europe and Rest of World, starting with the fourth quarter. We will know manage our global platform as one business across all product and channel type. 
Turning to the quarter. Our performance was consistent with our revised full year guidance. On the top line, we generated total revenues of nearly $3.1 billion, a year-over-year increase of 13%. This result was fueled by strong performance across our Europe and Rest of World regions as well as solid performance across our North America region. 
On the bottom line, we delivered adjusted net earnings of $726 million or $1.38 per adjusted diluted share, a year-over-year decline of about 3%, which was primarily driven by the significant contribution in the prior year period of new products.
As we look ahead to Mylan's next chapter, we believe we now have the commercial and operating scale needed to fulfill our mission. As such, our BD efforts going forward will emphasize bolt-on deals. We also remain committed to our investment-grade rating. 
As for our full year financial performance, we remain on track to achieve adjusted EPS within our revised range of $4.70 to $4.90. The majority of the revision is the result of the previously announced changes related to EpiPen and much of its impact occurred in the third quarter. In addition, we remain committed to our $6 adjusted EPS target in 2018 with the targeted growth in the low teens in both 2017 and 2018.
We are anticipating that EpiPen's contribution to be approximately 6% of total sales in 2017. We look forward to discussing Mylan's future, including our guidance for 2017, in greater detail during our next Investor Day event, which we'll host in conjunction with fourth quarter earnings. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our employees around the globe for remaining focused and steadfast and executing to deliver better health for a better world. 
Before turning the call over to Rajiv, I'd like to conclude by stating that while the world may be filled with uncertainty and the future of the U.S. health care system maybe unclear, one thing is certain, the world can count on Mylan to maintain our unwavering commitment to our mission and strategy and continue operating, executing and delivering for the benefit of all of our stakeholders.

We'll continue to remain focused on our mission of providing the world's 7 billion people with access to high-quality medication. Thanks to each and every one of them for their commitment to work hard. Now turning to the third quarter.
Overall, our Generics business delivered third-party net sales of approximately $2.6 billion for the quarter, an increase of 17% compared to the prior year quarter. Meda contributed $324 million of these revenues, in line with our expectations. 
In North America, our Generics business grew approximately 1% to just about $1.1 billion on a constant currency basis. Growth came primarily from our acquisitions of both Meda and the Renaissance topicals business as well as new product introductions. Note that we have a challenging year-over-year comparison this quarter due to significant contribution from the new products in the last year's third quarter, especially [indiscernible] and [indiscernible]. We also experienced increased competition with new entrants on a number of other key products.
The generic pricing environment was again consistent with our expectation and previous guidance. Tony will elaborate on this topic shortly.
In Europe, sales totaled $842 million, a year-over-year increase of approximately 39% on a constant currency basis. The strong result was mainly due to contributions from Meda at the table pricing of our portfolio and sales of new products.
In Rest of World, sales totaled $670 million, a year-over-year increase of 20% on a constant currency basis. The strong growth was due in part to the contributions of Meda business and new expansion markets. We also saw volumes increase across the region, specifically as our HIV tender volumes improve and [indiscernible] expected levels. Additionally, Japan, Australia and the rest of emerging markets showed favorable sales on existing products as this benefits [ph] of the new product introduction. 
Our specialty delivered revenues of $419 million in the quarter, a year-over-year decrease of 4%. This decrease was primarily the result of the timing of wholesaler purchases of EpiPen, which resulted in lower volumes and less [ph] the actions taken during the quarter to improve access to EpiPen such as the increase in our 2-point program and patient assistance program.
We are making very good progress in what we are calling integrating Mylan, as we bring together all of our recent acquisitions, Meda, Renaissance, the EPD Business and Famy Care with legacy Mylan. We continue to see significant opportunities to optimize our cost base as well as create value by integrating across our branded generics and OTC platform in all of our regions and operating as One Mylan. 
As we continue to learn more about these businesses, we have even greater clarity on the opportunities to create meaningful efficiencies and truly maximize our business for the future in a differentiated way. We will provide details about this enhanced potential during our Investor Day. That said, all of our work today provides us with greater confidence that we will not only achieve the operating synergy [indiscernible] provided upon the Meda closing, but potentially exceed them. We also continue to see revenue synergy opportunities as we apply our One Mylan approach to our combined portfolio. With that said, let me turn to some of the significant progress we have made on our key pipeline programs.
Turning first to our biosimilars portfolio. Yesterday, along with our partner, Biocon, we announced the FDA [ph] mission of our BLA [ph] for our proposed biosimilar trastuzumab to the 3 51 K [ph] pathway. This is our first FDA [ph] biosimilar submission, and we believe it has the potential to be the first submission of a proposed biosimilar trastuzumab in the U.S. The submitted BLA [ph] includes a comprehensive package of analytical similarity, nonclinical and clinical data. The clinical data consist of 2 PK studies and a HERITAGE Phase III confirmatory efficacy and safety trial. 
The results of the HERITAGE trial was presented at this year's ASCO and ESMO conference. Our applications for trastuzumab, pegfilgrastim and Glargine have already been accepted for review by European Medicines Agency. 
For pegfilgrastim, the results from our Phase III clinical efficacy and safety study as well as our PK NPD study have supported our EU application were also presented at ESMO. Our insulin Glargine EMA filing announced last week included analytical, preclinical and clinical data. 
Our preclinical package included our PK NPD studies demonstrating [indiscernible] of our insulin Glargine compared to lenses. Finally, the EU registration [indiscernible] an efficacy and safety clinical trial in type 1 diabetes patient, which successfully demonstrates [indiscernible] of our insulin Glargine with Lantus. We are on track to file our applications for pegfilgrastim and Glargine products with FDA. We continue to generate additional data and work with FDA to establish an interchangeable pathway for our insulin Glargine program. 15% of Mylan's pharmaceutical [ph] spend will be on [indiscernible] medicines by 2020. And there is a significant unmet need around the world for more affordable versions of injectable insulin products.
Turning to our partnership with Momenta. We announced last week that dosing has began in our Phase I study to compare the pharmacokinetics, safety and immunogenicity of M834, a proposed biosimilar of ORENCIA. This is a first product in our portfolio of 6 biosimilar in development, the Momenta, to advance the clinical trial. 
We also recently signed a development [ph] and commercialization agreement with [indiscernible], a Polish bio technology company for access [ph] to rituximab in all European countries and non–European Balkan [ph] states. Through these various collaborations, we have accessed [ph] the combined portfolio of 16 biosimilar and insulin analog generic products in development, which gives Mylan one of industry's the largest and most diverse portfolio.
We remain committed to robust investments in this portfolio. It's also worth noting that we have also filed applications for trastuzumab, pegfilgrastim and Glargine in more than 30 other markets around the world combined. It's our broad portfolio of biosimilars insulin, niche respiratory product as well as strong HIV basket and hep C products that will fuel the organic growth of our expansion markets platforms, which has been further enhanced by addition of Meda footprint in these countries.
On the respiratory front. We announced with our partner, Theravance Biopharma, positive results from 2 replicate Phase III efficacy study of revefenacin and investigational LAMA and first once-daily nebulized bronchodilator in development for the treatment of COPD. The data confirms that revefenacin has the potential to offer meaningful benefits to patients with moderate to very severe COPD and represents another exciting milestone in Mylan's global respiratory pipeline. 
Additionally, we look forward to the completion of an ongoing Phase III safety trial in 2017 with the goal of filing an NDA by the end of 2017. We believe Mylan's strong experience with nebulized product's and experienced sales force in the respiratory segment, which has been further enhanced through our Meda transaction will help ensure this product success when approved.
Our [ph] generic Advair, we remain confident in our application as we continue to be actively engaged with FDA and move towards our GDUFA goal date. We also had some good developments on generic Copaxone program this quarter. In September, we launch in the generic version of 20-milligrams version of this product in Germany known as CLIP. Multiple sclerosis medicines are among the top cause drivers in Germany, and we believe that the generic version can help provide meaningful cost savings for the German health care system.
In the USA, we are very encouraging that our ANDA for our 20 milligram product is moving forward. We very recently received some additional clarification and questions from agency. But based on the type of questions we can say that we are in the final stretch and we look forward to bringing additional competition to this marketplace.
With regard to Copaxone 40-milligram. You are pleased that the U.S. data mark office ruling in favor of Mylan and our IPF, filing all claims of 3 OpEx and 40-milligram patterns to be on potential. We believe that most of the synergies highly persuaded in detailing the basis for the invalidating of these patients. Last week, we also filed an IPR on a fourth covering the adverse 40-milligram Copaxone product.
In USA, we were pleased to have received approval of our AB-rated generate version of, further demonstrating our ability to develop and manufacture such complex products. With the details on the launch of this product are subject to a confidential settlement.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tony for some additional perspective on the commercial landscape. Thanks."

As Rajiv noted, we have continued to see growth across our global generic business, including in the U.S., where the pricing environment continues to be a topic of much focus. Throughout our history, we have seen many evolutions in our i",651,"Thank you, Rajiv. As Rajiv noted, we have continued to see growth across our global generic business, including in the U.S., where the pricing environment continues to be a topic of much focus. Throughout our history, we have seen many evolutions in our industry. However, our primary keys to success have remained constant, maintaining one of the industry's broadest portfolios, consistent execution of new product launches and being able to reliably supply significant volumes to our customers. Because of this, our relationship with customers continue to not only remain strong, but to thrive given the strength of our portfolio, our reputation for reliability, our shared excitement around our pipeline and our commitment to continuing to deliver high customer service levels.
As we have said consistently, we continue to see pricing across our very broad generics portfolio to be in line with our expectations with year-over-year price erosion in the mid single-digits, including the U.S. We continue to anticipate price erosion in the mid single-digits for the remainder of the year. 
Our business model has never been premised on price increases for our growth, and this remains the case today. In fact, the generic industry is based on vigorous competition driven by supply and demand. Occasionally, prices increase due to market conditions. But in a vast majority of periods, our business has experienced a net deflationary price environment.
Looking ahead in our Generics business. We recently launched with exclusivity our generic versions of Benicar and BenicarHCT with annualized brand sales of almost $2 billion based on IMS. And we expected this to be a strong launch for us. We also see the potential for several other important launches in the fourth quarter.
Additionally, we had to continue to see growth across the majority of our global brands and are pleased with their performance. With respect to EpiPen, while we saw Scripps increase quarter over quarter, volumes were down due to the lack of wholesaler purchases in the quarter in anticipation of our upcoming generic launch.
We have been in extensive dialogue with our customers to ensure successful launch. And at a wholesale acquisition cost of $300, we believe our authorized generic will great significant cost savings for patients and the health care system.
The new assets we have acquired had even further strengthened our expensive portfolio offering for our customers. Our APB brands are already doing well as part of the One Mylan platform, and we see significant potential to translate this success in our learnings to our recent acquisitions.
As we bring Meda and Renaissance into our commercial business, we continue to see opportunities to do more with our combined product portfolio as we optimize our sales force, bring new products into new countries and maximize high potential brands. Additionally, by now having OTC products along with our strong Gx and Rx businesses, we have a broader commercial reached than ever before and greater flexibility and optionality to successfully expand in any geographic market, especially the emerging markets.
With these current assets, combined with our strategic growth drivers, we have a portfolio and pipeline that we believe is second to none. Further, we are well positioned to continue to reduce health care cost for payers and patients as we bring more affordable versions of key drivers of rising pharmaceutical cost to markets around the world. 
With all that said, we recognize, along with many stakeholders in the pharmaceutical industry, the challenging dynamics at play and that we will need to evolve to reflect these dynamics.
As Heather said, we will do our part to lead this dialogue while continuing to serve as an important partner to our customers to ensure that we address these challenges in the right balanced way in order to enhance patient access to affordable medication, reserve and reward innovation and allow for a robust and competitive industry.
With that, I will turn the call over to Ken."

Turning to our financial results. Third quarter revenues grew to $3.1 billion with an increase of 13% over the third quarter of last year. And as Rajiv already noted, our Generics segment grew 17%, while our Spe",736,"Thanks, Tony, and good afternoon, everyone. Turning to our financial results. Third quarter revenues grew to $3.1 billion with an increase of 13% over the third quarter of last year. And as Rajiv already noted, our Generics segment grew 17%, while our Specialty segment declined 4%. The generics pricing environment was consistent with our expectations, declining at the mid-single-digit range overall in the quarter.
The year-over-year impact of currency translation on our third quarter revenues was insignificant. Adjusted gross margins for the third quarter of 2016 were 57%, that's down approximately 100 basis points due to significant contribution from new products in last year's third quarter.
Moving on to our operating expenses on an adjusted basis. R&D investment expanded to $176 million as we continue to invest in our respiratory, insulin and Biologics programs, yet it remained at approximately 6% of total revenues. SG&A expense also, on an adjusted basis, increased to $605 million or approximately 20% of total revenues. The increase is primarily due to the impact of acquisitions.
Our adjusted tax rate was 16% for the quarter, which was in line with our expectations. Adjusted net earnings decreased by $7 million to $726 million compared to $734 million in the prior year quarter, and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.38 compared to $1.43 in the prior year quarter.
As previously announced, during the third quarter, we accrued $465 million for a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice and other government agencies. It was related to the classification of the EpiPen Auto-Injector for purposes of the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.
Mylan continues to work with the government to finalize that settlement. In addition, during the quarter, we agreed with strides to settle substantially all outstanding claims associated with our acquisition of Attila. As a result of the recent settlement, we'll have access to approximately $80 million of currently restricted cash in the fourth quarter of 2016 and we recorded approximately $90 million of expense in the third quarter of 2016. For the 9 months ended September 30, total revenues grew to $7.8 billion, a year-over-year increase of 13%. Adjusted gross margins for the same period were 56%, up approximately 100 basis points from the prior year. 
Adjusted R&D expanded to approximately $533 million and remained an approximately 7% of total revenues consistent with the prior year. Adjusted SG&A expense expanded to approximately $1.6 billion or approximately 22% of total revenues. Again, the increase in SG&A was mainly due to the impact of acquisitions.
Resulting adjusted earnings for the 9 months ended September 30 increased to $188 million -- increased by $18 million to $1.7 billion and adjusted diluted EPS increased 7% to $3.31.
Turning to our cash flow and liquidity. Adjusted cash provided by operating activities was strong, $1.9 billion for the 9 months ended September 30, compared to $1.6 billion for the prior year period. The record performance in the current quarter was the result of continuing to tightly manage our business and effectively manage working capital.
We have no amounts outstanding on our accounts receivables securitization and revolving credit facilities. At the end of Q3, 2016, our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was approximately 3.8x, which includes Meda debt. We are fully committed to our investment-grade rating and reducing our debt and leverage during 2017 towards our target leverage ratio of approximately 3x by the end of the year in 2017. 
We have the financial flexibility to achieve this goal while still deploying capital strategically for bolt-on acquisitions. In addition, as we continue to optimize our capital structure and align it with our more balanced geographic profile, we remain committed to the euro bond market.
Subject to prevailing market conditions, the terms and specific timing are to be determined. We expect our diluted share count to be approximately 535 million shares for the fourth quarter, and that's including the full impact of recognizing the shares issued for the Meda transaction. We also expect our diluted share count for the full year to be approximately 520 million shares.
We look forward to ending the year strong. We're in the process and feel confident with our ability to continue to integrate Meda into Mylan, leveraging our existing outstanding global operating platform. We remain fully committed to our revised 2016 guidance, as communicated in early October, and to achieving our $6 adjusted EPS target in 2018.
With that, we'll now turn the call over for questions."

But it's that mix, that portfolio in our capacity and capability of supplying the demand that's is needed there is what's allowed us to continue to compete in a market that I would say has always been competitive. And lastly, we just say that again, I think as you look at the transactions and the acquisitions that we've done, we've said, it's about what we can do with those assets.

Before we get into the specifics of the quarter, I'd like to provide some perspective on the current state of affairs. 
As we've stated many times, Mylan's great strength lies in our highly diversified and differentiated platform and the tremendous operational and commercial scale we felt over the last decade. This foundation is what allows us to continue to successfully withstand headwinds whenever and wherever they occur. Currently, the segments are originating in the U.S. where the health care system is undergoing rapid and extraordinary change. As we see, for instance, greater attention being paid to the complexity of pharmaceutical pricing and the rapidly growing number of high deductible health plans, which are shifting significant out-of-pocket cost to consumers. We've been living this reality firsthand with EpiPen. And as I've said previously, I wish we had better anticipated the magnitude and acceleration of the rising out-of-pocket cost for a growing minority of patients who may have ended up paying full WACC or more when they went to the pharmacy counter. This is why we took this list an unprecedented action of increasing our savings card program from $100 to $300, doubling the eligibility for our patient assistance program and announcing that we will launch a generic at a WACC price of $300. We expect the launch to occur during the first half of December.
I'm also pleased to note that we filed our application for a new formulation that will extend the product shelf life. We believe that these steps where the right ones to ensure immediate and sustainable cost savings directly to patients in the health care system. 
I'd like to reemphasize that Mylan is much more than any one product and our reach goes far beyond any one market. Throughout these past several weeks, we've drove the discussion about how the U.S. health care system and the supply chain operates and the challenges that lie within it. We have acknowledged that the current system, which we didn't create, but which we must compete in, was not built for consumerism, it cannot be fixed overnight and it needs to be completely reinvented.
It's precisely this opportunity to set new standards in health care and fulfill our mission of providing the world's 7 billion people access to high-quality medicine that lead Mylan a decade ago to begin its transformation into the globally diversified organization we've become today. 
Put another way, we've built Mylan to ensure our sustainability for many years to come. We look forward to being an innovative, constructive and powerful change agent with respect to helping shape the industry's future. In the meantime, we're going to continue optimizing our platform for efficiency and leveraging it for growth. 
As a part of this process, we're now focused on what we call Mylan's integration. Rather than merely folding our recent transaction, meaning EPD, Famy Care, Renaissance and Meda, and to Mylan's existing structure and processes, we're looking for even better ways to organize, optimize and operate our new and expanded company so as to maintain our long-standing track record of delivering strong performance.
For example, for many years, we've been reporting financial performance in terms of 2 segments, generic and specialty. But now that our product portfolio will be effectively integrated across generic, branded and OTC products, we'll move to 3 reporting segments: North America, Europe and Rest of World, starting with the fourth quarter. We will know manage our global platform as one business across all product and channel type. 
Turning to the quarter. Our performance was consistent with our revised full year guidance. On the top line, we generated total revenues of nearly $3.1 billion, a year-over-year increase of 13%. This result was fueled by strong performance across our Europe and Rest of World regions as well as solid performance across our North America region. 
On the bottom line, we delivered adjusted net earnings of $726 million or $1.38 per adjusted diluted share, a year-over-year decline of about 3%, which was primarily driven by the significant contribution in the prior year period of new products.
As we look ahead to Mylan's next chapter, we believe we now have the commercial and operating scale needed to fulfill our mission. As such, our BD efforts going forward will emphasize bolt-on deals. We also remain committed to our investment-grade rating. 
As for our full year financial performance, we remain on track to achieve adjusted EPS within our revised range of $4.70 to $4.90. The majority of the revision is the result of the previously announced changes related to EpiPen and much of its impact occurred in the third quarter. In addition, we remain committed to our $6 adjusted EPS target in 2018 with the targeted growth in the low teens in both 2017 and 2018.
We are anticipating that EpiPen's contribution to be approximately 6% of total sales in 2017. We look forward to discussing Mylan's future, including our guidance for 2017, in greater detail during our next Investor Day event, which we'll host in conjunction with fourth quarter earnings. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our employees around the globe for remaining focused and steadfast and executing to deliver better health for a better world. 
Before turning the call over to Rajiv, I'd like to conclude by stating that while the world may be filled with uncertainty and the future of the U.S. health care system maybe unclear, one thing is certain, the world can count on Mylan to maintain our unwavering commitment to our mission and strategy and continue operating, executing and delivering for the benefit of all of our stakeholders. 
Thank you. Rajiv?"

As Heather noted, despite the public attention paid to Mylan in our EpiPen franchise during the past several months, we remain focused on managing our global business, integrating our acquisitions and executing on the future drivers of our growth. While our sector continues to face challenges, we are very confident in the scent [ph] of our business, our future opportunities, our pipeline and our ability to continue create value for customers, patients and health care systems globally while also continuing to deliver for shareholders.
The credit for this goes to our 40,000 new employees around the world. We'll continue to remain focused on our mission of providing the world's 7 billion people with access to high-quality medication. Thanks to each and every one of them for their commitment to work hard. Now turning to the third quarter.
Overall, our Generics business delivered third-party net sales of approximately $2.6 billion for the quarter, an increase of 17% compared to the prior year quarter. Meda contributed $324 million of these revenues, in line with our expectations. 
In North America, our Generics business grew approximately 1% to just about $1.1 billion on a constant currency basis. Growth came primarily from our acquisitions of both Meda and the Renaissance Topicals Business as well as new product introductions. Note that we have a challenging year-over-year comparison this quarter due to significant contribution from the new products in the last year's third quarter, especially esomeprazole, Lidocaine and Bexarotene. We also experienced increased competition with new entrants on a number of other key products.
The generic pricing environment was again consistent with our expectation and previous guidance. Tony will elaborate on this topic shortly.
In Europe, sales totaled $842 million, a year-over-year increase of approximately 39% on a constant currency basis. The strong result was mainly due to contributions from Meda at the table pricing of our portfolio and sales of new products.
In Rest of World, sales totaled $670 million, a year-over-year increase of 20% on a constant currency basis. The strong growth was due in part to the contributions of Meda business and new expansion markets. We also saw volumes increase across the region, specifically as our HIV tender volumes improve and it gone towards our expected levels. Additionally, Japan, Australia and the rest of emerging markets showed favorable sales on existing products as less benefits of the new product introduction. 
Our specialty delivered revenues of $419 million in the quarter, a year-over-year decrease of 4%. This decrease was primarily the result of the timing of wholesaler purchases of EpiPen, which resulted in lower volumes as well as the actions taken during the quarter to improve access to EpiPen such as the increase in our 2-point program and patient assistance program.
We are making very good progress in what we are calling integrating Mylan, as we bring together all of our recent acquisitions, Meda, Renaissance, the EPD Business and Famy Care with legacy Mylan. We continue to see significant opportunities to optimize our cost base as well as create value by integrating across our branded generics and OTC platform in all of our regions and operating as One Mylan. 
As we continue to learn more about these businesses, we have even greater clarity on the opportunities to create meaningful efficiencies and truly maximize our business for the future in a differentiated way. We will provide details about this enhanced potential during our Investor Day. That said, all of our work today provides us with greater confidence that we will not only achieve the operating synergies as we mentioned provided upon the Meda closing, but potentially exceed them. We also continue to see revenue synergy opportunities as we apply our One Mylan approach to our combined portfolio. With that said, let me turn to some of the significant progress we have made on our key pipeline programs.
Turning first to our biosimilars portfolio. Yesterday, along with our partner, Biocon, we announced the FDA submission of our BLA for our proposed biosimilar trastuzumab through the 351 (K) pathway. This is our first FDA biosimilar submission, and we believe it has the potential to be the first submission of a proposed biosimilar trastuzumab in the U.S. The submitted BLA includes a comprehensive package of analytical similarity, nonclinical and clinical data. The clinical data consist of 2 PK studies and a HERITAGE Phase III confirmatory efficacy and safety trial. 
The results of the HERITAGE trial was presented at this year's ASCO and ESMO conference. Our applications for trastuzumab, pegfilgrastim and Glargine have already been accepted for review by European Medicines Agency. 
For pegfilgrastim, the results from our Phase III clinical efficacy and safety study as well as our PK NPD study have supported our EU application were also presented at ESMO. Our insulin Glargine EMA filing announced last week included analytical, preclinical and clinical data. 
Our preclinical package included our PK NPD studies demonstrating [indiscernible] of our insulin Glargine compared to lenses. Finally, the EU registration [indiscernible], an efficacy and safety clinical trial in type 1 diabetes patient, which successfully demonstrates [indiscernible] of our insulin Glargine with Lantus. We are on track to file our applications for pegfilgrastim and Glargine products with FDA. We continue to generate additional data and work with FDA to establish an interchangeable pathway for our insulin Glargine program. 15% of world's pharmaceutical spend will be on [indiscernible] medicines by 2020. And there is a significant unmet need around the world for more affordable versions of injectable insulin products.
Turning to our partnership with Momenta. We announced last week that dosing has begun in our Phase I study to compare the pharmacokinetics, safety and immunogenicity of M834, a proposed biosimilar of ORENCIA. This is a first product in our portfolio of 6 biosimilar in development, the Momenta, to advance the clinical trial. 
We also recently signed a development and commercialization agreement with Mabion, a Polish bio technology company for [indiscernible] to rituximab in all European countries and non–European Balkan states. Through these various collaborations, we have assessed we have a combined portfolio of 16 biosimilar and insulin analog generic products in development, which gives Mylan one of industry's the largest and most diverse portfolio.
We remain committed to robust investments in this portfolio. It's also worth noting that we have also filed applications for trastuzumab, pegfilgrastim and Glargine in more than 30 other markets around the world combined. It's our broad portfolio of biosimilars insulin, niche respiratory product as well as strong HIV basket and hep C products that will fuel the organic growth of our expansion markets platforms, which has been further enhanced by addition of Meda footprint in these countries.
On the respiratory front. We announced with our partner, Theravance Biopharma, positive results from 2 replicate Phase III efficacy study of revefenacin and investigational LAMA and first once-daily nebulized bronchodilator in development for the treatment of COPD. The data confirms that revefenacin has the potential to offer meaningful benefits to patients with moderate to very severe COPD and represents another exciting milestone in Mylan's global respiratory pipeline. 
Additionally, we look forward to the completion of an ongoing Phase III safety trial in 2017 with the goal of filing an NDA by the end of 2017. We believe Mylan's strong experience with nebulized product's and experienced sales force in the respiratory segment, which has been further enhanced through our Meda transaction will help ensure this product success when approved.
Our generic Advair, we remain confident in our application as we continue to be actively engaged with FDA and move towards our GDUFA goal date. We also had some good developments on generic Copaxone program this quarter. In September, we launch in the generic version of 20-milligrams version of this product in Germany known as CLIP [ph]. Multiple sclerosis medicines are among the top cause drivers in Germany, and we believe that the generic version can help provide meaningful cost savings for the German health care system.
In the U.S.A., we are very encouraged that our ANDA for our [indiscernible] 20-milligram product is moving forward. We very recently received some additional clarification and questions from agency. But based on the type of questions we can say that we are in the final stretch, and we look forward to bringing additional competition to this marketplace.
With regard to Copaxone 40-milligram, we're pleased that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ruled in favor of Mylan in our IPR proceeding, finding all claims of 3 challenge Copaxone 20 40-milligram treatments to be on unpatentable. We believe that most of the CN [ph] is highly persuasive in detailing the basis for the invalidity of these patents. Last week, we also filed an IPR on a fourth patent covering the adverse 40-milligram Copaxone product.
In U.S.A., we were pleased to have received approval of our AB-rated generic version of [indiscernible], further demonstrating our ability to develop and manufacture such complex products. The details on the launch of this product are subject to a confidential settlement.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tony for some additional perspective on the commercial landscape. Thanks."

As Rajiv noted, we have continued to see growth across our global generic business, including in the U.S., where the pricing environment continues to be a topic of much focus. Throughout our history, we have seen many evolutions in our i",647,"Thank you, Rajiv. As Rajiv noted, we have continued to see growth across our global generic business, including in the U.S., where the pricing environment continues to be a topic of much focus. Throughout our history, we have seen many evolutions in our industry. However, our primary keys to success have remained constant, maintaining one of the industry's broadest portfolios, consistent execution of new product launches and being able to reliably supply significant volumes to our customers. Because of this, our relationship with customers continue to not only remain strong, but to thrive given the strength of our portfolio, our reputation for reliability, our shared excitement around our pipeline and our commitment to continuing to deliver high customer service levels.
As we have said consistently, we continue to see pricing across our very broad generics portfolio to be in line with our expectations with year-over-year price erosion in the mid-single digits, including the U.S. We continue to anticipate price erosion in the mid-single digits for the remainder of the year. 
Our business model has never been premised on price increases for our growth, and this remains the case today. In fact, the generic industry is based on vigorous competition driven by supply and demand. Occasionally, prices increase due to market conditions. But in a vast majority of periods, our business has experienced a net deflationary price environment.
Looking ahead in our Generics business. We recently launched with exclusivity our generic versions of Benicar and BenicarHCT with annualized brand sales of almost $2 billion based on IMS. And we expect this to be a strong launch for us. We also see the potential for several other important launches in the fourth quarter.
Additionally, we had continued to see growth across the majority of our global brands and are pleased with their performance. With respect to EpiPen, while we saw scripts increase quarter-over-quarter, volumes were down due to the lack of wholesaler purchases in the quarter in anticipation of our upcoming generic launch.
We have been in extensive dialogue with our customers to ensure successful launch. And at a wholesale acquisition cost of $300, we believe our authorized generic will create significant cost savings for patients and the health care system.
The new assets we have acquired had even further strengthened our expansive portfolio offering for our customers. Our EPD brands are already doing well as part of the One Mylan platform, and we see significant potential to translate this success in our learnings to our recent acquisitions.
As we bring Meda and Renaissance into our commercial business, we continue to see opportunities to do more with our combined product portfolio as we optimize our sales force, bring new products into new countries and maximize high-potential brands. Additionally, by now having OTC products along with our strong Gx and Rx businesses, we have a broader commercial reached than ever before and greater flexibility and optionality to successfully expand in any geographic market, especially the emerging markets.
With these current assets, combined with our strategic growth drivers, we have a portfolio and pipeline that we believe is second to none. Further, we are well positioned to continue to reduce health care cost for payers and patients as we bring more affordable versions of key drivers of rising pharmaceutical cost to markets around the world. 
With all that said, we recognize, along with many stakeholders in the pharmaceutical industry, the challenging dynamics at play and that we will need to evolve to reflect these dynamics.
As Heather said, we will do our part to lead this dialogue while continuing to serve as an important partner to our customers to ensure that we address these challenges in the right balanced way in order to enhance patient access to affordable medication, reserve and reward innovation and allow for a robust and competitive industry.
With that, I will turn the call over to Ken."
290203,404162467,1082149,"Mylan N.V., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 09, 2016",2016-11-09,"Earnings Calls","Viatris Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tony, and good afternoon, everyone. Turning to our financial results. Third quarter revenues grew to $3.1 billion, that's an increase of 13% over the third quarter of last year. And as Rajiv already noted, our Generics segment grew 17%, while our",736,"Thanks, Tony, and good afternoon, everyone. Turning to our financial results. Third quarter revenues grew to $3.1 billion, that's an increase of 13% over the third quarter of last year. And as Rajiv already noted, our Generics segment grew 17%, while our Specialty segment declined 4%. The generics pricing environment was consistent with our expectations, declining at the mid-single-digit range overall in the quarter.
The year-over-year impact of currency translation on our third quarter revenues was insignificant. Adjusted gross margins for the third quarter of 2016 were 57%, and that's down approximately 100 basis points due to significant contribution from new products in last year's third quarter.
Moving on to our operating expenses on an adjusted basis. R&D investment expanded to $176 million as we continue to invest in our respiratory, insulin and Biologics programs, yet it remained at approximately 6% of total revenues. SG&A expense also, on an adjusted basis, increased to $605 million or approximately 20% of total revenues. The increase is primarily due to the impact of acquisitions.
Our adjusted tax rate was 16% for the quarter, which was in line with our expectations. Adjusted net earnings decreased by $7 million to $726 million compared to $734 million in the prior year quarter, and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.38 compared to $1.43 in the prior year quarter.
As previously announced, during the third quarter, we accrued $465 million for a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice and other government agencies that was related to the classification of the EpiPen Auto-Injector for purposes of the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.
Mylan continues to work with the government to finalize that settlement. In addition, during the quarter, we agreed with strides to settle substantially all outstanding claims associated with our acquisition of Agila. As a result of the recent settlement, we'll have access to approximately $80 million of currently restricted cash in the fourth quarter of 2016, and we recorded approximately $90 million of expense in the third quarter of 2016. 
For the 9 months ended September 30, total revenues grew to $7.8 billion, a year-over-year increase of 13%. Adjusted gross margins for the same period were 56%, up approximately 100 basis points from the prior year. 
Adjusted R&D expanded to approximately $533 million and remained an approximately 7% of total revenues consistent with the prior year. Adjusted SG&A expense expanded to approximately $1.6 billion or approximately 22% of total revenues. Again, the increase in SG&A was mainly due to the impact of acquisitions.
Resulting adjusted earnings for the 9 months ended September 30 increased to $188 million -- increased by $188 million to $1.7 billion and adjusted diluted EPS increased 7% to $3.31.
Turning to our cash flow and liquidity. Adjusted cash provided by operating activities was strong, $1.9 billion for the 9 months ended September 30 compared to $1.6 billion for the prior year period. The record performance in the current quarter was the result of continuing to tightly manage our business and effectively manage working capital.
We have no amounts outstanding on our accounts receivables securitization and revolving credit facilities. At the end of Q3 2016, our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was approximately 3.8x, which includes Meda debt. We are fully committed to our investment-grade rating and reducing our debt and leverage during 2017 towards our target leverage ratio of approximately 3x by the end of the year 2017. 
We have the financial flexibility to achieve this goal while still deploying capital strategically for bolt-on acquisitions. In addition, as we continue to optimize our capital structure and align it with our more balanced geographic profile, we remain committed to the euro bond market.
Subject to prevailing market conditions, the terms and specific timing are to be determined. We expect our diluted share count to be approximately 535 million shares for the fourth quarter, and that's including the full impact of recognizing the shares issued for the Meda transaction. We also expect our diluted share count for the full year to be approximately 520 million shares.
We look forward to ending the year strong. We're in the process and feel confident with our ability to continue to integrate Meda into Mylan, leveraging our existing outstanding global operating platform. We remain fully committed to our revised 2016 guidance, as communicated in early October, and to achieving our $6 adjusted EPS target in 2018.
With that, we'll now turn the call over for questions."

So our ability to really maximize and optimize how we go to market in every country, I think we've never had a better opportunity to do so. And then I think of this -- the U.S. space and I again look at our portfolio and our mix is why I think we are able to talk about mid-single-digit erosion. And that has been what we have seen over the recent quarters and years. And I think it's that mix in the breadth of our portfolio, over 630 products in the United States alone over 2,000 globally. But it's that mix, that portfolio in our capacity and capability of supplying the demand that's needed out there is what's allowed us to continue to compete in a market that I would say has always been competitive. And lastly, I would just say that, again, I think as you look at the transactions and the acquisitions that we've done, we've said, it's about what we can do with those assets. And I think we have continue to execute. And as we said in our remarks, these next couple of years really give us the opportunity to leverage the economies of scale.

But at that time, we said that by 2018, that we assume EpiPen would only account for about 5% of revenue. So obviously, as I've said for other reasons and for -- as we look at the competitive landscape, we didn't have that as a major driver, '17 especially then going into '18. So yes, as that pulled forward a little bit that's why we try to quantify and say that we're estimating -- anticipating that about 6% of revenue next year would be to EpiPen. So again, I think that as you look and as you guys know that we're much more than any one product and much more than any one country that all of this differentiation on our product portfolio mix, again, as I said, has allowed us -- this platform has allowed us to absorb these headwinds when they hit, to mitigate them and to manage them. And I hope that in both our response to the EpiPen situation. But again, managing this overall business is allowing us to deliver and giving us the confidence about that $6 target. And as we also said, we see this low mid-teens growth, '17 and '18. And we look forward to coming to you in Investor Day in conjunction with fourth quarter to really detail that out more, but hopefully that gives a little bit when you think about the launches we've got coming.

Before we get into the specifics of the quarter, I'd like to provide some perspective on the current state of affairs. 
As we've stated many times, Mylan's great strength lies in our highly diversified and differentiated platform and the tremendous operational and commercial scale we've built over the last decade. This foundation is what allows us to continue to successfully withstand headwinds whenever and wherever they occur. Currently, those headwinds are originating in the U.S. where the health care system is undergoing rapid and extraordinary change. As we see, for instance, greater attention being paid to the complexity of pharmaceutical pricing and the rapidly growing number of high-deductible health plans, which are shifting significant out-of-pocket cost to consumers. We've been living this reality firsthand with EpiPen. And as I've said previously, I wish we had better anticipated the magnitude and acceleration of the rising out-of-pocket cost for a growing minority of patients who may have ended up paying full WACC or more when they went to the pharmacy counter. This is why we took the swift and unprecedented action of increasing our savings card program from $100 to $300, doubling the eligibility for our patient assistance program and announcing that we will launch a generic at a WACC price of $300. We expect the launch to occur during the first half of December.
I'm also pleased to note that we filed our application for a new formulation that will extend the product shelf life. We believe that these steps were the right ones to ensure immediate and a sustainable cost savings directly to patients in the health care system. 
I'd like to reemphasize that Mylan is much more than any one product and our reach goes far beyond any one market. Throughout these past several weeks, we've drove the discussion about how the U.S. health care system and the supply chain operates and the challenges that lie within it. We have acknowledged that the current system, which we didn't create but which we must compete in, was not built for consumerism, it cannot be fixed overnight and it needs to be completely reinvented.
It's precisely this opportunity to set new standards in health care and fulfill our mission of providing the world's 7 billion people access to high-quality medicine that lead Mylan a decade ago to begin its transformation into the globally diversified organization we've become today. 
Put another way, we've built Mylan to ensure our sustainability for many years to come. We look forward to being an innovative, constructive and powerful change agent with respect to helping shape the industry's future. In the meantime, we're going to continue optimizing our platform for efficiency and leveraging it for growth. 
As a part of this process, we're now focused on what we call Mylan's integration. Rather than merely folding our recent transactions -- meaning EPD, Famy Care, Renaissance and Meda -- into Mylan's existing structure and processes, we're looking for even better ways to organize, optimize and operate our new and expanded company so as to maintain our long-standing track record of delivering strong performance.
For example, for many years, we've been reporting financial performance in terms of 2 segments, generic and specialty. But now that our product portfolio will be effectively integrated across generic, branded and OTC products, we'll move to 3 reporting segments: North America, Europe and Rest of World, starting with the fourth quarter. We will now manage our global platform as one business across all product and channel type. 
Turning to the quarter. Our performance was consistent with our revised full year guidance. On the top line, we generated total revenues of nearly $3.1 billion, a year-over-year increase of 13%. This result was fueled by strong performance across our Europe and Rest of World regions as well as solid performance across our North America region. 
On the bottom line, we delivered adjusted net earnings of $726 million or $1.38 per adjusted diluted share, a year-over-year decline of about 3%, which was primarily driven by the significant contribution in the prior year period of new products.
As we look ahead to Mylan's next chapter, we believe we now have the commercial and operating scale needed to fulfill our mission. As such, our BD efforts going forward will emphasize bolt-on deals. We also remain committed to our investment-grade rating. 
As for our full year financial performance, we remain on track to achieve adjusted EPS within our revised range of $4.70 to $4.90. The majority of the revision is the result of the previously announced changes related to EpiPen and much of its impact occurred in the third quarter. In addition, we remain committed to our $6 adjusted EPS target in 2018 with the targeted growth in the low teens in both 2017 and 2018.
We are anticipating that EpiPen's contribution to be approximately 6% of total sales in 2017. We look forward to discussing Mylan's future, including our guidance for 2017, in greater detail during our next Investor Day event, which we'll host in conjunction with fourth quarter earnings. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our employees around the globe for remaining focused and steadfast and executing to deliver better health for a better world. 
Before turning the call over to Rajiv, I'd like to conclude by stating that while the world may be filled with uncertainty and the future of the U.S. health care system may be unclear, one thing is certain: The world can count on Mylan to maintain our unwavering commitment to our mission and strategy and continue operating, executing and delivering for the benefit of all of our stakeholders. 
Thank you. Rajiv?"

As Heather noted, despite the public attention paid to Mylan and our EpiPen franchise during the past several months, we remain focused on managing our global business, integrating our acquisitions and executing on the future drivers of our growth. While our sector continues to face challenges, we are very confident in the set of our business, our future opportunities, our pipeline and our ability to continue to create value for customers, patients and health care systems globally while also continuing to deliver for shareholders.
The credit for this goes to our 40,000 employees around the world, who continue to remain focused on our mission of providing the world's 7 billion people with access to high-quality medication. Thanks to each and every one of them for their commitment to work hard. Now turning to the third quarter.
Overall, our Generics business delivered third-party net sales of approximately $2.6 billion for the quarter, an increase of 17% compared to the prior year quarter. Meda contributed $324 million of these revenues, in line with our expectations. 
In North America, our Generics business grew approximately 1% to just about $1.1 billion on a constant currency basis. Growth came primarily from our acquisitions of both Meda and the Renaissance Topicals Business as well as new product introductions. Note that we have a challenging year-over-year comparison this quarter due to significant contribution from the new products in the last year's third quarter, especially esomeprazole, Lidocaine and Bexarotene. We also experienced increased competition with new entrants on a number of other key products.
The generic pricing environment was again consistent with our expectation and previous guidance. Tony will elaborate on this topic shortly.
In Europe, sales totaled $842 million, a year-over-year increase of approximately 39% on a constant currency basis. The strong result was mainly due to contributions from Meda and the stable pricing of our portfolio and sales of new products.
In Rest of World, sales totaled $670 million, a year-over-year increase of 20% on a constant currency basis. The strong growth was due in part to the contributions of Meda business and new expansion markets. We also saw volumes increase across the region, specifically as our HIV tender volumes improve and have gone towards our expected levels. Additionally, Japan, Australia and the rest of emerging markets showed favorable sales on existing products as well as benefits of the new product introduction. 
Our specialty delivered revenues of $419 million in the quarter, a year-over-year decrease of 4%. This decrease was primarily the result of the timing of wholesaler purchases of EpiPen, which resulted in lower volumes as well as the actions taken during the quarter to improve access to EpiPen such as the increase in our 2-point program and patient assistance program.
We are making very good progress in what we are calling integrating Mylan, as we bring together all of our recent acquisitions -- Meda, Renaissance, the EPD Business and Famy Care -- with legacy Mylan. We continue to see significant opportunities to optimize our cost base as well as create value by integrating across our branded generics and OTC platforms in all of our regions and operating as One Mylan. 
As we continue to learn more about these businesses, we have even greater clarity on the opportunities to create meaningful efficiencies and truly maximize our business for the future in a differentiated way. We will provide details about this enhanced potential during our Investor Day. That said, all of our work today provides us with greater confidence that we will not only achieve the operating synergies that we mentioned provided upon the Meda closing, but potentially exceed them. We also continue to see revenue synergy opportunities as we apply our One Mylan approach to our combined portfolio. With that said, let me turn to some of the significant progress we have made on our key pipeline programs.
Turning first to our biosimilars portfolio. Yesterday, along with our partner, Biocon, we announced the FDA submission of our BLA for our proposed biosimilar trastuzumab through the 351 (K) pathway. This is our first FDA biosimilar submission, and we believe it has the potential to be the first submission of a proposed biosimilar trastuzumab in the U.S. The submitted BLA includes a comprehensive package of analytical similarity, nonclinical and clinical data. The clinical data consists of 2 PK studies and a HERITAGE Phase III confirmatory efficacy and safety trial. 
The results of the HERITAGE trial was presented at this year's ASCO and ESMO conference. Our applications for trastuzumab, pegfilgrastim and Glargine have already been accepted for review by European Medicines Agency. 
For pegfilgrastim, the results from our Phase III clinical efficacy and safety study as well as our PK NPD study that supported our EU application were also presented at ESMO. Our insulin Glargine EMA filing announced last week included analytical, preclinical and clinical data. 
Our preclinical package included our PK NPD studies demonstrating [indiscernible] of our insulin Glargine compared to Lantus. Finally, the EU registration relies upon an efficacy and safety clinical trial in type 1 diabetes patients, which successfully demonstrates equivalence of our insulin Glargine with Lantus. We are on track to file our applications for pegfilgrastim and Glargine products with FDA. We continue to generate additional data and work with FDA to establish an interchangeable pathway for our insulin Glargine program. 15% of world's pharmaceutical spend will be on type of these medicines by 2020. And there is a significant unmet need around the world for more affordable versions of injectable insulin products.
Turning to our partnership with Momenta. We announced last week that dosing has begun in our Phase I study to compare the pharmacokinetics, safety and immunogenicity of M834, a proposed biosimilar of ORENCIA. This is the first product in our portfolio of 6 biosimilars in development with Momenta, to advance the clinical trial. 
We also recently signed a development and commercialization agreement with Mabion, a Polish biotechnology company for a license to rituximab in all European countries and non–European Balkan states. Through these various collaborations, we have access to a combined portfolio of 16 biosimilar and insulin analog generic products in development, which gives Mylan one of industry's the largest and most diverse portfolio.
We remain committed to robust investments in this portfolio. It's also worth noting that we have also filed applications for trastuzumab, pegfilgrastim and Glargine in more than 30 other markets around the world combined. It's our broad portfolio of biosimilars, insulin, niche respiratory products as well as strong HIV bucket and hep C products that will fuel the organic growth of our expansion markets platforms, which have been further enhanced by addition of Meda footprint in these countries.
On the respiratory front. We announced with our partner, Theravance Biopharma, positive results from 2 replicate Phase III efficacy studies of revefenacin and investigational LAMA and the first once-daily nebulized bronchodilator in development for the treatment of COPD. The data confirms that revefenacin has the potential to offer meaningful benefits to patients with moderate to very severe COPD and represents another exciting milestone in Mylan's global respiratory pipeline. 
Additionally, we look forward to the completion of an ongoing Phase III safety trial in 2017 with the goal of filing an NDA by the end of 2017. We believe Mylan's strong experience with nebulized products and experienced sales force in the respiratory segment, which has been further enhanced through our Meda transaction will help ensure this product success when approved.
Our generic Advair, we remain confident in our application as we continue to be actively engaged with FDA and move towards our GDUFA goal date. We also had some good developments on generic Copaxone program this quarter. In September, we launched a generic version of 20-milligrams version of this product in Germany known as CLIP [ph]. Multiple sclerosis medicines are among the top cost drivers in Germany, and we believe that the generic version can help provide meaningful cost savings for the German health care system.
In the U.S.A., we are very encouraged that our ANDA for our [indiscernible] 20-milligram product is moving forward. We very recently received some additional clarification and questions from agency. But based on the type of questions, we can say that we are in the final stretch, and we look forward to bringing additional competition to this marketplace.
With regard to Copaxone 40-milligram, we're pleased that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ruled in favor of Mylan in our IPR proceedings, finding all claims of 3 challenge Copaxone 40-milligram treatments to be unpatentable. We believe the most of the CN [ph] is highly persuasive in detailing the basis for the invalidity of these patents. Last week, we also filed an IPR on a fourth patent covering the adverse 40-milligram Copaxone product.
In the U.S.A., we were pleased to have received approval of our AB-rated generic version of Concerta, further demonstrating our ability to develop and manufacture such complex products. The details on the launch of this product are subject to a confidential settlement.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tony for some additional perspective on the commercial landscape. Thanks."

As Rajiv noted, we have continued to see growth across our global generic business, including in the U.S., where the pricing environment continues to be a topic of much focus. Throughout our history, we have seen many evolutions in our i",647,"Thank you, Rajiv. As Rajiv noted, we have continued to see growth across our global generic business, including in the U.S., where the pricing environment continues to be a topic of much focus. Throughout our history, we have seen many evolutions in our industry. However, our primary keys to success have remained constant: Maintaining one of the industry's broadest portfolios, consistent execution of new product launches and being able to reliably supply significant volumes to our customers. Because of this, our relationship with customers continues to not only remain strong, but to thrive given the strength of our portfolio, our reputation for reliability, our shared excitement around our pipeline and our commitment to continuing to deliver high customer service levels.
As we have said consistently, we continue to see pricing across our very broad generics portfolio to be in line with our expectations with year-over-year price erosion in the mid-single digits, including the U.S. We continue to anticipate price erosion in the mid-single digits for the remainder of the year. 
Our business model has never been premised on price increases for our growth, and this remains the case today. In fact, the generic industry is based on vigorous competition driven by supply and demand. Occasionally, prices increase due to market conditions. But in a vast majority of periods, our business has experienced a net deflationary price environment.
Looking ahead in our Generics business, we recently launched with exclusivity our generic versions of Benicar and BenicarHCT with annualized brand sales of almost $2 billion based on IMS. And we expect this to be a strong launch for us. We also see the potential for several other important launches in the fourth quarter.
Additionally, we have continued to see growth across the majority of our global brands and are pleased with their performance. With respect to EpiPen, while we saw scripts increase quarter-over-quarter, volumes were down due to the lack of wholesaler purchases in the quarter in anticipation of our upcoming generic launch.
We have been in extensive dialogue with our customers to ensure successful launch. And at a wholesale acquisition cost of $300, we believe our authorized generic will create significant cost savings for patients and the health care system.
The new assets we have acquired have even further strengthened our expansive portfolio offering for our customers. Our EPD brands are already doing well as part of the One Mylan platform, and we see significant potential to translate this success in our learnings to our recent acquisitions.
As we bring Meda and Renaissance into our commercial business, we continue to see opportunities to do more with our combined product portfolio as we optimize our sales force, bring new products into new countries and maximize high-potential brands. Additionally, by now having OTC products along with our strong Gx and Rx businesses, we have a broader commercial reach than ever before and greater flexibility and optionality to successfully expand in any geographic market, especially the emerging markets.
With these current assets, combined with our strategic growth drivers, we have a portfolio and pipeline that we believe is second to none. Further, we are well positioned to continue to reduce health care costs for payers and patients as we bring more affordable versions of key drivers of rising pharmaceutical cost to markets around the world. 
With all that said, we recognize, along with many stakeholders in the pharmaceutical industry, the challenging dynamics at play and that we will need to evolve to reflect these dynamics.
As Heather said, we will do our part to lead this dialogue while continuing to serve as an important partner to our customers to ensure that we address these challenges in the right, balanced way in order to enhance patient access to affordable medication, reserve and reward innovation and allow for a robust and competitive industry.
With that, I will turn the call over to Ken."

Turning to our financial results. Third quarter revenues grew to $3.1 billion, that's an increase of 13% over the third quarter of last year. And as Rajiv already noted, our Generics segment grew 17%, while our",735,"Thanks, Tony, and good afternoon, everyone. Turning to our financial results. Third quarter revenues grew to $3.1 billion, that's an increase of 13% over the third quarter of last year. And as Rajiv already noted, our Generics segment grew 17%, while our Specialty segment declined 4%. The generics pricing environment was consistent with our expectations, declining at a mid-single-digit rate overall in the quarter.
The year-over-year impact of currency translation on our third quarter revenues was insignificant. Adjusted gross margins for the third quarter of 2016 were 57%, and that's down approximately 100 basis points due to significant contribution from new products in last year's third quarter.
Moving on to our operating expenses on an adjusted basis. R&D investment expanded to $176 million as we continue to invest in our respiratory, insulin and Biologics programs, yet it remained at approximately 6% of total revenues. SG&A expense also, on an adjusted basis, increased to $605 million or approximately 20% of total revenues. The increase is primarily due to the impact of acquisitions.
Our adjusted tax rate was 16% for the quarter, which was in line with our expectations. Adjusted net earnings decreased by $7 million to $726 million compared to $734 million in the prior year quarter, and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.38 compared to $1.43 in the prior year quarter.
As previously announced, during the third quarter, we accrued $465 million for a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice and other government agencies that was related to the classification of the EpiPen Auto-Injector for purposes of the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.
Mylan continues to work with the government to finalize that settlement. In addition, during the quarter, we agreed with Strides to settle substantially all outstanding claims associated with our acquisition of Agila. As a result of the recent settlement, we'll have access to approximately $80 million of currently restricted cash in the fourth quarter of 2016, and we recorded approximately $90 million of expense in the third quarter of 2016. 
For the 9 months ended September 30, total revenues grew to $7.8 billion, a year-over-year increase of 13%. Adjusted gross margins for the same period were 56%, up approximately 100 basis points from the prior year. 
Adjusted R&D expanded to approximately $533 million and remained at approximately 7% of total revenues, consistent with the prior year. Adjusted SG&A expense expanded to approximately $1.6 billion or approximately 22% of total revenues. Again, the increase in SG&A was mainly due to the impact of acquisitions.
Resulting adjusted earnings for the 9 months ended September 30 increased to $188 million -- increased by $188 million to $1.7 billion and adjusted diluted EPS increased 7% to $3.31.
Turning to our cash flow and liquidity. Adjusted cash provided by operating activities was strong, $1.9 billion for the 9 months ended September 30 compared to $1.6 billion for the prior year period. The record performance in the current quarter was the result of continuing to tightly manage our business and effectively manage working capital.
We have no amounts outstanding on our accounts receivables securitization and revolving credit facilities. At the end of Q3 2016, our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was approximately 3.8x, which includes Meda debt. We are fully committed to our investment-grade rating and reducing our debt and leverage during 2017 towards our target leverage ratio of approximately 3x by the end of the year 2017. 
We have the financial flexibility to achieve this goal while still deploying capital strategically for bolt-on acquisitions. In addition, as we continue to optimize our capital structure and align it with our more-balanced geographic profile, we remain committed to the euro bond market.
Subject to prevailing market conditions, the terms and specific timing are to be determined. We expect our diluted share count to be approximately 535 million shares for the fourth quarter, and that's including the full impact of recognizing the shares issued for the Meda transaction. We also expect our diluted share count for the full year to be approximately 520 million shares.
We look forward to ending the year strong. We're in the process and feel confident with our ability to continue to integrate Meda into Mylan, leveraging our existing outstanding global operating platform. We remain fully committed to our revised 2016 guidance, as communicated in early October, and to achieving our $6 adjusted EPS target in 2018.
With that, we'll now turn the call over for questions."

So our ability to really maximize and optimize how we go to market in every country, I think we've never had a better opportunity to do so. And then I think of this -- the U.S. space and I again look at our portfolio and our mix is why I think we are able to talk about mid-single-digit erosion. And that has been what we have seen over the recent quarters and years. And I think it's that mix in the breadth of our portfolio, over 630 products in the United States alone, over 2,000 globally. But it's that mix, that portfolio in our capacity and capability of supplying the demand that's needed out there is what's allowed us to continue to compete in a market that I would say has always been competitive. And lastly, I would just say that, again, I think as you look at the transactions and the acquisitions that we've done, we've said it's about what we can do with those assets. And I think we have continued to execute. And as we said in our remarks, these next couple of years really give us the opportunity to leverage the economies of scale.

So obviously, as I've said for other reasons and for -- as we look at the competitive landscape, we didn't have that as a major driver, '17 especially then going into '18. So yes, as that pulled forward a little bit that's why we try to quantify and say that we're estimating -- anticipating that about 6% of revenue next year would be to EpiPen. So again, I think that as you look and as you guys know that we're much more than any one product and much more than any one country, that all of this differentiation in our product portfolio mix, again, as I said, has allowed us -- this platform has allowed us to absorb these headwinds when they hit, to mitigate them and to manage them. And I hope that in both our response to the EpiPen situation, but again, managing this overall business is allowing us to deliver and giving us the confidence about that $6 target. And as we also said, we see this low mid-teens growth, '17 and '18. And we look forward to coming to you in Investor Day in conjunction with fourth quarter to really detail that out more, but hopefully that gives a little bit when you think about the launches we've got coming. When you look at the business, again, across the globe and now, the diversification outside of the U.S. That you can start seeing a real clear pathway to how we're going to get there."

Before we get into the specifics of the quarter, I'd like to provide some perspective on the current state of affairs.

Before we get into the specifics of the quarter, I'd like to provide some perspective on the current state of affairs. 
As we've stated many times, Mylan's great strength lies in our highly diversified and differentiated platform and the tremendous operational and commercial scale we've built over the last decade. This foundation is what allows us to continue to successfully withstand headwinds whenever and wherever they occur. Currently, those headwinds are originating in the U.S. where the health care system is undergoing rapid and extraordinary change. As we see, for instance, greater attention being paid to the complexity of pharmaceutical pricing and the rapidly growing number of high-deductible health plans, which are shifting significant out-of-pocket cost to consumers. We've been living this reality firsthand with EpiPen. And as I've said previously, I wish we had better anticipated the magnitude and acceleration of the rising out-of-pocket cost for a growing minority of patients who may have ended up paying full WACC or more when they went to the pharmacy counter. This is why we took the swift and unprecedented action of increasing our savings card program from $100 to $300, doubling the eligibility for our patient assistance program and announcing that we will launch a generic at a WACC price of $300. We expect the launch to occur during the first half of December.
I'm also pleased to note that we filed our application for a new formulation that will extend the product shelf life. We believe that these steps were the right ones to ensure immediate and a sustainable cost savings directly to patients in the health care system. 
I'd like to reemphasize that Mylan is much more than any one product and our reach goes far beyond any one market. Throughout these past several weeks, we've drove the discussion about how the U.S. health care system and the supply chain operates and the challenges that lie within it. We have acknowledged that the current system, which we didn't create but which we must compete in, was not built for consumerism, it cannot be fixed overnight and it needs to be completely reinvented.
It's precisely this opportunity to set new standards in health care and fulfill our mission of providing the world's 7 billion people access to high-quality medicine that lead Mylan a decade ago to begin its transformation into the globally diversified organization we've become today. 
Put another way, we've built Mylan to ensure our sustainability for many years to come. We look forward to being an innovative, constructive and powerful change agent with respect to helping shape the industry's future. In the meantime, we're going to continue optimizing our platform for efficiency and leveraging it for growth. 
As a part of this process, we're now focused on what we call Mylan's integration. Rather than merely folding our recent transactions -- meaning EPD, Famy Care, Renaissance and Meda -- into Mylan's existing structure and processes, we're looking for even better ways to organize, optimize and operate our new and expanded company so as to maintain our long-standing track record of delivering strong performance.
For example, for many years, we've been reporting financial performance in terms of 2 segments, generic and specialty. But now that our product portfolio will be effectively integrated across generic, branded and OTC products, we'll move to 3 reporting segments: North America, Europe and Rest of World, starting with the fourth quarter. We will now manage our global platform as one business across all product and channel type. 
Turning to the quarter. Our performance was consistent with our revised full year guidance. On the top line, we generated total revenues of nearly $3.1 billion, a year-over-year increase of 13%. This result was fueled by strong performance across our Europe and Rest of World regions as well as solid performance across our North America region. 
On the bottom line, we delivered adjusted net earnings of $726 million or $1.38 per adjusted diluted share, a year-over-year decline of about 3%, which was primarily driven by the significant contribution in the prior year period of new products.
As we look ahead to Mylan's next chapter, we believe we now have the commercial and operating scale needed to fulfill our mission. As such, our BD efforts going forward will emphasize bolt-on deals. We also remain committed to our investment-grade rating. 
As for our full year financial performance, we remain on track to achieve adjusted EPS within our revised range of $4.70 to $4.90. The majority of the revision is the result of the previously announced changes related to EpiPen and much of its impact occurred in the third quarter. In addition, we remain committed to our $6 adjusted EPS target in 2018 with the targeted growth in the low teens in both 2017 and 2018.
We are anticipating that EpiPen's contribution to be approximately 6% of total sales in 2017. We look forward to discussing Mylan's future, including our guidance for 2017, in greater detail during our next Investor Day event, which we'll host in conjunction with fourth quarter earnings. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our employees around the globe for remaining focused and steadfast and executing to deliver better health for a better world. 
Before turning the call over to Rajiv, I'd like to conclude by stating that while the world may be filled with uncertainty and the future of the U.S. health care system may be unclear, one thing is certain: The world can count on Mylan to maintain our unwavering commitment to our mission and strategy and continue operating, executing and delivering for the benefit of all of our stakeholders. 
Thank you. Rajiv?"

As Heather noted, despite the public attention paid to Mylan and our EpiPen franchise during the past several months, we remain focused on managing our global business, integrating our acquisitions and executing on the future drivers of our growth. While our sector continues to face challenges, we are very confident in the set of our business, our future opportunities, our pipeline and our ability to continue to create value for customers, patients and health care systems globally while also continuing to deliver for shareholders.
The credit for this goes to our 40,000 employees around the world, who continue to remain focused on our mission of providing the world's 7 billion people with access to high-quality medication. Thanks to each and every one of them for their commitment to work hard. Now turning to the third quarter.
Overall, our Generics business delivered third-party net sales of approximately $2.6 billion for the quarter, an increase of 17% compared to the prior year quarter. Meda contributed $324 million of these revenues, in line with our expectations. 
In North America, our Generics business grew approximately 1% to just about $1.1 billion on a constant currency basis. Growth came primarily from our acquisitions of both Meda and the Renaissance Topicals Business as well as new product introductions. Note that we have a challenging year-over-year comparison this quarter due to significant contribution from the new products in the last year's third quarter, especially esomeprazole, Lidocaine and Bexarotene. We also experienced increased competition with new entrants on a number of other key products.
The generic pricing environment was again consistent with our expectation and previous guidance. Tony will elaborate on this topic shortly.
In Europe, sales totaled $842 million, a year-over-year increase of approximately 39% on a constant currency basis. The strong result was mainly due to contributions from Meda and the stable pricing of our portfolio and sales of new products.
In Rest of World, sales totaled $670 million, a year-over-year increase of 20% on a constant currency basis. The strong growth was due in part to the contributions of Meda business and new expansion markets. We also saw volumes increase across the region, specifically as our HIV tender volumes improve and have gone towards our expected levels. Additionally, Japan, Australia and the rest of emerging markets showed favorable sales on existing products as well as benefits of the new product introduction. 
Our specialty delivered revenues of $419 million in the quarter, a year-over-year decrease of 4%. This decrease was primarily the result of the timing of wholesaler purchases of EpiPen, which resulted in lower volumes as well as the actions taken during the quarter to improve access to EpiPen such as the increase in our 2-point program and patient assistance program.
We are making very good progress in what we are calling integrating Mylan, as we bring together all of our recent acquisitions -- Meda, Renaissance, the EPD Business and Famy Care -- with legacy Mylan. We continue to see significant opportunities to optimize our cost base as well as create value by integrating across our branded generics and OTC platforms in all of our regions and operating as One Mylan. 
As we continue to learn more about these businesses, we have even greater clarity on the opportunities to create meaningful efficiencies and truly maximize our business for the future in a differentiated way. We will provide details about this enhanced potential during our Investor Day. That said, all of our work today provides us with greater confidence that we will not only achieve the operating synergies that we mentioned provided upon the Meda closing, but potentially exceed them. We also continue to see revenue synergy opportunities as we apply our One Mylan approach to our combined portfolio. With that said, let me turn to some of the significant progress we have made on our key pipeline programs.
Turning first to our biosimilars portfolio. Yesterday, along with our partner, Biocon, we announced the FDA submission of our BLA for our proposed biosimilar trastuzumab through the 351 (K) pathway. This is our first FDA biosimilar submission, and we believe it has the potential to be the first submission of a proposed biosimilar trastuzumab in the U.S. The submitted BLA includes a comprehensive package of analytical similarity, nonclinical and clinical data. The clinical data consists of 2 PK studies and a HERITAGE Phase III confirmatory efficacy and safety trial. 
The results of the HERITAGE trial was presented at this year's ASCO and ESMO conference. Our applications for trastuzumab, pegfilgrastim and Glargine have already been accepted for review by European Medicines Agency. 
For pegfilgrastim, the results from our Phase III clinical efficacy and safety study as well as our PK NPD study that supported our EU application were also presented at ESMO. Our insulin Glargine EMA filing announced last week included analytical, preclinical and clinical data. 
Our preclinical package included our PK NPD studies demonstrating [indiscernible] of our insulin Glargine compared to Lantus. Finally, the EU registration relies upon an efficacy and safety clinical trial in type 1 diabetes patients, which successfully demonstrates equivalence of our insulin Glargine with Lantus. We are on track to file our applications for pegfilgrastim and Glargine products with FDA. We continue to generate additional data and work with FDA to establish an interchangeable pathway for our insulin Glargine program. 15% of world's pharmaceutical spend will be on type of these medicines by 2020. And there is a significant unmet need around the world for more affordable versions of injectable insulin products.
Turning to our partnership with Momenta. We announced last week that dosing has begun in our Phase I study to compare the pharmacokinetics, safety and immunogenicity of M834, a proposed biosimilar of ORENCIA. This is the first product in our portfolio of 6 biosimilars in development with Momenta, to advance the clinical trial. 
We also recently signed a development and commercialization agreement with Mabion, a Polish biotechnology company for a license to rituximab in all European countries and non–European Balkan states. Through these various collaborations, we have access to a combined portfolio of 16 biosimilar and insulin analog generic products in development, which gives Mylan one of industry's the largest and most diverse portfolio.
We remain committed to robust investments in this portfolio. It's also worth noting that we have also filed applications for trastuzumab, pegfilgrastim and Glargine in more than 30 other markets around the world combined. It's our broad portfolio of biosimilars, insulin, niche respiratory products as well as strong HIV bucket and hep C products that will fuel the organic growth of our expansion markets platforms, which have been further enhanced by addition of Meda footprint in these countries.
On the respiratory front. We announced with our partner, Theravance Biopharma, positive results from 2 replicate Phase III efficacy studies of revefenacin and investigational LAMA and the first once-daily nebulized bronchodilator in development for the treatment of COPD. The data confirms that revefenacin has the potential to offer meaningful benefits to patients with moderate to very severe COPD and represents another exciting milestone in Mylan's global respiratory pipeline. 
Additionally, we look forward to the completion of an ongoing Phase III safety trial in 2017 with the goal of filing an NDA by the end of 2017. We believe Mylan's strong experience with nebulized products and experienced sales force in the respiratory segment, which has been further enhanced through our Meda transaction will help ensure this product success when approved.
Our generic Advair, we remain confident in our application as we continue to be actively engaged with FDA and move towards our GDUFA goal date. We also had some good developments on generic Copaxone program this quarter. In September, we launched a generic version of 20-milligrams version of this product in Germany known as CLIP [ph]. Multiple sclerosis medicines are among the top cost drivers in Germany, and we believe that the generic version can help provide meaningful cost savings for the German health care system.
In the U.S.A., we are very encouraged that our ANDA for our [indiscernible] 20-milligram product is moving forward. We very recently received some additional clarification and questions from agency. But based on the type of questions, we can say that we are in the final stretch, and we look forward to bringing additional competition to this marketplace.
With regard to Copaxone 40-milligram, we're pleased that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ruled in favor of Mylan in our IPR proceedings, finding all claims of 3 challenge Copaxone 40-milligram treatments to be unpatentable. We believe the most of the CN [ph] is highly persuasive in detailing the basis for the invalidity of these patents. Last week, we also filed an IPR on a fourth patent covering the adverse 40-milligram Copaxone product.
In the U.S.A., we were pleased to have received approval of our AB-rated generic version of Concerta, further demonstrating our ability to develop and manufacture such complex products. The details on the launch of this product are subject to a confidential settlement.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tony for some additional perspective on the commercial landscape. Thanks."

As Rajiv noted, we have continued to see growth across our global generic business, including in the U.S., where the pricing environment continues to be a topic of much focus. Throughout our history, we have seen many evolutions in our i",647,"Thank you, Rajiv. As Rajiv noted, we have continued to see growth across our global generic business, including in the U.S., where the pricing environment continues to be a topic of much focus. Throughout our history, we have seen many evolutions in our industry. However, our primary keys to success have remained constant: Maintaining one of the industry's broadest portfolios, consistent execution of new product launches and being able to reliably supply significant volumes to our customers. Because of this, our relationship with customers continues to not only remain strong, but to thrive given the strength of our portfolio, our reputation for reliability, our shared excitement around our pipeline and our commitment to continuing to deliver high customer service levels.
As we have said consistently, we continue to see pricing across our very broad generics portfolio to be in line with our expectations with year-over-year price erosion in the mid-single digits, including the U.S. We continue to anticipate price erosion in the mid-single digits for the remainder of the year. 
Our business model has never been premised on price increases for our growth, and this remains the case today. In fact, the generic industry is based on vigorous competition driven by supply and demand. Occasionally, prices increase due to market conditions. But in a vast majority of periods, our business has experienced a net deflationary price environment.
Looking ahead in our Generics business, we recently launched with exclusivity our generic versions of Benicar and BenicarHCT with annualized brand sales of almost $2 billion based on IMS. And we expect this to be a strong launch for us. We also see the potential for several other important launches in the fourth quarter.
Additionally, we have continued to see growth across the majority of our global brands and are pleased with their performance. With respect to EpiPen, while we saw scripts increase quarter-over-quarter, volumes were down due to the lack of wholesaler purchases in the quarter in anticipation of our upcoming generic launch.
We have been in extensive dialogue with our customers to ensure successful launch. And at a wholesale acquisition cost of $300, we believe our authorized generic will create significant cost savings for patients and the health care system.
The new assets we have acquired have even further strengthened our expansive portfolio offering for our customers. Our EPD brands are already doing well as part of the One Mylan platform, and we see significant potential to translate this success in our learnings to our recent acquisitions.
As we bring Meda and Renaissance into our commercial business, we continue to see opportunities to do more with our combined product portfolio as we optimize our sales force, bring new products into new countries and maximize high-potential brands. Additionally, by now having OTC products along with our strong Gx and Rx businesses, we have a broader commercial reach than ever before and greater flexibility and optionality to successfully expand in any geographic market, especially the emerging markets.
With these current assets, combined with our strategic growth drivers, we have a portfolio and pipeline that we believe is second to none. Further, we are well positioned to continue to reduce health care costs for payers and patients as we bring more affordable versions of key drivers of rising pharmaceutical cost to markets around the world. 
With all that said, we recognize, along with many stakeholders in the pharmaceutical industry, the challenging dynamics at play and that we will need to evolve to reflect these dynamics.
As Heather said, we will do our part to lead this dialogue while continuing to serve as an important partner to our customers to ensure that we address these challenges in the right, balanced way in order to enhance patient access to affordable medication, reserve and reward innovation and allow for a robust and competitive industry.
With that, I will turn the call over to Ken."

Turning to our financial results. Third quarter revenues grew to $3.1 billion, that's an increase of 13% over the third quarter of last year. And as Rajiv already noted, our Generics segment grew 17%, while our",735,"Thanks, Tony, and good afternoon, everyone. Turning to our financial results. Third quarter revenues grew to $3.1 billion, that's an increase of 13% over the third quarter of last year. And as Rajiv already noted, our Generics segment grew 17%, while our Specialty segment declined 4%. The generics pricing environment was consistent with our expectations, declining at a mid-single-digit rate overall in the quarter.
The year-over-year impact of currency translation on our third quarter revenues was insignificant. Adjusted gross margins for the third quarter of 2016 were 57%, and that's down approximately 100 basis points due to significant contribution from new products in last year's third quarter.
Moving on to our operating expenses on an adjusted basis. R&D investment expanded to $176 million as we continue to invest in our respiratory, insulin and Biologics programs, yet it remained at approximately 6% of total revenues. SG&A expense also, on an adjusted basis, increased to $605 million or approximately 20% of total revenues. The increase is primarily due to the impact of acquisitions.
Our adjusted tax rate was 16% for the quarter, which was in line with our expectations. Adjusted net earnings decreased by $7 million to $726 million compared to $734 million in the prior year quarter, and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.38 compared to $1.43 in the prior year quarter.
As previously announced, during the third quarter, we accrued $465 million for a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice and other government agencies that was related to the classification of the EpiPen Auto-Injector for purposes of the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.
Mylan continues to work with the government to finalize that settlement. In addition, during the quarter, we agreed with Strides to settle substantially all outstanding claims associated with our acquisition of Agila. As a result of the recent settlement, we'll have access to approximately $80 million of currently restricted cash in the fourth quarter of 2016, and we recorded approximately $90 million of expense in the third quarter of 2016. 
For the 9 months ended September 30, total revenues grew to $7.8 billion, a year-over-year increase of 13%. Adjusted gross margins for the same period were 56%, up approximately 100 basis points from the prior year. 
Adjusted R&D expanded to approximately $533 million and remained at approximately 7% of total revenues, consistent with the prior year. Adjusted SG&A expense expanded to approximately $1.6 billion or approximately 22% of total revenues. Again, the increase in SG&A was mainly due to the impact of acquisitions.
Resulting adjusted earnings for the 9 months ended September 30 increased to $188 million -- increased by $188 million to $1.7 billion and adjusted diluted EPS increased 7% to $3.31.
Turning to our cash flow and liquidity. Adjusted cash provided by operating activities was strong, $1.9 billion for the 9 months ended September 30 compared to $1.6 billion for the prior year period. The record performance in the current quarter was the result of continuing to tightly manage our business and effectively manage working capital.
We have no amounts outstanding on our accounts receivables securitization and revolving credit facilities. At the end of Q3 2016, our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was approximately 3.8x, which includes Meda debt. We are fully committed to our investment-grade rating and reducing our debt and leverage during 2017 towards our target leverage ratio of approximately 3x by the end of the year 2017. 
We have the financial flexibility to achieve this goal while still deploying capital strategically for bolt-on acquisitions. In addition, as we continue to optimize our capital structure and align it with our more-balanced geographic profile, we remain committed to the euro bond market.
Subject to prevailing market conditions, the terms and specific timing are to be determined. We expect our diluted share count to be approximately 535 million shares for the fourth quarter, and that's including the full impact of recognizing the shares issued for the Meda transaction. We also expect our diluted share count for the full year to be approximately 520 million shares.
We look forward to ending the year strong. We're in the process and feel confident with our ability to continue to integrate Meda into Mylan, leveraging our existing outstanding global operating platform. We remain fully committed to our revised 2016 guidance, as communicated in early October, and to achieving our $6 adjusted EPS target in 2018.
With that, we'll now turn the call over for questions."

So our ability to really maximize and optimize how we go to market in every country, I think we've never had a better opportunity to do so. And then I think of this -- the U.S. space and I again look at our portfolio and our mix is why I think we are able to talk about mid-single-digit erosion. And that has been what we have seen over the recent quarters and years. And I think it's that mix in the breadth of our portfolio, over 630 products in the United States alone, over 2,000 globally. But it's that mix, that portfolio in our capacity and capability of supplying the demand that's needed out there is what's allowed us to continue to compete in a market that I would say has always been competitive. And lastly, I would just say that, again, I think as you look at the transactions and the acquisitions that we've done, we've said it's about what we can do with those assets. And I think we have continued to execute. And as we said in our remarks, these next couple of years really give us the opportunity to leverage the economies of scale.

Here's what I'd say, I think that we certainly continue to look for the opportunity for the facts to catch up to the story and the headlines that have been out there, and I think with the election behind us, that opportunity for the facts to be heard in a better, digestible way. We're going to continue to work on that. As far as blaming the system. Again, that is not what we said. What we did is start a discussion about the transparency that's needed and that people understand the complexity around the pricing. And I think that obviously, not only did we, yes, start that discussion and happy to see that, that discussion has continued with many other company executives talking about the gross to net and that the entire -- everybody needs to come together and sit around the table and talk about a solution; that you can't do it piecemeal, you can't try to do it by legislating a certain slice of it. So we absolutely hope and will obviously continue to drive not only that discussion, but look for solutions. As I said in my opening remarks, we need to -- the system needs reinvention across the health care -- across the entire U.S. health care landscape.

So the $6, when we launched it back in the 2013 Investor Day, certainly included a component for acquisition because that's part of what we've been doing with the business and a lot of the discussion you heard today around broadening the portfolio inside the U.S. as well as across the world. So there is an acquisition component to that. We'll update you on what that road map might look like when we do Investor Day to give you a little bit more specifics around it. But I'll tell you, you've heard us say since we've done the Meda acquisition, the words around capital redeployment have been more around bolt-on acquisitions. So you should anticipate that you're going to see us invest in those that create good, positive profits streams going forward and add on to the portfolios that we have already and at the same time, remain committed to our investment-grade credit rating."
