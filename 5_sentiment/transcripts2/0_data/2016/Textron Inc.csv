Revenue aviation overall decrease in revenue in the quarter. Despite a decline in revenues, with good exclusion with margin improvement in aviation, Systems and industrial, and saw double-digit margins Bell and strong cash flow across all the business segments. Bell issued 56 commercial helicopters compared to 57 in last year's fourth quarter. Commercial revenues were down, reflecting aftermarket volume and a change in mix of aircraft delivered. On the new product front, we are making good progress with our 525 Relentless program. We have now 2 aircraft in flight test the program and are preparing to bring a third aircraft in spring. We successfully obtained a top speed of 186 knots, validating the aircraft's maximum target. Although testing includes continued signal and stability testing, as well as full development of the gross weight and center of gravity extremes.
Aircraft will heading north to gather initial order data next month. continues to progress, developing phase of the test program, we are preparing to enter into certification test phase in the spring.
We also plan to 525 to Heli-Expo in the Louisville in March so that our customers can see the actual aircraft for the first time. Overall, the aircraft continued to perform very well, meeting or exceeding all of our initial performance expectations. Customer demand remained strong as we currently have about 80 letters of intent from around the world. We are targeting certification of first delivery of the 525 next year. Our 505 Jet Ranger X program is also making good progress, with 3 test aircraft now in operation. We are targeting certification and entering the service later this year. Our upgraded 407 GXP model continues to generate great reception in the marketplace, with overall 407 deliveries up 13 units in 2015. Earlier this month, we made the first delivery to air methods under the 10-year[ph] 200 unit contract that we signed at last year's Heli-Expo show.
While we're having good success on our helicopters, the medium segment of the market continued to be challenged. This is reflected in the low volume that we saw in 2015, and the outlook from unit helicopter remains soft as we look to 2016. 
On the defense side, V-22 deliveries were up in the quarter, as we delivered 8 V-22s compared to 7 a year ago. H-1 deliveries were also off as we delivered 9 units compared to 7 in the last year's fourth quarter. 
In systems, lower year-over-year revenues in the quarter were primarily the results of initial deliveries in last year's fourth quarter. This year's fourth quarter revenues include delivery of 55 COMMANDO select armored vehicles for the Afghan National Army, but did not include any Canadian TAPV deliveries as we are still conducting our internal testing.  now have completed initial testing, we'll begin the customer testing process this week. We expect that the process final will take 5 to 6 months to complete. in October, we opened our first commercial aviation maintenance training facility in Wichita, with initial courses for mechanical and avionics maintenance for the King Air, Baron and products. We also received a phase certification for both our and Fusion [indiscernible] 50 aircraft and associate simulator. We in the Tampa Center supporting initial aircraft deliveries in the quarter.
Moving to aviation. 
We delivered 60 Jets and 33 King Airs compared to 55 Jets and 41 King Airs last year. For the full year, we delivered 166 Jets, up from last year's 159, including 16 latitude deliveries. 
During the quarter, we delivered our 102, marking the success form this product in the marketplace during the 2 years it's been in service.  Most significant event during the quarter aviation was the unveiling of our new longitude and hemisphere aircraft, NBAA, in November. The customer reaction to both of these models have been very positive, and we believe they will generate substantial growth opportunities. The launch of superior operating performance compared to aircraft in its class and should provide meaningful contribution to revenue to aviation after its expected entry into service late next year. Longer term, the Hemisphere should provide to be a game changer as it will open up an entirely new market opportunity for us. With first flight targeted for 2019, we expect the Hemisphere will growth aviation as we enter next decade. We also announced details of our new single-engine turboprop, including a new 1300 shelf horsepower G turboprop engine. We're developing this aircraft product for the range of 1,500 nautical miles, speeds at over 280 knots, a larger cabin and reduced operating costs.
An important part of Textron Aviation and the Bell brand is our service footprint and after market support capabilities. In that regard, last week, able and journey component services, an innovative low-cost repair and overhaul business operated in Arizona. Able provides component repairs, component exchanges and replacement parts, along with other support and service offerings for commercial rotorcraft and fixed wing aircraft customers. This is a great extension to our aftermarket business.  
Wrapping up the quarter with Industrial, we achieved a 6.4% increase in revenues after a 5.8% negative impact from foreign exchange, reflecting strong organic growth in the quarter. At Caltex, we had solid growth, with revenues up in Europe, North America and Asia. Textron's vehicles had solid growth across all business lines, reflecting our focus on new products and the success of recent acquisitions, such as for ground support equipment businesses. 
To summarize the year. Despite decline in manufacturing revenues, we were able to achieve a 60 basis point improvement in manufacturing margins. We believe we entered the year with strong EPS and cash flow performance, especially given the challenges of the weaker-than-expected commercial helicopter market. Throughout the year, we took action that should position our businesses for growth and profitability over the next several years. At Textron Systems, we advanced our Ship to Shore program with the first 2 units in production. The targeted deliveries of 2017, the DoD exercise options for another 2 ships out of a total expected program of 73 units. At , we opened our Trent supplier training center and facility, received the King Air training certification and announced 3 additional from 737 max platform. At Industrial, our top line growth for the year reflects our continuing investment in new products, such as the Jacobsen HD, heavy-duty vehicle, the 4 x 4, and Green the something Wi-Fi system. Industrial growth also reflects the success of recent acquisitions which demonstrates our ability to leverage these businesses for growth and long-term shareholder value. At Bell, we continue to prove our win rate in the commercial helicopter market -- of our new and operated products, our industry-leading aftermarket support and our expanding sales presence around the world. On the military front, we made important progress with our order program. -- on demonstrations of each to potential domestic and foreign customers using a flight simulator to develop our teams at Bell and. Manufacturing at several operations first aircraft were well underway, and we remain on track for first flight in 2017.
Military's version or Belfour 12 model was selected for Japan's UH-X program. We've been partnering with Industries to deliver 150 aircraft beginning in 2021. We also signed contracts to deliver the first with 3 of at least 12 planned H-1 helicopters for Pakistan and the first 5 of 17 expected V-22s for Japan. Looking forward, we have a significant number of foreign opportunities for the H-1 which we are pursuing and expect to secure additional orders this year.
In Textron Aviation, last year, we began deliveries of our new Latitude, announces turboprop, 2 new business jets, and realized the full year impact of operational benefits from our Beechcraft acquisition. 
To finish with Textron's 2016 financial guidance. We're predicting revenues of about $14.3 billion, as we expect solid growth of aviation, industrial and Systems, and approximately flat revenue at Bell. We expect EPS from continuing operations between the range of $2.60 to $2.80, and manufacturing veteran cash flow before pension contributions in the range of $600 million to $700 million. 
With that, I turn the call over to Frank."

Segment profit in the quarter was $378 million, down $20 million from the fourth quarter of 2014, a $[indiscernible]million decrease in revenue. 
Let's review of how each of the segments performed, starting with Textron Aviation.
Revenues were down $32 million from this period last year, reflecting lower King Air and preowned aircraft volumes, partially offset by higher jet volumes. Aviation had a profit of $138 million compared to $130 million a year ago. This increase primarily reflected improved performance, which included lower amortization of $8 million related to fair value step-up adjustments, partially offset by the lower volumes. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $1.1 billion, down $308 million from the end of the third quarter.
Moving to Bell. 
Revenues were down $36 million, reflecting lower commercial aftermarket volume and a change in mix of commercial aircraft delivered in the quarter, partially offset by higher military deliveries.
Segment profit decreased $22 million from the fourth quarter of 2014, primarily reflecting an unfavorable impact from the change in mix of commercial aircraft delivered in the quarter and lower commercial aftermarket volume, partially offset by improved performance. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $5.2 billion, up $76 million from the end of the third quarter. 
At Textron Systems, revenues were down $158 million, primarily due to lower Unmanned Systems volume, partially offset by higher Marine & Land Systems volume. Segment profit was down $9 million, reflecting the impact of the lower volumes.
Industrial revenues increased $55 million due to higher overall volumes and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by a $50 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Segment profit increased $6 million, primarily reflecting the impact of the higher volumes.
Finance segment revenues decreased $2 million and profit decreased $3 million.
Moving below the segment profit line. 
Corporate expenses were $52 million, and our tax rate in the quarter was 23.5%. The fourth quarter tax rate benefited from the U.S. R&D tax legislation passed late in the quarter, as well as some other discrete items. 
Interest expense was $32 million, down $8 million from last year, reflecting lower debt levels. We repaid $100 million of the backlog from the Beechcraft acquisition and repurchased approximately 208,000 shares in the quarter. We ended the year with gross manufacturing debt of $2.7 billion, resulting in a year-end manufacturing debt-to-EBITDA multiple of about 1.8x. For the full year, we repurchased approximately 5.2 million shares at an overall cost of about $219 million.
Turning now to our 2016 guidance, beginning with our segments on Slide 9. 
At Textron Aviation, we're expecting about 6% revenue growth, bringing revenues to about $5.1 billion, primarily reflecting a ramp-up in Latitude deliveries. Segment margins are expected to be in the range of 8.5% to 9%. 
At Bell, we expect overall revenues will be flattish at about $3.4 billion, reflecting lower V-22 revenues, offset by higher H-1 deliveries on the military side, and essentially flat revenues in our Commercial business. We are forecasting margins in the range of 10% to 11%.
At Systems, we are estimating 2016 revenues at about $1.9 billion, up 25% from last year, reflecting the expected deliveries and good growth in most of our other Systems businesses. Segment margins are expected to be in the range of 10% to 10.5%. 
At Industrial, we're expecting solid growth in each of our businesses, resulting in a projected 7% segment revenue growth to about $3.8 billion, with estimated margins in the range of 9% to 9.9%. 
At Finance, we are forecasting segment profit of about about $15 million. 
Turning to Slide 10. 
Based on U.S. planned discount rate of 4.75%, we are estimating 2016 pension costs will be about $85 million, down from $138 million last year.
Turning to Slide 11. 
R&D is expected to be about $615 million, approximately flat with 2015. We're estimating CapEx will be about $475 million, up from last year's expenditures of $420 million, reflecting our investments in new products and geographic expansion.
Moving below the segment line, and looking at Slide 12. 
We're projecting about $155 million for corporate expense. Next year's interest expense is estimated at $133 million, reflecting higher rates on variable rate debt. We're assuming a tax rate of about 31%, as we had some items in 2015 that benefited our tax rate that we do not expect to reoccur in 2016, as well as an expected higher mix of U.S. revenues in 2016, which are taxed at higher rates. Our guidance assumes a flat share count of about 277 million shares, reflecting repurchases sufficient to offset dilution. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. So Steve, we can open the line for questions."

Nothing more than that. In terms of next year, the volume leverage probably is not as high as you guys would expect. I think that's largely driven by the fact that we're going to see probably some lower margin on a lot of our incremental sales, particularly that which is going into the business. So we have a fairly high number of deliveries next year. on the NetJets, you probably saw yesterday, they've announced the official launch of that product into their customer base. And typically, sales into the fractional channel are at a lower margin than our typical retail sales."

The big adjustment that we really made this year was a reduction in medium-sized helicopters that, you're probably about 12, 412s[ph], and we expect that to be about flat on a year-over-year basis.

Those are, for us, the 412s, that's typically a very international product. And as you can imagine, between the pressure around oil and other commodities, and just in general, international marketplace is pretty soft, and I think that's perfect overall in the Bell curve margins, so we expect that to be pretty flat as we go from '15 to '16."

So look, I think on the margin rate, what we've communicated to you, guys, we've been trying to hold that business at 11% to 12% rate.

So look, I think on the margin rate, what we've communicated to you, guys, we've been trying to hold that business at 11% to 12% rate. I think as we manage through, knowing what was going to happen on the military programs, we adjusted our cost base to make sure that we could hit that target. Just in our segment level kind of color at this point, we think we're probably 100 basis points lower than that, and that's a reflection of the fact that we're seeing a significant reduction in what we would have expected in terms of the volume in the midsized market as we go forward. So there will still -- obviously, there will be some cost reductions that come associated with that as we lower the production rates and our production rates on the 412 side in particular. But to try to pick up more costs from that and sustain the investments that we need to make in the 505 and 525 and V-280, I think that's going to cost a little about 100 basis points, and that's why you see that reflection of the drop. So what we committed an internal margin and then we dealt with the fact that we're going to have this known ramp down on the military side and then further reductions that we made this year on the commercial side has sustained margins about where we want it to be. But I think this point, given where we're taking the forecast on 412s, that's probably going to cost us about 100 basis points. So as we go into Heli-Expo, look, it's going to be an interesting show to try to understand where customers are, what their expectations are going forward. 505, we continued to feel very good about. The level of customer demand in that area is great. The 407s, as I said earlier, very strong, and delivering out some big programs and a continued strong interest. 429s are kind of flattish. I think the question is really going to be, with a lot of our international customers, how they feel going forward, now 412 obviously and give us a feel of where things are going in terms of the 525. We're still 1.5 years from or so of making first orders on an aircraft, so there are still a fair bit of time here to understand what that market dynamic is going to look like."

So I think at this point, products that have stronger demand or dependency on international markets are tougher markets.

Textron revenues in the quarter were $3.9 billion, down 4.2% from $4.1 billion in last year's fourth quarter. Income from continuing operations was $0.81 per share, up 6.6% from $0.76 in the fourth quarter of 2014. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions of $18 million was $534 million compared to $449 million in last year's fourth quarter.
For the full year, revenues were $13.4 billion, down 3.3% from a year ago. Income from continuing operations was $2.50 per share, up 16.3% from $2.15 last year. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions of $68 million was $631 million.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott."

Revenue growth for Industrial but down at Systems, Bell and Aviation were [indiscernible] due to an overall decrease in revenue in the quarter. Despite the decline in revenues, with good execution with margin improvements at Aviation, Systems and Industrial and saw double-digit margins at Bell, with strong cash flow across all our business segments. At Bell, we shipped 56 commercial helicopters compared to 57 in last year's fourth quarter. Commercial revenues were down, reflecting lower aftermarket volume and a change in mix of aircraft delivered.
On the new product front, we're making good progress with our 525 Relentless program. We now have 2 aircraft in our flight test program and are preparing to bring a third aircraft into testing this spring. It successfully attained a top speed of 186 knots, validating the aircraft's maximum true airspeed target, although our new [ph] testing includes continued signal and stability testing as well as further development of the gross weight and center of gravity extremes.
Aircraft will heading north to gather initial cold weather data next month. As the team continues to progress with the development phase of the test program, we're preparing to enter the certification test phase in the spring.
We also plan to fly the 525 to Heli-Expo in Louisville in March so that our customers can see the actual aircraft for the first time. Overall, the aircraft continued to perform very well, meeting or exceeding all of our initial performance expectations. Customer demand remains strong as we currently have about 80 letters of intent from around the world. We're targeting certification of first delivery of the 525 next year.
Our 505 Jet Ranger X program is also making good progress, with 3 test aircraft now in operation. We're targeting certification and entering into service later this year. Our upgraded 407GXP model continues to generate great reception in the marketplace, with overall 407 deliveries, up 13 units in 2015. Earlier this month, we made the first GXP delivery to Air Methods under the 10-year 200 unit contract that we signed at last year's Heli-Expo show.
While we're having good success selling our lighter helicopters, the medium segment of the market continues to be challenged. This was reflected in the low 412 volumes that we saw in 2015, and the outlook from medium helicopter remains soft as we look to 2016.
On the defense side, V-22 deliveries were up in the quarter, as we delivered 8 V-22s compared to 7 a year ago. H-1 deliveries were also up as we delivered 9 units compared to 7 in last year's fourth quarter.
Moving to systems, lower year-over-year revenues in the quarter were primarily the result of TCDL V2 Shadow deliveries in last year's fourth quarter. This year's fourth quarter revenues included delivery of 55 COMMANDO Select Armored Vehicles for the Afghan National Army, but did not include any Canadian TAPV deliveries as we're still conducting our internal testing. Now -- having now completed initial testing, we'll begin the customer testing process this week. We expect this process and final acceptance will take 5 to 6 months to complete. At TRUE, in October, we opened our first commercial aviation maintenance training facility in Wichita, with initial courses covering mechanical and avionics maintenance for the King Air, Baron and Bonanza products. We also received a phase certification for both our Pro Line Fusion-equipped King Air 350 aircraft and its associated simulator. We give the in pilot training in the new simulator at our Tampa ProFlight center, supporting initial aircraft deliveries in the quarter.
Moving to Aviation. We delivered 60 Jets and 33 King Airs compared to 55 Jets and 41 King Airs last year. For the full year, we delivered 166 Jets, up from last year's 159, including 16 Latitude deliveries. During the quarter, we delivered our 102nd, marking the solid success that this product has had in the marketplace during the 2 years it's been in service.
The most significant event during the quarter to Aviation was the unveiling of our new Longitude and hemisphere aircraft at NBAA in November. Customer reaction to both of these models have been very positive, and we believe they will generate substantial growth opportunities. The Longitude has superior operating performance compared to any aircraft in its class and should provide meaningful contribution to revenue and profits at Aviation after its expected entry into service late next year.
Longer term, the Hemisphere should provide to be a game changer as it will open up an entirely new market opportunity for us. With first flight targeted for 2019, we expect the Hemisphere will accelerate growth at Aviation as we enter the next decade. We also announced details of our new single-engine turboprop, including a new 1,300 shaft horsepower GE turboprop engine. We're developing this aircraft to be a class-leading product with a range of 1,500 nautical miles, speeds of over 280 knots, a larger cabin and reduced operating costs.
An important part of Textron Aviation and the Bell brand is our service footprint and aftermarket support capabilities. In that regard, last week, we acquired Able Engineering & Component Services, an innovative low-cost repair and overhaul business operated in Mesa, Arizona. Able provides component repairs, component exchanges and replacement parts, along with other support and service offerings for commercial rotorcraft and fixed-wing aircraft customers. This business is a great extension to our aftermarket business.
Wrapping up the quarter with Industrial, we achieved a 6.4% increase in revenues after a 5.8% negative impact from foreign exchange, reflecting strong organic growth in the quarter. At Kautex, we had solid growth, with revenues up in Europe, North America and Asia. Textron's specialized vehicles had solid growth across all business lines, reflecting our focus on new products and the success of recent acquisitions, such as TUG and Douglas airport ground support equipment businesses.
To summarize the year, despite a decline in manufacturing revenues, we were able to achieve a 60 basis point improvement in manufacturing margins. We believe we entered the year with strong EPS and cash flow performance, especially given the challenges of a weaker-than-expected commercial helicopter market.
Throughout the year, we took actions that should position our businesses for growth and profitability over the next several years. At Textron Systems, we advanced our Ship to Shore program with the first 2 units in production. With targeted deliveries in 2017, the DoD exercised options for another 2 ships out of the total expected program of 73 units. At TRUE, we opened our Tampa pilot training center and Wichita maintenance training facility, received the King Air training certification and announced 3 additional orders from Boeing for its new 737 MAX platform.
At Industrial, our top line growth for the year reflected our continuing investment in new products, such as the Jacobsen Truckster XD heavy-duty vehicle, the Cushman Hauler 4x4 and Greenlee's AirScout Wi-Fi test system. Industrial growth also reflects the success of recent acquisitions, which demonstrates our ability to leverage these businesses for growth and long-term shareholder value.
At Bell, we continue to prove our win rate in the commercial helicopter market based on the attractiveness of our new and upgraded products, our industry-leading aftermarket support and our expanding sales presence around the world. On the military front, we made important progress with our V-280 order program, provided a handful of demonstrations of V-280s to potential domestic and foreign customers using a flight simulator developed by our teams at Bell and TRUE.
Manufactured at several operations, the first aircraft were well underway, and we remain on track for first flight in 2017. The militarized version or Bell 412 model was selected for Japan's UH-X program. We've been partnering with Fuji Heavy Industries to deliver 150 aircraft beginning in 2021. We also signed contracts to deliver the first 3 of at least 12 planned H-1 helicopters for Pakistan and the first 5 of 17 expected V-22s for Japan. Looking forward, we have a significant number of foreign opportunities for the H-1s that we are pursuing and expect to secure additional orders this year.
In Textron Aviation, last year, we began deliveries of our new Latitude, announced its new single-engine turboprop, 2 new business jets and realized the full year impact of operational benefits from our Beechcraft acquisition.
To finish with Textron's 2016 financial guidance, we're predicting revenues of about $14.3 billion as we expect solid growth at Aviation, Industrial and Systems and approximately flat revenues at Bell. We expect EPS from continuing operations will be in the range of $2.60 to $2.80 and manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions in a range to $600 million to $700 million.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank."

Segment profit in the quarter was $378 million, down $20 million from the fourth quarter of 2014, [indiscernible] $3 million [ph] decrease in revenue.

Segment profit in the quarter was $378 million, down $20 million from the fourth quarter of 2014, [indiscernible] $3 million [ph] decrease in revenue. Let's review how each of the segments performed, starting with Textron Aviation.
Revenues were down $32 million from this period last year, reflecting lower King Air and preowned aircraft volumes, partially offset by higher jet volume. Aviation had a profit of $138 million compared to $130 million a year ago. This increase primarily reflected improved performance, which included lower amortization of $8 million related to fair value step-up adjustments, partially offset by the lower volumes. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $1.1 billion, down $308 million from the end of the third quarter.
Moving to Bell. Revenues were down $36 million, reflecting lower commercial aftermarket volume and a change in mix of commercial aircraft delivered in the quarter, partially offset by higher military deliveries. Segment profit decreased $22 million from the fourth quarter of 2014, primarily reflecting an unfavorable impact from the change in mix of commercial aircraft delivered in the quarter and lower commercial aftermarket volume, partially offset by improved performance. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $5.2 billion, up $76 million from the end of the third quarter.
At Textron Systems, revenues were down $158 million, primarily due to lower Unmanned Systems volume, partially offset by higher Marine & Land Systems volume. Segment profit was down $9 million, reflecting the impact of the lower volumes.
Industrial revenues increased $55 million due to higher overall volumes and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by a $50 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Segment profit increased $6 million, reflecting -- or primarily reflecting the impact of the higher volumes. Finance segment revenues decreased $2 million and profit decreased $3 million.
Moving below the segment profit line. Corporate expenses were $52 million, and our tax rate in the quarter was 23.5%. The fourth quarter tax rate benefited from the U.S. R&D tax legislation passed late in the quarter, as well as some other discrete items. Interest expense was $32 million, down $8 million from last year, reflecting lower debt levels.
We repaid $100 million of the bank loan from the Beechcraft acquisition and repurchased approximately 208,000 shares in the quarter. We ended the year with gross manufacturing debt of $2.7 billion, resulting in a year-end manufacturing debt-to-EBITDA multiple of about 1.8x. For the full year, we repurchased approximately 5.2 million shares at an overall cost of about $219 million.
Turning now to our 2016 guidance, beginning with our segments on Slide 9. At Textron Aviation, we're expecting about 6% revenue growth, bringing revenues to about $5.1 billion, primarily reflecting a ramp-up in Latitude deliveries. Segment margins are expected to be in the range of 8.5% to 9%.
At Bell, we expect overall revenues will be flattish at about $3.4 billion, reflecting lower V-22 revenues, offset by higher H-1 deliveries on the military side and essentially flat revenues in our commercial business. We're forecasting margins in the range of 10% to 11%.
At Systems, we're estimating 2016 revenues at about $1.9 billion, up 25% from last year, reflecting expected TAPV deliveries and good growth in most of our other Systems businesses. Segment margins are expected to be in the range of 10% to 10.5%. 
At Industrial, we're expecting solid growth in each of our businesses, resulting in a projected 7% segment revenue growth to about $3.8 billion, with estimated margins in the range of 9% to 9.9%. 
At Finance, we're forecasting segment profit of about $15 million.
Turning to Slide 10. Based on U.S. planned discount rate of 4.75%, we're estimating 2016 pension costs will be about $85 million, down from $138 million last year.
Turning to Slide 11. R&D is expected to be about $615 million, approximately flat with 2015. We're estimating CapEx will be about $475 million, up from last year's expenditures of $420 million, reflecting our investments in new products and geographic expansion.
Moving below the segment line and looking at Slide 12, we're projecting about $155 million for corporate expense. Next year's interest expense is estimated at $133 million, reflecting higher rates on variable rate debt. We're assuming a tax rate of about 31% as we had some items in 2015 that benefited our tax rate that we do not expect will reoccur in 2016 as well as an expected higher mix of U.S. revenues in 2016, which are taxed at higher rates. Our guidance assumes a flat share count of about 277 million shares, reflecting repurchases sufficient to offset dilution.
That concludes our prepared remarks. So Steve, we can open the line for questions."

Nothing more than substantive than that. In terms of next year, the volume leverage probably is not as high as you guys would expect. I think that's largely driven by the fact that we're going to see probably some lower margin on a lot of our incremental sales, particularly that which is going into the fractional business. So we have a fairly high number of deliveries next year. It will go on the NetJets. You probably saw yesterday, they've announced the official launch of that product into their customer base. And typically, sales into the fractional channel are at a lower margin than our typical retail sales."

So look, as I think on the margin rate, what we've communicated to you guys, we've been trying to hold that business at [ph] 11% to 12% rate.

So look, as I think on the margin rate, what we've communicated to you guys, we've been trying to hold that business at [ph] 11% to 12% rate. I think as we manage through, knowing what was going to happen on the military programs, we adjusted our cost base to make sure that we could hit that target. As you see in our segment level kind of color at this point, we think we're probably 100 basis points lower than that. And that's a reflection of the fact that we're seeing a significant reduction in what we would have expected in terms of the volume in the midsized market as we go forward. So there will still -- obviously, there will be some cost reductions that come associated with that as we lower the production rates and are lowering the production rates on the 412 side in particular. But to try to take out more costs from that and sustain the investments that we need to make in the 505 and 525 and V-280, I think that's going to cost a little about 100 basis points, and that's why you see that reflection of the drop. So what we committed, internal margin and how we dealt with the fact that we're going to have this known ramp-down on the military side and then further reductions that we made this year on the commercial side has sustained margins about where we want it to be. But I think at this point, given where we've taken the forecast on 412s, that's probably going to cost us about 100 basis points. So as we go into Heli-Expo, look, it's going to be an interesting show to try to understand where customers are, what their expectations are going forward. 505, we continue to feel very good about. The level of customer demand in that area is great. The 407s, as I said earlier, very strong and delivering out some big programs and a continued strong interest. 429s are kind of flattish. I think the question is really going to be, with a lot of our international customers, how they feel going forward, and that will affect the 412 obviously and give us a feel of where things are going in terms of the 525. We're still 1.5 years away from -- or so of making the first deliveries on an aircraft, so there's still a fair bit of time here to understand what that market dynamic is going to look like."

So it's really across the whole segment and of course, our simulation training business, which continues to perform and grow. So they're really -- it's not just one item. I mean, certainly getting -- TAPV is a big driver of the revenue increase in terms of finally delivering on that, but in terms of overall margins, it's pretty solid performance across all of those business segments."

So I think at this point, products that have stronger demand or dependency on international markets are tougher markets. So we've seen that certainly in the midsized helicopter market, we've seen a little bit on our King Air market because that is typically more international. But the business jet market itself, which is stronger and a little more U.S. centric at this point, is doing fine."

So look, what happened is when we talked in the fourth quarter about our expectation, we felt we could get some of the delivery starting late next year as we had finalized our initial testing.

So we decided we really needed to permanently [ph] resolve this thing. We did that. We've completed all our internal testing, it looks great. But it does completely reset the clock on the customer test as well. And so we've now started that. The vehicles are actually under test as we speak. It's going well, but it did reset the whole clock. So unfortunately, what was a fairly minor change and minor fix does reset the clock, and that means you're probably looking at something where deliveries will probably start in second half of this year. Now we've built many, many of the vehicles, so there's a lot of vehicles sitting there. They're -- they've been modified. There's a minor change.

But no -- yes, a big piece of it is expectations on lower margin and in terms of the fractional, which is a big part of our growth, frankly, right? So if you look at that year-over-year incremental, and then I know it was just kind of walking through the math as well, reading serial numbers of aircraft, but the -- a lot of our incremental, as we go from '15 to '16, is Latitudes, and a big chunk of that is going into the fractional market. So I mean, I think that's the reality of where we are. A big piece of the year-over-year is going to be fractional deliveries which are at lower margin rates.

Textron revenues in the quarter were $3.9 billion, down 4.2% from $4.1 billion in last year's fourth quarter. Income from continuing operations was $0.81 per share, up 6.6% from $0.76 in the fourth quarter of 2014. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions of $18 million was $534 million compared to $449 million in last year's fourth quarter.
For the full year, revenues were $13.4 billion, down 3.3% from a year ago. Income from continuing operations was $2.50 per share, up 16.3% from $2.15 last year. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions of $68 million was $631 million.

Revenues grew for Industrial but down at Systems, Bell and Aviation which led to an overall decrease in revenue in the quarter. Despite the decline in revenues, we had good execution with margin improvements at Aviation, Systems and Industrial and solid double-digit margins at Bell, with strong cash flow across all our business segments. At Bell, we shipped 56 commercial helicopters compared to 57 in last year's fourth quarter. Commercial revenues were down, reflecting lower aftermarket volume and a change in mix of aircraft delivered.
On the new product front, we're making good progress with our 525 Relentless program. We now have 2 aircraft in our flight test program and are preparing to bring a third aircraft into testing this spring. It successfully attained a top speed of 186 knots, validating the aircraft's maximum true airspeed target, other ongoing testing includes continued signal and stability testing as well as further development of the gross weight and center of gravity extremes.
Aircraft will heading north to gather initial cold weather data next month. As the team continues to progress through the development phase of the test program, we're preparing to enter the certification test phase in the spring.
We also plan to fly the 525 to Heli-Expo in Louisville in March so that our customers can see the actual aircraft for the first time. Overall, the aircraft continued to perform very well, meeting or exceeding all of our initial performance expectations. Customer demand remains strong as we currently have about 80 letters of intent from around the world. We are targeting certification of first delivery of the 525 next year.
Our 505 Jet Ranger X program is also making good progress, with 3 test aircraft now in operation. We're targeting certification and entry into service later this year. Our upgraded 407GXP model continues to generate great reception in the marketplace, with overall 407 deliveries, up 13 units in 2015. Earlier this month, we made the first GXP delivery to Air Methods under the 10-year 200 unit contract that we signed at last year's Heli-Expo show.
While we're having good success selling our lighter helicopters, the medium segment of the market continues to be challenged. This was reflected in the low 412 volumes that we saw in 2015, and the outlook from medium helicopter remains soft as we look to 2016.
On the defense side, V-22 deliveries were up in the quarter, as we delivered 8 V-22s compared to 7 a year ago. H-1 deliveries were also up as we delivered 9 units compared to 7 in last year's fourth quarter.
Moving to systems, lower year-over-year revenues in the quarter were primarily the result of initial TCDL V2 Shadow deliveries in last year's fourth quarter. This year's fourth quarter revenues included delivery of 55 COMMANDO Select Armored Vehicles for the Afghan National Army, but did not include any Canadian TAPV deliveries as we're still conducting our internal testing. Now -- having now completed initial testing, we begin the customer testing process this week. We expect this process and final acceptance will take 5 to 6 months to complete. At TRUE, in October, we opened our first commercial aviation maintenance training facility in Wichita, with initial courses covering mechanical and avionics maintenance for the King Air, Baron and Bonanza products. We also received FAA certification for both our Pro Line Fusion-equipped King Air 350 aircraft and its associated simulator. We give the in-pilot training in the new simulator at our Tampa ProFlight center, supporting initial aircraft deliveries in the quarter.
Moving to Aviation. We delivered 60 Jets and 33 King Airs compared to 55 Jets and 41 King Airs last year. For the full year, we delivered 166 Jets, up from last year's 159, including 16 Latitude deliveries. During the quarter, we delivered our 100th M2, marking the solid success that this product has had in the marketplace during the 2 years it's been in service.
The most significant event during the quarter to Aviation was the unveiling of our new Longitude and Hemisphere aircraft at NBAA in November. Customer reaction to both of these models have been very positive, and we believe they will generate substantial growth opportunities. The Longitude has superior operating performance compared to any aircraft in its class and should provide meaningful contribution to revenue and profits at Aviation after its expected entry into service late next year.
Longer term, the Hemisphere should prove to be a game changer as it will open up an entirely new market opportunity for us. With first flight targeted for 2019, we expect the Hemisphere will accelerate growth at Aviation as we enter the next decade. We also announced details of our new single-engine turboprop, including a new 1,300  shaft horsepower GE turboprop engine. We are developing this aircraft to be a class-leading product with a range of 1,500 nautical miles, speeds of over 280 knots, a larger cabin and reduced operating costs.
An important part of Textron Aviation and the Bell brand is our service footprint and aftermarket support capabilities. In that regard, last week, we acquired Able Engineering & Component Services, an innovative low-cost repair and overhaul business operated in Mesa, Arizona. Able provides component repairs, component exchanges and replacement parts, along with other support and service offerings for commercial rotorcraft and fixed-wing aircraft customers. This business is a great extension to our aftermarket business.
Wrapping up the quarter with Industrial, we achieved a 6.4% increase in revenues after a 5.8% negative impact from foreign exchange, reflecting strong organic growth in the quarter. At Kautex, we had solid growth, with revenues up in Europe, North America and Asia. Textron's specialized vehicles had solid growth across all business lines, reflecting our focus on new products and the success of recent acquisitions, such as TUG and Douglas airport ground support equipment businesses.
To summarize the year, despite a decline in manufacturing revenues, we were able to achieve a 60 basis point improvement in manufacturing margins. We believe we entered the year with strong EPS and cash flow performance, especially given the challenges of a weaker-than-expected commercial helicopter market.
Throughout the year, we took actions that should position our businesses for growth and profitability over the next several years. At Textron Systems, we advanced our Ship to Shore program with the first 2 units in production. With targeted deliveries in 2017, the DoD exercised options for another 2 ships out of the total expected program of 73 units. At TRUE, we opened our Tampa pilot training center and Wichita maintenance training facility, received the King Air training certification and announced 3 additional orders from Boeing for its new 737 MAX platform.
At Industrial, our top line growth for the year reflected our continuing investment in new products, such as the Jacobsen Truckster XD heavy-duty vehicle, the Cushman Hauler 4x4 and Greenlee's AirScout Wi-Fi test system. Industrial growth also reflects the success of recent acquisitions, which demonstrates our ability to leverage these businesses for growth and long-term shareholder value.
At Bell, we continue to improve our win rate in the commercial helicopter market based on the attractiveness of our new and upgraded products, our industry-leading aftermarket support and our expanding sales presence around the world. On the military front, we made important progress with our V-280 tail order program. We provided hands-on demonstrations of V-280s to potential domestic and foreign customers using a flight simulator developed by our teams at Bell and TRUE.
Manufacturing assembly operations for the first aircraft are well underway, and we remain on track for first flight in 2017. The militarized version or Bell 412 model was selected for Japan's UH-X program. We'll be partnering with Fuji Heavy Industries to deliver 150 aircraft beginning in 2021. We also signed contracts to deliver the first 3 of at least 12 planned H-1 helicopters for Pakistan and the first 5 of 17 expected V-22s for Japan. Looking forward, we have a significant number of foreign opportunities for the H-1s that we are pursuing and expect to secure additional orders this year.
In Textron Aviation, last year, we began deliveries of our new Latitude, announced the new single-engine turboprop, 2 new business jets and realized the full year impact of operational benefits from our Beechcraft acquisition.
To finish with Textron's 2016 financial guidance, we're predicting revenues of about $14.3 billion as we expect solid growth at Aviation, Industrial and Systems and approximately flat revenues at Bell. We expect EPS from continuing operations will be in the range of $2.60 to $2.80 and manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions in a range to $600 million to $700 million.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank."

Segment profit in the quarter was $378 million, down $20 million from the fourth quarter of 2014 on $83 million decrease in revenue. Let's review how each of the segments performed, starting with Textron Aviation.
Revenues were down $32 million from this period last year, reflecting lower King Air and preowned aircraft volumes, partially offset by higher jet volume. Aviation had a profit of $138 million compared to $130 million a year ago. This increase primarily reflected improved performance, which included lower amortization of $8 million related to fair value step-up adjustments, partially offset by the lower volumes. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $1.1 billion, down $308 million from the end of the third quarter.
Moving to Bell. Revenues were down $36 million, reflecting lower commercial aftermarket volume and a change in mix of commercial aircraft delivered in the quarter, partially offset by higher military deliveries. Segment profit decreased $22 million from the fourth quarter of 2014, primarily reflecting an unfavorable impact from the change in mix of commercial aircraft delivered in the quarter and lower commercial aftermarket volume, partially offset by improved performance. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $5.2 billion, up $76 million from the end of the third quarter.
At Textron Systems, revenues were down $158 million, primarily due to lower Unmanned Systems volume, partially offset by higher Marine & Land Systems volume. Segment profit was down $9 million, reflecting the impact of the lower volumes.
Industrial revenues increased $55 million due to higher overall volumes and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by a $50 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Segment profit increased $6 million, reflecting -- or primarily reflecting the impact of the higher volumes. Finance segment revenues decreased $2 million and profit decreased $3 million.
Moving below the segment profit line. Corporate expenses were $52 million, and our tax rate in the quarter was 23.5%. The fourth quarter tax rate benefited from the U.S. R&D tax legislation passed late in the quarter, as well as some other discrete items. Interest expense was $32 million, down $8 million from last year, reflecting lower debt levels.
We repaid $100 million of the bank loan from the Beechcraft acquisition and repurchased approximately 208,000 shares in the quarter. We ended the year with gross manufacturing debt of $2.7 billion, resulting in a year-end manufacturing debt-to-EBITDA multiple of about 1.8x. For the full year, we repurchased approximately 5.2 million shares at an overall cost of about $219 million.
Turning now to our 2016 guidance, beginning with our segments on Slide 9. At Textron Aviation, we're expecting about 6% revenue growth, bringing revenues to about $5.1 billion, primarily reflecting a ramp-up in Latitude deliveries. Segment margins are expected to be in the range of 8.5% to 9%.
At Bell, we expect overall revenues will be flattish at about $3.4 billion, reflecting lower V-22 revenues, offset by higher H-1 deliveries on the military side and essentially flat revenues in our commercial business. We're forecasting margins in the range of 10% to 11%.
At Systems, we're estimating 2016 revenues at about $1.9 billion, up 25% from last year, reflecting expected TAPV deliveries and good growth in most of our other Systems businesses. Segment margins are expected to be in the range of 10% to 10.5%. 
At Industrial, we're expecting solid growth in each of our businesses, resulting in a projected 7% segment revenue growth to about $3.8 billion, with estimated margins in the range of 9% to 9.9%. 
At Finance, we're forecasting segment profit of about $15 million.
Turning to Slide 10. Based on U.S. planned discount rate of 4.75%, we're estimating 2016 pension costs will be about $85 million, down from $138 million last year.
Turning to Slide 11. R&D is expected to be about $615 million, approximately flat with 2015. We're estimating CapEx will be about $475 million, up from last year's expenditures of $420 million, reflecting our investments in new products and geographic expansion.
Moving below the segment line and looking at Slide 12, we're projecting about $155 million for corporate expense. Next year's interest expense is estimated at $133 million, reflecting higher rates on variable rate debt. We're assuming a tax rate of about 31% as we had some items in 2015 that benefited our tax rate that we do not expect will reoccur in 2016 as well as an expected higher mix of U.S. revenues in 2016, which are taxed at higher rates. Our guidance assumes a flat share count of about 277 million shares, reflecting repurchases sufficient to offset dilution.
That concludes our prepared remarks. So Steve, we can open the line for questions."

Nothing more than substantive than that. In terms of next year, the volume leverage probably is not as high as you guys would expect. I think that's largely driven by the fact that we're going to see probably some lower margin on a lot of our incremental sales, particularly that which is going into the fractional business. So we have a fairly high number of deliveries next year. It will go in to NetJets. You probably saw yesterday, they've announced the official launch of that product into their customer base. And typically, sales into the fractional channel are at a lower margin than our typical retail sales."

And as you can imagine, between the pressure around oil and other commodities and just in general, the international marketplace has been pretty soft, and I think that's reflected overall in the Bell 412 margins.

So look, as I think on the margin rate, what we've communicated to you guys, we've been trying to hold that business in the 11% to 12% rate.

So look, as I think on the margin rate, what we've communicated to you guys, we've been trying to hold that business in the 11% to 12% rate. I think as we manage through, knowing what was going to happen on the military programs, we adjusted our cost base to make sure that we could hit that target. As you see in our segment level kind of color at this point, we think we're probably 100 basis points lower than that. And that's a reflection of the fact that we're seeing a significant reduction in what we would have expected in terms of the volume in the midsized market as we go forward. So there will still -- obviously, there will be some cost reductions that come associated with that as we lower the production rates and are lowering the production rates on the 412 side in particular. But to try to take out more costs from that and sustain the investments that we need to make in the 505 and 525 and V-280, I think that's going to cost about 100 basis points, and that's why you see that reflection of the drop. So what we committed, internal margin and how we dealt with the fact that we're going to have this known ramp-down on the military side and then further reductions that we made this year on the commercial side has sustained margins about where we want it to be. But I think at this point, given where we've taken the forecast on 412s, that's probably going to cost us about 100 basis points. 
So as we go into Heli-Expo, look, it's going to be an interesting show to try to understand where customers are, what their expectations are going forward. 505, we continue to feel very good about. The level of customer demand in that area is great. The 407s, as I said earlier, very strong and delivering on some big programs and a continued strong interest. 429s are kind of flattish. I think the question is really going to be, with a lot of our international customers, how they feel going forward, and that will affect the 412 obviously and give us a feel of where things are going in terms of the 525. We're still 1.5 years away from -- or so of making the first deliveries on that aircraft, so there's still a fair bit of time here to understand what that market dynamic is going to look like."

So we decided we really needed to permanently resolve this thing. We did that. We've completed all our internal testing, it looks great. But it does completely reset the clock on the customer tests as well. And so we've now started that. The vehicles are actually under test as we speak. It's going well, but it did reset the whole clock. So unfortunately, what was a fairly minor change and minor fix does reset the clock, and that means you're probably looking at something where deliveries will probably start in second half of this year. Now we've built many, many of the vehicles, so there's a lot of vehicles sitting there. They're -- they've been modified. You know, it's a minor change.

Textron revenues in the quarter were $3.9 billion, down 4.2% from $4.1 billion in last year's fourth quarter. Income from continuing operations was $0.81 per share, up 6.6% from $0.76 in the fourth quarter of 2014. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions of $18 million was $534 million compared to $449 million in last year's fourth quarter.

Revenues grew for Industrial but down at Systems, Bell and Aviation which led to an overall decrease in revenue in the quarter. Despite the decline in revenues, we had good execution with margin improvements at Aviation, Systems and Industrial and solid double-digit margins at Bell, with strong cash flow across all our business segments. At Bell, we shipped 56 commercial helicopters compared to 57 in last year's fourth quarter. Commercial revenues were down, reflecting lower aftermarket volume and a change in mix of aircraft delivered.
On the new product front, we're making good progress with our 525 Relentless program. We now have 2 aircraft in our flight test program and are preparing to bring a third aircraft into testing this spring. It successfully attained a top speed of 186 knots, validating the aircraft's maximum true airspeed target, other ongoing testing includes continued signal and stability testing as well as further development of the gross weight and center of gravity extremes.
Aircraft will heading north to gather initial cold weather data next month. As the team continues to progress through the development phase of the test program, we're preparing to enter the certification test phase in the spring.
We also plan to fly the 525 to Heli-Expo in Louisville in March so that our customers can see the actual aircraft for the first time. Overall, the aircraft continued to perform very well, meeting or exceeding all of our initial performance expectations. Customer demand remains strong as we currently have about 80 letters of intent from around the world. We are targeting certification of first delivery of the 525 next year.
Our 505 Jet Ranger X program is also making good progress, with 3 test aircraft now in operation. We're targeting certification and entry into service later this year. Our upgraded 407GXP model continues to generate great reception in the marketplace, with overall 407 deliveries, up 13 units in 2015. Earlier this month, we made the first GXP delivery to Air Methods under the 10-year 200 unit contract that we signed at last year's Heli-Expo show.
While we're having good success selling our lighter helicopters, the medium segment of the market continues to be challenged. This was reflected in the low 412 volumes that we saw in 2015, and the outlook from medium helicopter remains soft as we look to 2016.
On the defense side, V-22 deliveries were up in the quarter, as we delivered 8 V-22s compared to 7 a year ago. H-1 deliveries were also up as we delivered 9 units compared to 7 in last year's fourth quarter.
Moving to systems, lower year-over-year revenues in the quarter were primarily the result of initial TCDL V2 Shadow deliveries in last year's fourth quarter. This year's fourth quarter revenues included delivery of 55 COMMANDO Select Armored Vehicles for the Afghan National Army, but did not include any Canadian TAPV deliveries as we're still conducting our internal testing. Now -- having now completed initial testing, we begin the customer testing process this week. We expect this process and final acceptance will take 5 to 6 months to complete. At TRUE, in October, we opened our first commercial aviation maintenance training facility in Wichita, with initial courses covering mechanical and avionics maintenance for the King Air, Baron and Bonanza products. We also received FAA certification for both our Pro Line Fusion-equipped King Air 350 aircraft and its associated simulator. We give the in-pilot training in the new simulator at our Tampa ProFlight center, supporting initial aircraft deliveries in the quarter.
Moving to Aviation. We delivered 60 Jets and 33 King Airs compared to 55 Jets and 41 King Airs last year. For the full year, we delivered 166 Jets, up from last year's 159, including 16 Latitude deliveries. During the quarter, we delivered our 100th M2, marking the solid success that this product has had in the marketplace during the 2 years it's been in service.
The most significant event during the quarter to Aviation was the unveiling of our new Longitude and Hemisphere aircraft at NBAA in November. Customer reaction to both of these models have been very positive, and we believe they will generate substantial growth opportunities. The Longitude has superior operating performance compared to any aircraft in its class and should provide meaningful contribution to revenue and profits at Aviation after its expected entry into service late next year.
Longer term, the Hemisphere should prove to be a game changer as it will open up an entirely new market opportunity for us. With first flight targeted for 2019, we expect the Hemisphere will accelerate growth at Aviation as we enter the next decade. We also announced details of our new single-engine turboprop, including a new 1,300  shaft horsepower GE turboprop engine. We are developing this aircraft to be a class-leading product with a range of 1,500 nautical miles, speeds of over 280 knots, a larger cabin and reduced operating costs.
An important part of Textron Aviation and the Bell brand is our service footprint and aftermarket support capabilities. In that regard, last week, we acquired Able Engineering & Component Services, an innovative low-cost repair and overhaul business operated in Mesa, Arizona. Able provides component repairs, component exchanges and replacement parts, along with other support and service offerings for commercial rotorcraft and fixed-wing aircraft customers. This business is a great extension to our aftermarket business.
Wrapping up the quarter with Industrial, we achieved a 6.4% increase in revenues after a 5.8% negative impact from foreign exchange, reflecting strong organic growth in the quarter. At Kautex, we had solid growth, with revenues up in Europe, North America and Asia. Textron's specialized vehicles had solid growth across all business lines, reflecting our focus on new products and the success of recent acquisitions, such as TUG and Douglas airport ground support equipment businesses.
To summarize the year, despite a decline in manufacturing revenues, we were able to achieve a 60 basis point improvement in manufacturing margins. We believe we entered the year with strong EPS and cash flow performance, especially given the challenges of a weaker-than-expected commercial helicopter market.
Throughout the year, we took actions that should position our businesses for growth and profitability over the next several years. At Textron Systems, we advanced our Ship to Shore program with the first 2 units in production. With targeted deliveries in 2017, the DoD exercised options for another 2 ships out of the total expected program of 73 units. At TRUE, we opened our Tampa pilot training center and Wichita maintenance training facility, received the King Air training certification and announced 3 additional orders from Boeing for its new 737 MAX platform.
At Industrial, our top line growth for the year reflected our continuing investment in new products, such as the Jacobsen Truckster XD heavy-duty vehicle, the Cushman Hauler 4x4 and Greenlee's AirScout Wi-Fi test system. Industrial growth also reflects the success of recent acquisitions, which demonstrates our ability to leverage these businesses for growth and long-term shareholder value.
At Bell, we continue to improve our win rate in the commercial helicopter market based on the attractiveness of our new and upgraded products, our industry-leading aftermarket support and our expanding sales presence around the world. On the military front, we made important progress with our V-280 tail order program. We provided hands-on demonstrations of V-280s to potential domestic and foreign customers using a flight simulator developed by our teams at Bell and TRUE.
Manufacturing assembly operations for the first aircraft are well underway, and we remain on track for first flight in 2017. The militarized version or Bell 412 model was selected for Japan's UH-X program. We'll be partnering with Fuji Heavy Industries to deliver 150 aircraft beginning in 2021. We also signed contracts to deliver the first 3 of at least 12 planned H-1 helicopters for Pakistan and the first 5 of 17 expected V-22s for Japan. Looking forward, we have a significant number of foreign opportunities for the H-1s that we are pursuing and expect to secure additional orders this year.
In Textron Aviation, last year, we began deliveries of our new Latitude, announced the new single-engine turboprop, 2 new business jets and realized the full year impact of operational benefits from our Beechcraft acquisition.
To finish with Textron's 2016 financial guidance, we're predicting revenues of about $14.3 billion as we expect solid growth at Aviation, Industrial and Systems and approximately flat revenues at Bell. We expect EPS from continuing operations will be in the range of $2.60 to $2.80 and manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions in a range to $600 million to $700 million.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank."

Let's review how each of the segments performed, starting with Textron",782,"Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Segment profit in the quarter was $378 million, down $20 million from the fourth quarter of 2014 on $83 million [ph] decrease in revenue. Let's review how each of the segments performed, starting with Textron Aviation.
Revenues were down $32 million from this period last year, reflecting lower King Air and preowned aircraft volumes, partially offset by higher jet volume. Aviation had a profit of $138 million compared to $130 million a year ago. This increase primarily reflected improved performance, which included lower amortization of $8 million related to fair value step-up adjustments, partially offset by the lower volumes. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $1.1 billion, down $308 million from the end of the third quarter.
Moving to Bell. Revenues were down $36 million, reflecting lower commercial aftermarket volume and a change in mix of commercial aircraft delivered in the quarter, partially offset by higher military deliveries. Segment profit decreased $22 million from the fourth quarter of 2014, primarily reflecting an unfavorable impact from the change in mix of commercial aircraft delivered in the quarter and lower commercial aftermarket volume, partially offset by improved performance. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $5.2 billion, up $76 million from the end of the third quarter.
At Textron Systems, revenues were down $158 million, primarily due to lower Unmanned Systems volume, partially offset by higher Marine & Land Systems volume. Segment profit was down $9 million, reflecting the impact of the lower volumes.
Industrial revenues increased $55 million due to higher overall volumes and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by a $50 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Segment profit increased $6 million, reflecting -- or primarily reflecting the impact of the higher volumes. Finance segment revenues decreased $2 million and profit decreased $3 million.
Moving below the segment profit line. Corporate expenses were $52 million, and our tax rate in the quarter was 23.5%. The fourth quarter tax rate benefited from the U.S. R&D tax legislation passed late in the quarter, as well as some other discrete items. Interest expense was $32 million, down $8 million from last year, reflecting lower debt levels.
We repaid $100 million of the bank loan from the Beechcraft acquisition and repurchased approximately 208,000 shares in the quarter. We ended the year with gross manufacturing debt of $2.7 billion, resulting in a year-end manufacturing debt-to-EBITDA multiple of about 1.8x. For the full year, we repurchased approximately 5.2 million shares at an overall cost of about $219 million.
Turning now to our 2016 guidance, beginning with our segments on Slide 9. At Textron Aviation, we're expecting about 6% revenue growth, bringing revenues to about $5.1 billion, primarily reflecting a ramp-up in Latitude deliveries. Segment margins are expected to be in the range of 8.5% to 9%.
At Bell, we expect overall revenues will be flattish at about $3.4 billion, reflecting lower V-22 revenues, offset by higher H-1 deliveries on the military side and essentially flat revenues in our commercial business. We're forecasting margins in the range of 10% to 11%.
At Systems, we're estimating 2016 revenues at about $1.9 billion, up 25% from last year, reflecting expected TAPV deliveries and good growth in most of our other Systems businesses. Segment margins are expected to be in the range of 10% to 10.5%. 
At Industrial, we're expecting solid growth in each of our businesses, resulting in a projected 7% segment revenue growth to about $3.8 billion, with estimated margins in the range of 9% to 9.9%. 
At Finance, we're forecasting segment profit of about $15 million.
Turning to Slide 10. Based on U.S. planned discount rate of 4.75%, we're estimating 2016 pension costs will be about $85 million, down from $138 million last year.
Turning to Slide 11. R&D is expected to be about $615 million, approximately flat with 2015. We're estimating CapEx will be about $475 million, up from last year's expenditures of $420 million, reflecting our investments in new products and geographic expansion.
Moving below the segment line and looking at Slide 12, we're projecting about $155 million for corporate expense. Next year's interest expense is estimated at $133 million, reflecting higher rates on variable rate debt. We're assuming a tax rate of about 31% as we had some items in 2015 that benefited our tax rate that we do not expect will reoccur in 2016 as well as an expected higher mix of U.S. revenues in 2016, which are taxed at higher rates. Our guidance assumes a flat share count of about 277 million shares, reflecting repurchases sufficient to offset dilution.
That concludes our prepared remarks. So Steve, we can open the line for questions."

Nothing more than substantive than that. In terms of next year, the volume leverage probably is not as high as you guys would expect. I think that's largely driven by the fact that we're going to see probably some lower margin on a lot of our incremental sales, particularly that which is going into the fractional business. So we have a fairly high number of deliveries next year. It will go in to NetJets. You probably saw yesterday, they've announced the official launch of that product into their customer base. And typically, sales into the fractional channel are at a lower margin than our typical retail sales."

So look, as I think on the margin rate, what we've communicated to you guys, we've been trying to hold that business in the 11% to 12% rate.

So look, as I think on the margin rate, what we've communicated to you guys, we've been trying to hold that business in the 11% to 12% rate. I think as we manage through, knowing what was going to happen on the military programs, we adjusted our cost base to make sure that we could hit that target. As you see in our segment level kind of color at this point, we think we're probably 100 basis points lower than that. And that's a reflection of the fact that we're seeing a significant reduction in what we would have expected in terms of the volume in the midsized market as we go forward. So there will still -- obviously, there will be some cost reductions that come associated with that as we lower the production rates and are lowering the production rates on the 412 side in particular. But to try to take out more costs from that and sustain the investments that we need to make in the 505 and 525 and V-280, I think that's going to cost about 100 basis points, and that's why you see that reflection of the drop. So what we committed, internal margin and how we dealt with the fact that we're going to have this known ramp-down on the military side and then further reductions that we made this year on the commercial side has sustained margins about where we want it to be. But I think at this point, given where we've taken the forecast on 412s, that's probably going to cost us about 100 basis points. 
So as we go into Heli-Expo, look, it's going to be an interesting show to try to understand where customers are, what their expectations are going forward. 505, we continue to feel very good about. The level of customer demand in that area is great. The 407s, as I said earlier, very strong and delivering on some big programs and a continued strong interest. 429s are kind of flattish. I think the question is really going to be, with a lot of our international customers, how they feel going forward, and that will affect the 412 obviously and give us a feel of where things are going in terms of the 525. We're still 1.5 years away from -- or so of making the first deliveries on that aircraft, so there's still a fair bit of time here to understand what that market dynamic is going to look like."

So we decided we really needed to permanently resolve this thing. We did that. We've completed all our internal testing, it looks great. But it does completely reset the clock on the customer tests as well. And so we've now started that. The vehicles are actually under test as we speak. It's going well, but it did reset the whole clock. So unfortunately, what was a fairly minor change and minor fix does reset the clock, and that means you're probably looking at something where deliveries will probably start in second half of this year. Now we've built many, many of the vehicles, so there's a lot of vehicles sitting there. They're -- they've been modified. You know, it's a minor change.

On the call today we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.
Textron's revenues in the quarter were $3.2 billion, up $128 million from last year's finance -- first quarter. Income from continuing operations was $0.55 per share, up 19.6% from $0.46 reported in last year's first quarter.

Revenues were up 4.2% in the quarter, reflecting the success of our strategy of investing for growth, both in new products and acquisitions. Segment revenue was up in Industrial, Aviation and Systems while essentially flat at Bell, consistent with our expectations. 
At Bell, we delivered 6 V-22s, flat with last year's first quarter; 10 H-1s, up 4 units from last year; and 30 commercial helicopters, down from 35 a year ago. On the commercial side, we had a good showing at Heli-Expo, where we displayed actual flight test articles of our new 525 Relentless and 505 Jet Ranger, both of which generated significant interest. At the show, we signed a letter of intent for 10 525s with [indiscernible] group, a Chinese investment company. More recently, we also signed an LOI with PT White Sky Aviation [ph], an Indonesian operator, for 30 505s. Development on both programs is proceeding well. 
The 3 test 505 helicopters have completed over 700 test hours with certification and first deliveries expected later this year. 525 has 2 aircraft in flight test with a third unit expected to enter soon. The relentless is meeting or exceeding all of its performance objectives, including having demonstrated a top speed in excess of 200 knots. The effectiveness of 525 integrated fly-by-wire design has been evident during the testing by the aircraft superior in-flight handling, maneuverability and stability. Combining these factors should significantly contribute to the value of this aircraft to our customers. 
At HAI, we also announced the new Bell consumer advantage plan or CAP, which provides our customers the opportunity to lock in predictable, cost-effective maintenance for their aircraft. Our CAP product deliver broad covered solutions for our customers' daily operation, which, in turn, protects the value of their investment while increasing our craft available. We were also named #1 in helicopter service and support for the 22nd consecutive year by Pro Pilot Magazine. 
On the H-1 front, we have received recent orders from the DoD for 61 additional units, including 9 FMS units for Pakistan. This takes production through the first quarter of 2019. The remaining U.S. DoD program record and significant additional foreign military demand provide a solid launch for outlook for this program. 
Moving to Systems. Revenues were up modestly, primarily driven by higher Unmanned Systems volumes. During the quarter, Textron Relentless systems received $174 million contract for 5 additional ship to shore units to be delivered in 2020. Earlier this month, we were also awarded a contract for 60 COMMANDO Select Armored Vehicles to be delivered this year in Iraq and Columbia. On the Canadian program, we're on track for delivery beginning the third quarter as we successfully completed because reliability testing program 2 weeks ago. 
At TRUE stimulation and training, we were awarded another contract by Boeing to design and manufacture simulators for the newest twin-aisle airplanes, the 777x. 
Moving to Industrial, we saw a 9.2% increase in revenue, reflecting our continued investments. During the quarter, specialized vehicles we launched our newest product, the Onslaught 550, a mid-sized 4x4 ATV. At Jake, we announced the HR 700, which was the world's 14-foot wide rotary motor, providing increased productivity for our professional customers. At tools and test, new products in our electric utility space are driving significant growth for this category. At our selective reduction products and geographic expansion drove growth in excess of global vehicle production rates. 
Moving to Textron Aviation. We delivered 34 Jets in the quarter compared to 33 last year and 26 King Airs compared to 25 last year. Our sales success affirms our strategy of investing new products is resonating with our craft buyers. During the first quarter, we also received European certification for the Latitude as well as the Pro Line Fusion and King Air 250 and 350. Advance sales of Latitude fractionals NetJets to their end customers have been going very well, and we look forward to starting deliveries of the new aircraft later this summer. 
To sum up, we had a good start to the year as demand in our end markets finished the quarter generally consistent with what we were expecting. Operationally, we also had another good quarter as we achieved margin improvements at each of our manufacturing segments. We continue to believe that we will be able to generate solid overall growth in revenue, earnings and cash this year. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank."

Segment profit in the quarter was $280 million, up $21 million from the first quarter of 2015 on $128 million increase in revenues. 
Let's review how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron Aviation. At Textron Aviation, revenues were up $40 million from this period last year, primarily due to higher jet volume. Segment profit was $73 million, up from $67 million a year ago. Backlog in this segment ended the quarter at $1,047,000,000 lower than at the end of the fourth quarter. 
Moving to Bell. Revenues were essentially flat as higher military revenues offset lower commercial revenues. Segment profit increased $6 million from the first quarter of 2015, primarily due to improved performance. 
At Systems, revenues were up $9 million, primarily due to higher Unmanned Systems volumes while segment profit was up $1 million. 
Industrial revenues increased $80 million due to higher overall volumes and the impact of acquisitions. Segment profit increased $9 million, also reflecting the higher volumes and the impact of acquisitions. 
Finance segment revenues decreased $2 million, and profit decreased $1 million. 
Moving below the segment line, corporate segment -- corporate expenses were $32 million compared to $43 million last year, reflecting the impact of a lower stock price in our share-based compensation expense. Interest expense was $33 million, flat from last year. 
During the quarter, we issued $350 million in 10-year notes at a rate of 4%. This was effectively prefunding the retirement of $250 million in 4 5/8 notes that are set to mature in September. We also repurchased 6.2 million shares of stock during the quarter, returning $215 million in cash to shareholders. 
To wrap up with guidance, we are confirming our expected full year EPS from continuing operations of $2.60 to $2.80 a share, and cash flow from continuing operations of the manufacturing group before pension contributions of $600 million to $700 million. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. So Greg, we can open the line for questions."

So true -- when we bought Mechtronix, obviously part of the rationale for the acquisition was we felt they had some terrific technology, very capable team and a great product, but they were very small company, and they had, had some challenges and got a little overleveraged at one point and ran into some can financial trouble. And that hurts you in that market because when you look at the customers, whether it's a Boeing or a lot of the major airlines in the world, these assets are like an aircraft they're very long-lived, right? So companies want to know when you're buying a fairly high dollar capital item that you're going to be able to be around and provide the services and support and upgrades and such over time, and I do think that one of the things that hampered them in the marketplace was as a result of their financial struggles. They had some uncertainty around them. So it was any technical or product problem. It was a business liability issue, and obviously, when we acquired sort of put our balance sheet and reputation behind it, that kind of got rid of that sort of barrier with a lot of customers. So the team up there won the 737 MAX a couple of years ago. I think that they've executed very, very well on that. The Boeing folks obviously have been very happy with how the team has performed on the 737 MAX, and that gave them confidence to then also make us their partner on the 777 X. So if you execute well and perform well, it can snowball in the right direction. But for sure, part of the underlying pieces of the deal was he thought you had a company that a lot of great technology, great product, great capability, but it needed to have a little more certainty and strength from a financial standpoint, and I think we provided that."

Customers, obviously, want to fly that and see that before they would place an order. And the other was around airworthiness how do you get a certification and as I think you heard publicly, there is now Air Force program. There's program office, where they will conduct Airworthiness Certification of aircraft that were not funded in development by the Air Force. And so we've already submitted our application in that process, so that's a work in progress as well.

So they had a company who had great relations with a number of our customers that looked at a mix of how they maintain their fleet with a combination of both new parts as well as some parts can be overhauled. We've entered that business through the acquisition with Able, and frankly, that's going very well so far. We also acquired in the first quarter a company called. This is a company that provides technical training and principally under contract to the U.S. Navy. So supporting our current customers with fly missions that allow the Navy and the Marine Corps to not utilize their own asset to provide things like training, controlling training as well as adversary forces for schools like top gun as well as a lot of other aggressor forces to emulate enemy aircraft and exercises conducted by the U.S. Navy and the Marine Corps. I also has history doing some work for the Air Force. There's a number of opportunities out there that we think we continue to grow in that space, and that's a nice augmentation for us in terms of how we address customers within the U.S. as well as internationally to provide training capability. There was also a very small acquisition that we did in the quarter, a lot of the service and support that was done on the simulation training platforms in particular, the actual simulator maintenance, which is an important part of the business. That had been effectively outsourced for quite some time to a small company that was doing that. We think providing the right level of service to support is critical to those products over time and didn't feel comfortable we should be dependent on a third party. So we acquired that was basically acquiring the people. So they're now part of the company as opposed to having third party conducting that service and support speech.

Before we begin, I'd like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release.
On the call today we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. 
Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.
Textron's revenues in the quarter were $3.2 billion, up $128 million from last year's finance -- first quarter. Income from continuing operations was $0.55 per share, up 19.6% from $0.46 reported in last year's first quarter.

Revenues were up 4.2% in the quarter, reflecting the success of our strategy of investing for growth both in new products and acquisitions. Segment revenue was up in Industrial, Aviation and Systems while essentially flat at Bell, consistent with our expectations. 
At Bell, we delivered 6 V-22s, flat with last year's first quarter; 10 H-1s, up 4 units from last year; and 30 commercial helicopters, down from 35 a year ago. On the commercial side, we had a good showing at Heli-Expo where we displayed actual flight test articles of our new 525 Relentless and 505 Jet Ranger, both of which generated significant interests. At the show, we signed a letter of intent for 10 525s with [indiscernible] Group, a Chinese investment company. More recently, we also signed an LOI with PT White Sky Aviation, an Indonesian operator, for 30 505s. Development on both programs is proceeding well. 
The 3 test 505 helicopters have completed over 700 test hours with certification and first deliveries expected later this year. The 525 has 2 aircraft in flight test with a third unit expected to enter soon. The Relentless is meeting or exceeding all of its performance objectives including having demonstrated a top speed in excess of 200 knots. The effectiveness of 525's integrated fly-by-wire design has been evident during the testing by the aircraft's superior in-flight handling, maneuverability and stability. Combining these factors should significantly contribute to the value of this aircraft for our customers. 
At HAI, we also announced the new Bell Customer Advantage Plan or CAP, which provides our customers the opportunity to lock in predictable, cost-effective maintenance for their aircraft. Our CAP product delivers broad covered solutions for our customers' daily operation, which, in turn, protects the value of their investment while increasing aircraft availability. 
We were also named #1 in helicopter service and support for the 22nd consecutive year by Pro Pilot magazine. 
On the H-1 front, we have received recent orders from the DoD for 61 additional units including 9 FMS units for Pakistan. This takes production through the first quarter of 2019. The remaining U.S. DoD program record and significant additional foreign military demand provide a solid launch and outlook for this program. 
Moving to Systems. Revenues were up modestly, primarily driven by higher Unmanned Systems volumes. During the quarter, Textron Relentless systems received $174 million contract for 5 additional ship-to-shore units to be delivered in 2020. Earlier this month, we were also awarded a contract for 60 COMMANDO Select Armored Vehicles to be delivered this year in Iraq and Colombia. On the Canadian TAPV program, we're on track for deliveries beginning in the third quarter as we successfully completed the customer reliability testing program 2 weeks ago. 
At TRU Simulation + Training, we were just awarded another contract by Boeing to design and manufacture simulators for their newest twin-aisle airplane, the 777X. 
Moving to Industrial. We saw a 9.2% increase in revenue, reflecting our continued investments. During the quarter, in Specialized Vehicles, we launched our newest Bad Boy product, the Onslaught 550, a midsized 4x4 ATV. 
At Jake, we announced the HR700, which is the world's first 14-foot-wide rotary motor, providing increased productivity for our professional turf care customers. 
At Tools & Test, new products in our electric utility space are driving significant growth from this category. 
At Kautex, our selective catalytic reduction products and geographic expansion drove growth in excess of global vehicle production rates. 
Moving to Textron Aviation. We delivered 34 jets in the quarter compared to 33 last year and 26 King Airs compared to 25 last year. Our sales success affirms that our strategy of investing in new products is resonating with aircraft buyers. 
During the first quarter, we also received European certification for the Latitude as well as the Pro Line Fusion-equipped King Air 250 and 350. Advance sales of Latitude fractionals by NetJets to their end customers have been going very well and we look forward to starting deliveries of the new aircraft later this summer. 
To sum up. We had a good start to the year as demand in our end markets finished the quarter generally consistent with what we were expecting. Operationally, we also had another good quarter as we achieved margin improvements at each of our manufacturing segments. We continue to believe that we will be able to generate solid overall growth in revenue, earnings and cash this year. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank."

Segment profit in the quarter was $280 million, up $21 million from the first quarter of 2015 on $128 million increase in revenues. 
Let's review how each of the segments contributed starting with Textron Aviation. At Textron Aviation, revenues were up $40 million from this period last year, primarily due to higher jet volume. Segment profit was $73 million, up from $67 million a year ago. Backlog in this segment ended the quarter at $1,047,000,000 lower than at the end of the fourth quarter. 
Moving to Bell. Revenues were essentially flat as higher military revenues offset lower commercial revenues. Segment profit increased $6 million from the first quarter of 2015, primarily due to improved performance. 
At Systems, revenues were up $9 million, primarily due to higher Unmanned Systems volumes while segment profit was up $1 million. 
Industrial revenues increased $80 million due to higher overall volumes and the impact of acquisitions. Segment profit increased $9 million, also reflecting the higher volumes and the impact of acquisitions. 
Finance segment revenues decreased $2 million and profit decreased $1 million. 
Moving below the segment line. Corporate segment -- or corporate expenses were $32 million compared to $43 million last year, reflecting the impact of a lower stock price on our share-based compensation expense. Interest expense was $33 million, flat from last year. 
During the quarter, we issued $350 million in 10-year notes at a rate of 4%. This was effectively prefunding the retirement of $250 million in 4 5/8% notes that are set to mature in September. We also repurchased 6.2 million shares of stock during the quarter, returning $215 million in cash to shareholders. 
To wrap up with guidance. We are confirming our expected full year EPS from continuing operations of $2.60 to $2.80 a share, and cash flow from continuing operations of the manufacturing group before pension contributions of $600 million to $700 million. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. So Greg, we can open the line for questions."

We had an awful lot of R&D spending, frankly, as we're getting ready to do the first Longitude flight here coming up in the early part of this summer. And so even with step-up as you note in there, which was probably $5 million, $6 million, something like that, that was more than offset by a fair bit of R&D spending to get ready for Longitude. So there's nothing fundamentally different, I don't think.

And again, the number in Q1 is such a small incremental on the revenue that I don't think you can read a whole lot into it in terms of leverage."

We tend to have inventory build associated with products that do sell off good, better and different. Aviation and Bell tend to have more higher sales in the latter part of the year. So on an absolute basis, there's -- I don't think there's anything terribly surprising. In terms of the year-over-year comparative, we do have a situation with respect to customer deposits primarily -- almost exclusively, frankly, on the military side of Bell whereas as a result of performance-based payments over the last couple of years, we had a favorable position in terms of working capital, which will unwind through the course of this year and that's a good part of what you're seeing here in the first quarter. But those numbers are absolutely consistent with what we guided you guys in the overall cash number. So we'll see that working capital impact through the course of the year. But again, completely planned and consistent with expectation and so we have no change in our confidence in terms of our overall cash flow for the year."

But certainly, the scope of that contract is to provide the simulators for their use as well as their training centers and beyond that, obviously, a lot of Boeing's 777 customers will buy their own simulators for doing their own pilot training. So I think that the scope of the contract that we have is for the sales directly to Boeing. But obviously, from our perspective, while that's a great contract and we're thrilled to have it, it also gives us, we think, the position in the marketplace that we should win our fair share of end customers from Boeing who buy their own simulator. So it's the contract value specifically associated with Boeing plus future opportunities that are still to be determined."

So true -- when we bought Mechtronix, obviously part of the rationale for the acquisition was we felt they had some terrific technology, very capable team and a great product. But they were a very small company and they had, had some challenges and got a little over-leveraged at one point and ran into some can financial trouble and that hurts you in that market because when you look at the customers, whether it's a Boeing or a lot of the major airlines in the world, these assets are like an aircraft. They're very long-lived, right, so companies want to know when you're buying a fairly high dollar capital item that you're going to be able to be around and provide the service and support and upgrades and such over time. And I do think that one of the things that hampered them in the marketplace was, as a result of their financial struggles, they had some uncertainty around them. So it wasn't a technical or product problem, it was a business liability issue and obviously when we acquired them and sort of put our balance sheet and reputation behind it, that kind of got rid of that sort of barrier with a lot of customers. So the team up there won the 737 MAX a couple of years ago. I think that they've executed very, very well on that. The Boeing folks obviously have been very happy with how the team has performed on the 737 MAX and that gave them confidence to then also make us their partner on the 777X. So if you execute well and perform well, it can sort of snowball in the right direction. But for sure, part of the underlying pieces of the deal was that we thought we had a company that a lot of great technology, great product, great capability, but it needed to have a little more certainty and strength from a financial standpoint and I think we've provided that."

We've had the aircraft all over the country. We've had a lot of customers flying it. Really the next major milestone for us -- well, there's really 2. One is that we've had a couple relatively minor things that we wanted to change in the production configuration of the aircraft. We've completed that engineering work and we're in the manufacturing process right now, building that, let's call it, the conforming production version of the aircraft. Customers obviously want to fly that and see that before they would place an order. And the other issue was, for us, was always around airworthiness and how do you get a certification. And as I think you've heard publicly, there is now an Air Force program. They're standing of a program office where they will conduct airworthiness certification of aircraft that were not funded in development by the Air Force. And so we've already submitted our application in that process. So that's sort of a work in progress as well. So we think this all kind of dovetails with getting the first conforming article built and ready to fly here in probably early to midsummer, and the air airworthiness program will get underway and the Air Force ultimately will provide the airworthiness certification of that aircraft, which is a big deal to all of our prospective customers so..."

That's now integrated into our Aviation services network, but it's providing both work -- or actually right now, probably more Bell than anything else. So they had a company who had great relations with a number of our customers that looked at a mix of how they maintain their fleet with a combination of both new parts as well as some parts that can be overhauled. We've entered that business through that acquisition with Able and frankly that's going very well so far. We also acquired in the first quarter a company called ATAC. This is a company that provides tactical training and principally under contract to the U.S. Navy. So supporting our current customers with fly missions that allow the Navy and the Marine Corps to not utilize their own assets to provide things like tactical area training, controller training as well as adversary forces for schools like Top Gun as well as a lot of other aggressor forces to emulate enemy aircraft and exercises conducted by the U.S. Navy and the Marine Corps. It also has history doing some work for the Air Force. There's a number of opportunities out there that we think we continue to grow in that space and that's a nice augmentation for us in terms of how we address customers both in the U.S. as well as internationally to provide training capability. There was also a very small acquisition that we did in the quarter, a lot of the service and support that was done on the TRU Simulation + Training platforms, in particular the actual simulator maintenance, which is an important part of the business. That had been effectively outsourced for quite some time to a small company that was doing that. We think providing the right level of service and support is critical to those products over time and didn't feel comfortable that we should be dependent on a third party, so we acquired -- it was basically acquiring the people so that they're now part of the company as opposed to having a third party conducting that service and support."

Revenues were up 4.2% in the quarter, reflecting the success of our strategy of investing for growth both in new products and acquisitions. Segment revenue was up in Industrial, Aviation and Systems while essentially flat at Bell, consistent with our expectations. 
At Bell, we delivered 6 V-22s, flat with last year's first quarter; 10 H-1s, up 4 units from last year; and 30 commercial helicopters, down from 35 a year ago. On the commercial side, we had a good showing at Heli-Expo where we displayed actual flight test articles of our new 525 Relentless and 505 Jet Ranger, both of which generated significant interest. At the show, we signed a letter of intent for 10 525s with Guangxi Diwang Group, a Chinese investment company. More recently, we also signed an LOI with PT Whitesky Aviation, an Indonesian operator, for 30 505s. Development on both programs is proceeding well. 
The 3 test 505 helicopters have completed over 700 test hours with certification and first deliveries expected later this year. The 525 has 2 aircraft in flight test with a third unit expected to enter soon. The Relentless is meeting or exceeding all of its performance objectives including having demonstrated a top speed in excess of 200 knots. The effectiveness of 525's integrated fly-by-wire design has been evident during the testing by the aircraft's superior in-flight handling, maneuverability and stability. Combining these factors should significantly contribute to the value of this aircraft for our customers. 
At HAI, we also announced the new Bell Customer Advantage Plan or CAP, which provides our customers the opportunity to lock in predictable, cost-effective maintenance for their aircraft. Our CAP product delivers broad covered solutions for our customers' daily operation, which, in turn, protects the value of their investment while increasing aircraft availability. 
We were also named #1 in helicopter service and support for the 22nd consecutive year by Pro Pilot magazine. 
On the H-1 front, we have received recent orders from the DoD for 61 additional units including 9 FMS units for Pakistan. This takes production through the first quarter of 2019. The remaining U.S. DoD Program of Record and significant additional foreign military demand provide a solid long-term outlook for this program. 
Moving to Systems. Revenues were up modestly, primarily driven by higher Unmanned Systems volumes. During the quarter, at Textron Marine & Land Systems we received $174 million contract for 5 additional ship-to-shore units to be delivered in 2020. Earlier this month, we were also awarded a contract for 60 COMMANDO Select Armored Vehicles to be delivered this year in Iraq and Colombia. On the Canadian TAPV program, we're on track for deliveries to begin in the third quarter as we successfully completed the customer reliability testing program 2 weeks ago. 
At TRU Simulation + Training, we were just awarded another contract by Boeing to design and manufacture simulators for their newest twin-aisle airplane, the 777X. 
Moving to Industrial. We saw a 9.2% increase in revenue, reflecting our continued investments. During the quarter, in Specialized Vehicles, we launched our newest Bad Boy product, the Onslaught 550, a midsized 4x4 ATV. 
At Jake [ph], we announced the HR700, which is the world's first 14-foot-wide rotary mower, providing increased productivity for our professional turf care customers. 
At Tools & Test, new products in our electric utility space are driving significant growth in this category. 
At Kautex, our selective catalytic reduction products and geographic expansion drove growth in excess of global vehicle production rates. 
Moving to Textron Aviation. We delivered 34 jets in the quarter compared to 33 last year and 26 King Airs compared to 25 last year. Our sales success affirms that our strategy of investing in new products is resonating with aircraft buyers. 
During the first quarter, we also received European certification for the Latitude as well as the Pro Line Fusion-equipped King Air 250 and 350. Advance sales of Latitude fractionals by NetJets to their end customers have been going very well and we look forward to starting deliveries of the new aircraft later this summer. 
To sum up. We had a good start to the year as demand in our end markets finished the quarter generally consistent with what we were expecting. Operationally, we also had another good quarter as we achieved margin improvements at each of our manufacturing segments. We continue to believe that we will be able to generate solid overall growth in revenue, earnings and cash this year. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank."

Segment profit in the quarter was $280 million, up $21 million from the first quarter of 2015 on $128 million increase in revenues. 
Let's review how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron Aviation. At Textron Aviation, revenues were up $40 million from this period last year, primarily due to higher jet volume. Segment profit was $73 million, up from $67 million a year ago. Backlog in this segment ended the quarter at $1,047,000,000 lower than at the end of the fourth quarter. 
Moving to Bell. Revenues were essentially flat as higher military revenues offset lower commercial revenues. Segment profit increased $6 million from the first quarter of 2015, primarily due to improved performance. 
At Systems, revenues were up $9 million, primarily due to higher Unmanned Systems volumes while segment profit was up $1 million. 
Industrial revenues increased $80 million due to higher overall volumes and the impact of acquisitions. Segment profit increased $9 million, also reflecting the higher volumes and the impact of acquisitions. 
Finance segment revenues decreased $2 million and profit decreased $1 million. 
Moving below the segment line. Corporate segment -- or corporate expenses were $32 million compared to $43 million last year, reflecting the impact of a lower stock price on our share-based compensation expense. Interest expense was $33 million, flat from last year. 
During the quarter, we issued $350 million in 10-year notes at a rate of 4%. This was effectively prefunding the retirement of $250 million in 4 5/8% notes that are set to mature in September. We also repurchased 6.2 million shares of stock during the quarter, returning $215 million in cash to shareholders. 
To wrap up with guidance. We are confirming our expected full year EPS from continuing operations of $2.60 to $2.80 a share, and cash flow from continuing operations of the manufacturing group before pension contributions of $600 million to $700 million. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. So Greg, we can open the line for questions."

So in terms of leverage, we're talking about sort of what I would call the law of small numbers, okay? We, I think, had pretty good execution by the team. We had an awful lot of R&D spending, frankly, as we're getting ready to do the first Longitude flight here coming up in the early part of this summer. And so even with step-up as you note in there, which was probably $5 million, $6 million, something like that, that was more than offset by a fair bit of R&D spending to get ready for Longitude. So there's nothing fundamentally different, I don't think. The mix obviously was more biased towards Latitudes and some of our Legacy aircraft, but that's something we expected and kind of talked about in the context of our overall guidance for the segment leverage for the year, and I think that's what we're seeing kind of play through."

The 525 flight test programs are going very well and are consuming expense at about the pace we expected. V-280 is going very well.

But I mean, I really don't think there's anything fundamental we look at in the leverage issue in the first quarter as being indicative of what's going to happen in Q2, 3 and 4. So our guidance that we provided you guys around sort of that window of overall operating margin percent, I think we're on track to do that in the revenue side.

So on an absolute basis, there's -- I don't think there's anything terribly surprising. In terms of the year-over-year comparative, we do have a situation with respect to customer deposits primarily -- almost exclusively, frankly, on the military side of Bell whereas as a result of performance-based payments over the last couple of years, we had a favorable position in terms of working capital, which will unwind through the course of this year and that's a good part of what you see here in the first quarter.

But obviously, from our perspective, while that's a great contract and we're thrilled to have it, it also gives us, we think, the position in the marketplace that we should win our fair share of end customers from Boeing who buy their own simulator.

So true -- when we bought Mechtronix, obviously part of the rationale for the acquisition was we felt they had some terrific technology, very capable team and a great product.

So true -- when we bought Mechtronix, obviously part of the rationale for the acquisition was we felt they had some terrific technology, very capable team and a great product. But they were a very small company and they had, had some challenges and got a little over-leveraged at one point and ran into some financial trouble. And that hurts you in that market because when you look at big customers, whether it's a Boeing or a lot of the major airlines in the world, these assets are like an aircraft. They're very long-lived, right, so companies want to know when you're buying a fairly high-dollar capital item that you're going to be able to be around and provide the service and support and upgrades and such over time. And I do think that one of the things that hampered them in the marketplace was, as a result of their financial struggles, they had some uncertainty around them. So it wasn't a technical or product problem, it was a business liability issue and obviously when we acquired them and sort of put our balance sheet and reputation behind it that kind of got rid of that sort of barrier with a lot of customers. So the team up there won the 737 MAX a couple of years ago. I think that they've executed very, very well on that. The Boeing folks, obviously, have been very happy with how the team has performed on the 737 MAX, and that gave them confidence to then also make us their partner on the 777X. So if you execute well and perform well, it can sort of snowball in the right direction. But for sure, part of the underlying thesis of the deal was that we thought we had a company that a lot of great technology, great product, great capability, but it needed to have a little more certainty and strength from a financial standpoint and I think we've provided that."

One is that we've had a couple relatively minor things that we wanted to change in the production configuration of the aircraft. We've completed that engineering work, and we're in the manufacturing process right now, building that, let's call it, the conforming production version of the aircraft. Customers obviously want to fly that and see that before they would place an order. And the other issue was, for us, was always around airworthiness and how do you get a certification. And as I think you've heard, publicly, there is now an Air Force program. They're standing up a program office where they will conduct airworthiness certifications of aircraft that were not funded in development by the Air Force. And so we've already submitted our application in that process. So that's sort of a work in progress as well. So we think this all kind of dovetails with getting the first conforming article built and ready to fly here in probably early to midsummer, and the air airworthiness program will get underway and the Air Force ultimately will provide the airworthiness certification of that aircraft, which is a big deal to all of our prospective customers so..."

That's now integrated into our Aviation services network, but it's providing both work -- or actually right now, probably more Bell than anything else. So they had a company who had great relations with a number of our customers that looked at a mix of how they maintain their fleet with a combination of both new parts as well as some parts that can be overhauled. We've entered that business through that acquisition with Able and, frankly, that's going very well so far. We also acquired in the first quarter a company called ATAC. This is a company that provides tactical training and, principally, under contract to the U.S. Navy. So supporting our current customers, we fly missions that allow the Navy and the Marine Corps to not utilize their own assets to provide things like tactical area training, controller training as well as adversary forces for schools like Top Gun as well as a lot of other aggressor forces to emulate enemy aircraft in exercises conducted by the U.S. Navy and the Marine Corps. It also has history doing some work for the Air Force. There's a number of opportunities out there that we think we continue to grow in that space and that's a nice augmentation for us in terms of how we address customers both in the U.S. as well as internationally to provide training capability. There was also a very small acquisition that we did in the quarter, a lot of the service and support that was done on the TRU Simulation + Training platforms, in particular the actual simulator maintenance, which is an important part of the business. That had been, effectively, outsourced for quite some time to a small company that was doing that. We think providing the right level of service and support is critical to those products over time and didn't feel comfortable that we should be dependent on a third party.

On the call today we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer.
Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. Textron's revenue in the quarter were $3.5 billion, up $264 million from last year's second quarter. Income from continuing operations was $0.66 per share, up 10% from $0.60 reported in last year's second quarter. Manufacturing cash flow, before pension contributions, was a $26 million use of cash compared to a positive $106 million cash blow in last year's second quarter.

Before I discuss our results, I would like to comment on the 525 accident which occurred on July 6, during developmental test flight and tragically claim the lives of 2 Bell pilots. Both pilots were highly regarded individuals, well-respected members of Bell team and very experienced test pilots. We will miss them readily and keep them and their families in our thoughts and prayers.
We're currently providing assistance to the NTSB is supporting in the investigation to understand exactly what caused the accident. We suspended flight test activities on the program until we determine the cause of the accident. In the meantime, we're proceeding all of non-flight-related certification program activities. At this time, we do not have an estimate as to when fight testing might resume or the length of the delay and certification of our first deliveries. We do remained committed in the 525 program, and we'll work to ensure the aircraft will be a safe, reliable and high-performance helicopter.
Moving to the quarter, revenues were up 8.1%, reflecting our ongoing investments in both new products and acquisitions. Segment revenue was up in systems, industrial and aviation, while down in Bell consistent with our expectations.
At Bell, we delivered 6 V-22s flat with last year's second quarter, 9 H-1s, up from 6 units last year, and 24 commercial helicopters down from 39 a year ago. On the commercial side, our new 505 Jet Rangerx continues to generate strong interest in the marketplace and certification activities are running on track to support initial deliveries at the end of this year.
On the customer service front, during the quarter, we opened a new paint and delivery center in Prague to provide full aircraft completion and delivery capabilities to customers in the region.
Moving to the military side of the business. During the second quarter, we received an order for an additional V-22 under the current multiyear contract for delivery to U.S. Air Force. And earlier this week, we also received an order for 4 additional V-22s for delivery to Japan, and we continued to work with the DoD to identify sufficient quantities, both domestically and internationally to support a third multiyear contract.
We also continued to make progress on assembling our first V-28 aircraft as we reached the important milestone of meeting the wing and the cells to the aircraft fuselage in late April, bringing us one step closer to our scheduled first flight next year. 
We displayed our full scale markup at Farnborough last week and had significant interests from a large number of international customers.
Moving to systems, revenues were up significantly from the first quarter and last year, reflecting international weapons deliveries and higher unmanned aircraft volumes.
On the TAPV program at TMLS, we're making final preparations with our Canadian customer to begin deliveries next month. At our Unmanned Systems business, we received a contract for upgrading an additional 24 shadow systems, which takes us through the end of 2018 for this program. The shadow system also reached a major milestone during the quarter, achieving 1 million hours of in-service operation. 
Finally, at systems, earlier this year, we acquired a small business located in Newport near Virginia called Airborne Tactical Advantage Company, or ATAC. This business provides tactical flight training and air adversary services to the U.S. Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps using a fleet of 27 fighter and tactical aircraft flawn by former U.S. Military fighter pilots.
During the quarter, ATAC was awarded a new contract with the U.S. Navy, worth up to $43 million over the next year. A tax great fit for the company at it has significant synergies with a number of our businesses, and a good growth outlook as we believe the U.S. DoD and foreign militaries will increasingly rely on third parties to provide live airborne threat training services.
Moving to industrial, we saw an 8.3% increase in revenues, reflecting growth at Caltex and specialized vehicles. In specialized vehicles, we began shipping our newest Bad Boy off-road product, the Stampede 900, a recreational 4x4 utility vehicle with unmatched power and unrivaled hauling of storage capacity. We expect the Stampede will contribute to top line growth as this product taps into a new entirely market for this business.
During the quarter, we also acquired Premier engineering manufacturing, producer of the IC vehicles for the aviation industry. Premier will be part of our ground support business, which continues to grow nicely as airlines and airports invest in our infrastructure.
At Caltex, we continued to see good volume growth, reflecting ongoing adoption of our selective catalytic reduction product lines. Moving to Textron Aviation. Revenues were up $72 million, while profits were down $7 million. The increase in revenues reflected delivery of 45 jets in the quarter, compared to 36 last year and 23 King Airs compared to 30 last year. The increase in jets reflected 9 Latitudes, including our first delivery to NetJets. The Latitude continues to do well in the market, which superior performance, range, comfort and operating costs, and customer acceptance has been strong, including sales of fraction by NetJets to their end customers.
As result, NetJets increased their total expected contract requirement from 150 to 200 units, and accelerated their delivery schedule. However, launch pricing for the Latitude has been less than what we've hoped for due to competitive dynamics in this segment of the market, resulting in a lower per plane margin contribution.
Looking forward, while large portion of our capacities is currently allocated in NetJets, we continued to see strong end customer demand, which is translated to improved pricing for second half and next year deliveries.
Overall, we believe were still on track for our Aviation segment profit outlook, although our margins will likely be at the lower end of the range, where slightly higher volumes of expected Latitudes.
Longitude development continues to progress, as we made a wing in the cell for the aircraft fuselage on our first aircraft in May, and power the electrical distribution systems 3 weeks later. We're on track for first flight later this summer, and the aircraft continues to generate significant interest as customers anticipate its entry into service late next year.
On the service front, we opened our newest line maintenance station in Bremen, expanding our support offerings in Germany and throughout Europe. Moving to the Scorpion, the program is gaining momentum, as we began the U.S. DoD accreditation process with this week signing of a cooperative research and development agreement with the United States Air Force. Also production of the conforming aircraft is nearly complete with first flight expected next month.
We believe having the accreditation process underway and the conforming aircraft available for demo flights will help facilitate initial sales of the aircraft.
Last week, at Farnborough, we also announced that we were selected by the team of Kinetic and Telus to supply Scorpion jets for their bid on the U.K.'s air support to defense operational training program should they win the competition.
To sum up, demand in our end markets has been challenging, but we continue to believe that our new products and recent acquisitions will continue to contribute to overall growth in revenue, earnings and cash for the year.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank."

Segment profit in the quarter was $328 million, up $22 million from the second quarter of 2015, on a $264 million increase in revenues.
Let's review how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron Aviation. At Textron Aviation, revenues were up $72 million from this period last year, primarily due to volume and mix. Segment profit was $81 million, down from $88 million a year ago, primarily reflecting an unfavorable impact from the mix of products sold in the period. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $1.1 billion, $122 million higher than at the end of last -- at the end of the first quarter.
Moving to Bell. Revenues were down $46 million, primarily due to volume and mix. Segment profit decreased to $20 million from the second quarter of 2015 reflecting the lower volume and mix. At Textron Systems, revenues were up $165 million, primarily due to higher volumes in our weapons and sensors and unmanned product lines. Segment profit was up $39 million, reflecting the higher volumes and mix. 
Industrial revenues increased $77 million due to higher overall volumes and the impact of acquisitions. Segment profit increased $13 million, reflecting the higher volumes.
Finance segment revenues decreased $4 million, and profit decreased $3 million. Moving below the segment line, corporate expenses were $31 million compared to $33 million last year. Interest expense was $37 million, up $5 million from last year.
On the tax front, the Internal Revenue Service approved a settlement on July 11 of our 1998 to 2008 tax years. As a result, in the third quarter, we expect to record an income tax benefit, including the reversal of accrued interest of approximately $315 million, of which approximately $200 million or $0.74 per share is attributable to continuing operations. The settlement results in immaterial net benefit to claim consolidated cash during the year. 
To wrap up with guidance, we are reiterating our expected full-year EPS from continuing operations of $2.60 to $2.80 per share, exclusive of the tax settlement. We also continue to expect cash flow from continuing operations of manufacturing group before pension contributions of $600 million to $700 million.
That includes our prepared remarks. So Stacy, we can open the line for questions."

We've seen particular earlier in the year, a little bit of an uptick in Europe, which has been encouraging. Obviously, we saw a fair bit of dislocations here everywhere in the world in the last few weeks of the quarter, with the whole reaction of Brexit, I don't think any of that is actually fundamental at a macro level with Brexit, but just the upsets in the financial markets creates a lot of uncertainty, which kind of froze things up. But I think, other than that, we've seen a bit of a strengthening in Europe. South America is still very difficult. I think there's opportunities that are starting to show in some places like Argentina and that are starting to improve modestly, but Brazil, mostly down there are still very, very challenged. Middle East is there's activity certainly across most of our businesses, but again, it's a challenging environment. The conflict wars are going on down there, have allowed the government fairly distracted and focus on pretty immediate needs as opposed to much in the way of long-term work, but there's certainly are opportunities that are in the works. Southeast Asia, frankly, is probably one of the healthiest on the international markets in terms of opportunity. There's economies are a little more diversified and are doing okay. China continues to be okay for us, it's not the strength of the growth maybe it was in the past, but it was -- it's certainly, generally speaking, solid particularly in the Aviation segment. So Automotive, I think our numbers fairly well matched what you see going on the world. The European market actually has been kind of stronger. North America had general strength, but there's more strength in the larger vehicles and the trucks in the high-end and there are some of the smaller models, just I think reflecting the price of gas. So I don't think that you are seeing anything probably that will surprise you a lot versus just what's going on, in general, in terms of what GDP looks like in these various regions."

And with respect to pricing, I think our challenge on Latitude is that our competitor in net space has 2 aircraft, right? One, which is a little bit the smaller aircraft, which is really what we thought we would end up competing with, with the Latitude that was sort of our intention. And then you got us a larger aircraft, and those 2 aircraft have created a pricing problem. And I think our performance and our range were far superior to the smaller aircraft, which is where wanted to be,  but just kind of using the larger aircraft to try to compete with us, and that's really was generated a lot of the pricing problem. When you look at the Longitude, that's kind of the combination now where you have the much larger aircraft. And frankly, performance and range and I think will distinguish just very nicely from where the competition is. And so certainly our expectation is that we have a much better pricing position because we can distance ourselves in terms of the performance and capability of that aircraft, and there's none other aircraft the competitor has sitting on top of that to try to bring down on price to compete with it."

But I mean, obviously, we have to discussion with the board, we have had preliminary discussions and I wouldn't expect that it would be an issue."

And so I think, that expectation is kind of what we're seeing. I know we are seeing good demand on the Latitude, both from the NetJets as well as on the retail side. And other models are selling fine, they're selling consistent with how we expected. Some models are stronger than others. But, in general, the volume on the jet side is what we expected. And the thing that's driving the upside in terms of growth on a year-over-year basis, and then we would continue expect to see that as we rolled into next year is based on Latitude.

And generally speaking, for us, will serve to offset an awful lot of that in Q3 and Q4 as we see working capital reductions and lots of inventory through volume, largely in Aviation and Bell as we go through the balance of the year. And Taffy, of course, remember we don't start deliveries of those units here until August.

And those orders now are firming up and coming in being exercised, either under the multiyear 2 contract or as some of the potential volume in the multiyear 3 deal. There continued to be a number of conversations with international customers that are going on. I certainly still think that there is a potential that was talked about for quite a while, and then sort of moved out, and there's still uncertainty around that, but I think there's still conversations going on, which are, at this point, very much government to government. The same is true with a couple of other countries. And so those are things, however, we all be talked about in the context of a multiyear 3, so it's not something that's going to hit here in the next couple of years. The only ones we'll see really we'll probably be Japan in that near-term. So there's certainly a lot of other discussion and opportunities dialogue going on, some which is -- public which is not around H-1s. The H1 is performing fabulously for the Marine Corps. It's both the utility and the attack versions of that are in the quote process. And for processes, for several potential international applications, so we'll be following that pretty closely. Scorpion is still very much a wildcard, it's a huge milestone for us to have the Air Force sign up to do the accreditation program, that's just happened this past week. We've had, as you know, a number of international customers that have been looking at the aircraft and they've really been 2 issues for them, one is how you going to get this thing certified, so they can provide their certification on top of it. And not unreasonably, customers want to fly production fully conforming aircraft. We have the accreditation path checked off, and in the next month or so, we'll be flying the first production configured aircraft. So our customers are already talking about when they'll be able to come in and get a chance to fly the aircraft. So 2 big milestones, sort of boxes that we needed to check to get done before we can proceed with final sales of the aircraft."

Now those aircraft, of course, turn into a lot of service opportunities.

So from our perspective, they're both selling. Certainly with the Latitude being new, it is generating a little bit more demand, which is exactly what we expected. And certainly, some of those customers, if you went back 2 years ago, maybe people model Latitude. But it's good having them both in the portfolio.

Before I discuss our results, I would like to comment on the 525 accident, which occurred on July 6, during developmental test flight and tragically claimed the lives of 2 Bell pilots. Both pilots were highly regarded individuals, well-respected members of Bell's team and very experienced test pilots. We will miss them greatly, and keep them and their families in our thoughts and prayers.
We're currently providing assistance to the NTSB in supporting investigation to understand exactly what caused the accident. We've suspended flight test activities on the program until we determine the cause of the accident. In the meantime, we're proceeding with all non-flight-related certification and program activities. At this time, we do not have an estimate as to when flight testing might resume or the length of the delay and certification of our first deliveries. We do remain committed in the 525 program, and we'll work to ensure the aircraft will be a safe, reliable and high-performance helicopter.
Moving to the quarter, revenues were up 8.1%, reflecting our ongoing investments in both new products and acquisitions. Segment revenue was up at systems, industrial and aviation, while down at Bell, consistent with our expectations. At Bell, we delivered 6 V-22s, flat with last year's second quarter; 9 H-1s, up from 6 units last year; and 24 commercial helicopters, down from 39 a year ago. On the commercial side, our new 505 Jet Ranger X continues to generate strong interest in the marketplace, and certification activities are running on track to support initial deliveries at the end of this year. On the customer service front, during the quarter, we opened a new paint and delivery center in Prague to provide full aircraft completion and delivery capabilities to the customer in the region.
Moving to the military side of the business. During the second quarter, we received an order for an additional V-22 under the current multiyear contract for delivery to the U.S. Air Force, and earlier this week, we also received an order for 4 additional V-22s for delivery to Japan, and we continued to work with the DoD to identify sufficient quantities, both domestically and internationally to support a third multiyear contract.  We also continued to make progress on assembling our first V-28 aircraft, as we reach the important milestone of mating the wing in the cells to the aircraft fuselage in late April, bringing us one step closer to our scheduled first flight next year. We displayed our full scale markup at Farnborough last week, and had significant interest from a large number of international customers.
Moving to systems. Revenues were up significantly from the first quarter and last year, reflecting international weapons deliveries and higher unmanned aircraft volumes. On the TAPV program at TMLS, we're making final preparations with our Canadian customer to begin deliveries next month. At our Unmanned Systems business, we received a contract for upgrading an additional 24 shadow systems, which takes us through the end of 2018 for this program. The shadow system also reached a major milestone during the quarter, achieving 1 million hours of in-service operation. 
Finally, at Systems, earlier this year, we acquired a small business located in Newport News, Virginia, called Airborne Tactical Advantage Company or ATAC. This business provides tactical flight training and air adversary services to the U.S. Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps using a fleet of 27 fighter and tactical aircraft, flown by former U.S. Military fighter pilots.
During the quarter, ATAC was awarded a new contract with the U.S. Navy, worth up to $43 million over the next year. ATAC's a great fit for the company, as it has significant synergies with a number of our businesses, and a good growth outlook, as we believe the U.S. DoD and foreign militaries will increasingly rely on third parties to provide live airborne threat training services.
Moving to Industrial. We saw an 8.3% increase in revenues, reflecting growth at Kautex and specialized vehicles. At specialized vehicles, we began shipping our newest Bad Boy Off Road product, the Stampede 900, a recreational 4x4 utility vehicle, with unmatched power and unrivaled hauling of storage capacity. We expect the Stampede will contribute to top line growth, as this product taps into an entirely new market for this business.
During the quarter, we also acquired Premier Engineering & Manufacturing, a producer of de-icing vehicles for the aviation industry. Premier will be part of our ground support business, which continues to grow nicely, as airlines and airports invest in our infrastructure. At Kautex, we continue to see good volume growth, reflecting ongoing adoption of our selective catalytic reduction product lines. 
Moving to Textron Aviation. Revenues were up $72 million, while profits were down $7 million. The increase in revenues reflected delivery of 45 jets in the quarter compared to 36 last year, and 23 King Airs compared to 30 last year. The increase in jets reflected 9 Latitudes, including our first delivery to NetJets. The Latitude continues to do well in the market with superior performance, range, comfort and operating cost, and customer acceptance has been strong, including sales of fractions by NetJets to their end customers. As a result, NetJets increased their total expected contract requirement from 150 to 200 units, and accelerated their delivery schedule. However, launch pricing for the Latitude has been less than what we had hoped for due to competitive dynamics in this segment of the market, resulting in a lower per plane margin contribution. Looking forward, while a large portion of our capacity is currently allocated in NetJets, we continue to see strong end customer demand, which is translated to improved pricing for second half and next year deliveries. Overall, we believe we're still on track for our Aviation segment profit outlook, although our margins will likely be at the lower end of the range, with slightly higher volumes of expected Latitudes.
Longitude development continues to progress, as we mated the wing in the cells for the aircraft fuselage on our first aircraft in May, and power the electrical distribution systems 3 weeks later. We're on track for first flight later this summer, and the aircraft continues to generate significant interest, and as customers anticipate its entry into service late next year. On the service front, we opened our newest line maintenance station in Bremen, expanding our support offerings in Germany and throughout Europe. 
Moving to the Scorpion, the program is gaining momentum, as we began the U.S. DoD accreditation process, with this week's signing of a cooperative research and development agreement with the United States Air Force. Also, production of the conforming aircraft is nearly complete, with first flight expected next month. We believe having the accreditation process underway and the conforming aircraft available for demo flights will help facilitate initial sales of the aircraft.
Last week, at Farnborough, we also announced that we were selected by the team of QinetiQ and Thales to supply Scorpion jets for their bid on the U.K.'s Air Support to Defence Operational Training program, should they win the competition.
To sum up, demand in our end markets has been challenging, but we continue to believe that our new products and recent acquisitions will continue to contribute to overall growth in revenue, earnings and cash for the year.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank."

Segment profit in the quarter was $328 million, up $22 million from the second quarter of 2015, on a $264 million increase in revenues.
Let's review how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron Aviation. At Textron Aviation, revenues were up $72 million from this period last year, primarily due to volume and mix. Segment profit was $81 million, down from $88 million a year ago, primarily reflecting an unfavorable impact from the mix of products sold in the period. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $1.1 billion, $122 million higher than at the end of last -- at the end of the first quarter.
Moving to Bell. Revenues were down $46 million, primarily due to volume and mix. Segment profit decreased to $20 million from the second quarter of 2015, reflecting the lower volume and mix. At Textron Systems, revenues were up $165 million, primarily due to higher volumes in our weapons and sensors and unmanned product lines. Segment profit was up $39 million, reflecting the higher volumes and mix. Industrial revenues increased $77 million due to higher overall volumes and the impact of acquisitions. Segment profit increased $13 million, reflecting the higher volumes. Finance segment revenues decreased $4 million, and profit decreased $3 million. Moving below the segment line, corporate expenses were $31 million compared to $33 million last year. Interest expense was $37 million, up $5 million from last year.
On the tax front, the Internal Revenue Service approved a settlement on July 11 of our 1998 to 2008 tax years. As a result, in the third quarter, we expect to record an income tax benefit, including the reversal of accrued interest of approximately $315 million, of which approximately $200 million or $0.74 per share is attributable to continuing operations. The settlement results in an immaterial net benefit to consolidated cash during the year. 
To wrap up with guidance, we are reiterating our expected full-year EPS from continuing operations of $2.60 to $2.80 per share, exclusive of the tax settlement. We also continue to expect cash flow from continuing operations of manufacturing group before pension contributions of $600 million to $700 million.
That concludes our prepared remarks. So Stacy, we can open the line for questions."

As I kind of mentioned on the last quarter, we think there's some number of opportunities out there that we're working on, which hopefully will give us some better visibility into the future. But at least, in terms of how we think the year will close out at Bell, for 2016, I think it will be consistent with our expectations."

We've seen in particular, earlier in the year, a little bit of an uptick in Europe, which has been encouraging. Now obviously, we saw a fair bit of dislocations here everywhere in the world in the last few weeks of the quarter, with the whole reaction of Brexit. I don't think any of that is actually fundamental at a macro level with Brexit, but just the upset in the financial markets creates a lot of uncertainty, which kind of froze things up. But I think, other than that, we've seen a bit of a strengthening in Europe. South America is still very difficult. I think there's some opportunities that are starting to show in some places like Argentina that are starting to improve modestly. But Brazil, most of the economies down there are still very, very challenged. Middle East is -- there's activity, certainly, across most of our businesses, but again, it's a challenging environment. The conflict wars are going on down there, have a lot of the governments fairly distracted and focus on pretty immediate needs as opposed to much in the way of long-term work, but there certainly are opportunities that are in the works. Southeast Asia, frankly, is probably one of the healthiest on the international markets in terms of opportunity. There's -- economies are a little more diversified and are doing okay. China continues to be okay for us. It's not the strength of the growth maybe than it was in the past, but it's -- it's certainly, generally speaking, solid, particularly in the Aviation segment. So Automotive, I think our numbers fairly well match what you see going on the world. The European market, actually, has been kind of stronger. North America's had general strength, but there's more strength in the larger vehicles and the trucks in the high-end than there are in some of the smaller models, just I think reflecting the price of gas. So I don't think that you were seeing anything probably that would surprise you a lot versus just what's going on, in general, in terms of what GDP looks like in these various regions."

We've had kind of our normal sort of customers have been into Wichita, pretty extensively looking at the aircraft. As you might recall, we had a full, not just a mockup, but a full aircraft that we displayed last year, and we've kept that aircraft at the plant. We've had lots of people coming in to look at it. And with respect to pricing, I think our challenge on Latitude is that our competitor in that space has 2 aircraft, right, one, which is a little bit the smaller aircraft, which is really what we thought we would end up competing with, with the Latitude. That was sort of our intention. And then they've got us a larger aircraft, and those 2 aircraft have created a pricing problem. And I think our performance and our range were far superior to the smaller aircraft, which is where wanted to be, but just kind of using the larger aircraft to try to compete with us, and that's really what's generated a lot of the pricing problem. When you look at Longitude, that's kind of the combination now where you have the much larger aircraft. And frankly, performance and range and [indiscernible] a little bit, I think, will distinguish us very nicely from where the competition is. And so certainly, our expectation is that we have a much better pricing position because we can distance ourselves in terms of the performance and capability of that aircraft, and there's not another aircraft that a competitor has sitting on top of that to try to bring down on price to compete with it."

We are seeing good demand on the Latitude, both on the NetJets as well as on the retail side, and other models are selling fine. They're selling consistent with how we expected. Some models are stronger than others, but in general, the volume on the jet side is what we expected, and the thing that's driving the upside in terms of growth on a year-over-year basis, and then we would continue to expect to see that as we roll into next year, is based on Latitude.

The same is true with a couple of other countries.

Now those aircraft, of course, turn into a lot of service opportunities. So I mean, net, the margins in the commercial side are still good because of all the service that those aircraft pull through with them.

I mean, we're talking to a lot of our customers, obviously, and we have a sense of where they are. Oil and gas, obviously, remains very difficult, right? I mean, you've got -- some of these guys are in bankruptcy, they've got a lot of their fleet that's sitting on the ground, they're just not being utilized. Now the oil and gas cycle is, in all likelihood, exactly that, a cycle, right? So I mean, we've seen a rebounding of the price of oil, but not back to where it probably needs to be for them to feel better and starting to probably impact possibly in some regions of the world, where $50 or so is -- you can extract and be profitable about. There are certainly other parts of the world where it needs to be significantly higher than that to make them feel like that end customer is going to start getting stronger. And of course, a lot of these economies, they're just oil and gas petrodollar based, so their economies will get healthier as that price per barrel rebounds. But we don't really have a great sense, at this point, what that lag is, between all those rebounds and pricing and how quickly that will flow through to having the ability to invest in their fleets, or, in general, those economies where people feel comfortable to start laying out the funding for significant CapEx kind of projects. But, anyway, I mean, I wish I had a very clear answer for you, but we talk to customers everyday, our team's out there working, we kind of know pretty much every opportunity in the world that's out there. It's just a matter of seeing some of those stuff start to convert to orders, and it's been soft. I mean, and when you see that in the volumes in the quarter, and I'd be misleading if I thought it was going to, all of a sudden, materially improve to affect the second half of this year, which is why I would say, I would expect unit volumes to be down sort of from where we would have expected it to be, but not with significant financial impact for the year. Again, in terms of how we look out any further than that, that's something we'll have to work on and factor that into how we guide for 2017, and that will depend a lot on just sort of the general outlook of what those conversations are like for customers. And in particular, a number of opportunities out there that are fairly significant, but will materialize or not between now and the end of the year."

And if you don't quite need the range and you don't quite need the number of passengers, but you want to go with that larger cabin, then the Latitude is a great choice. And I think what you're seeing is that we have a fair number of customers that will give up a few hundred nautical miles and don't need to have the higher passenger count, and they're the side of the Latitude. So from our perspective, they're both selling. Certainly, with the Latitude being new, it is generating a little bit more demand, which was exactly what we expected. And certainly, some of those customers, if you went back 2 years ago, there may have been people that would have bought a Latitude. But it's good having them both in the portfolio. It gives us the ability to deal and work with the customer, and say what's your mission and which one fits your mission better. And that's kind of where we are continuing to sell."

Before I discuss our results, I would like to comment on the 525 accident, which occurred on July 6, during developmental test flight and tragically claimed the lives of 2 Bell pilots. Both pilots were highly regarded individuals, well-respected members of Bell's team and very experienced test pilots. We will miss them greatly and keep them and their families in our thoughts and prayers.
We're currently providing assistance to the NTSB in supporting the investigation to understand exactly what caused the accident. We've suspended flight test activities on the program until we determine the cause of the accident. In the meantime, we're proceeding with all non-flight-related certification and program activities. At this time, we do not have an estimate as to when flight testing might resume or the length of the delay in certification or first deliveries. We do remain committed in the 525 program, and we'll work to ensure the aircraft will be a safe, reliable and high-performance helicopter.
Moving to the quarter, revenues were up 8.1%, reflecting our ongoing investments in both new products and acquisitions. Segment revenue was up at Systems, Industrial and Aviation, while down at Bell, consistent with our expectations. At Bell, we delivered 6 V-22s, flat with last year's second quarter; 9 H-1s, up from 6 units last year; and 24 commercial helicopters, down from 39 a year ago. On the commercial side, our new 505 Jet Ranger X continues to generate strong interest in the marketplace, and certification activities are running [ph] on track to support initial deliveries at the end of this year. On the customer service front, during the quarter, we opened the new paint and delivery center in Prague to provide full aircraft completion and delivery capabilities to the customers in the region.
Moving to the military side of the business. During the second quarter, we received an order for an additional V-22 under the current multiyear contract for delivery to the U.S. Air Force, and earlier this week, we also received an order for 4 additional V-22s for delivery to Japan, and we continued to work with the DoD to identify sufficient quantities, both domestically and internationally to support a third multiyear contract. We also continued to make progress on assembling our first V-280 aircraft, as we reached the important milestone of mating the wing and the cells to the aircraft fuselage in late April, bringing us one step closer to our scheduled first flight next year. We displayed our full scale mock-up at Farnborough last week, and had significant interest from a large number of international customers.
Moving to systems. Revenues were up significantly from the first quarter and last year, reflecting international weapons deliveries and higher unmanned aircraft volumes. On the TAPV program at TMLS, we're making final preparations with our Canadian customer to begin deliveries next month. At our Unmanned Systems business, we received a contract for upgrading an additional 24 Shadow Systems, which takes us through the end of 2018 for this program. The Shadow System also reached a major milestone during the quarter, achieving 1 million hours of in-service operation. 
Finally, at Systems, earlier this year, we acquired a small business located in Newport News, Virginia, called Airborne Tactical Advantage Company or ATAC. This business provides tactical flight training and air adversary services to the U.S. Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps using a fleet of 27 fighter and tactical aircraft, flown by former U.S. military fighter pilots.
During the quarter, ATAC was awarded a new contract with the U.S. Navy, worth up to $43 million over the next year. ATAC's a great fit for the company, as it has significant synergies with a number of our businesses and a good growth outlook, as we believe the U.S. DoD and foreign militaries will increasingly rely on third parties to provide live airborne threat training services.
Moving to Industrial. We saw an 8.3% increase in revenues, reflecting growth at Kautex and specialized vehicles. At specialized vehicles, we began shipping our newest Bad Boy Off Road product, the Stampede 900, a recreational 4x4 utility vehicle, with unmatched power and unrivaled hauling and storage capacity. We expect the Stampede will contribute to top line growth, as this product taps into an entirely new market for this business.
During the quarter, we also acquired Premier Engineering & Manufacturing, a producer of de-icing vehicles for the aviation industry. Premier will be part of our ground support business, which continues to grow nicely, as airlines and airports invest in their infrastructure. At Kautex, we continue to see good volume growth, reflecting ongoing adoption of our selective catalytic reduction product lines. 
Moving to Textron Aviation. Revenues were up $72 million, while profits were down $7 million. The increase in revenues reflected delivery of 45 jets in the quarter compared to 36 last year, and 23 King Airs compared to 30 last year. The increase in jets reflected 9 Latitudes, including our first delivery to NetJets. The Latitude continues to do well in the market with superior performance, range, comfort and operating cost, and customer acceptance has been strong, including sales of fractions by NetJets to their end customers. As a result, NetJets increased their total expected contract requirement from 150 to 200 units, and accelerated their delivery schedule. However, launch pricing for the Latitude has been less than what we had hoped for due to competitive dynamics in this segment of the market, resulting in a lower per plane margin contribution. Looking forward, while a large portion of our capacity is currently allocated to NetJets, we continue to see strong end customer demand, which has translated to improved pricing for second half and next year deliveries. Overall, we believe we're still on track for our Aviation segment profit outlook, although our margins will likely be at the lower end of the range, with slightly higher volumes of expected Latitudes.
Longitude development continues to progress, as we mated the wing and the cells to the aircraft fuselage on our first aircraft in May, and powered the electrical distribution systems 3 weeks later. We're on track for first flight later this summer, and the aircraft continues to generate significant interest and its customers anticipate its entry into service late next year. On the service front, we opened our newest line maintenance station in Bremen, expanding our support offerings in Germany and throughout Europe. 
Moving to the Scorpion, the program is gaining momentum, as we have begun the U.S. DoD accreditation process, with this week's signing of a cooperative research and development agreement with the United States Air Force. Also, production of the conforming aircraft is nearly complete, with first flight expected next month. We believe having the accreditation process underway and the conforming aircraft available for demo flights will help facilitate initial sales of the aircraft.
Last week, at Farnborough, we also announced that we were selected by the team of QinetiQ and Thales to supply Scorpion jets for their bid on the U.K.'s Air Support to Defence Operational Training program, should they win the competition.
To sum up, demand in our end markets has been challenging, but we continue to believe that our new products and recent acquisitions will continue to contribute to overall growth in revenue, earnings and cash for the year.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank."

Segment profit was up $39 million, reflecting the higher volumes and mix. Industrial revenues increased $77 million due to higher overall volumes and the impact of acquisitions. Segment profit increased $13 million, reflecting the higher volumes. Finance segment revenues decreased $4 million, and profit decreased $3 million. Moving below the segment line, corporate expenses were $31 million compared to $33 million last year. Interest expense was $37 million, up $5 million from last year.
On the tax front, the Internal Revenue Service approved a settlement on July 11 of our 1998 to 2008 tax years. As a result, in the third quarter, we expect to record an income tax benefit, including the reversal of accrued interest of approximately $315 million, of which approximately $200 million or $0.74 per share is attributable to continuing operations. The settlement results in an immaterial net benefit to consolidated cash during the year. 
To wrap up with guidance, we are reiterating our expected full-year EPS from continuing operations of $2.60 to $2.80 per share, exclusive of the tax settlement. We also continue to expect cash flow from continuing operations of the manufacturing group before pension contributions of $600 million to $700 million.
That concludes our prepared remarks. So Stacy, we can open the line for questions."

We've seen, in particular, earlier in the year, a little bit of an uptick in Europe, which has been encouraging. Now obviously, we saw a fair bit of dislocation here everywhere in the world in the last few weeks of the quarter, with the whole reaction to Brexit. I don't think any of that is actually fundamental at a macro level with Brexit, but just the upset in the financial markets creates a lot of uncertainty, which kind of froze things up. But I think, other than that, we've seen a bit of a strengthening in Europe. South America is still very difficult. I think there's some opportunities that are starting to show in some places like Argentina that are starting to improve modestly. But Brazil, most of the economies down there are still very, very challenged. Middle East is -- there's activity, certainly, across most of our businesses, but again, it's a challenging environment. The conflict wars are going on down there, have a lot of the governments fairly distracted and focused on pretty immediate needs as opposed to much in the way of long-term work, but there certainly are opportunities that are in the works. Southeast Asia, frankly, is probably one of the healthiest on the international markets in terms of opportunity. There's -- economies are a little more diversified and are doing okay. China continues to be okay for us. It's not the strength of the growth maybe than it was in the past, but it's -- it's certainly, generally speaking, solid, particularly in the Aviation segment. So Automotive, I think our numbers fairly well match what you see going on the world. The European market, actually, has been kind of stronger. North America has had general strength, but there's more strength in the larger vehicles and the trucks and the high-end than there are in some of the smaller models, just I think reflecting the price of gas. So I don't think that we're seeing anything probably that would surprise you a lot versus just what's going on, in general, in terms of what GDP looks like in these various regions."

As you may recall, we had a full, not just a mockup, but a full aircraft that we displayed last year, and we've kept that aircraft at the plant. We've had lots of people coming in to look at it. And with respect to pricing, I think our challenge on Latitude is that our competitor in that space has 2 aircraft, right, one, which is a little bit -- the smaller aircraft, which is really what we thought we would end up competing with, with the Latitude. That was sort of our intention. And then they've got us a larger aircraft, and those 2 aircraft have created a pricing problem. And I think our performance and our range were far superior to the smaller aircraft, which is where wanted to be, but they're [ph] kind of using the larger aircraft to try to compete with us, and that's really what's generated a lot of the pricing problem. When you look at Longitude, that's kind of the combination now where you have the much larger aircraft. And frankly, performance and range and load that, I think, will distinguish us very nicely from where the competition is. And so certainly, our expectation is that we have a much better pricing position because we can distance ourselves in terms of the performance and capability of that aircraft, and there's not another aircraft that a competitor has sitting on top of that to try to bring down on price to compete with it."

It's both the utility and the attack versions of that are in the quote process and proposal processes for several potential international applications, so we'll be following that pretty closely. Scorpion is still very much a wildcard. It was a huge milestone for us to have the Air Force sign up to do the accreditation program. That just happened this past week. And we've had, as you know, a number of international customers that have been looking at the aircraft. And there have really been 2 issues for them, one is how are you going to get this thing certified, so that they can provide their certification on top of it. And not unreasonably, customers want to fly the production fully-conforming aircraft. We have the accreditation path checked off and here in the next month or so, we'll be flying the first production configured aircraft. So customers are already talking about when they're going to be able to come in and get a chance to fly the aircraft.

So I think that business is in good shape and they'll deliver to our expectations. I do think we'll be lighter on some of the commercial volume in total number than we would have expected at the beginning of the year. But it's largely in a lot of the lighter helicopters, which is -- which, on the initial equipment sale, is not as material to the business as others. Now those aircraft, of course, turn into a lot of service opportunities. So I mean, net, the margins on the commercial side are still good because of all the service that those aircraft pull through with them. But to be light, in terms of volume, on some of the lighter aircraft will not have a meaningful impact within the year. In the end, it all comes down largely to the larger aircraft, in particular, the 412s, and I think we're on track to do that. And those are more heavily laid into the back half of the year."

I mean, you've got -- some of these guys are in bankruptcy, they've got a lot of their fleet that's sitting on the ground, they're just not being utilized. Now the oil and gas cycle is, in all likelihood, exactly that, a cycle, right? So I mean, we've seen a rebounding of the price of oil, but not back to where it probably needs to be for them to feel better. It's starting to probably impact, possibly, in some regions of the world, where $50 or so is -- you can extract and be profitable at that. There are certain other parts of the world where it needs to be significantly higher than that to make them feel like that end customer is going to start getting stronger. And of course, in a lot of these economies, they're just oil and gas petrodollar based, so their economies will get healthier as that price per barrel rebounds. But we don't really have a great sense, at this point, what that lag is, between [indiscernible] those rebounds in pricing and how quickly that will flow through to having the ability to invest in their fleets, or, in general, in those economies, for people to feel comfortable to start laying out the funding for significant CapEx kind of projects. But, anyway, I mean, I wish I had a very clear answer for you, but we talk to customers every day. Our team's out there working it. We kind of know pretty much every opportunity in the world that's out there. It's just a matter of seeing some of the stuff start to convert to orders, and it's been soft. I mean, and when you see that in the volumes in the quarter, and I'd be misleading if I thought it was going to, all of a sudden, materially improve to affect the second half of this year, which is why I would say, I would expect unit volumes to be down sort of from where we would have expected them to be, but not with significant financial impact for the year. Again, in terms of how we look out any further than that, that's something we'll have to work on and factor that into how we guide for 2017, and that will depend a lot on just sort of the general outlook of what those conversations are like with customers.

And I think what you're seeing is that we have a fair number of customers that will give up a few hundred nautical miles and don't need to have the higher passenger count, and they'll err on the side of the Latitude. So from our perspective, they're both selling. Certainly, with the Latitude being new, it is generating a little bit more demand, which was exactly what we expected. And certainly, some of those customers, if you went back 2 years ago, may have been people that would have bought a Latitude. But it's good having them both in the portfolio.

These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release. On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer.
Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. Textron's revenues in the quarter were $3.5 billion, up $264 million from last year's second quarter. Income from continuing operations was $0.66 per share, up 10% from $0.60 reported in last year's second quarter. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was a $26 million use of cash compared to a positive $106 million cash flow in last year's second quarter.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott."

Before I discuss our results, I would like to comment on the 525 accident, which occurred on July 6, during developmental test flight and tragically claimed the lives of 2 Bell pilots. Both pilots were highly regarded individuals, well-respected members of Bell's team and very experienced test pilots. We will miss them greatly and keep them and their families in our thoughts and prayers.
We're currently providing assistance to the NTSB in supporting the investigation to understand exactly what caused the accident. We've suspended flight test activities on the program until we determine the cause of the accident. In the meantime, we're proceeding with all non-flight-related certification and program activities. At this time, we do not have an estimate as to when flight testing might resume or the length of the delay in certification or first deliveries. We do remain committed in the 525 program, and we'll work to ensure the aircraft will be a safe, reliable and high-performance helicopter.
Moving to the quarter, revenues were up 8.1%, reflecting our ongoing investments in both new products and acquisitions. Segment revenue was up at Systems, Industrial and Aviation, while down at Bell, consistent with our expectations. At Bell, we delivered 6 V-22s, flat with last year's second quarter; 9 H-1s, up from 6 units last year; and 24 commercial helicopters, down from 39 a year ago. On the commercial side, our new 505 Jet Ranger X continues to generate strong interest in the marketplace, and certification activities are running [ph] on track to support initial deliveries at the end of this year. On the customer service front, during the quarter, we opened the new paint and delivery center in Prague to provide full aircraft completion and delivery capabilities to the customers in the region.
Moving to the military side of the business. During the second quarter, we received an order for an additional V-22 under the current multiyear contract for delivery to the U.S. Air Force, and earlier this week, we also received an order for 4 additional V-22s for delivery to Japan, and we continued to work with the DoD to identify sufficient quantities, both domestically and internationally to support a third multiyear contract. We also continued to make progress on assembling our first V-280 aircraft, as we reached the important milestone of mating the wing and the cells to the aircraft fuselage in late April, bringing us one step closer to our scheduled first flight next year. We displayed our full scale mock-up at Farnborough last week, and had significant interest from a large number of international customers.
Moving to systems. Revenues were up significantly from the first quarter and last year, reflecting international weapons deliveries and higher unmanned aircraft volumes. On the TAPV program at TMLS, we're making final preparations with our Canadian customer to begin deliveries next month. At our Unmanned Systems business, we received a contract for upgrading an additional 24 Shadow Systems, which takes us through the end of 2018 for this program. The Shadow System also reached a major milestone during the quarter, achieving 1 million hours of in-service operation. 
Finally, at Systems, earlier this year, we acquired a small business located in Newport News, Virginia, called Airborne Tactical Advantage Company or ATAC. This business provides tactical flight training and air adversary services to the U.S. Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps using a fleet of 27 fighter and tactical aircraft, flown by former U.S. military fighter pilots.
During the quarter, ATAC was awarded a new contract with the U.S. Navy, worth up to $43 million over the next year. ATAC's a great fit for the company, as it has significant synergies with a number of our businesses and a good growth outlook, as we believe the U.S. DoD and foreign militaries will increasingly rely on third parties to provide live airborne threat training services.
Moving to Industrial. We saw an 8.3% increase in revenues, reflecting growth at Kautex and specialized vehicles. At specialized vehicles, we began shipping our newest Bad Boy Off Road product, the Stampede 900, a recreational 4x4 utility vehicle, with unmatched power and unrivaled hauling and storage capacity. We expect the Stampede will contribute to top line growth, as this product taps into an entirely new market for this business.
During the quarter, we also acquired Premier Engineering & Manufacturing, a producer of de-icing vehicles for the aviation industry. Premier will be part of our ground support business, which continues to grow nicely, as airlines and airports invest in their infrastructure. At Kautex, we continue to see good volume growth, reflecting ongoing adoption of our selective catalytic reduction product lines. 
Moving to Textron Aviation. Revenues were up $72 million, while profits were down $7 million. The increase in revenues reflected delivery of 45 jets in the quarter compared to 36 last year, and 23 King Airs compared to 30 last year. The increase in jets reflected 9 Latitudes, including our first delivery to NetJets. The Latitude continues to do well in the market with superior performance, range, comfort and operating cost, and customer acceptance has been strong, including sales of fractions by NetJets to their end customers. As a result, NetJets increased their total expected contract requirement from 150 to 200 units, and accelerated their delivery schedule. However, launch pricing for the Latitude has been less than what we had hoped for due to competitive dynamics in this segment of the market, resulting in a lower per plane margin contribution. Looking forward, while a large portion of our capacity is currently allocated to NetJets, we continue to see strong end customer demand, which has translated to improved pricing for second half and next year deliveries. Overall, we believe we're still on track for our Aviation segment profit outlook, although our margins will likely be at the lower end of the range, with slightly higher volumes of expected Latitudes.
Longitude development continues to progress, as we mated the wing and the cells to the aircraft fuselage on our first aircraft in May, and powered the electrical distribution systems 3 weeks later. We're on track for first flight later this summer, and the aircraft continues to generate significant interest and its customers anticipate its entry into service late next year. On the service front, we opened our newest line maintenance station in Bremen, expanding our support offerings in Germany and throughout Europe. 
Moving to the Scorpion, the program is gaining momentum, as we have begun the U.S. DoD accreditation process, with this week's signing of a cooperative research and development agreement with the United States Air Force. Also, production of the conforming aircraft is nearly complete, with first flight expected next month. We believe having the accreditation process underway and the conforming aircraft available for demo flights will help facilitate initial sales of the aircraft.
Last week, at Farnborough, we also announced that we were selected by the team of QinetiQ and Thales to supply Scorpion jets for their bid on the U.K.'s Air Support to Defence Operational Training program, should they win the competition.
To sum up, demand in our end markets has been challenging, but we continue to believe that our new products and recent acquisitions will continue to contribute to overall growth in revenue, earnings and cash for the year.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank."

Segment profit in the quarter was $328 million, up $22 million from the second quarter of 2015, on a $264 million increase in revenues.
Let's review how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron Aviation. At Textron Aviation, revenues were up $72 million from this period last year, primarily due to volume and mix. Segment profit was $81 million, down from $88 million a year ago, primarily reflecting an unfavorable impact from the mix of products sold in the period. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $1.1 billion, $122 million higher than at the end of last -- at the end of the first quarter.
Moving to Bell. Revenues were down $46 million, primarily due to volume and mix. Segment profit decreased $20 million from the second quarter of 2015, reflecting the lower volume and mix. At Textron Systems, revenues were up $165 million, primarily due to higher volumes in our weapons and sensors and unmanned product lines. Segment profit was up $39 million, reflecting the higher volumes and mix. Industrial revenues increased $77 million due to higher overall volumes and the impact of acquisitions. Segment profit increased $13 million, reflecting the higher volumes. Finance segment revenues decreased $4 million, and profit decreased $3 million. Moving below the segment line, corporate expenses were $31 million compared to $33 million last year. Interest expense was $37 million, up $5 million from last year.
On the tax front, the Internal Revenue Service approved a settlement on July 11 of our 1998 to 2008 tax years. As a result, in the third quarter, we expect to record an income tax benefit, including the reversal of accrued interest of approximately $315 million, of which approximately $200 million or $0.74 per share is attributable to continuing operations. The settlement results in an immaterial net benefit to consolidated cash during the year. 
To wrap up with guidance, we are reiterating our expected full-year EPS from continuing operations of $2.60 to $2.80 per share, exclusive of the tax settlement. We also continue to expect cash flow from continuing operations of the manufacturing group before pension contributions of $600 million to $700 million.
That concludes our prepared remarks. So Stacy, we can open the line for questions."

We've seen, in particular, earlier in the year, a little bit of an uptick in Europe, which has been encouraging. Now obviously, we saw a fair bit of dislocation here everywhere in the world in the last few weeks of the quarter, with the whole reaction to Brexit. I don't think any of that is actually fundamental at a macro level with Brexit, but just the upset in the financial markets creates a lot of uncertainty, which kind of froze things up. But I think, other than that, we've seen a bit of a strengthening in Europe. South America is still very difficult. I think there's some opportunities that are starting to show in some places like Argentina that are starting to improve modestly. But Brazil, most of the economies down there are still very, very challenged. Middle East is -- there's activity, certainly, across most of our businesses, but again, it's a challenging environment. The conflict wars are going on down there, have a lot of the governments fairly distracted and focused on pretty immediate needs as opposed to much in the way of long-term work, but there certainly are opportunities that are in the works. Southeast Asia, frankly, is probably one of the healthiest on the international markets in terms of opportunity. There's -- economies are a little more diversified and are doing okay. China continues to be okay for us. It's not the strength of the growth maybe than it was in the past, but it's -- it's certainly, generally speaking, solid, particularly in the Aviation segment. So Automotive, I think our numbers fairly well match what you see going on the world. The European market, actually, has been kind of stronger. North America has had general strength, but there's more strength in the larger vehicles and the trucks and the high-end than there are in some of the smaller models, just I think reflecting the price of gas. So I don't think that we're seeing anything probably that would surprise you a lot versus just what's going on, in general, in terms of what GDP looks like in these various regions."

And with respect to pricing, I think our challenge on Latitude is that our competitor in that space has 2 aircraft, right, one, which is a little bit -- the smaller aircraft, which is really what we thought we would end up competing with, with the Latitude. That was sort of our intention. And then they've got us a larger aircraft, and those 2 aircraft have created a pricing problem. And I think our performance and our range were far superior to the smaller aircraft, which is where wanted to be, but they're [ph] kind of using the larger aircraft to try to compete with us, and that's really what's generated a lot of the pricing problem. When you look at Longitude, that's kind of the combination now where you have the much larger aircraft. And frankly, performance and range and load that, I think, will distinguish us very nicely from where the competition is. And so certainly, our expectation is that we have a much better pricing position because we can distance ourselves in terms of the performance and capability of that aircraft, and there's not another aircraft that a competitor has sitting on top of that to try to bring down on price to compete with it."

It'd be great to understand how much of that is NetJets' Latitude aircraft folding into the backlog, as you've said, you'll do it carefully, versus something at Beech versus just pure underlying regular old business jet?"

I mean, we haven't done that in quite some time. But look, I think it's not just NetJets. I mean, I think, we've been pretty open about the fact that Latitude is selling well. And our expectations for the year was that the overall market would be generally fairly flattish from last year in terms of most of the model types, and most of the growth would be driven by the big new product introduction, which in this case, this year is Latitude, and so I think that expectation is kind of what we're seeing. We are seeing good demand on the Latitude, both on the NetJets as well as on the retail side, and other models are selling fine. They're selling consistent with how we expected. Some models are stronger than others, but in general, the volume on the jet side is what we expected, and the thing that's driving the upside in terms of growth on a year-over-year basis, and then we would continue to expect to see that as we roll into next year, is based on Latitude. And so the bulk of that increase in backlog, I would say, is going to be attributed to that, both NetJets and retail sales."

And those orders now are firming up and coming in and being exercised, either under the Multiyear II contract or as some of the potential volume in a Multiyear III deal. There continue to be a number of conversations with international customers that are going on. I certainly still think that Israel is a potential, that was talked about for quite a while, and then sort of moved out, and there's still uncertainty around that, but I think there's still conversations going on, which are, at this point, very much government-to-government. The same is true with a couple of other countries. And so those are things, however, that would all be talked about in the context of a Multiyear III, so it's not something that's going to hit here in the next couple of years. The only ones we'll see, really, will probably be Japan in that near term. So there's certainly a lot of other discussion and opportunities dialogue going on, some of which is public, some of which is not around H-1s. The H1 is performing fabulously for the Marine Corps. It's both the utility and the attack versions of that are in the quote process and proposal processes for several potential international applications, so we'll be following that pretty closely. Scorpion is still very much a wildcard. It was a huge milestone for us to have the Air Force sign up to do the accreditation program. That just happened this past week. And we've had, as you know, a number of international customers that have been looking at the aircraft. And there have really been 2 issues for them, one is how are you going to get this thing certified, so that they can provide their certification on top of it. And not unreasonably, customers want to fly the production fully-conforming aircraft. We have the accreditation path checked off and here in the next month or so, we'll be flying the first production configured aircraft. So customers are already talking about when they're going to be able to come in and get a chance to fly the aircraft. So 2 big milestones, sort of boxes that we needed to check to get done before we can proceed with final sales of the aircraft."

Now those aircraft, of course, turn into a lot of service opportunities. So I mean, net, the margins on the commercial side are still good because of all the service that those aircraft pull through with them. But to be light, in terms of volume, on some of the lighter aircraft will not have a meaningful impact within the year. In the end, it all comes down largely to the larger aircraft, in particular, the 412s, and I think we're on track to do that. And those are more heavily laid into the back half of the year."

So I mean, we've seen a rebounding of the price of oil, but not back to where it probably needs to be for them to feel better. It's starting to probably impact, possibly, in some regions of the world, where $50 or so is -- you can extract and be profitable at that. There are certain other parts of the world where it needs to be significantly higher than that to make them feel like that end customer is going to start getting stronger. And of course, in a lot of these economies, they're just oil and gas petrodollar based, so their economies will get healthier as that price per barrel rebounds. But we don't really have a great sense, at this point, what that lag is, between [indiscernible] those rebounds in pricing and how quickly that will flow through to having the ability to invest in their fleets, or, in general, in those economies, for people to feel comfortable to start laying out the funding for significant CapEx kind of projects.

If it's the right kind of deals and we think it's good, we'll do them. If we don't, then obviously, we don't do them."

And if you don't quite need the range and you don't quite need the number of passengers but you want to go with that larger cabin, then the Latitude is a great choice. And I think what you're seeing is that we have a fair number of customers that will give up a few hundred nautical miles and don't need to have the higher passenger count, and they'll err on the side of the Latitude. So from our perspective, they're both selling. Certainly, with the Latitude being new, it is generating a little bit more demand, which was exactly what we expected. And certainly, some of those customers, if you went back 2 years ago, may have been people that would have bought a Latitude. But it's good having them both in the portfolio. It gives us the ability to deal work with a customer, and say what's your mission and which one fits your mission better. And that's kind of where we are continuing to sell."

Before we begin, I'd like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release.
On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer.
Our earnings call presentation can be found in the investor relations section of our website.
Textron's revenues in the quarter were $3.3 billion, up $71 million from last year's third quarter. During this year's third quarter, we recorded a $115 million pretax charge or $0.27 per share after-tax related to the restructuring plan we announced this past summer. We also recorded a tax benefit of $0.76 per share related to a settlement of U.S. Internal Revenue Service audits. Excluding these items, adjusted income from continuing operations was $0.61 per share, down $0.02 from last year's third quarter. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $94 million compared to $116 million in last year's third quarter.

2.2% increase in third quarter revenues reflected growth in Industrial and Aviation. We had good execution in the quarter, with margin improvements in our Systems and Bell businesses. Despite the increase in revenues, adjusted earnings per share was down $0.02, primarily the result of higher corporate expenses which reflected higher stock-based compensation expense and higher spending on the Scorpion program.
At Bell, revenues were down slightly, as lower commercial units delivered in the quarter more than offset higher military volumes. Specifically, we delivered 25 commercial helicopters, down from 45 in last year's third quarter. We delivered 6 V-22s, up from 4 units last year; and 8 H-1s, up from 5 last year. Our V-280 Valor program continues to progress, with assembly of the first aircraft approximately 2/3 complete and on track for first flight next year. We also announced a new military rotor -- tiltrotor product, the Bell V-247 Vigilant. The Bell V-247 Vigilant is a Group 5 unmanned aerial system that will leverage the investment we're making in the V-280 platform. The 247 design will provide unmatched speed, payload, long endurance capabilities and runway independence to fill a multitude of missions, including maritime environments. At the AUSA show earlier this month, customer interest was high around both our V-280 mockup and the Bell V-247 model that were on display.
On the commercial side, while deliveries were down significantly in the quarter, we saw an increase in order flow. As we consider customer -- current customer activity and contract opportunities, we believe that Bell commercial helicopter demand has stabilized and may be in the early stages of recovery. On our new 505 Jet Ranger X, we continue to make progress on certification. And we expect to achieve this initial certification late this year, with deliveries beginning shortly thereafter. During the quarter, we were awarded 2 FMS contracts for 13 Huey II helicopters to be delivered in Uganda and Kenya, with deliveries beginning in the fourth quarter. Overall, given the challenging commercial markets, we had a strong quarter at Bell, as cost productivity efforts over the past several years contributed to a 13% segment margin.
Moving to Systems. Revenues were down, as high revenues at Marine and Land Systems were more than offset by lower weapon deliveries. As you know, we announced we will be discontinuing production of Sensor Fuzed Weapon in March of next year. As a result, we are taking actions now to reduce costs across the Systems segment. At TMLS, we began initial TAPV deliveries to our Canadian customer in the quarter. Looking to the fourth quarter, we have a significant ramp in deliveries, although slower than we had originally planned.
Moving to Industrial. We saw a 7% increase in revenues, reflecting the impact of acquisitions and higher volumes in our automotive and specialized vehicle businesses. Last month, we announced we'll be consolidating Jacobsen with our specialized vehicle business to optimize efficiencies and better serve the company's shared customers and distributors. Also in the vehicle business, we recently acquired Safeaero, a Swedish manufacturer of de-icers for the commercial aviation industry. Safeaero will be part of our ground support equipment portfolio, which continues to grow very nicely. In our commercial business, we introduced a new line of Cushman Hauler utility vehicles, while in our consumer product line, our distributors kicked off retail sales of our new Stampede 4x4 off-road product. At Kautex, our selective catalytic reduction product lines continued to drive growth above the current auto market.
Moving to Textron Aviation. Revenues were up $39 million in the quarter. We delivered 41 jets compared to 37 last year; and 29 King Airs, flat with last year. On the new product front, the Longitude made its first flight in October 8, marking an important achievement in its path to certification and market entry. This first flight occurred [indiscernible] unveiling the Longitude NBAA last November, demonstrating our rapid new product development cycle, with a target certification later next year. Customer anticipation of this new aircraft remained strong, as we have begun executing purchase agreements with potential customers. During the quarter, we also unveiled the Cessna Denali, our new clean-sheet single-engine pressurized turboprop. The Denali will feature superior operating performance with the only flat floor cabin design in its class and will easily convert between passenger and cargo configurations. We're now currently serving this market segment and believe the highly differentiated Denali will contribute to significant future growth in Aviation with its best-in-class performance characteristics.
Moving to Scorpion. The program continues to make good progress, and we expect first flight of our initial production aircraft very soon. Last week, we conducted successful weapons testings with our existing aircraft at U.S. Air Force white sands proving grounds. With the accreditation process now underway and customer interest increasing, we have accelerated investment in the program. We have begun building several aircraft to support the accreditation requirements, validate our manufacturing process and expand our marketing and customer engagement activities.
Moving to an update on our restructuring plan. We've announced additional headcount reductions across our businesses, principally through a voluntary separation plan in our Aviation segment; and have increased our cost estimates accordingly.
To wrap up. While several of our end markets remained challenging in the third quarter, we still achieved top line growth while furthering our development efforts on major new programs.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank."

And good morning, everyone.
Segment profit in the quarter was $310 million, down $2 million from the third quarter of 2015 on a $71 million increase in revenues.
Let's review how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron Aviation.
At Textron Aviation, revenues were up $39 million from this period last year primarily due to higher preowned aircraft volume and the impact of an acquisition. Segment profit was $100 million, down from $107 million at a year ago, primarily reflecting the mix of products sold. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $1.1 billion, approximately flat with the second quarter.
Moving to Bell. Revenues were down $22 million primarily due to lower commercial deliveries, partially offset by higher military volumes. Segment profit decreased $2 million from the third quarter of 2015, reflecting the lower commercial aircraft deliveries. Backlog in the segment was $4.9 billion at the end of the quarter, approximately flat with the second quarter.
At Textron Systems, revenues were down $7 million primarily due to lower weapons volume, partially offset by higher revenues at marine and land. Segment profit was up $5 million, reflecting improved performance. Backlog in the segment was $2.2 billion, down $74 million from the end of the second quarter.
Industrial revenues increased $58 million due to the impact of acquired businesses and higher volumes. Segment profit increased $5 million, reflecting improved performance.
Finance segment revenues increased $3 million, and profit decreased $3 million.
Moving below the segment profit.
Corporate expenses were $53 million compared to $27 million last year. As Scott explained, this reflected higher stock-based compensation expense and the accelerated spending on our Scorpion program. Interest expense was $35 million, up $2 million from last year. With respect to our restructuring plan in the quarter, we recorded pretax charges of $115 million on the special charges line. Looking forward, our revised cost estimate for the total restructuring plan is now a range of $140 million to $170 million pretax, up from $110 million to $140 million, to reflect the additional reductions that Scott discussed. Cash outlays associated with this plan are now estimated to be in a range of $100 million to $120 million compared to our previous estimate of $65 million to $85 million.
We recorded a total income tax benefit of $319 million in the quarter related to settlement of U.S. IRS audits for years 1998 through 2008. $206 million, or $0.76 per share, was attributable to continuing operations.
To wrap up. We are narrowing our adjusted full year EPS from continuing operations guidance to $2.65 to $2.75 a share, which corresponds to GAAP EPS of $3.06 to $3.21 per share. Given our accelerated spending on Scorpion, higher investment in restructuring and slower TAPV deliveries, we are revising our outlook for cash flow from continuing operations of the manufacturing group before pension contributions to $500 million to $600 million, down from our previous estimate of $600 million to $700 million.
That concludes our prepared remarks, so Stacy, we can open the line for questions."

So our plan obviously is that -- the only growth that we've been seeing has been driven by the new products coming out into the marketplace, and that's why we continue to stay focused on bringing the Longitude to the market and bringing Denali to the market, ultimately bringing the Hemisphere to the market. Because I think that's -- at least in the market environment that we exist in today, that's the only way to drive growth.

NetJets has a pretty broad range of product that they provide to reach people that aren't owning their own whole aircraft. So that's an important part of where we are today with Latitudes. Obviously, on the King Air side you have guys out there like Wheels Up that are operating primarily King Airs and also aimed at a non-equity and a broader base of potential customers. So we see some of that. I mean these are very real customers. They are taking delivery of aircraft and are running pretty significant businesses today and appear to be doing so successfully. How much broader we see that market or how far that reaches to what customer segments in the world, I think, is still to be determined. It's there is lot of different models out there. Some might stick around and work. And there's other ones that may not work, but certainly we have a couple key customers that are sort of in line with, I think, kind of your questions.

Our expenses, we have accelerated. So these are things that certainly could have been put off and originally would have been done in the future, but I think, as we've established this crater with the Air Force and now have a path to certification, the level of activity with customers has stepped up considerably. And it's the right time for us to sort of step up and demonstrate this aircraft and its performance capability and get much more aggressive about the marketing and test flights. And I think it's the right time, based on what's going on in the customer community, to really mature this program. And so those are largely expenses that we've pulled forward because we think we need to do it now. I think waiting a year or spreading it out over a longer period of time won't help us given the opportunities that we see out there in the not-too-distant future."

And then also, to get to the low end of your 8.5% to 9% margin would require a margin north of 11% in the fourth quarter, so is that doable? And if not, what would you suggest is the range now?"

First of all, the R&D, as we went from Q2 to Q3, did come down in the business.

First of all, the R&D, as we went from Q2 to Q3, did come down in the business. And I think, if you look at -- the sequential margins are pretty good from Q2 to Q3, but if you look on a year-over-year basis, there's no question that the leverage wasn't there. I'd say the -- most of that is a result of the fact that our revenue growth on a year-over-year basis was largely driven by used aircraft sales; and the inclusion of our acquisition at Able, which is a great little business but, in its first year, with deal-related costs and step-up and all that kind of stuff, its first year is kind of a breakeven. So if you look at that model, you have $50-plus million of revenue in there that's not -- that has no margin. It's used aircraft and the first year of that deal. So that's the bulk of where you don't have leverage, where you would probably have expected to see some of that leverage. And the rest of it still is this ongoing mix issue. So we did have positive pricing on the retail side on Latitude in the quarter, but it's still at lower margin rates than what we typically see in the rest of our portfolio. And obviously, all of the mix shift in the quarter, as well mentioned and you guys see the numbers in terms of aircraft, we had a couple more Mustangs. We had a couple more M2s. We certainly had more Latitudes, but we also were down a couple XLSes and Sovereigns, so from a mix standpoint, that certainly pressured some of the conversion as well on a year-over-year basis."

We will certainly not get to where we would have expected to be. And that's part of our cash pressure, right? So we will have higher finished goods inventory on the TAPV program than we would have expected in our plan. So that is certainly a significant part of the downward revision on our cash for the year.

So that was above and beyond certification work, a demonstration of its capability, which I think was important to our prospective customers, and was being watched very carefully. The acceleration on the production process maturing, obviously, we've been always planning to do this initial production configuration aircraft to support certification program. but given a little activity, we've gone ahead in sort of pull the trigger on initiating a small production build to help validate our manufacturing processes as well. So what we have going on right now. We think there's a number of opportunities to demonstrate this aircraft. We have a bunch of customers that want to fly the aircraft, and that's really what led us to accelerate both the expense side as well as to bring in the inventory and initiate kind of a limited rate of production because we need to have these assets available for customer demonstrations, customer flights and hopefully eventually, customer sales.

Textron's revenues in the quarter were $3.3 billion, up $71 million from last year's third quarter. During this year's third quarter, we recorded a $115 million pretax charge or $0.27 per share after-tax related to the restructuring plan we announced this past summer. We also recorded a tax benefit of $0.76 per share related to a settlement of U.S. Internal Revenue Service audits. Excluding these items, adjusted income from continuing operations was $0.61 per share, down $0.02 from last year's third quarter.

2.2% increase in third quarter revenues reflected growth in Industrial and Aviation. We had good execution in the quarter, with margin improvements in our Systems and Bell businesses. Despite the increase in revenues, adjusted earnings per share was down $0.02, primarily the result of higher corporate expenses which reflected higher stock-based compensation expense and higher spending on the Scorpion program.
At Bell, revenues were down slightly, as lower commercial units delivered in the quarter more than offset higher military volumes. Specifically, we delivered 25 commercial helicopters, down from 45 in last year's third quarter. We delivered 6 V-22s, up from 4 units last year; and 8 H-1s, up from 5 last year. Our V-280 Valor program continues to progress, with assembly of the first aircraft approximately 2/3 complete and on track for first flight next year. We also announced a new military rotor -- tiltrotor product, the Bell V-247 Vigilant. The Bell V-247 Vigilant is a Group 5 unmanned aerial system that will leverage the investment we're making in the V-280 platform. The 247 design will provide unmatched speed, payload, long endurance capabilities and runway independence to fill a multitude of missions, including maritime environments. At the AUSA show earlier this month, customer interest was high around both our V-280 mockup and the Bell V-247 model that were on display.
On the commercial side, while deliveries were down significantly in the quarter, we saw an increase in order flow. As we consider customer -- current customer activity and contract opportunities, we believe that Bell commercial helicopter demand has stabilized and may be in the early stages of recovery. On our new 505 Jet Ranger X, we continue to make progress on certification. And we expect to achieve this initial certification late this year, with deliveries beginning shortly thereafter. During the quarter, we were awarded 2 FMS contracts for 13 Huey II helicopters to be delivered in Uganda and Kenya, with deliveries beginning in the fourth quarter. Overall, given the challenging commercial markets, we had a strong quarter at Bell, as cost productivity efforts over the past several years contributed to a 13% segment margin.
Moving to Systems. Revenues were down, as high revenues at Marine and Land Systems were more than offset by lower weapon deliveries. As you know, we announced we will be discontinuing production of Sensor Fuzed Weapon in March of next year. As a result, we are taking actions now to reduce costs across the Systems segment. At TMLS, we began initial TAPV deliveries to our Canadian customer in the quarter. Looking to the fourth quarter, we have a significant ramp in deliveries, although slower than we had originally planned.
Moving to Industrial. We saw a 7% increase in revenues, reflecting the impact of acquisitions and higher volumes in our automotive and specialized vehicle businesses. Last month, we announced we'll be consolidating Jacobsen with our specialized vehicle business to optimize efficiencies and better serve the company's shared customers and distributors. Also in the vehicle business, we recently acquired Safeaero, a Swedish manufacturer of de-icers for the commercial aviation industry. Safeaero will be part of our ground support equipment portfolio, which continues to grow very nicely. In our commercial business, we introduced a new line of Cushman Hauler utility vehicles, while in our consumer product line, our distributors kicked off retail sales of our new Stampede 4x4 off-road product. At Kautex, our selective catalytic reduction product lines continued to drive growth above the current auto market.
Moving to Textron Aviation. Revenues were up $39 million in the quarter. We delivered 41 jets compared to 37 last year; and 29 King Airs, flat with last year. On the new product front, the Longitude made its first flight in October 8, marking an important achievement in its path to certification and market entry. This first flight occurred whilst [indiscernible] unveiling the Longitude NBAA last November, demonstrating our rapid new product development cycle, with a target certification later next year. Customer anticipation of this new aircraft remained strong, as we have begun executing purchase agreements with potential customers. During the quarter, we also unveiled the Cessna Denali, our new clean-sheet single-engine pressurized turboprop. The Denali will feature superior operating performance with the only flat floor cabin design in its class and will easily convert between passenger and cargo configurations. We're now currently serving this market segment and believe the highly differentiated Denali will contribute to significant future growth in Aviation with its best-in-class performance characteristics.
Moving to Scorpion. The program continues to make good progress, and we expect first flight of our initial production aircraft very soon. Last week, we conducted successful weapons testings with our existing aircraft at U.S. Air Force white sands proving grounds. With the accreditation process now underway and customer interest increasing, we have accelerated investment in the program. We have begun building several aircraft to support the accreditation requirements, validate our manufacturing process and expand our marketing and customer engagement activities.
Moving to an update on our restructuring plan. We've announced additional headcount reductions across our businesses, principally through a voluntary separation plan in our Aviation segment; and have increased our cost estimates accordingly.
To wrap up. While several of our end markets remained challenging in the third quarter, we still achieved top line growth while furthering our development efforts on major new programs.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank."

And good morning, everyone.
Segment profit in the quarter was $310 million, down $2 million from the third quarter of 2015 on a $71 million increase in revenues.
Let's review how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron Aviation.
At Textron Aviation, revenues were up $39 million from this period last year primarily due to higher preowned aircraft volume and the impact of an acquisition. Segment profit was $100 million, down from $107 million at a year ago, primarily reflecting the mix of products sold. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $1.1 billion, approximately flat with the second quarter.
Moving to Bell. Revenues were down $22 million primarily due to lower commercial deliveries, partially offset by higher military volumes. Segment profit decreased $2 million from the third quarter of 2015, reflecting the lower commercial aircraft deliveries. Backlog in the segment was $4.9 billion at the end of the quarter, approximately flat with the second quarter.
At Textron Systems, revenues were down $7 million primarily due to lower weapons volume, partially offset by higher revenues at marine and land. Segment profit was up $5 million, reflecting improved performance. Backlog in the segment was $2.2 billion, down $74 million from the end of the second quarter.
Industrial revenues increased $58 million due to the impact of acquired businesses and higher volumes. Segment profit increased $5 million, reflecting improved performance.
Finance segment revenues increased $3 million, and profit decreased $3 million.
Moving below the segment profit.
Corporate expenses were $53 million compared to $27 million last year. As Scott explained, this reflected higher stock-based compensation expense and the accelerated spending on our Scorpion program. Interest expense was $35 million, up $2 million from last year. With respect to our restructuring plan in the quarter, we recorded pretax charges of $115 million on the special charges line. Looking forward, our revised cost estimate for the total restructuring plan is now a range of $140 million to $170 million pretax, up from $110 million to $140 million, to reflect the additional reductions that Scott discussed. Cash outlays associated with this plan are now estimated to be in a range of $100 million to $120 million compared to our previous estimate of $65 million to $85 million.
We recorded a total income tax benefit of $319 million in the quarter related to settlement of U.S. IRS audits for years 1998 through 2008. $206 million, or $0.76 per share, was attributable to continuing operations.
To wrap up. We are narrowing our adjusted full year EPS from continuing operations guidance to $2.65 to $2.75 a share, which corresponds to GAAP EPS of $3.06 to $3.21 per share. Given our accelerated spending on Scorpion, higher investment in restructuring and slower TAPV deliveries, we are revising our outlook for cash flow from continuing operations of the manufacturing group before pension contributions to $500 million to $600 million, down from our previous estimate of $600 million to $700 million.
That concludes our prepared remarks, so Stacy, we can open the line for questions."

That's certainly been true with Latitude. The market for the kind of the historical products is pretty flat. And yes, there continues to be a pretty tight market that it's difficult to get any kind of pricing, but it's up a little on some models and down a little on some models, so it's -- it really is consistent with what we've been seeing for the last couple years. So our plan obviously is that -- the only growth that we've been seeing has been driven by the new products coming out into the marketplace, and that's why we continue to stay focused on bringing the Longitude to the market and bringing Denali to the market, ultimately bringing the Hemisphere to the market. Because I think that's -- at least in the market environment that we exist in today, that's the only way to drive growth.

Obviously, on the King Air side you have guys out there like Wheels Up that are operating primarily King Airs and also aimed at a non-equity and a broader base of potential customers. So we see some of that. I mean these are very real customers. They are taking delivery of aircraft and are running pretty significant businesses today and appear to be doing so successfully. How much broader we see that market or how far that reaches to what customer segments in the world, I think, is still to be determined. It's there is lot of different models out there. Some might stick around and work. And there's other ones that may not work, but certainly we have a couple key customers that are sort of in line with, I think, kind of your questions.

Our expenses, we have accelerated. So these are things that certainly could have been put off and originally would have been done in the future, but I think, as we've established this crater with the Air Force and now have a path to certification, the level of activity with customers has stepped up considerably. And it's the right time for us to sort of step up and demonstrate this aircraft and its performance capability and get much more aggressive about the marketing and test flights. And I think it's the right time, based on what's going on in the customer community, to really mature this program.

First of all, the R&D, as we went from Q2 to Q3, did come down in the business. And I think, if you look at -- the sequential margins are pretty good from Q2 to Q3, but if you look on a year-over-year basis, there's no question that the leverage wasn't there. I'd say the -- most of that is a result of the fact that our revenue growth on a year-over-year basis was largely driven by used aircraft sales; and the inclusion of our acquisition at Able, which is a great little business but, in its first year, with deal-related costs and step-up and all that kind of stuff, its first year is kind of a breakeven. So if you look at that model, you have $50-plus million of revenue in there that's not -- that has no margin. It's used aircraft and the first year of that deal. So that's the bulk of where you don't have leverage, where you would probably have expected to see some of that leverage. And the rest of it still is this ongoing mix issue. So we did have positive pricing on the retail side on Latitude in the quarter, but it's still at lower margin rates than what we typically see in the rest of our portfolio. And obviously, all of the mix shift in the quarter, as well mentioned and you guys see the numbers in terms of aircraft, we had a couple more Mustangs. We had a couple more M2s. We certainly had more Latitudes, but we also were down a couple XLSes and Sovereigns, so from a mix standpoint, that certainly pressured some of the conversion as well on a year-over-year basis."

We will certainly not get to where we would have expected to be. And that's part of our cash pressure, right?

We are flowing the TAPVs which we didn't have before. We also have deliveries of another U.S. contract, which is a Iraq and Colombian ASVs, which will be in there. And as you know, we always have a little bit of lumpiness here on our Sensor Fuzed Weapons.

This is certainly not still at a sure bet standpoint, but I mean obviously we would not do that and make those investments and take that hit in terms of near term's earnings and cash if we didn't think that the level of customer interest that we're seeing, the fact that we now have a path to certification, the fact that we've demonstrated weapons capabilities, the level of interest that we'd have from customers that we've been talking to for a number of years has become strong enough that we felt it was time to accelerate that spending and be willing to invest some of our cash to be ready to do a limited production run here. So is it a sure thing? No. Do we see that the opportunity is real and that we think that there's a real future for this thing and something that can be a profitable line of business for the company? I'd have to say the answer is yes, or we wouldn't have made the decisions to go ahead and take some pressure on earnings and pressure on cash to really take that final step and bring this thing to the market in a very real, credible way."

Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.
Textron's revenues in the quarter were $3.3 billion, up $71 million from last year's third quarter. During this year's third quarter, we recorded a $115 million pretax charge or $0.27 per share after-tax related to the restructuring plan we announced this past summer. We also recorded a tax benefit of $0.76 per share related to a settlement of U.S. Internal Revenue Service audits. Excluding these items, adjusted income from continuing operations was $0.61 per share, down $0.02 from last year's third quarter. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $94 million compared to $116 million in last year's third quarter.

2.2% increase in third quarter revenues reflected growth in Industrial and Aviation. We had good execution in the quarter, with margin improvements in our Systems and Bell businesses. Despite the increase in revenues, adjusted earnings per share was down $0.02, primarily the result of higher corporate expenses which reflected higher stock-based compensation expense and higher spending on the Scorpion program.
At Bell, revenues were down slightly, as lower commercial units delivered in the quarter more than offset higher military volumes. Specifically, we delivered 25 commercial helicopters, down from 45 in last year's third quarter. We delivered 6 V-22s, up from 4 units last year; and 8 H-1s, up from 5 last year. Our V-280 Valor program continues to progress, with assembly of the first aircraft approximately 2/3 complete and on track for first flight next year. We also announced a new military rotor -- tiltrotor product, the Bell V-247 Vigilant. The Bell V-247 Vigilant is a Group 5 unmanned aerial system that will leverage the investment we're making in the V-280 platform. The 247 design will provide unmatched speed, payload, long endurance capabilities and runway independence to fill a multitude of missions, including maritime environments. At the AUSA show earlier this month, customer interest was high around both our V-280 mockup and the Bell V-247 model that were on display.
On the commercial side, while deliveries were down significantly in the quarter, we saw an increase in order flow. As we consider customer -- current customer activity and contract opportunities, we believe that Bell commercial helicopter demand has stabilized and may be in the early stages of recovery. On our new 505 Jet Ranger X, we continue to make progress on certification. And we expect to achieve this initial certification late this year, with deliveries beginning shortly thereafter. During the quarter, we were awarded 2 FMS contracts for 13 Huey II helicopters to be delivered in Uganda and Kenya, with deliveries beginning in the fourth quarter. Overall, given the challenging commercial markets, we had a strong quarter at Bell, as cost productivity efforts over the past several years contributed to a 13% segment margin.
Moving to Systems. Revenues were down, as high revenues at Marine and Land Systems were more than offset by lower weapon deliveries. As you know, we announced we will be discontinuing production of Sensor Fuzed Weapon in March of next year. As a result, we are taking actions now to reduce costs across the Systems segment. At TMLS, we began initial TAPV deliveries to our Canadian customer in the quarter. Looking to the fourth quarter, we have a significant ramp in deliveries, although slower than we had originally planned.
Moving to Industrial. We saw a 7% increase in revenues, reflecting the impact of acquisitions and higher volumes in our automotive and specialized vehicle businesses. Last month, we announced we'll be consolidating Jacobsen with our specialized vehicle business to optimize efficiencies and better serve the company's shared customers and distributors. Also in the vehicle business, we recently acquired Safeaero, a Swedish manufacturer of de-icers for the commercial aviation industry. Safeaero will be part of our ground support equipment portfolio, which continues to grow very nicely. In our commercial business, we introduced a new line of Cushman Hauler utility vehicles, while in our consumer product line, our distributors kicked off retail sales of our new Stampede 4x4 off-road product. At Kautex, our selective catalytic reduction product lines continued to drive growth above the current auto market.
Moving to Textron Aviation. Revenues were up $39 million in the quarter. We delivered 41 jets compared to 37 last year; and 29 King Airs, flat with last year. On the new product front, the Longitude made its first flight in October 8, marking an important achievement in its path to certification and market entry. This first flight occurred less than 1 year after unveiling the Longitude NBAA last November, demonstrating our rapid new product development cycle, with a target certification later next year. Customer anticipation of this new aircraft remained strong, as we have begun executing purchase agreements with potential customers. During the quarter, we also unveiled the Cessna Denali, our new clean-sheet single-engine pressurized turboprop. The Denali will feature superior operating performance with the only flat floor cabin design in its class and will easily convert between passenger and cargo configurations. We're now currently serving this market segment and believe the highly differentiated Denali will contribute to significant future growth in Aviation with its best-in-class performance characteristics.
Moving to Scorpion. The program continues to make good progress, and we expect first flight of our initial production aircraft very soon. Last week, we conducted successful weapons testings with our existing aircraft at U.S. Air Force white sands proving grounds. With the accreditation process now underway and customer interest increasing, we have accelerated investment in the program. We have begun building several aircraft to support the accreditation requirements, validate our manufacturing process and expand our marketing and customer engagement activities.
Moving to an update on our restructuring plan. We've announced additional headcount reductions across our businesses, principally through a voluntary separation plan in our Aviation segment; and have increased our cost estimates accordingly. To wrap up, while several of our end markets remained challenging in the third quarter, we still achieved top line growth while furthering our development efforts on major new programs.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank."

Segment profit in the quarter was $310 million, down $2 million from the third quarter of 2015 on a $71 million increase in revenues.
Let's review how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron Aviation. At Textron Aviation, revenues were up $39 million from this period last year primarily due to higher preowned aircraft volume and the impact of an acquisition. Segment profit was $100 million, down from $107 million at a year ago, primarily reflecting the mix of products sold. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $1.1 billion, approximately flat with the second quarter.
Moving to Bell. Revenues were down $22 million primarily due to lower commercial deliveries, partially offset by higher military volumes. Segment profit decreased $2 million from the third quarter of 2015, reflecting the lower commercial aircraft deliveries. Backlog in the segment was $4.9 billion at the end of the quarter, approximately flat with the second quarter.
At Textron Systems, revenues were down $7 million, primarily due to lower weapons volume, partially offset by higher revenues at marine and land. Segment profit was up $5 million, reflecting improved performance. Backlog in the segment was $2.2 billion, down $74 million from the end of the second quarter. Industrial revenues increased $58 million due to the impact of acquired businesses and higher volumes. Segment profit increased $5 million, reflecting improved performance. Finance segment revenues increased $3 million, and profit decreased $3 million.
Moving below the segment profit. Corporate expenses were $53 million compared to $27 million last year. As Scott explained, this reflected higher stock-based compensation expense and the accelerated spending on our Scorpion program. Interest expense was $35 million, up $2 million from last year. With respect to our restructuring plan in the quarter, we recorded pretax charges of $115 million on the special charges line. Looking forward, our revised cost estimate for the total restructuring plan is now a range of $140 million to $170 million pretax, up from $110 million to $140 million, to reflect the additional reductions that Scott discussed. Cash outlays associated with this plan are now estimated to be in a range of $100 million to $120 million compared to our previous estimate of $65 million to $85 million. We recorded a total income tax benefit of $319 million in the quarter related to settlement of U.S. IRS audits for years 1998 through 2008. $206 million, or $0.76 per share, was attributable to continuing operations.
To wrap up. We are narrowing our adjusted full year EPS from continuing operations guidance to $2.65 to $2.75 a share, which corresponds to GAAP EPS of $3.06 to $3.21 per share. Given our accelerated spending on Scorpion, higher investment in restructuring and slower TAPV deliveries, we are revising our outlook for cash flow from continuing operations of the manufacturing group before pension contributions to $500 million to $600 million, down from our previous estimate of $600 million to $700 million.
That concludes our prepared remarks, so Stacy, we can open the line for questions."

That's certainly been true with Latitude. The market for the kind of the historical products is pretty flat. And yes, there continues to be a pretty tight market that it's difficult to get any kind of pricing, but it's up a little on some models and down a little on some models, so it's -- it really is consistent with what we've been seeing for the last couple years. So our plan obviously is that -- the only growth that we've been seeing has been driven by the new products coming out into the marketplace, and that's why we continue to stay focused on bringing the Longitude to the market and bringing Denali to the market, ultimately bringing the Hemisphere to the market. Because I think that's -- at least in the market environment that we exist in today, that's the only way to drive growth.

NetJets, to the extent they're obviously selling these aircraft to fractional customers and they're card based. NetJets has a pretty broad range of product that they provide to reach people that aren't owning their own whole aircraft. So that's an important part of where we are today with Latitudes. Obviously, on the King Air side you have guys out there like Wheels Up that are operating primarily King Airs and also aimed at a non-equity and a broader base of potential customers. So we see some of that. I mean these are very real customers that are taking delivery of aircraft and are running pretty significant businesses today and appear to be doing so successfully. How much broader we see that market or how far that reaches to what customer segments in the world, I think, is still to be determined. It's -- there are a lot of different models out there. Some of them might stick around and [ph] work. And there's other ones that may not work, but certainly we have a couple key customers that are sort of in line with, I think, kind of your questions.

Our expenses, we've accelerated. So these are things that certainly could have been put off and originally would have been done in the future. But I think as we've established this creative with the Air Force and now have a path to certification, the level of activity with customers has stepped up considerably. And it's the right time for us to sort of step up and demonstrate this aircraft and its performance capability and get much more aggressive about the marketing and test flights. And I think it's the right time, based on what's going on in the customer community, to really mature this program. And so those are largely expenses that we've pulled forward because we think we need to do it now.

First of all, the R&D, as we went from Q2 to Q3, did come down in the business. And I think, if you look at -- the sequential margins are pretty good from Q2 to Q3, but if you look on a year-over-year basis, there's no question that the leverage wasn't there. I'd say the -- most of that is a result of the fact that our revenue growth on a year-over-year basis was largely driven by used aircraft sales; and the inclusion of our acquisition at Able, which is a great little business but, in its first year, with deal-related costs and step-up and all that kind of stuff, its first year is kind of a breakeven. So if you look at that model, you have $50-plus million of revenue in there that's not -- that has no margin. It's used aircraft and the first year of that deal. So that's the bulk of where you don't have leverage, where you would probably have expected to see some of that leverage. And the rest of it still is this ongoing mix issue. So we did have positive pricing on the retail side on Latitude in the quarter, but it's still at lower margin rates than what we typically see in the rest of our portfolio. And obviously, all of the mix shift in the quarter, as we'll mention and you guys see the numbers in terms of aircraft, we had a couple more Mustangs. We had a couple more M2s. We certainly had more Latitudes, but we also were down a couple XLSes and Sovereigns, so from a mix standpoint, that certainly pressured some of the conversion as well on a year-over-year basis."

The good news is we are now -- we're making deliveries every week. And we have an agreement with the customer on how many units they're taking. And that process appears to be flowing, but it is at a lower level than we would have originally planned in our AOP. So we will make a fair number of deliveries here in the fourth quarter. We will certainly not get to where we would have expected to be. And that's part of our cash pressure, right? So we will have higher finished goods inventory on the TAPV program than we would have expected in our plan. So that is certainly a significant part of the downward revision on our cash for the year.

So that was above and beyond certification work, a demonstration of its capability, which I think was important to our prospective customers and was being watched very carefully. The acceleration on the production process, maturing, obviously. We've been always planning to do this initial production configuration aircraft to support certification program. But given the level of activity, we've gone ahead and sort of pulled the trigger on initiating a small production build to help validate our manufacturing processes as well. So look, we have a lot of customer conversation going on right now. We think there's a number of opportunities to demonstrate this aircraft. We have a bunch of customers that want to fly the aircraft. And that's really what led us to accelerate both the expense side as well as to bring in the inventory and initiate the kind of a limited rate of production, because we need to have these assets available for customer demonstrations, customer flights and, hopefully, eventually customer sales. So I won't provide any color, I don't think, on a specific closure date of any particular contract, but there's a lot of customer activity and a lot of discussions ongoing."

Textron's revenues in the quarter were $3.3 billion, up $71 million from last year's third quarter. During this year's third quarter, we recorded a $115 million pretax charge or $0.27 per share after-tax related to the restructuring plan we announced this past summer. We also recorded a tax benefit of $0.76 per share related to a settlement of U.S. Internal Revenue Service audits. Excluding these items, adjusted income from continuing operations was $0.61 per share, down $0.02 from last year's third quarter. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $94 million compared to $116 million in last year's third quarter.

2.2% increase in third quarter revenues reflected growth in Industrial and Aviation. We had good execution in the quarter, with margin improvements in our Systems and Bell businesses. Despite the increase in revenues, adjusted earnings per share was down $0.02, primarily the result of higher corporate expenses which reflected higher stock-based compensation expense and higher spending on the Scorpion program.
At Bell, revenues were down slightly, as lower commercial units delivered in the quarter more than offset higher military volumes. Specifically, we delivered 25 commercial helicopters, down from 45 in last year's third quarter. We delivered 6 V-22s, up from 4 units last year; and 8 H-1s, up from 5 last year. Our V-280 Valor program continues to progress, with assembly of the first aircraft approximately 2/3 complete and on track for first flight next year. We also announced a new military rotor -- tiltrotor product, the Bell V-247 Vigilant. The Bell V-247 Vigilant is a Group 5 unmanned aerial system that will leverage the investment we're making in the V-280 platform. The 247 design will provide unmatched speed, payload, long endurance capabilities and runway independence to fill a multitude of missions, including maritime environments. At the AUSA show earlier this month, customer interest was high around both our V-280 mockup and the Bell V-247 model that were on display.
On the commercial side, while deliveries were down significantly in the quarter, we saw an increase in order flow. As we consider customer -- current customer activity and contract opportunities, we believe that Bell commercial helicopter demand has stabilized and may be in the early stages of recovery. On our new 505 Jet Ranger X, we continue to make progress on certification. And we expect to achieve this initial certification late this year, with deliveries beginning shortly thereafter. During the quarter, we were awarded 2 FMS contracts for 13 Huey II helicopters to be delivered in Uganda and Kenya, with deliveries beginning in the fourth quarter. Overall, given the challenging commercial markets, we had a strong quarter at Bell, as cost productivity efforts over the past several years contributed to a 13% segment margin.
Moving to Systems. Revenues were down, as high revenues at Marine and Land Systems were more than offset by lower weapon deliveries. As you know, we announced we will be discontinuing production of Sensor Fuzed Weapon in March of next year. As a result, we are taking actions now to reduce costs across the Systems segment. At TMLS, we began initial TAPV deliveries to our Canadian customer in the quarter. Looking to the fourth quarter, we have a significant ramp in deliveries, although slower than we had originally planned.
Moving to Industrial. We saw a 7% increase in revenues, reflecting the impact of acquisitions and higher volumes in our automotive and specialized vehicle businesses. Last month, we announced we'll be consolidating Jacobsen with our specialized vehicle business to optimize efficiencies and better serve the company's shared customers and distributors. Also in the vehicle business, we recently acquired Safeaero, a Swedish manufacturer of de-icers for the commercial aviation industry. Safeaero will be part of our ground support equipment portfolio, which continues to grow very nicely. In our commercial business, we introduced a new line of Cushman Hauler utility vehicles, while in our consumer product line, our distributors kicked off retail sales of our new Stampede 4x4 off-road product. At Kautex, our selective catalytic reduction product lines continued to drive growth above the current auto market.
Moving to Textron Aviation. Revenues were up $39 million in the quarter. We delivered 41 jets compared to 37 last year; and 29 King Airs, flat with last year. On the new product front, the Longitude made its first flight in October 8, marking an important achievement in its path to certification and market entry. This first flight occurred less than 1 year after unveiling the Longitude NBAA last November, demonstrating our rapid new product development cycle, with a target certification later next year. Customer anticipation of this new aircraft remained strong, as we have begun executing purchase agreements with potential customers. During the quarter, we also unveiled the Cessna Denali, our new clean-sheet single-engine pressurized turboprop. The Denali will feature superior operating performance with the only flat floor cabin design in its class and will easily convert between passenger and cargo configurations. We're now currently serving this market segment and believe the highly differentiated Denali will contribute to significant future growth in Aviation with its best-in-class performance characteristics.
Moving to Scorpion. The program continues to make good progress, and we expect first flight of our initial production aircraft very soon. Last week, we conducted successful weapons testings with our existing aircraft at U.S. Air Force white sands proving grounds. With the accreditation process now underway and customer interest increasing, we have accelerated investment in the program. We have begun building several aircraft to support the accreditation requirements, validate our manufacturing process and expand our marketing and customer engagement activities.
Moving to an update on our restructuring plan. We've announced additional headcount reductions across our businesses, principally through a voluntary separation plan in our Aviation segment; and have increased our cost estimates accordingly. To wrap up, while several of our end markets remained challenging in the third quarter, we still achieved top line growth while furthering our development efforts on major new programs.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank."

Segment profit in the quarter was $310 million, down $2 million from the third quarter of 2015 on a $71 million increase in revenues.
Let's review how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron Aviation. At Textron Aviation, revenues were up $39 million from this period last year primarily due to higher preowned aircraft volume and the impact of an acquisition. Segment profit was $100 million, down from $107 million at a year ago, primarily reflecting the mix of products sold. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $1.1 billion, approximately flat with the second quarter.
Moving to Bell. Revenues were down $22 million primarily due to lower commercial deliveries, partially offset by higher military volumes. Segment profit decreased $2 million from the third quarter of 2015, reflecting the lower commercial aircraft deliveries. Backlog in the segment was $4.9 billion at the end of the quarter, approximately flat with the second quarter.
At Textron Systems, revenues were down $7 million, primarily due to lower weapons volume, partially offset by higher revenues at marine and land. Segment profit was up $5 million, reflecting improved performance. Backlog in the segment was $2.2 billion, down $74 million from the end of the second quarter. Industrial revenues increased $58 million due to the impact of acquired businesses and higher volumes. Segment profit increased $5 million, reflecting improved performance. Finance segment revenues increased $3 million, and profit decreased $3 million.
Moving below the segment profit. Corporate expenses were $53 million compared to $27 million last year. As Scott explained, this reflected higher stock-based compensation expense and the accelerated spending on our Scorpion program. Interest expense was $35 million, up $2 million from last year. With respect to our restructuring plan in the quarter, we recorded pretax charges of $115 million on the special charges line. Looking forward, our revised cost estimate for the total restructuring plan is now a range of $140 million to $170 million pretax, up from $110 million to $140 million, to reflect the additional reductions that Scott discussed. Cash outlays associated with this plan are now estimated to be in a range of $100 million to $120 million compared to our previous estimate of $65 million to $85 million. We recorded a total income tax benefit of $319 million in the quarter related to settlement of U.S. IRS audits for years 1998 through 2008. $206 million, or $0.76 per share, was attributable to continuing operations.
To wrap up. We are narrowing our adjusted full year EPS from continuing operations guidance to $2.65 to $2.75 a share, which corresponds to GAAP EPS of $3.06 to $3.21 per share. Given our accelerated spending on Scorpion, higher investment in restructuring and slower TAPV deliveries, we are revising our outlook for cash flow from continuing operations of the manufacturing group before pension contributions to $500 million to $600 million, down from our previous estimate of $600 million to $700 million.

I would say it's more or less in line with what we expected this year, which is to say that most of the growth is driven by the new products that are coming onto the market. That's certainly been true with Latitude. The market for the kind of the historical products is pretty flat. And yes, there continues to be a pretty tight market that it's difficult to get any kind of pricing, but it's up a little on some models and down a little on some models, so it's -- it really is consistent with what we've been seeing for the last couple years. So our plan obviously is that -- the only growth that we've been seeing has been driven by the new products coming out into the marketplace, and that's why we continue to stay focused on bringing the Longitude to the market and bringing Denali to the market, ultimately bringing the Hemisphere to the market. Because I think that's -- at least in the market environment that we exist in today, that's the only way to drive growth. And you continue to expect that the legacy historical product lines will be relatively flat."

NetJets has a pretty broad range of product that they provide to reach people that aren't owning their own whole aircraft. So that's an important part of where we are today with Latitudes. Obviously, on the King Air side you have guys out there like Wheels Up that are operating primarily King Airs and also aimed at a non-equity and a broader base of potential customers. So we see some of that. I mean these are very real customers that are taking delivery of aircraft and are running pretty significant businesses today and appear to be doing so successfully. How much broader we see that market or how far that reaches to what customer segments in the world, I think, is still to be determined. It's -- there are a lot of different models out there. Some of them might stick around and [ph] work. And there's other ones that may not work, but certainly we have a couple key customers that are sort of in line with, I think, kind of your questions.

Our expenses, we've accelerated. So these are things that certainly could have been put off and originally would have been done in the future. But I think as we've established this creative with the Air Force and now have a path to certification, the level of activity with customers has stepped up considerably. And it's the right time for us to sort of step up and demonstrate this aircraft and its performance capability and get much more aggressive about the marketing and test flights. And I think it's the right time, based on what's going on in the customer community, to really mature this program. And so those are largely expenses that we've pulled forward because we think we need to do it now. I think waiting a year or spreading it out over a longer period of time won't help us given the opportunities that we see out there in the not-too-distant future."

And so we are starting now to see customers that are coming forward, actually signing deals and closing contracts. And in particular, there's a number of campaigns that are in process where quotes are out there, activity's happening and clearly deals are going to close. So that's the rationale for sort of our color on that. We're coming out of a year or so here of a very, very difficult environment in terms of closing any deals. And I think, in the last quarter, we saw a lot of deals close and a lot of deals that are active and in progress. So it's -- again, it's not where things were in the great days, but it's certainly positive to see an uptick in activity in actual orders."

First of all, the R&D, as we went from Q2 to Q3, did come down in the business. And I think, if you look at -- the sequential margins are pretty good from Q2 to Q3, but if you look on a year-over-year basis, there's no question that the leverage wasn't there. I'd say the -- most of that is a result of the fact that our revenue growth on a year-over-year basis was largely driven by used aircraft sales; and the inclusion of our acquisition at Able, which is a great little business but, in its first year, with deal-related costs and step-up and all that kind of stuff, its first year is kind of a breakeven. So if you look at that model, you have $50-plus million of revenue in there that's not -- that has no margin. It's used aircraft and the first year of that deal. So that's the bulk of where you don't have leverage, where you would probably have expected to see some of that leverage. And the rest of it still is this ongoing mix issue. So we did have positive pricing on the retail side on Latitude in the quarter, but it's still at lower margin rates than what we typically see in the rest of our portfolio. And obviously, all of the mix shift in the quarter, as we'll mention and you guys see the numbers in terms of aircraft, we had a couple more Mustangs. We had a couple more M2s. We certainly had more Latitudes, but we also were down a couple XLSes and Sovereigns, so from a mix standpoint, that certainly pressured some of the conversion as well on a year-over-year basis."

And that process appears to be flowing, but it is at a lower level than we would have originally planned in our AOP. So we will make a fair number of deliveries here in the fourth quarter. We will certainly not get to where we would have expected to be. And that's part of our cash pressure, right? So we will have higher finished goods inventory on the TAPV program than we would have expected in our plan. So that is certainly a significant part of the downward revision on our cash for the year.

So that was above and beyond certification work, a demonstration of its capability, which I think was important to our prospective customers and was being watched very carefully. The acceleration on the production process, maturing, obviously. We've been always planning to do this initial production configuration aircraft to support certification program. But given the level of activity, we've gone ahead and sort of pulled the trigger on initiating a small production build to help validate our manufacturing processes as well. So look, we have a lot of customer conversation going on right now. We think there's a number of opportunities to demonstrate this aircraft.

We are flowing the TAPVs which we didn't have before. We also have deliveries of another U.S. contract, which is Iraq and Colombian ASVs, which will be in there. And as you know, we always have a little bit of lumpiness here on our Sensor Fuzed Weapons.

This is the first quarter where we've had to say, look, this is having an impact on what we would have guided you guys both in terms of expense as well as some cash impact as we build inventory to actually make a run with aircraft. This is certainly not still at a sure bet standpoint, but I mean obviously we would not do that and make those investments and take that hit in terms of near term's earnings and cash if we didn't think that the level of customer interest that we're seeing, the fact that we now have a path to certification, the fact that we've demonstrated weapons capabilities, the level of interest that we'd have from customers that we've been talking to for a number of years has become strong enough that we felt it was time to accelerate that spending and be willing to invest some of our cash to be ready to do a limited production run here. So is it a sure thing? No. Do we see that the opportunity is real and that we think that there's a real future for this thing and something that can be a profitable line of business for the company? I'd have to say the answer is yes, or we wouldn't have made the decisions to go ahead and take some pressure on earnings and pressure on cash to really take that final step and bring this thing to the market in a very real, credible way."

And we -- as you know, these programs, when you're building tanks for these platforms, they tend to be fairly long cycle, so when we commit to go and invest the capital on a new plant and a new bolt-rolling machines and stuff like that, we clearly have line of sight to where that capacity is going to be utilized and all the platforms that capacity will be utilized on. So we don't see much downside risk to underutilization of those assets. And certainly, that's been our history over there is that these plants are well utilized and deliver good returns."

I mean, again, we really do this and make these decisions based on specific opportunities, specific platforms that we win, and that's what drives us. So in terms of how we think about capital allocation in that business in the future, we allocate it to the places where we've won with a customer and need to produce locally. So and I mean I think, if you look in that this year so far, we've actually had more growth in Europe than we've had in North America or Asia, and that's because our customers in Europe have had higher growth rates. But again, our allocation of capital and where we choose to put locations is very highly driven to how we're doing and who we're winning with on where in the world. So we really let that drive it, as opposed to a philosophy of being in one particular region or the other."
