Moving to Slide 3. Our a",1674,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased that you could join us. 
With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; as well as the President of our U.S. and U.K. utility businesses. 
Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda this morning starts with an overview of our 2015 earnings results and operational overview and a discussion of our 2016 [ph] earnings forecast and our priorities for this year. 
After my remarks, we'll review our segment financials and provided more detailed financial overview. 
Before I go any further, however, let me simply say that 2015 was a remarkable year for PPL. We successfully spun off our competitive generation business. In doing so, we better position PPL for the future growth and cap our strategic transformation into a purely regulated utility business. 
We delivered more than $3 billion in infrastructure improvements, investments that are driving earnings growth and improving service to our 10 million customers. 
We secured favorable outcomes in our Kentucky and Pennsylvania rate cases. Successfully transitioning to RIIO-ED1 in the U.K., we increased our dividend for the 13th time in 14 years and we've delivered strong earnings results. 
Moreover, our stock outperformed our peers, the UTY and the S&P 500 utilities index. 
PPL's total share of return of 6.2% on a year was higher than any other utility in the UTY, our significant accomplishments during a time of significant change for our company and our industry. 
Today, we're announcing a plan to achieve compound annual earnings growth of 5% to 6% through 2018, off of our 2014 adjusted EPS of $2.03 per share. 
The continued excellence performance of our utilities give you the confidence in our ability to deliver competitive earnings growth and a strong dividend. 
Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced 2015 reported earnings of $1.01 per share compared with $2.61 [ph] per share in 2014. Our 2015 results reflect the loss from discontinued operations of $921 million or $1.36 per share, resulting primarily from the June 1 spinoff of our competitive Supply business. 
Adjusting for special items are 2015 earnings from ongoing operations were $2.21 per share. That's an increase of 9% from 2014 adjusted results of $2.03 per share. 
For the fourth quarter of 2015, reported earnings were $0.59 [ph] per share compared with $1.04 per share a year ago. 
Earnings per share from ongoing operations were $0.43 in the fourth quarter compared with $0.49 a year ago. 
The 9% or $140 [ph] million year-over-year improvement in earnings of ongoing operations was driven primarily by the benefits of our corporate restructuring, lower income taxes and depreciation expense in the U.K., higher returns on capital investments and a midyear Kentucky rate increases. 
Vince will provide more details on segment results in his remarks. 
Let's move on to Slide 5 for an update on our utility operations. On November 19, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved rate increase for PPL Electric Utilities. The action followed a settlement agreement that we reach with party to a rate case. The increase, which took effect January 1, will provide an additional $124 million in revenue and help fund additional reliability improvements as we continue to strengthen and modernize our Pennsylvania delivery network. 
The settlement was black box settlement and does not specify and allow return on equity. 
Turning to Kentucky, Louisville Gas & Electric and Kentucky Utilities saw environmental compliance and cost recovery plans for the Kentucky Public Service Commission on January 29. The application seek approval and environmental cost recovery rate treatment for $1 billion in upcoming environmental improvement projects. These projects will ensure compliance with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's new coal combustion residuals that became effective last year. The projects will involve capping and closing remaining  at our coal plans, building process order facility and completing the second phase of a drug store's landfill project our EW Brown generating station. 
We expect to begin these investments in these incremental improvement in 2016 and it will continue through 2023. 
Looking to the U.K., WPD wrapped up the DPC intro period March 31, 2015. WPD was the top performer over the period and earned $478 million by outperforming its incentive targets. We were consistently the best performer within customer service in all categories: customer satisfaction, customer complaints and stakeholder engagement. 
During the price control period, WPD made through a major transformation acquiring to lower performing midline network operations in 2011 and very quickly improved their performance, which helped drive the significant incentive revenues earned under DPCR5. 
Turning to the new RIIO-ED1 price control period. WPD continues to outperform its 2015 to 2016 performance targets and is on pace to be near the maximum incentive reward for customer minutes lost and customer interruptions. 
In addition, we're in place to be near or at the maximum reward levels for customer satisfaction. 
During our last call, we raised our guidance estimates for the incentive revenues we expect to earn for the calendar years 2017 through 2018. 
Based on our continued strong performance to date, we expect incentive revenues for 2016 to be at the high end of our $120 million to $130 million range. 
As you may recall, incentives for the 2015, 2016 regulatory year will be received in revenues beginning in the 2017, 2018 regulatory year as there's that a year lagged. Details on WPD's performance and incentives are included in today's appendix. 
Turning to Slide 6, our 2016 earnings forecast. It's $2.25 to $2.45 per share. The midpoint of this range, $2.35 per share, represents growth of 6.3% compared to our 2015 earnings from ongoing operations, up $2.21 per share. 
As I highlighted in my opening remarks, the continued excellent performance of our utility operations and the organic growth of planned and accrued infrastructure investments give us great confidence in our ability to achieve compound annual growth in earnings of 5% to 6% through 2018, again off of our 2014 adjusted EPS of $2.03 per share. 
We expect EPS growth of 11% to 13% through 2018 from our U.S. operations with 1% to 3% growth expected in the U.K. 
Vince will cover this in more detail during his remarks. 
Turning to Slide 7. I'm also pleased to announce our board approved an increase in our common stock dividend, raising it from $1.51 to $1.52 per share on an annualized basis. This marks PPL's 14th dividend increase in 15 years. This is consistent with our prior guidance of a modest increase in 2016 [ph] as we work our way into the mid-60% [ph] payout range. 
We expect to grow the dividend more meaningfully beginning in 2017, at which time we will target in the 4% range. 
Now let's move to Slide 8 and highlight some of PPL's objectives in 2016. A primary objective of ours is executing on our planned capital investment program of $3.5 billion. This includes expenditures to strengthen, transmission and distribution network and that may continued environmental improvement in Kentucky. 
In Pennsylvania, we're focused for an advancing Project Compass, which is designed to provide significant benefits to electricity consumers in the Northeast. 
In October, we saw an interconnection request with the New York ISL to build the first segment of Project Compass and its 95-mile transmission line between Lake and New York. We expect to serve the next step in approvals in the first quarter of 2016 [ph], New York's Article 7 application process, which is a full siding application. 
We're also focused on completing our Northeast Transmission line, a $350 million improvement project that includes 70 miles of new transmission lines, 3 new substations as well as additional improvements. 
We expect to conclude that project this May, which is about a year ahead of our original schedule. 
In Kentucky, a major focus will be approval of the compliance plan and cost recovery for the environmental construction projects that I highlighted earlier. 
Another key objective is to work with the state of Kentucky to address the Clean Power Plan in the best interest of our customers and our shareholders. 
In the U.K, our team is focused on continued regulatory performance and adding to a long history of operational excellence. We'll also look to continue to hedge our 2018 British pound currency exposure be on the 20% that we've been able to hedge to date at or near our budgeted rate of $1.60 [ph] per pound. 
We built some capacity in our business plan to further hedge 2018. And at the current stock rate of through the pound of about $1.46, we feel confident that we will be able to achieve our stated earnings growth rates through 2018. 
Turning to Slide 9. We expect infrastructure investment to continue to drive rate base and EPS growth in the coming years. We plan to invest nearly $10 billion from 2016 to 2018 to modernize and strengthen our transmission and distribution systems and to address environmental regulations in Kentucky. 
Constructed brake mechanisms in the premiere jurisdictions where we operate allow me real-time recovery of much of that investment. More than 80% of our regulated capital expenditures are subject to minimal or no regulatory lag. 
Based on planned infrastructure spending, we expect the rate base to grow by $4.3 billion from 2015 to 2010. We expect compound annual EPS growth through 2018 of 5 to 6 [indiscernible] for 2014 earnings from ongoing operations of $2.03 per share. 
As you know, prior to the year-end 2015, passage of the Act Congress extended 50% [ph] bonus depreciation from 2015 through 2017, with a reduction in bonus to 40% in 2018 and 30% in 2019 with a 0% thereafter. 
The impact of bonus depreciation expansion are factored into our earnings projections. Vince will speak more about this in just a bit. 
We're confident we will be able to achieve this growth rate given our low-risk business plan, the premium jurisdictions in which we operate and our demonstrated ability to manage our foreign currency exposure in the U.K. 
I look forward to your questions after we hear some additional earnings details from Vincent Sorgi. Vince?"

That is Slide 11 for a review of segment earnings. Full year 2015 earnings from ongoing operations increased over the prior year from 2014 adjusted earnings of $2.03 per share to $2.21 per share, slightly ahe",2518,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. That is Slide 11 for a review of segment earnings. 
Full year 2015 earnings from ongoing operations increased over the prior year from 2014 adjusted earnings of $2.03 per share to $2.21 per share, slightly ahead of the midpoint of our earnings guidance range. The main drivers of growth were higher earnings in the U.K. Regulated and Kentucky Regulated segments as well as lower cost in Corporate and Other, partially offset by lower earnings from the Pennsylvania Regulated segment. 
The favorable $0.10 in Corporate and Other is properly driven by the corporate restructuring efforts. 
Before I get into the segment details, let's briefly discuss the fourth quarter results as well as domestic weather for the year compared to the prior year and compared to our 2015 bucket. 
Our fourth quarter earnings from ongoing operations decreased over last year by $0.06 per share, driven primarily by lower earnings from the U.K. Regulated segment as a result of transitioning to the RIIO-ED1 regulatory period. Pennsylvania Regulated and Kentucky Regulated segment were both slightly negative this year versus last, affecting the impact of less favorable weather. And Corporate and Other was better this year, resulting from the corporate restructuring. 
Overall, domestic weather was flat compared to the prior year that had a positive impact compared to budget by about $0.02. Favorable weather for the first 9 months of the year was partially offset by the warmer weather experienced primarily in December. 
Let's move to a more detailed review of the 2015 segment earnings drivers starting with the Pennsylvania results on Slide 12. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.37 per share in 2015, a $0.03 decrease compared to 2014. This decrease was due to higher O&M expenses as a result of higher service company allocation due to the spinoff of the Supply business. And also our strong performance throughout the year provided us the opportunity to take advantage of additional spending opportunities focused primarily on improving bigger liability, which will benefit future periods. 
Depreciation was higher due to additions and we had bought higher financing costs related to prior debt -- prior year debt issuance. 
Partially offsetting these negative factors were higher margins from additional transmission investments and returns on distribution improvement capital investment and lower taxes, primarily due to the settlement of a 2011 gross receipts tax audit resulting in a $0.02 benefit this year. 
Moving to Slide 13. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.51 [ph] per share in 2015, a $0.04 increase from 2014. This increase was due to higher gross margin, which is the net effect of electric and gas base rate increases affected our IFRS in 2015 and returns on additional environmental capital investments, partially offset by lower volumes due to warmer weather in November and December of this year compared to the prior year and lower industrial sales. 
And while the first quarter was colder than average, it was not as cold as the polar vortex driven weather in 2014. These net positive results were partially offset by higher O&M expenses, including costs associated with the return of the Cane Run facility of $0.02 and higher financing costs related to the September 2015 debt issuances. 
Moving to Slide 14. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $1.44 per share in 2015, a $0.07 improvement compared to 2014. This increase was due to lower U.S. income taxes primarily from lower taxes on dividends in 2015 compared to 2014 and lower U.K. income taxes resulting from a lower effective tax rate in the U.K. due to a reduction in the statutory tax rate. 
While our depreciation expense from the asset life extension we discussed earlier this year also contributed to the improvement, which was partially offset by increased depreciation from asset efficiency. 
These increases were partially offset by lower gross margin as we transition to RIIO-ED1 on April 1 of this year, partially offset by the April 1, 2014, price increases and higher O&M expenses. 
Before we move to the next slide, I wanted to mention that similar to last year, we will provide you unaudited consolidated financial information for PPL Global LLC for 2015. We expect to furnish those statements separately and an 8-K to be filed at the time we file our 10-K in a couple of weeks. 
Turning to Slide 15. We have prepared a walk from our 2015 ongoing earnings of $2.21 per share to the $2.35 per share midpoint of our 2016 earnings forecast. 
Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment is forecast to contribute $0.10 to the improvement in 2016 earnings. This increase is primarily driven by the distribution base rate increase, which became affected effective January 1, 2016, at higher transmission margins and lower O&M. These positive drivers are expected to be partially offset by higher depreciation, higher financing costs to fund the capital growth in Pennsylvania and the tax benefit received in 2015 from the release of a gross receipt tax reserve. 
Our Kentucky Regulated segment also puts us higher earnings of $0.06 per share. These increases primarily driven by realizing a full year of electric and gas rate increases that became effective July 1, 2015, and higher returns on additional environmental capital investments and higher retail loan and other margins. 
Higher margins are expected to be partially offset by higher depreciation on an increased plan in service and higher interest expense to fund the capital growth in Kentucky. 
In the U.K., we project slightly lower segment earnings due to the higher financing costs, primarily from a full year of interest expense on the December 2015 debt issuances, higher depreciation expense from asset efficiencies, higher taxes and other, and unfavorable effects of foreign currency, as we execute from 2016 restrikes to hedge 2018 earnings near our budgeted rate of $1.60 [ph]. 
These negative drivers are partially offset by lower O&M, including pension expense and higher gross margins from price increases. 
Corporate and Other is expected to be relatively flat year-over-year, which is slightly higher interest expense in 2016 driving the increase. 
In addition, for the U.K. Regulated segment, you will see in the appendix on Slide 27 that we have provided 1 additional year of earnings production. Our U.K. earnings guidance range for 2017 is $1.40 per share to $1.50 per share, with the midpoint of $1.45 per share. 
Turning to Slide 16. As Bill mentioned earlier in the call, we are confident in our ability to achieve our 5% to 6% earnings growth targets through 2018, off of our 2014 adjusted ongoing earnings of $2.03 per share. 
We now expect 9% to 11% growth in our domestic utility earnings and approximately 2% growth coming from our corporate restructuring effort. And we increased our expectation slightly in our U.K. business over this time period to 1% to 3% growth, up from 1% to 2% growth. 
The 1% to 3% represents growth off of 2014 earnings of $1.37 [ph] per share, which incorporates the lower depreciation expense from the asset life extension and our updates on incentive revenues, a well as lower net pension expense in part due to updating our pension discount rate methodology to utilize the stock rate method recently approved by the SEC to measure both service cost and interest cost. 
This change in pension discount rate methodology was only applied to the U.K. pension plan as the method we used in the U.S. to set our discount rates did not qualify for the spot rate method approved by the SEC. 
Several key drivers to our organic growth in the domestic utility includes strong transmission rate base growth of 14% through 2018 in Pennsylvania and favorable rate base outcomes contribute to our growth in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky. The successful execution of our CapEx plans is critical to all 3 of our business segments. We continue to assume minimal load growth over the period in both Kentucky and Pennsylvania. 
Also included in our 5% to 6% earnings growth forecast is the full 5-year extension of bonus depreciation. 
As a reminder, when we updated our 2017 earnings growth target to 6% last quarter, we had assumed a 2-year [ph] extension of bonus depreciation. Incorporating the full 5 years of bonus depreciation did not have a significant incremental effect on our 2018 earnings. 
While extending bonus depreciation is a net negative to earnings, it is positive from a credit perspective, especially from in the back end of the planning period. Over the next 5 years, we expect bonus depreciation to reduce our federal cash tax position by about $270 [ph] million and we do not expect to be a significant cash tax payer to at least the next 5 years. 
The increase in available cash combined with our stronger earnings growth has enabled us to reduce our equity needs from $020 million per year to $100 million per year and maintain our targeted credit metric. 
For the U.K. Regulated segment, of course, executing on the off-jam accepted RIIO-ED1 plan has been built into the growth assumptions and provides 8 years of base revenue certainty, discontinued opportunity to outperform target. 
We have also assumed that budgeted currency rate of $1.56 [ph] per pound for 2016, $1.58 [ph] per pound for '17 and $1.60 [ph] per pound for 2018, which includes existing hedge position. 
The inflation rate used for the 2015, '16 regulatory year was 2.6%, which will be chewed up for actual inflation in the 2017, '18 regulatory. 
We are now assuming the actual inflation rate for 2015 to '16 will be 1.3% and the adjustment to chew up the 2.6% [ph] down to the 1.3% has been included in our 2017 and '18 earnings forecast and FX 2017 revenue by approximately $0.03 per share. We have provided additional details on the chew-up mechanisms to base revenue on Slide 30 in the appendix. 
Our IPI assumption for 2016, '17 are now 2.3% [ph] and 3.1% for '17, '18, consistent with the Treasury forecast. We have increased our incentive revenue estimate for 2016 to the high end of our previous $120 million to $130 million range. 
We are assuming the same incentive revenues of last quarter for 2017 and 2018. And finally, we are assuming an effective tax rate in the U.K. of about 17%. 
For Corporate and Other, we have built into the growth rate achieving the full $75 million in corporate support cost savings and an additional $0.02 per share improvement by 2017. 
On Slide 17, we're providing an update to our view of domestic cash flows for 2015 and 2016. 
As you can see in the table, we expect to have sufficient domestic cash flow to fund our maintenance capital and the common stock dividend with almost $300 [ph] million left over in 2016 [ph] to fund dividend growth and growth CapEx. We have now domestic debt maturities in 2016 to the debt equity issuances in the U.S. will fund the rest of our growth CapEx. 
Moving to Slide 18. Our planned capital expenditures for 2016 through 2020 are detailed on the slide. These regulated utility investment totaling about $16 [ph] billion over the period and about $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion per year. This includes previously announced initiatives such as the U.K. spending for our accepted RIIO-ED1 business plan, executing on our environmental compliance plans in Kentucky to meet EPA regulations, updating and modernizing aging infrastructure in Pennsylvania, including programs that identify areas to strategically improve system performance and reliability. This capital plan still excludes any impact of between power plants. 
Moving to Slide 19. Our revised capital plan reflects generally the same spending levels in the U.K. as last year's plan, except for some slight increased spending on faults and overhead repairs in 2016. We reduced investment of approximately $650 [ph] million in Kentucky as we deferred a projected natural gas combined cycle plant. However, new gas power generation may ultimately be part of our clean power plant compliance strategy, which I've noted on Slide 18, is not include in our projection. This was partially offset by additional reliability based programs in the transmission and distribution businesses in Kentucky while environmental spending has remained fairly consistent with the prior plan. 
In Pennsylvania, we are experiencing higher-than-expected increases in reliability based on all the capital investments we've made to date. As a result, we now believe we can achieve our targeted reliability with about $270 [ph] million less of distribution capital compared to last year's plan. 
Anticipated transmission spend remains relatively consistent with the prior plan. These investments are expected to result in additional improvements in reliability over the next 5 years. 
And consistent with last year's plan, our capital plan is based on identified projects across the portfolio and does not include unidentified growth projects. 
Turning to Slide 20. Our rate base is now expected to grow at a 5.3% CAGR over the next 5 years, which incorporate the 5-year extension of bonus depreciation and the deferral of the second combined cycle gas plant in Kentucky. 
And finally, moving to Slide 21. On this slide, we provide an update to our GDP hedging status for 2016, '17 and '18, including sensitivities through $0.05, $0.10 and $0.15 downward movement in the exchange rate compared to our budgeted rate of $1.60 [ph] on our open position. We are 95% hedged through 2016 at an average rate of $1.56 [ph]. For 2017, we have continued to layer on hedges during the quarter and have increased our hedge percentage from 66% [ph] at the end of the third quarter to 89% today at an average rate of $1.58 [ph]. 
You can see from the sensitivity table that there's no exposure for '16 and minimal exposure for 2017. 
We've also started to hedge our 2018 earnings and are now 20% hedged at an average rate of $1.60. It's important to note as well that included in our earnings guidance ranges is an upside to hedge about 50% of our 2018 U.K. earnings. 
After we get about 50% hedge for 2018, our risk program would not require us to layer on additional hedges until about mid-2017. 
Switching to RPI. Also on this slide, we show our RPI sensitivity, which has been updated as well. 
As I discussed earlier, we are now incorporating a 1.3% RPI rate in our current 2015, '16 planning assumptions compared to the 2.6% included in our tariff. 
Therefore, the 2017 RPI sensitivity for a half percent downward movement in the '15, '16 RPI is now off the current budget of 1.3%. 
In November 2015, we set our 2016, '17 and 2017, '18 tariff based on the forecasted RPI at that time consistent with Ofgem's guidance. 
Now we have -- now that we've completed the tariff setting process for the next 2 regulatory years, in November of 2016, only 1 additional year of tariff for 2018, '19 will be set based on the RPI forecast at that time. 
Overall, we're confident in our ability to manage our FX exposure and we've incorporated the low RPI environment into our earnings growth projections. 
That concludes my prepared remarks and I'll turn the call over to Bill for the Q&A period. Bill?"

We will be working with the Kentucky Public Utility Commission, of course, to get a plan that's acceptable. And then throughout my perspective, I would anticipate us perhaps concentrating another combined cycle plan later in the planning FX outside this period, probably by 2022. But I do think Kentucky realizes that it would like to maintain the electability both to grow the plan and not to the subject to New York federal implementation plan. And second, be in a position to the extent mitigation should be successful was in part or in total. So that's where we are. And I think it will be a constructive exercise for all of us. And I think the state recognizes they need to maintain the flexibility."

With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; as well as the Presidents of our U.S. and U.K. utility businesses.
Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda this morning starts with an overview of our 2015 earnings results, an operational overview and a discussion of our 2016 earnings forecast and our priorities for this year. After my remarks, Vince will review our segment financials and provide a more detailed financial overview.
Before I go any further, however, let me simply say that 2015 was a remarkable year for PPL. We successfully spun off our competitive generation business. In doing so, we better position PPL for future growth and capped our strategic transformation into a purely regulated utility business.
We delivered more than $3 billion in infrastructure improvements, investments that are driving earnings growth and improving service to our 10 million customers. We secured favorable outcomes in our Kentucky and Pennsylvania rate cases. Successfully transitioning to RIIO-ED1 in the U.K., we increased our dividend for the 13th time in 14 years, and we've delivered strong earnings results. Moreover, our stock outperformed our peers, the UTY and the S&P 500 Utilities Index. PPL's total shareowner return of 6.2% on the year was higher than any other utility in the UTY. All were significant accomplishments during a time of significant change for our company and our industry.
Today, we're announcing a plan to achieve compound annual earnings growth of 5% to 6% through 2018, off of our 2014 adjusted EPS of $2.03 per share. The continued excellent performance of our utilities gives us confidence in our ability to deliver competitive earnings growth and a strong dividend.
Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced 2015 reported earnings of $1.01 per share compared with $2.61 per share in 2014. Our 2015 results reflect the loss from discontinued operations of $921 million or $1.36 per share, resulting primarily from the June 1 spinoff of our competitive supply business.
Adjusting for special items, our 2015 earnings from ongoing operations were $2.21 per share, that's an increase of 9% from 2014 adjusted results of $2.03 per share. For the fourth quarter of 2015, reported earnings were $0.59 per share compared with $1.04 per share a year ago. Earnings per share from ongoing operations were $0.43 in the fourth quarter compared with $0.49 a year ago. The 9% or $140 million year-over-year improvement in earnings from ongoing operations was driven primarily by the benefits of our corporate restructuring, lower income taxes and depreciation expense in the U.K., higher returns on capital investments and the midyear Kentucky rate increases. Vince will provide more details on segment results in his remarks.
Let's move on to Slide 5 for an update on our utility operations. On November 19, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a rate increase for PPL Electric Utilities. The action followed a settlement agreement that we reached with the party for a rate case. The increase, which took effect January 1, will provide an additional $124 million in revenue and help fund additional reliability improvements as we continue to strengthen and modernize our Pennsylvania delivery network. The settlement was a black box settlement and does not specify an allowed return on equity.
Turning to Kentucky. Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities filed environmental compliance and cost recovery plans for the Kentucky Public Service Commission on January 29. The application seek approval an environmental cost recovery rate treatment for $1 billion in upcoming environmental improvement projects. These projects will ensure compliance with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's new Coal Combustion Residuals rule that became effective last year. The projects will involve capping and closing remaining ash ponds at our coal-fired power plants, building process order facilities and completing the second phase of a dry storage landfill project at our E.W. Brown Generating Station. We expect to begin these investments in these environmental improvements in 2016 and they will continue through 2023.
Looking to the U.K. WPD wrapped up the DPCR5 price control period March 31, 2015. WPD was the top performer over the period and earned $478 million by outperforming its incentive targets. We were consistently the best performer for customer service in all categories: customer satisfaction, customer complaints and stakeholder engagement.
During the price control period, WPD went through a major transformation, acquiring 2 lower-performing Midlands network operations in 2011 and very quickly improved their performance, which helped drive the significant incentive revenues earned under DPCR5.
Turning to the new RIIO-ED1 price control period. WPD continues to outperform its 2015 to 2016 performance targets and is on pace to be near the maximum incentive reward for customer minutes lost and customer interruptions. In addition, we're on pace to be near or at the maximum reward levels for customer satisfaction.
During our last call, we raised our guidance estimates for the incentive revenues we expect to earn for the calendar years 2017 through 2018. Based on our continued strong performance to-date, we expect incentive revenues for 2016 to be at the high end of our $120 million to $130 million range.
As you may recall, incentives for the 2015, 2016 regulatory year will be received in revenues beginning in the 2017, 2018 regulatory year as there is that a 2-year lag. Details on WPD's performance and incentives are included in today's appendix.
Turning to Slide 6. Our 2016 earnings forecast is $2.25 to $2.45 per share. The midpoint of this range, $2.35 per share, represents growth of 6.3% compared to our 2015 earnings from ongoing operations, up $2.21 per share.
As I highlighted in my opening remarks, the continued excellent performance of our utility operations and the organic growth from planned and accrued infrastructure investments give us great confidence in our ability to achieve compound annual growth in earnings of 5% to 6% through 2018, again, off of our 2014 adjusted EPS of $2.03 per share. We expect EPS growth of 11% to 13% through 2018 from our U.S. operations, with 1% to 3% growth expected in the U.K. Vince will cover this in more detail during his remarks.
Turning to Slide 7. I'm also pleased to announce that our board approved an increase in our common stock dividend, raising it from $1.51 to $1.52 per share on an annualized basis. This marks PPL's 14th dividend increase in 15 years. This is consistent with our prior guidance of a modest dividend increase in 2016 as we work our way into the mid-60 percent payout range. We expect to grow the dividend more meaningfully beginning in 2017, at which time we will target in the 4% range.
Now let's move to Slide 8 and highlight some of PPL's objectives in 2016. A primary objective of ours is executing on our planned capital investment program of $3.5 billion. This includes expenditures to strengthen transmission and distribution networks and the may [ph] continued environmental improvements in Kentucky.
In Pennsylvania, we're focused toward advancing Project Compass, which is designed to provide significant benefits to electricity consumers in the Northeast. In October, we filed an interconnection request with the New York ISO to build the first segment of Project Compass, a 95-mile transmission line between Blakely, PA and Ramapo, New York. We expect to start the next step in the approvals in the first quarter of 2016, New York's Article VII application process, which is a full siting and needs application.
We're also focused on completing our Northeast Pocono Transmission Line, a $350 million improvement project that includes 70 miles of new transmission lines, 3 new substations as well as additional improvements. We expect to conclude that project this May, which is about a year ahead of our original schedule.
In Kentucky, a major focus will be approval of compliance plans and cost recovery for the environmental construction projects that I highlighted earlier. Another key objective is to work with the state of Kentucky to address the Clean Power Plan in the best interest of our customers and our shareowners.
In the U.K, our team is focused on continued regulatory performance and adding to our long history of operational excellence. We'll also look to continue to hedge our 2018 British pound currency exposure beyond the 20% that we've been able to hedge to-date at or near our budgeted rate of $1.60 per pound. We built some capacity in our business plan to further hedge 2018 and at the current spot rate for the GP -- for the pound of about $1.46, we feel confident that we will be able to achieve our stated earnings growth rates through 2018.
Turning to Slide 9. We expect infrastructure investment to continue to drive rate base and EPS growth in the coming years. We plan to invest nearly $10 billion from 2016 through 2018 to modernize and strengthen our transmission and distribution systems and to address environmental regulations in Kentucky.
Constructive rate mechanisms in the premier jurisdictions where we operate allow near real-time recovery of much of that investment. More than 80% of our regulated capital expenditures are subject to minimal or no regulatory lag. Based on planned infrastructure spending, we expect our rate base to grow by $4.3 billion from 2015 to 2018. We expect compound annual EPS growth through 2018 of 5 to 6 [Audio Gap] for 2014 earnings from ongoing operations of $2.03 per share.
As you know, prior to the year-end 2015, passage of the PATH Act by Congress extended 50% bonus depreciation from 2015 through 2017, with a faded out reduction in bonus to 40% in 2018 and 30% in 2019, with a 0% thereafter. The impact of the bonus depreciation extension are factored in to our earnings projections. Vince will speak more about this in just a bit.
We're confident we will be able to achieve this growth rate given our low-risk business plan, the premium jurisdictions in which we operate and our demonstrated ability to manage our foreign currency exposure in the U.K.
I look forward to your questions after we hear some additional earnings details from Vince Sorgi. Vince?"

That is Slide 11 for a review of our segment earnings.
Full year 2015 earnings from ongoing operations increased over the prior year from 2014 adjusted earnings of $2.03 per share to $2.21 per share, slightly ahead of the midpoint of our earnings guidance range. The main drivers of growth were higher earnings in the U.K. Regulated and Kentucky Regulated segments as well as lower cost in Corporate and Other, partially offset by lower earnings from the Pennsylvania Regulated segment. The favorable $0.10 in Corporate and Other is primarily driven by the corporate restructuring efforts.
Before I get into the segment details, let's briefly discuss the fourth quarter results as well as domestic weather for the year compared to the prior year and compared to our 2015 budget. Our fourth quarter earnings from ongoing operations decreased over last year by $0.06 per share, driven primarily by lower earnings from the U.K. Regulated segment as a result of transitioning to the RIIO-ED1 regulatory period. Pennsylvania Regulated and Kentucky Regulated segments were both slightly negative this year versus last, reflecting the impact of less favorable weather. And Corporate and Other was better this year resulting from the corporate restructuring.
Overall, domestic weather was flat compared to the prior year and had a positive impact compared to budget by about $0.02. Favorable weather for the first 9 months of the year was partially offset by the warmer weather experienced primarily in December.
Let's move to a more detailed review of the 2015 segment earnings drivers, starting with the Pennsylvania results on Slide 12. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.37 per share in 2015, a $0.03 decrease compared to 2014. This decrease was due to higher O&M expenses as a result of higher service company allocations due to the spinoff of the supply business. And also, our strong performance throughout the year provided us the opportunity to take advantage of additional spending opportunities focused primarily on improving bigger liability which would benefit future periods. Depreciation was higher due to asset additions, and we had bought higher financing costs related to prior debt -- prior year debt issuances.
Partially offsetting these negative factors were higher margins from additional transmission investments and returns on distribution improvement capital investment and lower taxes primarily due to the settlement of a 2011 gross receipts tax audit resulting in a $0.02 benefit this year.
Moving to Slide 13. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.51 per share in 2015, a $0.04 increase from 2014. This increase was due to higher gross margins, which is the net effect of electric and gas base rate increases effective July 1, 2015, and returns on additional environmental capital investments, partially offset by lower volumes due to warmer weather in November and December of this year compared to the prior year and lower industrial sales. And while the first quarter was colder than average, it was not as cold as the polar vortex-driven weather in 2014.
These net positive results were partially offset by higher O&M expenses, including costs associated with the retiring of the Cane Run coal-fired facility of $0.02 and higher financing costs related to the September 2015 debt issuances.
Moving to Slide 14. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $1.44 per share in 2015, a $0.07 improvement compared to 2014. This increase was due to lower U.S. income taxes, primarily from lower taxes on dividends in 2015 compared to 2014 and lower U.K. income taxes resulting from a lower effective tax rate in the U.K. due to a reduction in the statutory tax rate. Lower depreciation expense from the asset life extension we discussed earlier this year also contributed to the improvement, which was partially offset by increased depreciation from asset additions.
These increases were partially offset by lower gross margin as we transition to RIIO-ED1 on April 1 of this year, partially offset by the April 1, 2014 price increases and higher O&M expenses.
Before we move to the next slide, I wanted to mention that, similar to last year, we will provide you unaudited consolidated financial information for PPL Global LLC for 2015. We expect to furnish those statements separately and an 8-K to be filed at the time we file our 10-K in a couple of weeks.
Turning to Slide 15. We have prepared a walk from our 2015 ongoing earnings of $2.21 per share to the $2.35 per share midpoint of our 2016 earnings forecast.
Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment is forecast to contribute $0.10 to the improvement in 2016 earnings. This increase is primarily driven by the distribution base rate increase, which became effective January 1, 2016, and higher transmission margins and lower O&M. These positive drivers are expected to be partially offset by higher depreciation, higher financing costs to fund the capital growth in Pennsylvania and the tax benefit received in 2015 from the release of a gross receipt tax reserve.
Our Kentucky Regulated segment also project higher earnings of $0.06 per share. This increase is primarily driven by realizing a full year of electric and gas base rate increases that became effective July 1, 2015 and higher returns on additional environmental capital investments and higher retail load at other margins. Higher margins are expected to be partially offset by higher depreciation on the increased plan of service and higher interest expense to fund the capital growth in Kentucky.
In the U.K., we project slightly lower segment earnings due to higher financing costs, primarily from a full year of interest expense on the December 2015 debt issuances, higher depreciation expense from asset additions, higher taxes and other and unfavorable effects of foreign currency as we execute some 2016 restrikes that hedge 2018 earnings near our budgeted rate of $1.60. These negative drivers are partially offset by lower O&M, including pension expense, and higher gross margins from price increases.
Corporate and Other is expected to be relatively flat year-over-year, with slightly higher interest expense in 2016 driving the pending decrease.
In addition, for the U.K. Regulated segment, you will see in the appendix on Slide 27 that we have provided one additional year of earnings projection. Our U.K. earnings guidance range for 2017 is $1.40 per share to $1.50 per share, with a midpoint of $1.45 per share.
Turning to Slide 16. As Bill mentioned earlier in the call, we are confident in our ability to achieve our 5% to 6% earnings growth targets through 2018, off of our 2014 adjusted ongoing earnings of $2.03 per share. We now expect 9% to 11% growth in our domestic utility earnings and approximately 2% growth coming from our corporate restructuring efforts. And we increased our expectation slightly in our U.K. business over this time period to 1% to 3% growth, up from 1% to 2% growth. The 1% to 3% represents growth off of 2014 earnings of $1.37 per share, which incorporates the lower depreciation expense from the asset life extension and our updates on incentive revenues as well as lower net pension expense in part due to updating our pension discount rate methodology to utilize the spot rate method recently approved by the SEC to measure both service cost and interest cost. This change in pension discount rate methodology was only applied to the U.K. pension plan as the method we use in the U.S. to set our discount rate did not qualify for the spot rate method approved by the SEC.
Several key drivers to our organic growth in the domestic utility includes strong transmission rate base growth of 14% through 2018 in Pennsylvania. Favorable rate case outcomes contribute to our growth in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky. The successful execution of our CapEx plans is critical for all 3 of our business segments. We continue to assume minimal load growth over the period in both Kentucky and Pennsylvania.
Also included in our 5% to 6% earnings growth forecast is the full 5-year extension of bonus depreciation. As a reminder, when we updated our 2017 earnings growth target to 6% last quarter, we had assumed a 2-year extension of bonus depreciation. Incorporating the full 5 years of bonus depreciation did not have a significant incremental effect on our 2018 earnings.
While extending bonus depreciation is a net negative to earnings, it is positive from a credit perspective, especially in the back end of the planning period. Over the next 5 years, we expect bonus depreciation to reduce our federal cash tax position by about $270 million. And we do not expect to be a significant cash tax payer to, at least, the next 5 years.
The increase in available cash combined with our stronger earnings growth has enabled us to reduce our equity needs from $200 million per year to $100 million per year and maintain our targeted credit metric.
For the U.K. Regulated segment, of course, executing on the Ofgem-accepted RIIO-ED1 business plan has been built into the growth assumptions and provides 8 years of base revenue certainty, with continued opportunity to outperform target.
We have also assumed the budgeted currency rate of $1.56 per pound for 2016, $1.58 per pound for '17 and $1.60 per pound for 2018, which includes existing hedge positions.
The inflation rate used for the 2015-'16 regulatory year carat [ph] was 2.6%, which will be trued-up for actual inflation in the 2017-'18 regulatory year.
We are now assuming the actual inflation rate for 2015 to '16 will be 1.3%, and the adjustment to true-up the 2.6% down to the 1.3% has been included in our 2017 and '18 earnings forecast and affects 2017 revenue by approximately $0.03 per share. We have provided additional details on the true-up mechanisms to base revenue on Slide 30 in the appendix.
Our RPI assumptions for 2016, '17 are now 2.3% and 3.1% for '17, '18, consistent with the HM Treasury forecast.
We have increased our incentive revenue estimate for 2016 to the high end of our previous $120 million to $130 million range. We are assuming the same incentive revenues as last quarter for 2017 and 2018.
And finally, we are assuming an effective tax rate in the U.K. of about 17%.
For Corporate and Other, we have built into the growth rate achieving the full $75 million in corporate support cost savings and an additional $0.02 per share improvement by 2017.
On Slide 17, we're providing an update to our view of domestic cash flows for 2015 and 2016. As you can see in the table, we expect to have sufficient domestic cash flows to fund our maintenance capital and the common stock dividend with almost $300 million left over in 2016 to fund dividend growth and growth CapEx.
We have no domestic debt maturities in 2016. So the debt and equity issuances in the U.S. will fund the rest of our growth CapEx.
Moving to Slide 18. Our planned capital expenditures for 2016 through 2020 are detailed on this slide, with regulated utility investment totaling about $16 billion over the period and about $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion per year. This includes previously announced initiatives such as U.K. spending for our accepted RIIO-ED1 business plan, executing on our environmental compliance plans in Kentucky to meet EPA regulations, updating and modernizing aging infrastructure in Pennsylvania, including programs that identify areas to strategically improve system performance and reliability. And this capital plan still excludes any impacts of Clean Power Plan.
Moving to Slide 19. Our revised capital plan reflects generally the same spending levels in the U.K. as last year's plan, except for some slight increased spending on faults and overhead repairs in 2016.
We reduced investment of approximately $650 million in Kentucky as we deferred a projected Natural Gas Combined Cycle Plant. However, new gas-fired generation may ultimately be part of our Clean Power Plan compliance strategy, which, as noted on Slide 18, is not include in all projections. This was partially offset by additional reliability-based programs in the transmission and distribution businesses in Kentucky, while environmental spending has remained fairly consistent with the prior plan.
In Pennsylvania, we are experiencing higher than expected increases in reliability based on all the capital investment we've made to-date. As a result, we now believe we can achieve our targeted reliability, with about $270 million less of distribution capital compared to last year's plan. Anticipated transmission spend remained relatively consistent with the prior plan. These investments are expected to result in additional improvements in reliability over the next 5 years.
And consistent with last year's plan, our capital plan is based on identified projects across the portfolio and does not include unidentified growth projects.
Turning to Slide 20. Our rate base is now expected to grow at a 5.3% CAGR over the next 5 years, which incorporates the 5-year extension of bonus depreciation and the deferral of the second Combined Cycle Gas Plant in Kentucky.
And finally, moving to Slide 21. On this slide, we provide an update to our GBP hedging status for 2016, '17 and '18, including sensitivities for $0.05, $0.10 and $0.15 downward movement in the exchange rate compared to our budgeted rate of $1.60 on our open position. We are 95% hedged through 2016 at an average rate of $1.56. For 2017, we have continued to layer on hedges during the quarter and have increased our hedge percentage from 66% at the end of the third quarter to 89% today at an average rate of $1.58. 
You can see from the sensitivity table that there's no exposure for '16 and minimal exposure for 2017. 
We've also started to hedge our 2018 earnings and are now 20% hedged at an average rate of $1.60. It's important to note as well that included in our earnings guidance ranges is an upside powder to hedge about 50% of our 2018 U.K. earnings. 
After we get about 50% hedge for 2018, our risk program would not require us to layer on additional hedges until about mid-2017. 
Switching to RPI. Also on this slide, we show our RPI sensitivity, which has been updated as well. 
As I discussed earlier, we are now incorporating a 1.3% RPI rate in our current 2015, '16 planning assumptions compared to the 2.6% included in our tariff. 
Therefore, the 2017 RPI sensitivity for 0.5% downward movement in the '15, '16 RPI is now off the current budget of 1.3%. 
In November 2015, we set our 2016, '17 and 2017, '18 tariff based on the forecasted RPI at that time, consistent with Ofgem's guidance. 
Now we have -- now that we've completed the tariff setting process for the next 2 regulatory years, in November of 2016, only 1 additional year of tariff for 2018, '19 will be set based on the RPI forecast at that time. 
Overall, we're confident in our ability to manage our FX exposure and we've incorporated the low RPI environment into our earnings growth projections. 
That concludes my prepared remarks and I'll turn the call over to Bill for the Q&A period. Bill?"

Our age",1682,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased that you could join us. With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; as well as the Presidents of our U.S. and U.K. utility businesses.
Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda this morning starts with an overview of our 2015 earnings results, an operational overview and a discussion of our 2016 earnings forecast and our priorities for this year. After my remarks, Vince will review our segment financials and provide a more detailed financial overview.
Before I go any further, however, let me simply say that 2015 was a remarkable year for PPL. We successfully spun off our competitive generation business. In doing so, we better positioned PPL for future growth and capped our strategic transformation into a purely regulated utility business.
We delivered more than $3 billion in infrastructure improvements, investments that are driving earnings growth and improving service to our 10 million customers. We secured favorable outcomes in our Kentucky and Pennsylvania rate cases. Successfully transitioning to RIIO-ED1 in the U.K., we increased our dividend for the 13th time in 14 years, and we've delivered strong earnings results. Moreover, our stock outperformed our peers, the UTY and the S&P 500 Utilities Index. PPL's total shareowner return of 6.2% on the year was higher than any other utility in the UTY. All were significant accomplishments during a time of significant change for our company and our industry.
Today, we're announcing a plan to achieve compound annual earnings growth of 5% to 6% through 2018, off of our 2014 adjusted EPS of $2.03 per share. The continued excellent performance of our utilities gives us confidence in our ability to deliver competitive earnings growth and a strong dividend.
Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced 2015 reported earnings of $1.01 per share compared with $2.61 per share in 2014. Our 2015 results reflect the loss from discontinued operations of $921 million or $1.36 per share, resulting primarily from the June 1 spinoff of our competitive supply business.
Adjusting for special items, our 2015 earnings from ongoing operations were $2.21 per share. That's an increase of 9% from 2014 adjusted results of $2.03 per share. For the fourth quarter of 2015, reported earnings were $0.59 per share compared with $1.04 per share a year ago. Earnings per share from ongoing operations were $0.43 in the fourth quarter compared with $0.49 a year ago. The 9% or $140 million year-over-year improvement in earnings from ongoing operations was driven primarily by the benefits of our corporate restructuring, lower income taxes and depreciation expense in the U.K., higher returns on capital investments and the midyear Kentucky rate increases. Vince will provide more details on segment results in his remarks.
Let's move on to Slide 5 for an update on our utility operations. On November 19, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a rate increase for PPL Electric Utilities. The action followed a settlement agreement that we reached with the party through our rate case. The increase, which took effect January 1, will provide an additional $124 million in revenue and help fund additional reliability improvements as we continue to strengthen and modernize our Pennsylvania delivery network. The settlement was a black box settlement and does not specify an allowed return on equity.
Turning to Kentucky. Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities filed environmental compliance and cost recovery plans with the Kentucky Public Service Commission on January 29. The application seeked approval and environmental cost recovery rate treatment for $1 billion in upcoming environmental improvement projects. These projects will ensure compliance with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's new Coal Combustion Residuals rule that became effective last year. The projects will involve capping and closing remaining ash ponds at our coal-fired power plants, building process water facilities and completing the second phase of a dry storage landfill project at our E.W. Brown Generating Station. We expect to begin these investments in these environmental improvements in 2016, and they will continue through 2023.
Looking to the U.K. WPD wrapped up the DPCR5 price control period March 31, 2015. WPD was the top performer over the period and earned $478 million by outperforming its incentive targets. We were consistently the best performer for customer service in all categories: customer satisfaction, customer complaints and stakeholder engagement.
During the price control period, WPD went through a major transformation, acquiring 2 lower-performing Midlands network operations in 2011 and very quickly improved their performance, which helped drive the significant incentive revenues earned under DPCR5.
Turning to the new RIIO-ED1 price control period. WPD continues to outperform its 2015 to 2016 performance targets and is on pace to be near the maximum incentive reward for customer minutes lost and customer interruptions. In addition, we're on pace to be near or at the maximum reward levels for customer satisfaction.
During our last call, we raised our guidance estimates for the incentive revenues we expect to earn for the calendar years 2017 through 2018. Based on our continued strong performance to-date, we expect incentive revenues for 2016 to be at the high end of our $120 million to $130 million range.
As you may recall, incentives for the 2015, 2016 regulatory year will be received in revenues beginning in the 2017, 2018 regulatory year, as there is a 2-year lag. Details on WPD's performance and incentives are included in today's appendix.
Turning to Slide 6. Our 2016 earnings forecast is $2.25 to $2.45 per share. The midpoint of this range, $2.35 per share, represents growth of 6.3% compared to our 2015 earnings from ongoing operations of $2.21 per share.
As I highlighted in my opening remarks, the continued excellent performance of our utility operations and the organic growth from planned and approved infrastructure investments give us great confidence in our ability to achieve compound annual growth in earnings of 5% to 6% through 2018, again, off of our 2014 adjusted EPS of $2.03 per share. We expect EPS growth of 11% to 13% through 2018 from our U.S. operations, with 1% to 3% growth expected in the U.K. Vince will cover this in more detail during his remarks.
Turning to Slide 7. I'm also pleased to announce our board approved an increase in our common stock dividend, raising it from $1.51 to $1.52 per share on an annualized basis. This marks PPL's 14th dividend increase in 15 years. This is consistent with our prior guidance of a modest dividend increase in 2016 as we work our way into the mid-60 percent payout range. We expect to grow the dividend more meaningfully beginning in 2017, at which time we will target in the 4% range.
Now let's move to Slide 8 and highlight some of PPL's objectives in 2016. A primary objective of ours is executing on our planned capital investment program of $3.5 billion. This includes expenditures to strengthen transmission and distribution networks and to make continued environmental improvements in Kentucky.
In Pennsylvania, we're focused on advancing Project Compass, which is designed to provide significant benefits for electricity consumers in the Northeast. In October, we filed an interconnection request with the New York ISO to build the first segment of Project Compass, a 95-mile transmission line between Blakely, PA and Ramapo, New York. We expect to start the next step in approvals in the first quarter of 2016, New York's Article VII application process, which is a full siting and needs application.
We're also focused on completing our Northeast Pocono Transmission Line, a $350 million improvement project that includes 70 miles of new transmission lines, 3 new substations as well as additional improvements. We expect to conclude that project this May, which is about a year ahead of our original schedule.
In Kentucky, a major focus will be approval of compliance plans and cost recovery for the environmental construction projects that I highlighted earlier. Another key objective is to work with the state of Kentucky to address the Clean Power Plan in the best interest of our customers and our shareowners.
In the U.K., our team is focused on continued regulatory performance and adding to our long history of operational excellence. We'll also look to continue to hedge our 2018 British pound currency exposure beyond the 20% that we've been able to hedge to-date at or near our budgeted rate of $1.60 per pound. We built some capacity in our business plan to further hedge 2018 and at the current spot rate for the GP -- for the pound of about $1.46, we feel confident that we will be able to achieve our stated earnings growth rates through 2018.
Turning to Slide 9. We expect infrastructure investment to continue to drive rate base and EPS growth in the coming years. We plan to invest nearly $10 billion from 2016 through 2018 to modernize and strengthen our transmission and distribution systems and to address environmental regulations in Kentucky.
Constructive rate mechanisms in the premier jurisdictions where we operate allow near real-time recovery of much of that investment. More than 80% of our regulated capital expenditures are subject to minimal or no regulatory lag. Based on planned infrastructure spending, we expect our rate base to grow by $4.3 billion from 2015 to 2018. We expect compound annual EPS growth through 2018 of 5 to 6

for 2014 earnings from ongoing operations of $2.03 per share.
As you know, prior to the year-end 2015, passage of the PATH Act by Congress extended 50% bonus depreciation from 2015 through 2017, with a phase-out reduction and bonus to 40% in 2018 and 30% in 2019, with 0% thereafter. The impact of the bonus depreciation extension are factored in to our earnings projections. Vince will speak more about this in just a bit.
We're confident we will be able to achieve this growth rate given our low-risk business plan, the premium jurisdictions in which we operate and our demonstrated ability to manage our foreign currency exposure in the U.K.
I look forward to your questions after we hear some additional earnings details from Vince Sorgi. Vince?"

Go to Slide 11 for a review of segment earnings.Full year 2015 earnings from ongoing operations increased over the prior year from 2014 adjusted earnings of $2.03 per share to $2.21 per share, slightly ahead",2484,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Go to Slide 11 for a review of segment earnings.
Full year 2015 earnings from ongoing operations increased over the prior year from 2014 adjusted earnings of $2.03 per share to $2.21 per share, slightly ahead of the midpoint of our earnings guidance range. The main drivers of growth were higher earnings in the U.K. Regulated and Kentucky Regulated segments as well as lower costs in Corporate and Other, partially offset by lower earnings from the Pennsylvania Regulated segment. The favorable $0.10 in Corporate and Other is primarily driven by the corporate restructuring efforts.
Before I get into the segment details, let's briefly discuss the fourth quarter results as well as domestic weather for the year compared to the prior year and compared to our 2015 budget. Our fourth quarter earnings from ongoing operations decreased over last year by $0.06 per share, driven primarily by lower earnings from the U.K. Regulated segment as a result of transitioning to the RIIO-ED1 regulatory period. Pennsylvania Regulated and Kentucky Regulated segments were both slightly negative this year versus last, reflecting the impact of less favorable weather. And Corporate and Other was better this year, resulting from the corporate restructuring.
Overall, domestic weather was flat compared to the prior year and had a positive impact compared to budget by about $0.02. Favorable weather for the first 9 months of the year was partially offset by the warmer weather experienced primarily in December.
Let's move to a more detailed review of the 2015 segment earnings drivers, starting with the Pennsylvania results on Slide 12. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.37 per share in 2015, a $0.03 decrease compared to 2014. This decrease was due to higher O&M expenses as a result of higher service company allocations due to the spinoff of the supply business. And also, our strong performance throughout the year provided us the opportunity to take advantage of additional spending opportunities, focused primarily on improving grid reliability, which would benefit future periods. Depreciation was higher due to asset additions, and we had higher financing costs related to prior debt -- prior year debt issuances.
Partially offsetting these negative factors were higher margins from additional transmission investments and returns on distribution improvement capital investment and lower taxes, primarily due to the settlement of a 2011 gross receipts tax audit resulting in a $0.02 benefit this year.
Moving to Slide 13. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.51 per share in 2015, a $0.04 increase from 2014. This increase was due to higher gross margins, which is the net effect of electric and gas base rate increases effective July 1, 2015, and returns on additional environmental capital investments, partially offset by lower volumes due to warmer weather in November and December of this year compared to the prior year and lower industrial sales. And while the first quarter was colder than average, it was not as cold as the polar vortex-driven weather in 2014.
These net positive results were partially offset by higher O&M expenses, including costs associated with the retirement of the Cane Run coal-fired facility of $0.02 and higher financing costs related to the September 2015 debt issuances.
Moving to Slide 14. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $1.44 per share in 2015, a $0.07 improvement compared to 2014. This increase was due to lower U.S. income taxes, primarily from lower taxes on dividends in 2015 compared to 2014 and lower U.K. income taxes resulting from a lower effective tax rate in the U.K. due to a reduction in the statutory tax rate. Lower depreciation expense from the asset life extension we discussed earlier this year also contributed to the improvement, which was partially offset by increased depreciation from asset additions.
These increases were partially offset by lower gross margin as we transitioned to RIIO-ED1 on April 1 of this year, partially offset by the April 1, 2014 price increases and higher O&M expenses.
Before we move to the next slide, I wanted to mention that, similar to last year, we will provide you unaudited consolidated financial information for PPL Global LLC for 2015. We expect to furnish those statements separately in an 8-K to be filed at the time we file our 10-K in a couple of weeks.
Turning to Slide 15. We have prepared a walk from our 2015 ongoing earnings of $2.21 per share to the $2.35 per share midpoint of our 2016 earnings forecast.
Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment is forecast to contribute $0.10 to the improvement in 2016 earnings. This increase is primarily driven by the distribution base rate increase, which became effective January 1, 2016, and higher transmission margins and lower O&M. These positive drivers are expected to be partially offset by higher depreciation, higher financing costs to fund the capital growth in Pennsylvania and the tax benefit received in 2015 from the release of a gross receipt tax reserve.
Our Kentucky Regulated segment also projects higher earnings of $0.06 per share. This increase is primarily driven by realizing a full year of electric and gas base rate increases that became effective July 1, 2015, and higher returns on additional environmental capital investments and higher retail load at other margins. Higher margins are expected to be partially offset by higher depreciation on the increased planned [ph] service and higher interest expense to fund the capital growth in Kentucky.
In the U.K., we project slightly lower segment earnings due to higher financing costs, primarily from a full year of interest expense on the December 2015 debt issuances, higher depreciation expense from asset additions, higher taxes and other and unfavorable effects of foreign currency as we execute some 2016 restrikes to hedge 2018 earnings near our budgeted rate of $1.60. These negative drivers are partially offset by lower O&M, including pension expense, and higher gross margins from price increases.
Corporate and Other is expected to be relatively flat year-over-year, with slightly higher interest expense in 2016 driving the [indiscernible] decrease.
In addition, for the U.K. Regulated segment, you will see in the appendix on Slide 27 that we have provided one additional year of earnings projection. Our U.K. earnings guidance range for 2017 is $1.40 per share to $1.50 per share, with a midpoint of $1.45 per share.
Turning to Slide 16. As Bill mentioned earlier in the call, we are confident in our ability to achieve our 5% to 6% earnings growth targets through 2018, off of our 2014 adjusted ongoing earnings of $2.03 per share. We now expect 9% to 11% growth in our domestic utility earnings and approximately 2% growth coming from our corporate restructuring effort. And we increased our expectation slightly in our U.K. business over this time period to 1% to 3% growth, up from 1% to 2% growth. The 1% to 3% represents growth off of 2014 earnings of $1.37 per share, which incorporates the lower depreciation expense from the asset life extension and our updates on incentive revenues as well as lower net pension expense, in part due to updating our pension discount rate methodology to utilize the spot rate method recently approved by the SEC to measure both service cost and interest cost. This change in pension discount rate methodology was only applied to the U.K. pension plan, as the method we use in the U.S. to set our discount rate did not qualify for the spot rate method approved by the SEC.
Several key drivers to our organic growth in the domestic utility includes strong transmission rate base growth of 14% through 2018 in Pennsylvania. Favorable rate case outcomes contribute to our growth in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky. The successful execution of our CapEx plans is critical for all 3 of our business segments. We continue to assume minimal load growth over the period in both Kentucky and Pennsylvania.
Also included in our 5% to 6% earnings growth forecast is the full 5-year extension of bonus depreciation. As a reminder, when we updated our 2017 earnings growth target to 6% last quarter, we had assumed a 2-year extension of bonus depreciation. Incorporating the full 5 years of bonus depreciation did not have a significant incremental effect on our 2018 earnings.
While extending bonus depreciation is a net negative to earnings, it is positive from a credit perspective, especially in the back end of the planning period. Over the next 5 years, we expect bonus depreciation to reduce our federal cash tax position by about $270 million. And we do not expect to be a significant cash taxpayer through at least the next 5 years.
The increase in available cash combined with our stronger earnings growth has enabled us to reduce our equity needs from $200 million per year to $100 million per year and maintain our targeted credit metric.
For the U.K. Regulated segment, of course, executing on the Ofgem-accepted RIIO-ED1 business plan has been built into the growth assumptions and provides 8 years of base revenue certainty, with continued opportunity to outperform targets.
We have also assumed the budgeted currency rate of $1.56 per pound for 2016, $1.58 per pound for '17 and $1.60 per pound for 2018, which includes existing hedge positions.
The inflation rate used for the 2015/'16 regulatory year carriage [ph] was 2.6%, which will be trued-up for actual inflation in the 2017/'18 regulatory year.
We are now assuming the actual inflation rate for 2015/'16 will be 1.3%, and the adjustment to true-up the 2.6% down to the 1.3% has been included in our 2017 and '18 earnings forecasts and affects 2017 revenue by approximately $0.03 per share. We have provided additional details on the true-up mechanisms to base revenue on Slide 30 in the appendix.
Our RPI assumptions for 2016/'17 are now 2.3%; and 3.1% for '17/'18, consistent with the HM Treasury forecast.
We have increased our incentive revenue estimate for 2016 to the high end of our previous $120 million to $130 million range. We are assuming the same incentive revenues as last quarter for 2017 and 2018.
And finally, we are assuming an effective tax rate in the U.K. of about 17%.
For Corporate and Other, we have built into the growth rate achieving the full $75 million in corporate support cost savings and an additional $0.02 per share improvement by 2017.
On Slide 17, we're providing an update to our view of domestic cash flows for 2015 and 2016. As you can see in the table, we expect to have sufficient domestic cash flows to fund our maintenance capital and the common stock dividend, with almost $300 million left over in 2016 to fund dividend growth and growth CapEx.
We have no domestic debt maturities in 2016. So the debt and equity issuances in the U.S. will fund the rest of our growth CapEx.
Moving to Slide 18. Our planned capital expenditures for 2016 through 2020 are detailed on this slide, with regulated utility investment totaling about $16 billion over the period and about $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion per year. This includes previously announced initiatives such as U.K. spending for our accepted RIIO-ED1 business plan; executing on our environmental compliance plans in Kentucky to meet EPA regulations; updating and modernizing aging infrastructure in Pennsylvania, including programs that identify areas to strategically improve system performance and reliability; and this capital plan still excludes any impacts of the Clean Power Plan.
Moving to Slide 19. Our revised capital plan reflects generally the same spending levels in the U.K. as last year's plan, except for some slight increased spending on faults and overhead repairs in 2016.
We reduced investment of approximately $650 million in Kentucky as we deferred a projected Natural Gas Combined Cycle Plant. However, new gas-fired generation may ultimately be part of our Clean Power Plan compliance strategy, which, as noted on Slide 18, is not include in all projections. This was partially offset by additional reliability-based programs in the transmission and distribution businesses in Kentucky, while environmental spending has remained fairly consistent with the prior plan.
In Pennsylvania, we are experiencing higher than expected increases in reliability based on all the capital investment we've made to-date. As a result, we now believe we can achieve our targeted reliability with about $270 million less of distribution capital compared to last year's plan. Anticipated transmission spend remained relatively consistent with the prior plan. These investments are expected to result in additional improvements in reliability over the next 5 years.
And consistent with last year's plan, our capital plan is based on identified projects across the portfolio and does not include unidentified growth projects.
Turning to Slide 20. Our rate base is now expected to grow at a 5.3% CAGR over the next 5 years, which incorporates the 5-year extension of bonus depreciation and the deferral of the second Combined Cycle Gas Plant in Kentucky.
And finally, moving to Slide 21. On this slide, we provide an update to our GBP hedging status for 2016, '17 and '18, including sensitivities for $0.05, $0.10 and $0.15 downward movement in the exchange rate compared to our budgeted rate of $1.60 on our open position. We are 95% hedged for 2016 at an average rate of $1.56. For 2017, we have continued to layer on hedges during the quarter and have increased our hedge percentage from 66% at the end of the third quarter to 89% today at an average rate of $1.58.
You can see from the sensitivity table that there's no exposure for '16 and minimal exposure for 2017. 
We've also started to hedge our 2018 earnings and are now 20% hedged at an average rate of $1.60. It's important to note as well that included in our earnings guidance ranges is enough dry powder to hedge about 50% of our 2018 U.K. earnings. 
After we get about 50% hedged for 2018, our risk program would not require us to layer on additional hedges until about mid-2017. 
Switching to RPI. Also on this slide, we show our RPI sensitivity, which has been updated as well. 
As I discussed earlier, we are now incorporating a 1.3% RPI rate in our current 2015/'16 planning assumptions compared to the 2.6% included in our tariff.
Therefore, the 2017 RPI sensitivity for 0.5% downward movement in the '15/'16 RPI is now off the current budget of 1.3%. 
In November 2015, we set our 2016/'17 and 2017/'18 tariffs based on the forecasted RPI at that time, consistent with Ofgem's guidance. 
Now we have -- now that we've completed the tariff-setting process for the next 2 regulatory years, in November of 2016, only one additional year of tariffs, for 2018/'19, will be set based on the RPI forecast at that time. 
Overall, we're confident in our ability to manage our FX exposure, and we've incorporated the low RPI environment into our earnings growth projections. 
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call over to Bill for the Q&A period. Bill?"

We raised our guidance on U.K. incentive revenue. We lowered our exposure to the pound. We've signaled meaningful increases in our dividend growth, and we've lowered our equity needs. I can't think of another company that has accomplished so much in such a short period of time.

Our assets are diverse. We operate in premium jurisdictions, continuing to invest heavily in our businesses to improve service for customers, as well as grow value for shareowners.

With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; and the Presidents of our U.S. and U.K. utility businesses. 
Moving to Slide 3, our agenda this morning starts with a discussion of our 2016 ongoing earnings forecast, an overview of our first quarter 2016 earnings results, and an operational overview. Following my remarks, Robert Symons, Chief Executive of our Western Power Distribution subsidiary, will provide an update on expected U.K. incentive revenues for 2017 and 2018, which we are increasing today. And Robert will also provide a general update on the completion of our first year under RIIO-ED1. Vince will then review our segment financials and provide a more detailed financial overview.
Let's move to Slide 4 for discussion of our 2016 earnings forecast. As we note on this slide, we are reaffirming our 2016 forecast of $2.25 to $2.45 per share. The midpoint of this range $2.35 per share represents growth of 6.3% compared to 2015 earnings from ongoing operations. Our first quarter results were in line with our expectations, and we remain on track to deliver on this forecast despite the warmer than normal weather we experienced across our service territories to start this year. The significant investments we continue to make to build tomorrow's energy infrastructure, coupled with our ability to begin recovering more than 80% of that investment in near real time will drive our long-term sustainable growth. We expect to achieve compound annual EPS growth through 2018 of 5% to 6% off of our adjusted 2014 earnings from ongoing operations of $2.03 per share. We continue to expect strong EPS growth of 11% to 13% through 2018 from our U.S. operations with 1% to 3% growth expected in the the U.K. 
Turning to Slide 5. Today, we announced first quarter 2016 reported earnings of $0.71 per share compared with $0.96 per share from our first quarter 2015 results. Adjusting for special items, first quarter 2016 earnings from ongoing operations were $0.67 per share compared with $0.77 per share a year ago. As expected, we saw a decline in earnings from ongoing operations in the first quarter as a result of lower earnings in the U.K. This stemmed from lower revenues due to the new price control period that began on April 1 of 2015. Higher domestic margins from rate increases at our Kentucky and Pennsylvania businesses were partially offset by lower sales volumes due to milder winter weather. Vince will go into greater detail in first quarter results a little later in the call, including a discussion of the timing of our U.K. earnings. As Vince will discuss, we did expect variability between quarters, with increased earnings weighted towards the back half of this year. 
Now let's move to Slide 6 for an update on our utility operations. This month, PPL Electric Utilities energized its northeast transmission line a year ahead of schedule. The project includes 60 miles of new transmission lines, 3 new substations and additional improvements focused on making the grid more reliable, resilient and secure. We are confident this line will deliver significant benefits for our customers. Completing major transmission project like this one or like the Susquehanna-Roseland line we completed last spring, takes expertise in construction and project management. It also requires working closely with the public and coordinating with various permitting agencies. We shown our ability to excel in these areas and deliver successful outcomes for our customers and our share owners. 
Turning to Kentucky, Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities continue to invest in environmental upgrades at existing generation facilities, while strengthening the diversity of our generation fleet. In late January, we environmental compliance and cost recovery plans with the Kentucky Public Service Commission, seeking approval and environmental cost recovery for $1 billion in upcoming environmental improvement projects. These projects are largely aimed at ensuring compliance with the EPA's new coal combustion residual tools, which took effect last year. The projects will involve capping and closing remaining ASH ponds at our Cornwall power plants, building process facilities and completing the second phase of a dry storage landfill project at our E.W. Brown generating station. The application review process before the Kentucky Public Service Commission is proceeding as we would expect. We expect to begin investments in these environmental improvements in the second half of 2016, and those will continue through 2023. 
In addition, we are on track to complete the final installation at our Mill Creek generating station by June. This follows previous installations of baghouses at our Trimble County and E.W. Brown generating stations. We also expect to complete Kentucky's largest solar facility in June. The 10-megawatt facility under construction at our E.W. Brown generating facility represents a cost-effective way to expand the benefits of solar to all customers. While portions of the project continue, we began generating our first solar power from the facility on April 14. 
Moving to the U.K. We continue to achieve strong performance against our RIIO-ED1 incentive targets, and Robert will now discuss that in more detail. Robert?"

March 31, 2016, marked the end of the first full regulatory year under RIIO-ED1, and we are pleased to be providing an update on our full year performance against the RIIO-ED1 incentive targets. Befo",509,"Many thanks, Bill, and good morning. Moving to Slide 7. March 31, 2016, marked the end of the first full regulatory year under RIIO-ED1, and we are pleased to be providing an update on our full year performance against the RIIO-ED1 incentive targets. Before I go into the details, I'd like to review a few key points of the incentive framework. The primary incentive mechanisms that contribute to incentive revenues include the interruption incentive schemes and the broad measure of customer satisfaction. Interruption incentive schemes include Customer Interruptions and Customer Minutes Lost. The measure of customer satisfaction measures the performance of customer satisfaction on a scale from 1 to 10 against the targets established with customers experiencing interruptions, requesting a connection or making a general inquiry. Both of these incentive mechanisms are designed to encourage D&Os to invest and operate their networks so as to reduce both the frequency and duration of power outages. 
Turning to Slide 8. On this slide, you will find our full year results against the performance targets set by Ofgem for regulatory year 2015 and 2016. WPD has improved Customer Minutes Lost and Customer Interruptions performance metrics by approximately 8% over the 2014 throughout 2015 regulatory year, which resulted in earnings of 77% of the maximum potential payout. This year, our operational efforts contributing to the success included several major asset replacement projects, significant rural network automation and outperforming previous year's reliability performance. As it relates to broad measure of customer satisfaction, WPD has also received reaccreditation to the U.K. Government sponsored customer service excellence standard once again achieved the highest level of compliance, which further demonstrates our continued commitment to excellent customer service. As shown back on Slide 7 and based on our better-than-expected performance quality of service and customer satisfaction, we now expect to achieve $115 million in total incentive revenue in calendar year 2017, above our prior range of $90 million to $110 million for 2017. As a reminder, these incentive revenues, while earned during 2015, 2016 regulatory year will be received in 2017, '18 regulatory year. These amounts internal estimates until final determination is received from Ofgem in November 2016. We expect these favorable results to continue into the next regulatory year even with targets that get progressively tougher, we are increasing our guidance range from $75 million to $105 million in incentive revenues in calendar year 2019 to $85 million to $115 million. 
Overall, the first year of RIIO-ED1 is broadly in line with our published business plan as accepted by Ofgem. We are focused on delivering excellent customer service, achieving the outputs and incentives while delivering safe, reliable and sustainable network service. We've been also recognized by Ofgem for our innovative work on providing quicker and alternative network connections for solar, and we continue to hold stakeholder workshops reviewing our results from the first year of RIIO-ED1, while planning for the future by discussing long-term strategic priorities, such as reporting smart networks and affordability.

Let's move to Slide 10. Our first quarter regulated utility earnings from ongoing operations decreased from last year, driven primarily by expected lower U.K. regulated segment earnings as a result of the April 1, 2015, price decrease, as we began our first year under the RIIO-ED1 framework and the impacts of foreign currency, offset by an improvement in the Pennsylvania Regulated segment, while the Kentucky Regulated segment and corporate and other remained flat compared to a year ago. 
Let's briefly discuss domestic weather for the first quarter compared to last year and compared to plan. My old temperatures during the first quarter of 2016 had an unfavorable impact for our domestic segment,  a total of $0.04 compared to the prior year, was $0.02 in Pennsylvania and $0.02 in Kentucky. Compared to our plan, weather had a negative $0.02 impact with $0.01 impact in each of the domestic segments. Heating degree days were about 11% lower-than-normal in the first quarter of 2016 for both Kentucky and Pennsylvania. While weather in the U.K. was also unfavorable to plan in the prior year with Q1 being the mild this winter recorded history for the U.K., it was not a primary driver of our results for the U.K. segment. And as Bill mentioned in his remarks, despite this unfavorable weather for Q1, we remain confident that we will continue to meet our 2016 earnings guidance of $2.25 to $2.45 per share. 
Let's move to a more detailed review in the first quarter segment earnings drivers, starting with the Pennsylvania results on Slide 11. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.14 per share in the first quarter of 2016, a $0.01 increase compared to the same period last year. This increase was due to higher gross margins due to higher distribution margins as a result of the 2015 rate case that became effective January 1, 2016, and higher transmission margins due to additional capital investments, partially offset by lower volumes due to unfavorable weather. Higher margins were partially offset by higher O&M, primarily due to higher support costs and maintenance-related work, mostly attributable to timing. 
Moving to Slide 12. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.16 per share in the first quarter of 2016, flat compared to a year ago. This result was due to a lower O&M, primarily due to the closure of the Cane Run and Green River coal stations in 2015, offset by higher financing costs due to higher debt balances to fund CapEx. Higher gross margins from higher base rates that went into effect July 1 of last year were offset by lower sales volumes, primarily due to the less favorable weather. 
Turning to Slide 13. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.39 per share in the first quarter 2016, and $0.11 decrease compared to last year, primarily driven by lower prices in RIIO-ED1 and the effects of foreign currency. In our plan, we had expected about $0.10 decrease year-over-year for Q1, so the actual results are consistent with our expectations. I'll provide additional details on the shape of our 2016 U.K. earnings forecast after I walk through the quarter compared to last quarter's results. The quarter-on-quarter decrease was due to lower gross margins resulting from lower prices as we transitioned to RIIO-ED1 on April 1, 2015, of about $0.08 per share, an unfavorable effects of foreign currency of about $0.03 per share, which included some 2016 executed during the quarter to hedge 2018 earnings. The other variances for the U.K. were not significant and offset each other. 
So taking a closer look at our full year U.K. segment forecast. As noted on our year-end earnings call, and the 2016 ongoing earnings update that Bill just provided, we are projecting a $0.01 decrease in U.K. segment earnings year-over-year. However, there is significant variability between the quarters with lower earnings in Q1 and Q2 and higher earnings in Q3 and Q4. We expect lower margins in the first half of the year as a result of the RIIO-ED1 revenue reset. That revenue reset occurred at the beginning of the regulatory year on April 1, 2015. And since we report WPD on a 1-month lag, we will still see some effect of that revenue reset continuing into the second quarter, an additional $0.02 per share about the $0.08 for Q1. This decrease is expected to be primarily offset by the price increase beginning April 1, 2016, and allowed revenues under the RIIO-ED1 and from the recovery of prior customer rebates beginning April 1, 2016, through March 31, 2017, which will positively impact 2016 earnings by about $0.05. We also expect this revenue recovery to positively affect 2017 earnings by another $0.02 to $0.03. 
In addition, we are projecting lower O&M expenses in the back half of the year, primarily related to higher vegetation management in Q4 of last year and lower-than-expected pension expense in 2016. All of these factors contributed to the shaping of our earnings for the U.K. this year compared to last year. 
Moving to Slide 14. On this slide, we'll provide an update to our GBP hedging status for 2016, '17 and '18, including sensitivities $0.25, $0.10 and $0.15 downward movement in the rate compared to our budgeted rate of $1.60 on opening positions. First, we are 93% hedged for the remainder of 2016 at an average rate of $1.54. For 2017, we're still hedged at 89% at an average rate of $1.58. And for 2018, we've continued to layer on hedges during the quarter and have increased our hedge percentage from 20% at year-end to 41% today, at an average rate of $1.56. You can see from the sensitivity table that there's minimal exposure in '16 and '17, and about $0.03 of exposure in 2018 for every $0.05 below our budgeted rate of $1.60. As I mentioned during our year-end call, our business plan provided enough capacity to hedge about 50% of our 2018 U.K. earnings exposure through restrikes. However, at this point, we will refrain from adding additional 2018 hedges until after the U.K. referendum vote on June 23. 
Moving to Slide 15. On this slide, we are providing an update on RPI. Now that 2015, '16 regulatory year has concluded, the final RPI rate was 1.1% and was based on the Office of National Statistics average RPI index from April 2015 through March 2016. If you recall, in the third quarter of 2015, we had incorporated a 1.3% RPI rate in our 2015/'16 planning assumptions compared to the 2.6% included in our tariffs. That true-up will flow through in our revenues in 2017 and 2018, and is already in incorporated in our earnings growth projections. These additional downside from our budgeted 1.3% rate will not have a material impact on earnings in either 2017 or 2018. Our planning assumptions for 2016/'17, 2018, '17/'18 and '18/'19 have not changed since our year-end update and as you can see the current forecast from the Treasury for all periods are in line with our current assumptions. That concludes my prepared remarks. And I'll turn call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period."

With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; and the presidents of our U.S. and U.K. utility businesses.
Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda this morning starts with the discussion of our 2016 ongoing earnings forecast, an overview of our first quarter 2016 earnings results and an operational overview. Following my remarks, Robert Symons, Chief Executive of our Western Power Distribution subsidiary, will provide an update on expected U.K. incentive revenues for 2017 and 2018, which we are increasing today. And Robert will also provide a general update on the completion of our first year under RIIO-ED1. Vince will then review our segment financials and provide a more detailed financial overview.
Let's move to Slide 4 for a discussion of our 2016 earnings forecast. As we note on this slide, we are reaffirming our 2016 forecast of $2.25 to $2.45 per share. The midpoint of this range, $2.35 per share, represents growth of 6.3% compared to 2015 earnings from ongoing operations.
Our first quarter results were in line with our expectations, and we remain on track to deliver on this forecast despite the warmer than normal weather we experienced across our service territories to start this year. The significant investments we continue to make to build tomorrow's energy infrastructure coupled with our ability to begin recovering more than 80% of that investment in near real time will drive our long-term sustainable growth.
We expect to achieve compound annual EPS growth through 2018 of 5% to 6% off of our adjusted 2014 earnings from ongoing operations of $2.03 per share. We continue to expect strong EPS growth of 11% to 13% through 2018 from our U.S. operations with 1% to 3% growth expected in the U.K.
Turning to Slide 5. Today, we announced first quarter 2016 reported earnings of $0.71 per share compared with $0.96 per share from our first quarter 2015 results. Adjusting for special items, first quarter 2016 earnings from ongoing operations were $0.67 per share compared with $0.77 per share a year ago. As expected, we saw a decline in earnings from ongoing operations in the first quarter as a result of lower earnings in the U.K. This stemmed from lower revenues due to the new price control period that began on April 1 of 2015.
Higher domestic margins from rate increases at our Kentucky and Pennsylvania businesses were partially offset by lower sales volumes due to milder winter weather. Vince will go into greater detail on first quarter results a little later in the call, including a discussion of the timing of our U.K. earnings. As Vince will discuss, we did expect variability between quarters with increased earnings weighted towards the back half of this year.
Now let's move to Slide 6 for an update on our utility operations. This month, PPL Electric Utilities energized its Northeast Pocono Transmission Line a year ahead of schedule. The project includes 60 miles of new transmission lines, 3 new substations and additional improvements focused on making the grid more reliable, resilient and secure. We're confident this line will deliver significant benefits for our customers. Completing major transmission project like this one or like the Susquehanna-Roseland line we completed last spring takes expertise in construction and project management. It also requires working closely with the public and coordinating with various permitting agencies. We shown our ability to excel in these areas and deliver successful outcomes for our customers and our share owners.
Turning to Kentucky. Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities continue to invest in environmental upgrades at existing generation facilities while strengthening the diversity of our generation fleet. In late January, we filed environmental compliance and cost recovery plans with the Kentucky Public Service Commission, seeking approval and environmental cost recovery for $1 billion in upcoming environmental improvement projects.
These projects are largely aimed at ensuring compliance with the EPA's new coal combustion residuals rule, which took effect the last year. The projects will involve capping and closing remaining ash ponds at our coal-fired power plants, building process water facilities and completing the second phase of a dry storage landfill project at our E.W. Brown generating station. The application review process before the Kentucky Public Service Commission is proceeding as we would expect. We expect to begin investments in these environmental improvements in the second half of 2016, and those will continue through 2023.
In addition, we're on track to complete the final baghouse installation at our Mill Creek generating station by June. This follows previous installations of baghouses at our Trimble County and E.W. Brown generating stations.
We also expect to complete Kentucky's largest solar facility in June. The 10-megawatt facility under construction at our E.W. Brown generating facility represents a cost-effective way to extend the benefits of solar to all customers. While portions of the project continue, we began generating our first solar power from the facility on April 14.
Moving to the U.K. We continue to achieve strong performance against our RIIO-ED1 incentive targets, and Robert will now discuss that in more detail. Robert?"

March 31, 2016 marked the end of the first full regulatory year under RIIO-ED1, and we are pleased to be providing an update on our full year performance against the RIIO-ED1 incentive targets.Befo",516,"Many thanks, Bill, and good morning. Moving to Slide 7. March 31, 2016 marked the end of the first full regulatory year under RIIO-ED1, and we are pleased to be providing an update on our full year performance against the RIIO-ED1 incentive targets.
Before I go into the details, I would like to review a few key points of the incentive framework. The primary incentive mechanisms that contribute to incentive revenues include the interruption incentive schemes and the broad measure of customer satisfaction. Interruption incentive schemes include customer interruptions and customer minutes lost. The broad measure of customer satisfaction measures the performance of customer satisfaction on a scale from 1 to 10 against the targets Ofgem has established with customers experiencing interruptions, requesting a connection or making a general inquiry. Both of these incentive mechanisms are designed to encourage D&Os to invest and operate their networks so as to reduce both the frequency and duration of power outages.
Turning to Slide 8. On this slide, you will find our full year results against the performance targets set by Ofgem for the regulatory year 2015 to 2016. WPD has improved customer minutes lost and customer interruptions performance metrics by approximately 8% over the 2014 through '15 regulatory year, which resulted in earning 77% of the maximum potential payout. This year, our operational efforts contributing to the success included several major asset replacement projects, significant rural network automation and outperforming previous year's reliability performance.
As it relates to broad measure of customer satisfaction, WPD has also received reaccreditation to the U.K. government-sponsored Customer Service Excellence Standard and has once again achieved the highest level of compliance, which further demonstrates our continued commitment to excellent customer service. As shown back on Slide 7 and based on our better-than-expected performance for quality of service and customer satisfaction, we now expect to achieve $115 million in total incentive revenue in calendar year 2017, above our prior range of $90 million to $110 million for 2017.
As a reminder, these incentive revenues, while earned during the 2015/'16 regulatory year will be received in the 2017/'18 regulatory year. These amounts are internal estimates until final determination is received from Ofgem in November 2016. We expect these favorable results to continue into the next regulatory year. Even with targets that get progressively tougher, we are increasing our guidance range from $75 million to $105 million in incentive revenues in calendar year 2018 to $85 million to $115 million.
Overall, the first year of RIIO-ED1 is broadly in line with our published business plan as accepted by Ofgem. We are focused on delivering excellent customer service, achieving the outputs and incentives while delivering safe, reliable and sustainable network service. We've been also recognized by Ofgem for our innovative work on providing quicker and alternative network connections for solar, and we continue to hold stakeholder workshops reviewing our results from the first year of RIIO-ED1, while planning for the future by discussing long-term strategic priorities, such as reporting smart networks and affordability.
Vince will now walk you through a more detailed look at segment earnings. Vince?"

Let's move to Slide 10.Our first quarter regulated utility earnings from ongoing operations decreased from last year driven primarily by expected lower U.K. Regulated segment earnings as a result of the Apr",1191,"Thank you, Robert, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 10.
Our first quarter regulated utility earnings from ongoing operations decreased from last year driven primarily by expected lower U.K. Regulated segment earnings as a result of the April 1, 2015, price decrease as we began our first year under the RIIO-ED1 framework and the impacts of foreign currency, offset by an improvement in the Pennsylvania Regulated segment while the Kentucky Regulated segment and Corporate and Other remained flat compared to a year ago.
Let's briefly discuss domestic weather for the first quarter compared to last year and compared to plan. Mild temperatures during the first quarter of 2016 had an unfavorable impact for our domestic segment, a total of $0.04 compared to the prior year with $0.02 in Pennsylvania and $0.02 in Kentucky. Compared to our plan, weather had a negative $0.02 impact with $0.01 impact in each of the domestic segments.
Heating degree days were about 11% lower than normal in the first quarter 2016 for both Kentucky and Pennsylvania. While weather in the U.K. was also unfavorable to plan and the prior year with Q1 being the mildest winter in recorded history for the U.K., it was not a primary driver of our results for the U.K. segment. And as Bill mentioned in his remarks, despite this unfavorable weather for Q1, we remain confident that we will continue to meet our 2016 earnings guidance of $2.25 to $2.45 per share.
Let's move to a more detailed review of the first quarter segment earnings drivers, starting with the Pennsylvania results on Slide 11.
Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.14 per share in the first quarter 2016, a $0.01 increase compared to the same period last year. This increase was due to higher gross margins due to higher distribution margins as a result of the 2015 rate case that became effective January 1, 2016, and higher transmission margins due to additional capital investments, partially offset by lower volumes due to unfavorable weather. Higher margins were partially offset by higher O&M primarily due to higher support costs and maintenance-related work mostly attributable to timing.
Moving to Slide 12. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.16 per share in the first quarter of 2016, flat compared to a year ago. This result was due to lower O&M primarily due to the closure of the Cane Run and Green River coal stations in 2015, offset by higher financing costs due to higher debt balances to fund CapEx. Higher gross margins from higher base rates that went into effect July 1 of last year were offset by lower sales volumes primarily due to the less favorable weather.
Turning to Slide 13. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.39 per share in the first quarter 2016, an $0.11 decrease compared to last year primarily driven by lower prices in RIIO-ED1 and the effects of foreign currency. In our plan, we had expected about a $0.10 decrease year-over-year for Q1, so the actual results are consistent with our expectations. I'll provide additional details on the shape of our 2016 U.K. earnings forecast after I walk through the quarter compared to last quarter's results.
The quarter-on-quarter decrease was due to lower gross margins resulting from lower prices as we transitioned to RIIO-ED1 on April 1, 2015, of about $0.08 per share; and unfavorable effects of foreign currency of about $0.03 per share, which included some 2016 restrikes executed during the quarter to hedge 2018 earnings. The other variances for the U.K. were not significant and offset each other.
So taking a closer look at our full year U.K. segment forecast. As noted on our year-end earnings call and the 2016 ongoing earnings update that Bill just provided, we are projecting a $0.01 decrease in U.K. segment earnings year-over-year. However, there is significant variability between the quarters with lower earnings in Q1 and Q2 and higher earnings in Q3 and Q4. We expect lower margins in the first half of the year as a result of the RIIO-ED1 revenue reset. That revenue reset occurred at the beginning of the regulatory year on April 1, 2015. And since we report WPD on a 1-month lag, we will still see some effect of that revenue reset continue into the second quarter, an additional $0.02 per share above the $0.08 for Q1.
This decrease is expected to be primarily offset by the price increase beginning April 1, 2016, and allowed revenues under the RIIO-ED1 framework and from the recovery of prior customer rebates beginning April 1, 2016 through March 31, 2017, which will positively impact 2016 earnings by about $0.05. We also expect this revenue recovery to positively affect 2017 earnings by another $0.02 to $0.03. In addition, we are projecting lower O&M expenses in the back half of the year primarily related to higher vegetation management in Q4 of last year and lower expected pension expense in 2016. All of these factors contribute to the shaping of our earnings for the U.K. this year compared to last year.
Moving to Slide 14. On this slide we provide an update to our GBP hedging status for 2016, '17 and '18, including sensitivities for a $0.05, $0.10 and $0.15 downward movement in the exchange rate compared to our budgeted rate of $1.60 on open positions.
First, we are 93% hedged for the remainder of 2016 at an average rate of $1.54. For 2017, we're still hedged at 89% at an average rate of $1.58. And for 2018, we've continued to layer on hedges during the quarter and have increased our hedge percentage from 20% at year-end to 41% today at an average rate of $1.56. You can see from the sensitivity table that there's minimal exposure in '16 and '17 and about $0.03 of exposure in 2018 for every $0.05 below our budgeted rate of $1.60.
As I mentioned during our year-end call, our business plan provided enough capacity to hedge about 50% of our 2018 U.K. earnings exposure through restrikes. However, at this point we will refrain from adding additional 2018 hedges until after the U.K. referendum vote on June 23.
Moving to Slide 15. On this slide we are providing an update on RPI. Now that 2015/'16 regulatory year has concluded, the final RPI rate was 1.1% and was based on the Office of National Statistics average RPI index from April 2015 through March 2016. If you recall in the third quarter of 2015, we had incorporated a 1.3% RPI rate in our 2015/'16 planning assumptions compared to the 2.6% included in our tariffs. That true-up will flow through allowed revenues in 2017 and 2018 and has already been incorporated in our earnings growth projections. The additional downside from our budgeted 1.3% rate will not have a material impact on earnings in either 2017 or 2018. Our planning assumptions for 2016/'17, '17/'18 and '18/'19 have not changed since our year-end update and as you can see, the current forecast from the HM Treasury for all periods are in line with our current assumptions.
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period."

I'd like to first summarize by saying that we remain confident in where we're headed. We're solidly on track to deliver on our earnings forecast for 2016, and we expect to deliver compound annual EPS growth of 5% to 6% through 2018. We're pleased the WPD team has had such a successful first year under RIIO-ED1 and have outperformed incentive expectations. As Robert mentioned earlier, we are raising our expectation for incentive revenues from $90 million to $110 million to $115 million for 2017 and from $75 million to $105 million to $85 million to $115 million for 2018. This level of performance is consistent with WPD's long history of operational excellence.
Across all of our businesses, we continue to invest in tomorrow's energy infrastructure, the strength and the diversity of our generation fleet and to drive continuous improvements aimed at exceeding customer expectations and delivering power safely, reliably and affordably.

Good morning, everyone. We're pleased that you've joined us this morning. With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; and the presidents of our U.S. and U.K. utility businesses.
Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda this morning starts with the discussion of our 2016 ongoing earnings forecast, an overview of our first quarter 2016 earnings results and an operational overview. Following my remarks, Robert Symons, Chief Executive of our Western Power Distribution subsidiary, will provide an update on expected U.K. incentive revenues for 2017 and 2018, which we are increasing today. And Robert will also provide a general update on the completion of our first year under RIIO-ED1. Vince will then review our segment financials and provide a more detailed financial overview.
Let's move to Slide 4 for a discussion of our 2016 earnings forecast. As we note on this slide, we are reaffirming our 2016 forecast of $2.25 to $2.45 per share. The midpoint of this range, $2.35 per share, represents growth of 6.3% compared to 2015 earnings from ongoing operations.
Our first quarter results were in line with our expectations, and we remain on track to deliver on this forecast despite the warmer than normal weather we experienced across our service territories to start this year. The significant investments we continue to make to build tomorrow's energy infrastructure coupled with our ability to begin recovering more than 80% of that investment in near real time will drive our long-term sustainable growth.
We expect to achieve compound annual EPS growth through 2018 of 5% to 6% off of our adjusted 2014 earnings from ongoing operations of $2.03 per share. We continue to expect strong EPS growth of 11% to 13% through 2018 from our U.S. operations with 1% to 3% growth expected in the U.K.
Turning to Slide 5. Today, we announced first quarter 2016 reported earnings of $0.71 per share compared with $0.96 per share from our first quarter 2015 results. Adjusting for special items, first quarter 2016 earnings from ongoing operations were $0.67 per share compared with $0.77 per share a year ago. As expected, we saw a decline in earnings from ongoing operations in the first quarter as a result of lower earnings in the U.K. This stemmed from lower revenues due to the new price control period that began on April 1 of 2015.
Higher domestic margins from rate increases at our Kentucky and Pennsylvania businesses were partially offset by lower sales volumes due to milder winter weather. Vince will go into greater detail on first quarter results a little later in the call, including a discussion of the timing of our U.K. earnings. As Vince will discuss, we did expect variability between quarters with increased earnings weighted towards the back half of this year.
Now let's move to Slide 6 for an update on our utility operations. This month, PPL Electric Utilities energized its Northeast Pocono Transmission Line a year ahead of schedule. The project includes 60 miles of new transmission lines, 3 new substations and additional improvements focused on making the grid more reliable, resilient and secure. We're confident this line will deliver significant benefits for our customers. Completing major transmission project like this one or like the Susquehanna-Roseland line we completed last spring takes expertise in construction and project management. It also requires working closely with the public and coordinating with various permitting agencies. We've shown our ability to excel in these areas and deliver successful outcomes for our customers and our share owners.
Turning to Kentucky. Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities continue to invest in environmental upgrades at existing generation facilities while strengthening the diversity of our generation fleet. In late January, we filed environmental compliance and cost recovery plans with the Kentucky Public Service Commission, seeking approval and environmental cost recovery for $1 billion in upcoming environmental improvement projects.
These projects are largely aimed at ensuring compliance with the EPA's new coal combustion residuals rule, which took effect the last year. The projects will involve capping and closing remaining ash ponds at our coal-fired power plants, building process water facilities and completing the second phase of a dry storage landfill project at our E.W. Brown generating station. The application review process before the Kentucky Public Service Commission is proceeding as we would expect. We expect to begin investments in these environmental improvements in the second half of 2016, and those will continue through 2023.
In addition, we're on track to complete the final baghouse installation at our Mill Creek generating station by June. This follows previous installations of baghouses at our Trimble County and E.W. Brown generating stations.
We also expect to complete Kentucky's largest solar facility in June. The 10-megawatt facility under construction at our E.W. Brown generating facility represents a cost-effective way to extend the benefits of solar to all customers. While portions of the project continue, we began generating our first solar power from the facility on April 14.
Moving to the U.K. We continue to achieve strong performance against our RIIO-ED1 incentive targets, and Robert will now discuss that in more detail. Robert?"

March 31, 2016 marked the end of the first full regulatory year under RIIO-ED1, and we are pleased to be providing an update on our full year performance against the RIIO-ED1 incentive targets.Befo",516,"Many thanks, Bill, and good morning. Moving to Slide 7. March 31, 2016 marked the end of the first full regulatory year under RIIO-ED1, and we are pleased to be providing an update on our full year performance against the RIIO-ED1 incentive targets.
Before I go into the details, I would like to review a few key points of the incentive framework. The primary incentive mechanisms that contribute to incentive revenues include the interruption incentive schemes and the broad measure of customer satisfaction. Interruption incentive schemes include customer interruptions and customer minutes lost. The broad measure of customer satisfaction measures the performance of customer satisfaction on a scale from 1 to 10 against the targets Ofgem has established with customers experiencing interruptions, requesting a connection or making a general inquiry. Both of these incentive mechanisms are designed to encourage D&Os to invest and operate their networks so as to reduce both the frequency and duration of power outages.
Turning to Slide 8. On this slide, you will find our full year results against the performance targets set by Ofgem for the regulatory year 2015 to 2016. WPD has improved customer minutes lost and customer interruptions performance metrics by approximately 8% over the 2014 through '15 regulatory year, which resulted in earning 77% of the maximum potential payout. This year, our operational efforts contributing to the success included several major asset replacement projects, significant rural network automation and outperforming previous year's reliability performance.
As it relates to broad measure of customer satisfaction, WPD has also received reaccreditation to the U.K. government-sponsored Customer Service Excellence Standard and has once again achieved the highest level of compliance, which further demonstrates our continued commitment to excellent customer service. As shown back on Slide 7 and based on our better-than-expected performance for quality of service and customer satisfaction, we now expect to achieve $115 million in total incentive revenue in calendar year 2017, above our prior range of $90 million to $110 million for 2017.
As a reminder, these incentive revenues, while earned during the 2015/'16 regulatory year will be received in the 2017/'18 regulatory year. These amounts are internal estimates until final determination is received from Ofgem in November 2016.
We expect these favorable results to continue into the next regulatory year. Even with targets that get progressively tougher, we are increasing our guidance range from $75 million to $105 million in incentive revenues in calendar year 2018 to $85 million to $115 million.
Overall, the first year of RIIO-ED1 is broadly in line with our published business plan as accepted by Ofgem. We are focused on delivering excellent customer service, achieving the outputs and incentives while delivering safe, reliable and sustainable network service. We've been also recognized by Ofgem for our innovative work on providing quicker and alternative network connections for solar, and we continue to hold stakeholder workshops reviewing our results from the first year of RIIO-ED1, while planning for the future by discussing long-term strategic priorities, such as reporting smart networks and affordability.
Vince will now walk you through a more detailed look at segment earnings. Vince?"

Let's move to Slide 10.Our first quarter regulated utility earnings from ongoing operations decreased from last year driven primarily by expected lower U.K. Regulated segment earnings as a result of the Apr",1191,"Thank you, Robert, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 10.
Our first quarter regulated utility earnings from ongoing operations decreased from last year driven primarily by expected lower U.K. Regulated segment earnings as a result of the April 1, 2015, price decrease as we began our first year under the RIIO-ED1 framework and the effects of foreign currency, offset by an improvement in the Pennsylvania Regulated segment while the Kentucky Regulated segment and Corporate and Other remained flat compared to a year ago.
Let's briefly discuss domestic weather for the first quarter compared to last year and compared to plan. Mild temperatures during the first quarter of 2016 had an unfavorable impact for our domestic segment, a total of $0.04 compared to the prior year with $0.02 in Pennsylvania and $0.02 in Kentucky. Compared to our plan, weather had a negative $0.02 impact with $0.01 impact in each of the domestic segments.
Heating degree days were about 11% lower than normal in the first quarter 2016 for both Kentucky and Pennsylvania. While weather in the U.K. was also unfavorable to plan and the prior year with Q1 being the mildest winter in recorded history for the U.K., it was not a primary driver of our results for the U.K. segment. And as Bill mentioned in his remarks, despite this unfavorable weather for Q1, we remain confident that we will continue to meet our 2016 earnings guidance of $2.25 to $2.45 per share.
Let's move to a more detailed review of the first quarter segment earnings drivers, starting with the Pennsylvania results on Slide 11.
Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.14 per share in the first quarter 2016, a $0.01 increase compared to the same period last year. This increase was due to higher gross margins due to higher distribution margins as a result of the 2015 rate case that became effective January 1, 2016, and higher transmission margins due to additional capital investments, partially offset by lower volumes due to unfavorable weather. Higher margins were partially offset by higher O&M primarily due to higher support costs and maintenance-related work mostly attributable to timing.
Moving to Slide 12. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.16 per share in the first quarter of 2016, flat compared to a year ago. This result was due to lower O&M primarily due to the closure of the Cane Run and Green River coal stations in 2015, offset by higher financing costs due to higher debt balances to fund CapEx. Higher gross margins from higher base rates that went into effect July 1 of last year were offset by lower sales volumes primarily due to the less favorable weather.
Turning to Slide 13. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.39 per share in the first quarter 2016, an $0.11 decrease compared to last year primarily driven by lower prices in RIIO-ED1 and the effects of foreign currency. In our plan, we had expected about a $0.10 decrease year-over-year for Q1, so the actual results are consistent with our expectations. I'll provide additional details on the shape of our 2016 U.K. earnings forecast after I walk through the quarter compared to last quarter's results.
The quarter-on-quarter decrease was due to lower gross margins resulting from lower prices as we transitioned to RIIO-ED1 on April 1, 2015, of about $0.08 per share; and unfavorable effects of foreign currency of about $0.03 per share, which included some 2016 restrikes executed during the quarter to hedge 2018 earnings. The other variances for the U.K. were not significant and offset each other.
So taking a closer look at our full year U.K. segment forecast. As noted on our year-end earnings call and the 2016 ongoing earnings update that Bill just provided, we are projecting a $0.01 decrease in U.K. segment earnings year-over-year. However, there is significant variability between the quarters with lower earnings in Q1 and Q2 and higher earnings in Q3 and Q4. We expect lower margins in the first half of the year as a result of the RIIO-ED1 revenue reset. That revenue reset occurred at the beginning of the regulatory year on April 1, 2015. And since we report WPD on a 1-month lag, we will still see some effect of that revenue reset continue into the second quarter, an additional $0.02 per share above the $0.08 for Q1.
This decrease is expected to be primarily offset by the price increase beginning April 1, 2016, and allowed revenues under the RIIO-ED1 framework and from the recovery of prior customer rebates beginning April 1, 2016 through March 31, 2017, which will positively impact 2016 earnings by about $0.05. We also expect this revenue recovery to positively affect 2017 earnings by another $0.02 to $0.03. In addition, we are projecting lower O&M expenses in the back half of the year primarily related to higher vegetation management in Q4 of last year and lower expected pension expense in 2016. All of these factors contribute to the shaping of our earnings for the U.K. this year compared to last year.
Moving to Slide 14. On this slide we provide an update to our GBP hedging status for 2016, '17 and '18, including sensitivities for a $0.05, $0.10 and $0.15 downward movement in the exchange rate compared to our budgeted rate of $1.60 on open positions.
First, we are 93% hedged for the remainder of 2016 at an average rate of $1.54. For 2017, we're still hedged at 89% at an average rate of $1.58. And for 2018, we've continued to layer on hedges during the quarter and have increased our hedge percentage from 20% at year-end to 41% today at an average rate of $1.56. You can see from the sensitivity table that there's minimal exposure in '16 and '17 and about $0.03 of exposure in 2018 for every $0.05 below our budgeted rate of $1.60.
As I mentioned during our year-end call, our business plan provided enough capacity to hedge about 50% of our 2018 U.K. earnings exposure through restrikes. However, at this point we will refrain from adding additional 2018 hedges until after the U.K. referendum vote on June 23.
Moving to Slide 15. On this slide we are providing an update on RPI. Now that 2015/'16 regulatory year has concluded, the final RPI rate was 1.1% and was based on the Office of National Statistics average RPI index from April 2015 through March 2016. If you recall in the third quarter of 2015, we had incorporated a 1.3% RPI rate in our 2015/'16 planning assumptions compared to the 2.6% included in our tariffs. That true-up will flow through allowed revenues in 2017 and 2018 and has already been incorporated in our earnings growth projections. The additional downside from our budgeted 1.3% rate will not have a material impact on earnings in either 2017 or 2018. Our planning assumptions for 2016/'17, '17/'18 and '18/'19 have not changed since our year-end update and as you can see, the current forecast from the HM Treasury for all periods are in line with our current assumptions.
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period."

I'd like to first summarize by saying that we remain confident in where we're headed. We're solidly on track to deliver on our earnings forecast for 2016, and we expect to deliver compound annual EPS growth of 5% to 6% through 2018. We're pleased the WPD team has had such a successful first year under RIIO-ED1 and have outperformed incentive expectations. As Robert mentioned earlier, we are raising our expectation for incentive revenues from $90 million to $110 million to $115 million for 2017 and from $75 million to $105 million to $85 million to $115 million for 2018. This level of performance is consistent with WPD's long history of operational excellence.
Across all of our businesses, we continue to invest in tomorrow's energy infrastructure, the strength and the diversity of our generation fleet and to drive continuous improvements aimed at exceeding customer expectations and delivering power safely, reliably and affordably. And as I stated in my recent message to shareowners in the annual report, I'm convinced that our best days are ahead and I'm very excited about our future.

With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; and the presidents of our U.S. and U.K. utility businesses. 
Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda this morning starts with an overview of our quarterly and year-to-date 2016 earnings results. We will also provide an update to our 2016 full year earnings guidance, which we are reaffirming today. We will then turn our discussion to the impact of the U.K. decision to leave the European Union has had on PPL. We're also initiating earnings guidance for 2017 and updating our long-term EPS growth rates. 
Following my remarks, Vince will review our segment results and provide an overview of the assumptions we've used in planning for growth through the end of the decade. As always, we'll leave time to answer your questions. 
Turning next to Slide 4. Today we announced second quarter 2016 reported earnings of $0.71 per share compared with a reported loss of $1.13 per share in the second quarter of 2015. Second quarter 2015 results reflected a one-time charge of $1.50 per share from discontinued operations associated with the June 1, 2015 spinoff of our supply business. 
Year-to-date through the second quarter, reported earnings were $1.41 per share compared with a loss of $0.17 per share due to same period in 2015. 
Reported earnings for the first 6 months of 2015 reflects a loss from discontinued operations of $1.36 per share, resulting, again, primarily from the supply spinoff. Adjusting for special items, second quarter 2016 earnings from ongoing operations were $0.56 per share compared with $0.49 per share a year ago, representing a 14% increase on a per share basis. This increase was driven largely by higher base electricity rates at our Pennsylvania and Kentucky utilities, along with higher transmission margins from additional transmission investments in Pennsylvania. Through the first 6 months of 2016, earnings from ongoing operations were $1.23 per share compared with $1.26 per share a year ago, with a lower earnings year-to-date driven by the lower U.K. earnings in the first quarter of 2016 as a result of the Rio ED1 revenue reset that occurred on April of 2015. Vince will go into greater detail on second quarter results a little later in the call, but we're very pleased with the results for the second quarter and so far this year. 
Moving to Slide 5. Today we're reaffirming our 2016 ongoing earnings forecast of $2.25 to $2.45 per share, with a midpoint of $2.35 per share. The higher-than-expected results in all of our business units so far this year gives us a high degree of confidence in our ability to meet our 2016 earnings forecast. We continue to execute our plans for sustainable growth across our 7 high-performing utilities while delivering award-winning customer service, strengthening reliability and improving our efficiencies. And to reflect the current market to the pound, our 2016 forecast now assumes $1.30 per pound on our open positions. 
Turning to Slide 6. Looking beyond 2016, the fundamentals of the business remains strong and intact despite the recent U.K. vote to withdraw from the European Union, and the resulting weakening of the British pound sterling exchange rates. The vote to leave the EU has created broader economic uncertainty in the U.K. and is clearly a unique event that has led to significant volatility in the currency and worldwide markets. Despite this reaction, there is no change in our underlying business in the U.K. Our revenues are set for 7 more years. We are essentially sheltered from economic recession since we would be made whole in future periods for any volume variances that may result from an economic slowdown in the U.K. And as a reminder, our base revenues are also adjusted for inflation using the Retail Price Index, or RPI. The July RPI forecast has actually already increased from the forecast published just a month ago in June. Further, we expect no change to our investment in infrastructure since our business plans have already been accepted by , the U.K. regulator. The volatility created in the currency market, however, does have an impact on our U.S. dollar financial projections. The lower pound exchange rate will impact our translated earnings and the WPD dividend coming back to the U.S. 
Moving to Slide 7. We know that without providing updates to our earnings growth profile, there will continue to be uncertainty for investors as our longer-term earnings profile given the sharp decline in the British pound exchange rates. With no near-term catalysts that would signal a move higher in the pound, we took action to update our business plans to reflect current market conditions starting with the monetization of our existing 2017 and 2018 hedges, which I'll discuss in more detail shortly. 
Today, we're providing new earnings growth projections and a targeted dividend growth rate as well as updates to our U.K. cash repatriation and FX hedging strategies, all of which should provide clarity around our earnings and dividend targets through the end of the decade. The post-Brexit decline in the pound sterling drove our existing foreign currency hedges to be about $450 million in the money, which we don't believe is being appropriately reflected in PPL's stock price. We believe investors are largely valuing the company on an open leases, excluding the value of these hedges. As a result, we were looking for an opportunity to optimize the value of these existing hedges. We decided to modernize the gains associated with our 2017 and 2018 earnings hedges, capturing approximately $310 million in value. This monetization in combination with the higher-than-expected gains on the remaining 2016 hedges will offset lower expected cash, repatriation amounts from the U.K. resulting from the lower expected exchange rate providing about 5 to 6 years of coverage and will support the company's future dividend growth. 
Cashing in the hedges though this results in us remarking our future earnings using current market rates, which is expected to result in 2017 earnings being lower than 2016 earnings. Since we didn't think we are getting credit in the stock price on the hedges, we felt it was prudent to lock in the value of those hedges and protect the dividend growth despite the resetting of our future earnings. We have reestablished hedges for 2017 and 2018 at current foreign exchange rates at slightly higher hedge levels than existed prior to the monetization. We've updated our business plan to reflect current market conditions, including $1.30 foreign currency rate on unhedged positions from 2017 through 2020. Rehedging about 95% of the 2017 U.K. earnings at current rates protects the 2017 earnings guidance that we're providing today against any further near-term decline in the pound, and resetting our earnings hedges on the business plan to the $1.30 exchange rate allows for potential upside our earnings projections if there is a recovery in the pound. We are also announcing an update to our cash repatriation strategy with an expectation of lower amounts being repatriated from the U.K. going forward. On an annual basis, we will determine the appropriate level of distributions from the U.K., taking into account foreign exchange rates as well as tax rates in both the U.S. and the U.K. But in the near-term, we anticipate that we would repatriate about $100 million to $200 million annually. Vince will provide more details on this updated strategy in his prepared remarks. 
The actions we have taken reinforce our dividend growth projections and reestablish a baseline of PPL earnings in future earnings  growth reflective of the Brexit decision, the current market and our underlying business growth. 
Today, we're providing a 2017 guidance range of $2.05 to $2.25 per share for PPL, with a midpoint of $2.15 per share. We now expect per share compound annual earnings growth of 5% to 6% from 2017 through 2020, based on the midpoint of our 2017 guidance. 
Moving forward, we will continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and strong cash flows and our investment-grade credit ratings remain unchanged with a stable outlook. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, with the cash out of the hedges, we're not changing our expectation of a more meaningful dividend growth beginning in 2017. We're now targeting dividend growth of 14% annually through the end of the decade. This will result in our total return proposition to be projected in the 8% to 10% range over this period. While we were not expecting the U.K. to vote to leave the EU after careful consideration and deliberation with our Board of Directors, we decided to take these actions now as it recognizes the reality of the current market conditions is reflective of the underlying growth of the business and it enables us to focus our attention on providing safe, reliable service the customers and delivering loan-to-value for shareowners as opposed to being overly focused on the FX rate. 
Turning to Slide 8. We preferred to walk from the midpoint of our 2016 earnings forecast of $2.35 per share to the $2.15 per share midpoint of our 2017 earnings forecast. As you can see on this slide, there is a $0.20 per share decline from 2016 to 2017, directly attributable to the impact of resetting the exchange rate to the updated hedge rate of $1.32 per pound. The U.K. earnings, excluding currency, are expected to be $0.04 lower in 2017 compared to 2016 as a result of lower incentive revenues that we've discussed on prior calls. The higher depreciation and interest expense is offset by the annual price increase under Rio ED1 in the U.K. We are forecasting both the Pennsylvania and Kentucky Regulated segment's to be $0.02 higher in 2017 compared to 2016. In both cases, higher margins are driving the higher earnings. Corporate and other expenses are expected to be relatively flat year-over-year. 
Moving on to Slide 9. Our fundamental businesses -- business fundamentals, rather, and investment propositions have not changed significantly. We still expect strong compound annual rate base growth of about 5% from year-end 2016 through 2020, with rate base expected to grow to $29 billion by 2020. The constructive regulatory climate in which we do business is also the same. We still expect about 80% of our $12 billion infrastructure investment over the period to receive real-time recovery. Our core business is growing in support of our longer-term growth projection of 5% to 6% from 2017 through 2020. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Vince to walk you through a detailed look at segment earnings and a full review of the detailed assumptions used in planning for our updated guidance. Vince?"

Let's move to Slide 11. Our second quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased by $0.07 per share, driven primarily by higher earnings from the Pennsylvania Regulated segment and the Kentucky Regulated s",1817,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 11. Our second quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased by $0.07 per share, driven primarily by higher earnings from the Pennsylvania Regulated segment and the Kentucky Regulated segment while the U.K. Regulated segment remained flat compared to a year ago. 
Corporate and other cause were slightly favorable compared to prior year. We should note that for the second quarter compared to prior year, domestic weather was relatively flat and weather was about $0.01 positive compared to budget. 
Let's move to a more detailed review of the second quarter segment earnings drivers starting with the Pennsylvania results on Slide 12. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.11 per share in the second quarter of 2016, a $0.04 increase compared to the same period last year. This increase was primarily driven by a higher gross margin due to higher distribution margins as a result of a 2015 rate case that became effective January 1, 2016, and higher transmission margins due to additional capital investments. 
Moving to Slide 13. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.11 per share in the second quarter of 2016, a dhe $0.02 increase compared to a year ago. This result was primarily due to higher gross margins from higher base rates that were effective July 1 of this year. 
Turning to Slide 14. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.36 per share in the second quarter of 2016, the same as a year ago. This result was due to higher gross margins, primarily resulting from higher prices due to the April 1, 2016, price increase, partially offset by a one month of lower prices from the April 1, 2015, price decrease from the commencement of Rio ED1. Higher margins were offset by higher depreciation and interest expense as a result of continued investment in CapEx, and lower O&M expense of $0.01 was offset by unfavorable effects of $0.01. 
Let's move to Slide 15 and take a closer look at our earnings growth drivers. As Bill discussed, we are initiating our 2017 earnings guidance range of $2.05 to $2.25 per share, with a midpoint of $2.15 per share. We now expect a 5% to 6% long-term compound annual growth rate off of the 2017 midpoint of $2.15 through the end of the decade. The key drivers in support of this new guidance include updating the GBP exchange rate to $1.30 per pound for all open positions and updating RPI using the July HM Treasury forecast for the U.K. economy. 
We have also updated our U.S. and U.K. interest rate and pension assumptions to incorporate a lower-for-longer interest rate environment. And as Bill indicated earlier, we're targeting a dividend growth rate of about 4% per year through 2020, starting in 2017. 
Our assumptions for the 6% to 8% growth profiles our domestic utilities includes the same strong growth factors as previously discussed, including domestic rate base growth of about 5%, minimal loan growth in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky, transmission spending under rates in Pennsylvania of between $600 million and $700 million per year, totaling $2.6 billion over the 4 years; and between $350 million in $400 million a year of continued environmentally investment in Kentucky at on ROE of 10%. 
Over the 4 years, we expect to spend about $1.5 billion of environmental CapEx in Kentucky. Just this week, the Kentucky Public Service Commission approved our $1 billion environmental cost recovery plan with a 9.8% ROE. 
Moving to the U.K. The updates of the business plan reflect the macroeconomic impacts following the U.K. referendum. We now project 4% to 6% growth in the U.K. from '17 through '20. The plan incorporates $1.30 per pound FX rate on our unhedged earnings from 2017 through 2020. With the monetization of the 2017 and 2018 hedges, we entered into new hedges for those years at current market rates. I'll discuss the hedge levels and the average rates we obtained when we got to the foreign currency hedging status slide. 
Rev growth is expected to be 5.4% through 2020, driving segment ROEs in the 12% to 14% range. We've also incorporated an update on the U.K. incentive revenues. Estimates are now $85 million for 2017, between $80 million and $100 million for 2018 and between $95 million and $115 million for '19 and '20. These estimates for incentives were adjusted for the  assumed change in exchange rates and RPI as well as expected performance against those targets. You will find our progress against the 2016, 2017 regulatory year targets in the appendix to the presentation. 
WPD's performance continues to be very strong. It is on track to beat the new target. We've incorporated the new RPI assumptions to reflect the latest forecast published by HM Treasury in late July. This forecast shows a slight uptick in RPI from previous forecast, and we continue to expect an effective tax rate in the U.K. of approximately 17%. 
Moving to Slide 16. I'd like to review our updated cash repatriation strategy from the U.K. as this strategy has been modified beyond just the lower FX rate. Our previous guidance on cash repatriation from the U.K. was to distribute between $300 million and $500 million per year, with a target of $400 million assuming an FX rate of $1.60 per pound. We've previously indicated the amount of repatriation within that range will depend on a number of factors, including the FX rate. The targeted $400 million per year represents a distribution of about GBP 250 million  per year. That GBP 250 million translated at $1.30  would result in U.S. dollar distributions of about $325 million. This lower value of $75 million per year does not immediately impact us from a cash perspective since the end of money hedge value of about $450 million provides about 5 to 6 years of coverage against that lower U.S. dollar amount. But while these hedges kept us whole from a cash perspective with the historically low FX rate and higher corporate tax rates in the U.S. versus the U.K., we have an opportunity to optimize our cash coming back from the U.K. even further. We are currently planning to repatriate between $100 million and $200 million per year in the near-term. This lower cash amount will minimize the amount of translation impact on cash coming back from the U.K. at this historically low exchange rate. We will replace the lower repatriation level with debt in the U.S. Debt in the U.K., however, will be reduced with the same amount. Therefore, total debt at the PPL consolidated level will remain the same. This shift in borrowing from the U.K. to the U.S. captures the benefit of tax rate differential between the 2 countries. This benefit becomes even more pronounced as the U.K. continues to reduce their corporate tax rates. Since the distributions are reducing our U.K. tax basis, this lower distribution levels also extend our tax efficient repatriation strategy well beyond our original expectation of 2021 or 2022. And on an annual basis, we will continue to evaluate the most efficient level of cash repatriation taking into account perspective changes in the exchange rate, tax rates in both the U.K. and the U.S., as well as our overall tax strategy. 
Moving into Slide 17. The primary change to our revised capital plan is updating the U.K. projections for 2017 through 2020 based on an FX rate of $1.30 compared to the $1.60 previously used and to an average rate of $1.37 for 2016. We are not projecting any impact on the U.K. capital forecast in  local currency as those business plans have been accepted by Ofgem. On a U.S. dollar basis, we are now investing approximately $1 billion annually in each of our 3 business lines and the 5-year spending plan from 2016 to 2020 is about $15.4 billion. 
Moving to Slide 18. We have also updated our rate base growth projections and have shown updated rep balances to reflect the $1.30 FX rate assumption. Our overall growth rate of 5% has decreased slightly as we have reset our base year to 2016. And to enhance comparability, we have assumed $1.30 per pound for all periods. 
Moving to Slide 19. As we've discussed earlier, at the same time we monetize the 2017 and 2018 hedges, we put new hedges at slightly higher levels at current market rates. You can see our average hedge levels for 2017 and 2018 and the average rates we when we put the new hedges on. We use forward contracts to hedge 2017, which locks in from an FX perspective the new guidance we just provided for 2017. However, we used a combination of forward contract and 0 cost callers to resurge 2018, providing us with some potential upside if the pound appreciates before year end. The average hedge rates noted on the slide are based on the forward and the floors in the callers for 2018. So we protected the downside below $1.30 but retained some upside potential above the rate shown on this slide. We've also provided updated sensitivities, which show there is more upside potential for 2018 than downside risk given the callers. But the rule of thumb of a $0.01 movement in the FX rate equaling a $0.01 movement in EPS still applies for a fully open year by 2019. 
Moving to Slide 20. On this slide, our updated forecast assumptions are shown for RPI, again, using the July HM Treasury forecast of the U.K. economy. The rates for 2017, '18 and '19 have been Incorporated into our updated revenue projection. As a result, the RPI sensitivity you for 0.5% movement is now off of our updated forecast and would increase or decrease earnings by $0.02 in 2018. I know that was a lot of information, so let me just recap. We felt the most appropriate cause of action in light of Brexit was to: one, monetize the large mark to market value of the hedges, which enables us to preserve our dividend growth strategy for the PPL dividend; two, update our business plan to assume $1.30 per pound FX rate for all open positions, thus,  our earnings projections for 2017 forward; three, provide a very clear path for earnings growth beyond 2017 through the end of the decade based on the underlying growth of both the U.S. and U.K. businesses; and four, optimize our strategy of U.K. cash distributions back to the U.S. by lowering the amount of distributions to the minimum required, capturing the tax rate differential between the U.S. and the U.K. and preserving our tax efficient cash repatriation strategy for significantly longer. And added benefit of this approach is that if the pound or RPI increases overtime that would be upside to the new EPS forecast and growth rates we just provided. That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call over to Bill for the question-and-answer period. Bill?"

I think as we've also when we and kind of reset our earnings, we wanted to make sure we had a strong degree of confidence in those earnings that we were coming out within the growth rates that we've provided. As we talked with economists in the U.K. the banks, the number of banks both in the U.K. here in the U.S., and then there was some view that in the back half of '16 there could be some additional pressure on the pound. I think the consensus estimate for the back half of '16 is about $1.28. But I think there are some that show $1.20 to $1.30. And then '17, I would say consensus is kind of in that $1.30 to $1.35 range. Coincidentally, the colors that we put on basically gives as an effective color of $1.30 to $1.36, so right in line kind of with consensus estimates for the pound over the next, say, 1.5 years or so. I think from our perspective, it was a win-win. We've got to take the cash also the reason why we didn't take off the 2016 hedges that's supporting our $2.35 guidance that we reaffirmed today plus again if the bias is for the pound to go down a little bit more in the short-term, those hedges would be more in the money. So I mean we just took the whole position and thought about it holistically, it made sense to put the hedges back on at the current market. Also I think when you look at the hedge program in the way the stock trades in normal, say, FX conditions, I think the hedges work very well, and we do get the credit for the hedges. It's in the extreme cases where we tend to trade treat on a fully open basis. And if $1.30 is the new norm, we would expect and I think investors would expect us to rehedge."

With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; and the presidents of our U.S. and U.K. utility businesses. 
Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda this morning starts with an overview of our quarterly and year-to-date 2016 earnings results. We will also provide an update to our 2016 full year earnings guidance, which we are reaffirming today. We will then turn our discussion to the impact that the U.K. decision to leave the European Union has had on PPL. We're also initiating earnings guidance for 2017 and updating our long-term EPS growth rates. 
Following my remarks, Vince will review our segment results and provide an overview of the assumptions we've used in planning for growth through the end of the decade. As always, we'll leave time to answer your questions. 
Turning next to Slide 4. Today, we announced second quarter 2016 reported earnings of $0.71 per share compared with a reported loss of $1.13 per share in the second quarter of 2015. Second quarter 2015 results reflected a one-time charge of $1.50 per share from discontinued operations associated with the June 1, 2015 spinoff of our supply business. 
Year-to-date through the second quarter, reported earnings were $1.41 per share compared with a loss of $0.17 per share through the same period in 2015. 
Reported earnings for the first 6 months of 2015 reflect a loss from discontinued operations of $1.36 per share, resulting, again, primarily from the supply spinoff. Adjusting for special items, second quarter 2016 earnings from ongoing operations were $0.56 per share compared with $0.49 per share a year ago, representing a 14% increase on a per-share basis. This increase was driven largely by higher base electricity rates at our Pennsylvania and Kentucky Utilities, along with higher transmission margins from additional transmission investments in Pennsylvania. Through the first 6 months of 2016, earnings from ongoing operations were $1.23 per share compared with $1.26 per share a year ago, with a lower earnings year-to-date driven by the lower U.K. earnings in the first quarter of 2016 as a result of the RIIO-ED1 revenue reset that occurred in April of 2015. Vince will go into greater detail on second quarter results a little later in the call, but we're very pleased with the results for the second quarter and so far this year. 
Moving to Slide 5. Today, we're reaffirming our 2016 ongoing earnings forecast of $2.25 to $2.45 per share, with a midpoint of $2.35 per share. The higher-than-expected results in all of our business units so far this year gives us a high degree of confidence in our ability to meet our 2016 earnings forecast. We continue to execute our plans for sustainable growth across our 7 high-performing utilities, while delivering award-winning customer service, strengthening reliability and improving our efficiencies. And to reflect the current market for the pound, our 2016 forecast now assumes $1.30 per pound on our open positions. 
Turning to Slide 6. Looking beyond 2016, the fundamentals of the business remain strong and intact despite the recent U.K. vote to withdraw from the European Union and the resulting weakening of the British pound sterling exchange rates. The vote to leave the EU has created broader economic uncertainty in the U.K. and is clearly a unique event that has led to significant volatility in the currency and worldwide markets. Despite this reaction, there is no change in our underlying business in the U.K. Our revenues are set for 7 more years. We are essentially sheltered from economic recession, since we would be made whole in future periods for any volume variances that may result from an economic slowdown in the U.K. And as a reminder, our base revenues are also adjusted for inflation using the Retail Price Index, or RPI. The July RPI forecast has actually already increased from the forecast published just a month ago in June. Further, we expect no change to our investment in infrastructure, since our business plans have already been accepted by Ofgem, the U.K. regulator. The volatility created in the currency markets, however, does have an impact on our U.S. dollar financial projections. The lower pound exchange rate will impact our translated earnings and the WPD dividend coming back to the U.S. 
Moving to Slide 7. We know that without providing updates to our earnings growth profile, there will continue to be uncertainty for investors as to our longer-term earnings profile given the sharp decline in the British pound exchange rates. With no near-term catalysts that would signal a move higher in the pound, we took action to update our business plans to reflect current market conditions starting with the monetization of our existing 2017 and 2018 hedges, which I'll discuss in more detail shortly. 
Today, we're providing new earnings growth projections and a target dividend growth rate as well as updates to our U.K. cash repatriation and FX hedging strategies, all of which should provide clarity around our earnings and dividend targets through the end of the decade. The post-Brexit decline in the pound sterling drove our existing foreign currency hedges to be about $450 million in the money, which we don't believe is being appropriately reflected in PPL's stock price. We believe investors are largely valuing the company on an open basis, excluding the value of these hedges. As a result, we were looking for an opportunity to optimize the value of these existing hedges. We decided to monetize the gains associated with our 2017 and 2018 earnings hedges, capturing approximately $310 million in value. This monetization in combination with the higher-than-expected gains on the remaining 2016 hedges will offset lower expected cash repatriation amounts from the U.K., resulting from the lower expected exchange rate, providing about 5 to 6 years of coverage and will support the company's future dividend growth. 
Cashing in the hedges though did result in us remarking our future earnings using current market rates, which is expected to result in 2017 earnings being lower than 2016 earnings. Since we didn't think we are getting credit in the stock price for the hedges, we felt it was prudent to lock in the value of those hedges and protect the dividend growth despite the resetting of our future earnings. We have reestablished hedges for 2017 and 2018 at current foreign exchange rates at slightly higher hedge levels than existed prior to the monetization. We've updated our business plan to reflect current market conditions, including $1.30 foreign currency rate on unhedged positions from 2017 through 2020. Rehedging about 95% of the 2017 U.K. earnings at current rates protects the 2017 earnings guidance that we're providing today against any further near-term decline in the pound, and resetting our unhedged earnings in our business plan to the $1.30 exchange rate allows for potential upside to our earnings projections if there is a recovery in the pound. We're also announcing an update to our cash repatriation strategy, with an expectation of lower amounts being repatriated from the U.K. going forward. On an annual basis, we will determine the appropriate level of distributions from the U.K., taking into account foreign exchange rates as well as tax rates in both the U.S. and the U.K., but in the near-term, we anticipate that we would repatriate about $100 million to $200 million annually. Vince will provide more details on this updated strategy in his prepared remarks. 
The actions we have taken reinforce our dividend growth projections and reestablish a baseline of PPL earnings and future earnings  growth reflective of the Brexit decision, the current market and our underlying business growth. 
Today, we're providing a 2017 guidance range of $2.05 to $2.25 per share for PPL, with a midpoint of $2.15 per share. We now expect per share compound annual earnings growth of 5% to 6% from 2017 through 2020, based on the midpoint of our 2017 guidance. 
Moving forward, we will continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and strong cash flows, and our investment-grade credit ratings remain unchanged with a stable outlook. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, with the cash out of the hedges, we are not changing our expectation of a more meaningful dividend growth beginning in 2017. We're now targeting dividend growth of 14% annually through the end of the decade. This will result in our total return proposition being projected to be in the 8% to 10% range over this period. While we were not expecting the U.K. to vote to leave the EU, after careful consideration and deliberation with our Board of Directors, we decided to take these actions now as it recognizes the reality of the current market conditions is reflective of the underlying growth of the business, and it enables us to focus our attention on providing safe, reliable service to customers and delivering long-term value for shareowners as opposed to being overly focused on the FX rate. 
Turning to Slide 8. We've prepared a walk from the midpoint of our 2016 earnings forecast of $2.35 per share to the $2.15 per share midpoint of our 2017 earnings forecast. As you can see on this slide, there is a $0.20 per share decline from 2016 to 2017, directly attributable to the impact of resetting the exchange rate to the updated hedge rate of $1.32 per pound. The U.K. earnings, excluding currency, are expected to be $0.04 lower in 2017 compared to 2016 as a result of lower incentive revenues that we've discussed on prior calls. The higher depreciation and interest expense is offset by the annual price increase under RIIO-ED1 in the U.K. We are forecasting both the Pennsylvania and Kentucky Regulated segments to be $0.02 higher in 2017 compared to 2016. In both cases, higher margins are driving the higher earnings. Corporate and other expenses are expected to be relatively flat year-over-year. 
Moving on to Slide 9. Our fundamental businesses -- business fundamentals rather and investment proposition have not changed significantly. We still expect strong compound annual rate base growth of about 5% from year-end 2016 through 2020, with rate base expected to grow to $29 billion by 2020. The constructive regulatory climate, in which we do business, is also the same. We still expect about 80% of our $12 billion infrastructure investment over the period to receive real-time recovery. Our core business is growing in support of our longer-term growth projection of 5% to 6% from 2017 through 2020. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Vince to walk you through a detailed look at segment earnings and a full review of the detailed assumptions used in planning for our updated guidance. Vince?"

Let's move to Slide 11. Our second quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased by $0.07 per share, driven primarily by higher earnings from the Pennsylvania Regulated segment and the Kentucky Regulated s",1809,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 11. Our second quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased by $0.07 per share, driven primarily by higher earnings from the Pennsylvania Regulated segment and the Kentucky Regulated segment, while the U.K. Regulated segment remained flat compared to a year ago. 
Corporate and other costs were slightly favorable compared to prior year. We should note that for the second quarter compared to prior year, domestic weather was relatively flat and weather was about $0.01 positive compared to budget. 
Let's move to a more detailed review of the second quarter segment earnings drivers, starting with the Pennsylvania results on Slide 12. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.11 per share in the second quarter of 2016, a $0.04 increase compared to the same period last year. This increase was primarily driven by a higher gross margins due to higher distribution margins as a result of the 2015 rate case that became effective January 1, 2016, and higher transmission margins due to additional capital investments. 
Moving to Slide 13. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.11 per share in the second quarter of 2016, a $0.02 increase compared to a year ago. This result was primarily due to higher gross margins from higher base rates that were effective July 1 of last year. 
Turning to Slide 14. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.36 per share in the second quarter of 2016, the same as a year ago. This result was due to higher gross margins, primarily resulting from higher prices due to the April 1, 2016, price increase, partially offset by one month of lower prices from the April 1, 2015, price decrease from the commencement of RIIO-ED1. Higher margins were offset by higher depreciation and interest expense as a result of continued investment in CapEx, and lower O&M expense of $0.01 was offset by unfavorable effects of $0.01. 
Let's move to Slide 15 and take a closer look at our earnings growth drivers. As Bill discussed, we are initiating our 2017 earnings guidance range of $2.05 to $2.25 per share, with a midpoint of $2.15 per share. We now expect a 5% to 6% long-term compound annual growth rate off of the 2017 midpoint of $2.15 through the end of the decade. The key drivers in support of this new guidance include updating the GBP exchange rate to $1.30 per pound for all open positions and updating RPI using the July HM Treasury forecast for the U.K. economy. 
We have also updated our U.S. and U.K. interest rate and pension assumptions to incorporate a lower-for-longer interest rate environment. And as Bill indicated earlier, we're targeting a dividend growth rate of about 4% per year through 2020, starting in 2017. 
Our assumptions for the 6% to 8% growth profile our domestic utilities includes the same strong growth factors as previously discussed, including domestic rate base growth of about 5%, minimal load growth in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky, transmission spending under FERC formula rates in Pennsylvania of between $600 million and $700 million per year, totaling $2.6 billion over the 4 years; and between $350 million and $400 million a year of continued environmental investment in Kentucky at an ROE of 10%. 
Over the 4 years, we expect to spend about $1.5 billion of environmental CapEx in Kentucky. Just this week, the Kentucky Public Service Commission approved our $1 billion environmental cost recovery plan with a 9.8% ROE. 
Moving to the U.K. The updates to the business plan reflect the macroeconomic impact following the U.K. referendum. We now project 4% to 6% growth in the U.K. from '17 through '20. The plan incorporates $1.30 per pound FX rate on our unhedged earnings from 2017 through 2020. With the monetization of the 2017 and 2018 hedges, we entered into new hedges for those years at current market rates. I'll discuss the hedge levels and the average rates we obtained when we get to the foreign currency hedging status slide. 
RAV growth is expected to be 5.4% through 2020, driving segment ROEs in the 12% to 14% range. We've also incorporated an update on the U.K. incentive revenues. Estimates are now $85 million for 2017, between $80 million and $100 million for 2018 and between $95 million and $115 million for '19 and '20. These estimates for incentives were adjusted for the  assumed change in exchange rates and RPI as well as expected performance against those targets. You will find our progress against the 2016 and 2017 regulatory year targets in the appendix to the presentation. 
WPD's performance continues to be very strong and is on track to beat the new target. We've incorporated new RPI assumptions to reflect the latest forecast published by HM Treasury in late July. This forecast shows a slight uptick in RPI from previous forecast, and we continue to expect an effective tax rate in the U.K. of approximately 17%. 
Moving to Slide 16. I'd like to review our updated cash repatriation strategy from the U.K., as this strategy has been modified beyond just the lower FX rate. Our previous guidance on cash repatriation from the U.K. was to distribute between $300 million and $500 million per year, with a target of $400 million assuming an FX rate of $1.60 per pound. We've previously indicated the amount of repatriation within that range would depend on a number of factors, including the FX rate. The targeted $400 million per year represented distributions of about GBP 250 million  per year. That GBP 250 million translated at $1.30  would result in U.S. dollar distributions of about $325 million. This lower value of $75 million per year does not immediately impact us from a cash perspective, since the in-the-money hedge value of about $450 million provides about 5 to 6 years of coverage against that lower U.S. dollar amount. While these hedges kept us whole from a cash perspective with a historically low FX rate and higher corporate tax rates in the U.S. versus the U.K., we have an opportunity to optimize our cash coming back from the U.K. even further. We are currently planning to repatriate between $100 million and $200 million per year in the near term. This lower cash amount will minimize the amount of translation impact on cash coming back from the U.K. at these historically low exchange rates. We will replace the lower repatriation level with debt in the U.S. Debt in the U.K., however, will be reduced by the same amount. Therefore, total debt at the PPL consolidated level will remain the same. This shift in borrowing from the U.K. to the U.S. captures the benefit of tax rate differential between the 2 countries. This benefit becomes even more pronounced as the U.K. continues to reduce their corporate tax rate. Since the distributions are reducing our U.K. tax basis, these lower distribution levels also extend our tax-efficient repatriation strategy well beyond our original expectation of 2021 or 2022. And on an annual basis, we will continue to evaluate the most efficient level of cash repatriation, taking into account perspective changes in the exchange rate, tax rates in both the U.K. and the U.S. as well as our overall tax strategy. 
Moving to Slide 17. The primary change to our revised capital plan is updating the U.K. projections for 2017 through 2020 based on an FX rate of $1.30 compared to the $1.60 previously used and to an average rate of $1.37 for 2016. We are not projecting any impact on the U.K. capital forecast in local currency, as those business plans have been accepted by Ofgem. On a U.S. dollar basis, we are now investing approximately $1 billion annually in each of our 3 business lines, and the 5-year spending plan from 2016  through 2020 is about $15.4 billion. 
Moving to Slide 18. We have also updated our rate base growth projections and have shown updated RAV balances to reflect the $1.30 FX rate assumption. Our overall growth rate of 5% has decreased slightly, as we have reset our base year to 2016. And to enhance comparability, we have assumed $1.30 per pound for all periods. 
Moving to Slide 19. As we've discussed earlier, at the same time we monetize the 2017 and 2018 hedges, we put new hedges on at slightly higher levels at current market rates. You can see our average hedge levels for 2017 and 2018 and the average rates we achieved when we put the new hedges on. We used forward contracts to hedge 2017, which locks in from an FX perspective the new guidance we just provided for 2017. However, we used a combination of forward contracts and zero-cost collars to rehedge 2018, providing us with some potential upside if the pound appreciates before then. The average hedge rates noted on the slide are based on the forwards and the floors in the collars for 2018. So we've protected the downside below $1.30, but retained some upside potential above the rate shown on the slide. We've also provided updated sensitivities, which show there is more upside potential for 2018 than downside risk given the collars. But the rule of thumb of a $0.01 movement in the FX rate equaling a $0.01 movement in EPS still applies for a fully open year by 2019. 
Moving to Slide 20. On this slide, our updated forecast assumptions are shown for RPI, again, using the July HM Treasury forecast of the U.K. economy. The rates for 2017, '18 and '19 have been Incorporated into our updated revenue projection. As a result, the RPI sensitivity for 0.5% movement is now off our updated forecast and would increase or decrease earnings by $0.02 in 2018. I know that was a lot of information, so let me just recap. We felt the most appropriate course of action in light of Brexit was to: one, monetize the large mark-to-market value of the hedges, which enables us to preserve our dividend growth strategy for the PPL dividend; two, update our business plan to assume $1.30 per pound FX rate for all open positions, thus,  rebasing our earnings projections for 2017 forward; three, provide a very clear path for earnings growth beyond 2017 through the end of the decade, based on the underlying growth of both the U.S. and U.K. businesses; and four, optimize our strategy of U.K. cash distributions back to the U.S. by lowering the amount of distributions to the minimum required, capturing the tax rate differential between the U.S. and the U.K. and preserving our tax-efficient cash repatriation strategy for significantly longer. An added benefit of this approach is that if the pound or RPI increases over time, there will be upside to the new EPS forecast and growth rates we just provided. That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call over to Bill for the question-and-answer period. Bill?"

I believe today's actions are very important because they provide clarity and transparency in our response to the U.K.'s decision to exit the EU. By providing longer-term earnings expectations, our actions also illustrate the confidence we have in the strong business fundamentals of our 7 high-performing utilities. It was clear to us that the volatility in our stock was correlated to changes in the pound, and the benefits of our financial hedges were not being reflected in our valuation. By monetizing those hedges, we have not only helped to secure our dividend growth objectives, but our earnings growth is also now clarified on a foreign currency basis that is more reflective of the current market. Clearly, Brexit was a unique event, but our positive view of the U.K. business model remains unchanged. PPL's senior management team is committed to delivering 5% to 6% annual earnings growth through 2020.

Much of the work that Robert and his team are doing is very predictable and very kind of standard blocking and tackling-type work. So no expectation there. As I know you can appreciate, Michael, the RPI could be an uplift to us, because that Retail Price Index is expected to probably go higher, as the economy in the U.K. is under some pressure.

I think as we've also -- when we come out and kind of reset our earnings, we wanted to make sure we had a strong degree of confidence in those earnings that we were coming out within the growth rates that we provided. As we talked with economists in the U.K., banks, number of banks both in the U.K., here in the U.S., I think there was some view that in the back half of '16, there could be some additional pressure on the pound. I think the consensus estimate for the back half of '16 is about $1.28, but I think there are some that show $1.20 to $1.30. And then '17, I would say consensus is kind of in that $1.30 to $1.35 range. Coincidentally, the collars that we put on basically give us an effective collar of $1.30 to $1.36, so right in line kind of with consensus estimates for the pound over the next, say, 1.5 years. So I think from our perspective, it was a win-win. We got to take the cash. Also, the reason why we didn't take off the 2016 hedges that's supporting our $2.35 guidance that we reaffirmed today, plus again if the bias is for the pound to go down a little bit more in the short term, those hedges would be more in the money. So I think, as we just took the whole position and thought about it holistically, it made sense to put the hedges back on at the current market. Also I think when you look at the hedge program and the way the stock trades in normal, say, FX conditions, I think the hedges work very well, and we do get the credit for the hedges. It's in these extreme cases where we tend to trade on a fully open basis. And if $1.30 is the new norm, we would expect, and I think investors would expect us to rehedge."

Moving to Slide 3. Our a",1785,"Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. We're very pleased that you've joined us this morning. With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; and the presidents of our U.S. and U.K. utility businesses. 
Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda this morning starts with an overview of our quarterly and year-to-date 2016 earnings results. We will also provide an update to our 2016 full year earnings guidance, which we are reaffirming today. We will then turn our discussion to the impact that the U.K. decision to leave the European Union has had on PPL. We're also initiating earnings guidance for 2017 and updating our long-term EPS growth rates. 
Following my remarks, Vince will review our segment results and provide an overview of the assumptions we've used in planning for growth through the end of the decade. As always, we'll leave time to answer your questions. 
Turning next to Slide 4. Today, we announced second quarter 2016 reported earnings of $0.71 per share compared with a reported loss of $1.13 per share in the second quarter of 2015. Second quarter 2015 results reflected a onetime charge of $1.50 per share from discontinued operations associated with the June 1, 2015 spinoff of our supply business. 
Year-to-date through the second quarter, reported earnings were $1.41 per share compared with a loss of $0.17 per share through the same period in 2015. 
Reported earnings for the first 6 months of 2015 reflect a loss from discontinued operations of $1.36 per share, resulting, again, primarily from the supply spinoff. Adjusting for special items, second quarter 2016 earnings from ongoing operations were $0.56 per share compared with $0.49 per share a year ago, representing a 14% increase on a per-share basis. This increase was driven largely by higher base electricity rates at our Pennsylvania and Kentucky Utilities, along with higher transmission margins from additional transmission investments in Pennsylvania. Through the first 6 months of 2016, earnings from ongoing operations were $1.23 per share compared with $1.26 per share a year ago, with the lower earnings year-to-date driven by the lower U.K. earnings in the first quarter of 2016 as a result of the RIIO-ED1 revenue reset that occurred in April of 2015. Vince will go into greater detail on second quarter results a little later in the call, but we're very pleased with the results for the second quarter and so far this year. 
Moving to Slide 5. Today, we're reaffirming our 2016 ongoing earnings forecast of $2.25 to $2.45 per share, with a midpoint of $2.35 per share. The higher-than-expected results in all of our business units so far this year gives us a high degree of confidence in our ability to meet our 2016 earnings forecast. We continue to execute our plans for sustainable growth across our 7 high-performing utilities, while delivering award-winning customer service, strengthening reliability and improving our efficiencies. And to reflect the current market for the pound, our 2016 forecast now assumes $1.30 per pound on our open positions. 
Turning to Slide 6. Looking beyond 2016, the fundamentals of the business remain strong and intact despite the recent U.K. vote to withdraw from the European Union and the resulting weakening of the British pound sterling exchange rates. The vote to leave the EU has created broader economic uncertainty in the U.K. and is clearly a unique event that has led to significant volatility in the currency and worldwide markets. Despite this reaction, there is no change in our underlying business in the U.K. Our revenues are set for 7 more years. We are essentially sheltered from an economic recession, since we would be made whole in future periods for any volume variances that may result from an economic slowdown in the U.K. And as a reminder, our base revenues are also adjusted for inflation using the Retail Price Index, or RPI. The July RPI forecast has actually already increased from the forecast published just a month ago in June. Further, we expect no change to our investment in infrastructure, since our business plans have already been accepted by Ofgem, the U.K. regulator. The volatility created in the currency markets, however, does have an impact on our U.S. dollar financial projections. The lower pound exchange rate will impact our translated earnings and the WPD dividend coming back to the U.S. 
Moving to Slide 7. We know that without providing updates to our earnings growth profile, there would continue to be uncertainty for investors as to our longer-term earnings profile given the sharp decline in the British pound exchange rates. With no near-term catalysts that would signal a move higher in the pound, we took action to update our business plans to reflect current market conditions, starting with the monetization of our existing 2017 and 2018 hedges, which I'll discuss in more detail shortly. 
Today, we're providing new earnings growth projections and a target dividend growth rate as well as updates to our U.K. cash repatriation and FX hedging strategies, all of which should provide clarity around our earnings and dividend targets through the end of the decade. The post-Brexit decline in the pound sterling drove our existing foreign currency hedges to be about $450 million in the money, which we don't believe is being appropriately reflected in PPL's stock price. We believe investors are largely valuing the company on an open basis, excluding the value of these hedges. As a result, we were looking for an opportunity to optimize the value of these existing hedges. We decided to monetize the gains associated with our 2017 and 2018 earnings hedges, capturing approximately $310 million in value. This monetization in combination with the higher-than-expected gains on the remaining 2016 hedges will offset lower expected cash repatriation amounts from the U.K., resulting from the lower expected exchange rate, providing about 5 to 6 years of coverage and will support the company's future dividend growth. 
Cashing in the hedges, though, did result in us remarking our future earnings using current market rates, which is expected to result in 2017 earnings being lower than 2016 earnings. Since we didn't think we were getting credit in the stock price for the hedges, we felt it was prudent to lock in the value of those hedges and protect the dividend growth despite the resetting of our future earnings. We have reestablished hedges for 2017 and 2018 at current foreign exchange rates at slightly higher hedge levels than existed prior to the monetization. We've updated our business plan to reflect current market conditions, including $1.30 foreign currency rate on unhedged positions from 2017 through 2020. Rehedging about 95% of the 2017 U.K. earnings at current rates protects the 2017 earnings guidance that we are providing today against any further near-term decline in the pound, and resetting our unhedged earnings in our business plan to the $1.30 exchange rate allows for potential upside to our earnings projections if there is a recovery in the pound. We're also announcing an update to our cash repatriation strategy, with an expectation of lower amounts being repatriated from the U.K. going forward. On an annual basis, we will determine the appropriate level of distributions from the U.K., taking into account foreign exchange rates as well as tax rates in both the U.S. and the U.K., but in the near-term, we anticipate that we would repatriate about $100 million to $200 million annually. Vince will provide more details on this updated strategy in his prepared remarks. 
The actions we have taken reinforce our dividend growth projections and reestablish a baseline of PPL earnings and future earnings growth reflective of the Brexit decision, the current market and our underlying business growth. 
Today, we're providing a 2017 guidance range of $2.05 to $2.25 per share for PPL, with a midpoint of $2.15 per share. We now expect per share compound annual earnings growth of 5% to 6% from 2017 through 2020, based on the midpoint of our 2017 guidance. 
Moving forward, we will continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and strong cash flows, and our investment-grade credit ratings remain unchanged, with a stable outlook. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, with the cash out of the hedges, we are not changing our expectation of a more meaningful dividend growth beginning in 2017. We're now targeting dividend growth of about 4% annually through the end of the decade. This will result in our total return proposition being projected to be in the 8% to 10% range over this period. While we were not expecting the U.K. to vote to leave the EU, after careful consideration and deliberation with our Board of Directors, we decided to take these actions now as it recognizes the reality of the current market conditions is reflective of the underlying growth of the business, and it enables us to focus our attention on providing safe, reliable service to customers and delivering long-term value for shareowners as opposed to being overly focused on the FX rate. 
Turning to Slide 8. We've prepared a walk from the midpoint of our 2016 earnings forecast of $2.35 per share to the $2.15 per share midpoint of our 2017 earnings forecast. As you can see on this slide, there is a $0.20 per share decline from 2016 to 2017, directly attributable to the impact of resetting the exchange rate to the updated hedge rate of $1.32 per pound. The U.K. earnings, excluding currency, are expected to be $0.04 lower in 2017 compared to 2016 as a result of lower incentive revenues that we've discussed on prior calls. The higher depreciation and interest expense is offset by the annual price increase under RIIO-ED1 in the U.K. We are forecasting both the Pennsylvania and Kentucky Regulated segments to be $0.02 higher in 2017 compared to 2016. In both cases, higher margins are driving the higher earnings. Corporate and other expenses are expected to be relatively flat year-over-year. 
Moving on to Slide 9. Our fundamental businesses -- business fundamentals rather and investment proposition have not changed significantly. We still expect strong compound annual rate base growth of about 5% from year-end 2016 through 2020, with rate base expected to grow to $29 billion by 2020. The constructive regulatory climate, in which we do business, is also the same. We still expect about 80% of our $12 billion infrastructure investment over the period to receive real-time recovery. Our core business is growing in support of our longer-term growth projection of 5% to 6% from 2017 through 2020. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Vince to walk you through a detailed look at segment earnings and a full review of the detailed assumptions used in planning for our updated guidance. Vince?"

Let's move to Slide 11. Our second quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased by $0.07 per share, driven primarily by higher earnings from the Pennsylvania Regulated segment and the Kentucky Regulated s",1809,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 11. Our second quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased by $0.07 per share, driven primarily by higher earnings from the Pennsylvania Regulated segment and the Kentucky Regulated segment, while the U.K. Regulated segment remained flat compared to a year ago. 
Corporate and other costs were slightly favorable compared to prior year. We should note that for the second quarter compared to prior year, domestic weather was relatively flat and weather was about $0.01 positive compared to budget. 
Let's move to a more detailed review of the second quarter segment earnings drivers, starting with the Pennsylvania results on Slide 12. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.11 per share in the second quarter of 2016, a $0.04 increase compared to the same period last year. This increase was primarily driven by higher gross margins due to higher distribution margins as a result of the 2015 rate case that became effective January 1, 2016, and higher transmission margins due to additional capital investments. 
Moving to Slide 13. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.11 per share in the second quarter of 2016, a $0.02 increase compared to a year ago. This result was primarily due to higher gross margins from higher base rates that were effective July 1 of last year. 
Turning to Slide 14. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.36 per share in the second quarter of 2016, the same as a year ago. This result was due to higher gross margins, primarily resulting from higher prices due to the April 1, 2016, price increase, partially offset by one month of lower prices from the April 1, 2015, price decrease from the commencement of RIIO-ED1. Higher margins were offset by higher depreciation and interest expense as a result of continued investment in CapEx, and lower O&M expense of $0.01 was offset by unfavorable FX of $0.01. 
Let's move to Slide 15 and take a closer look at our earnings growth drivers. As Bill discussed, we are initiating our 2017 earnings guidance range of $2.05 to $2.25 per share, with a midpoint of $2.15 per share. We now expect a 5% to 6% long-term compound annual growth rate off of the 2017 midpoint of $2.15 through the end of the decade. The key drivers in support of this new guidance include updating the GBP exchange rate to $1.30 per pound for all open positions and updating RPI using the July HM Treasury forecast for the U.K. economy. 
We have also updated our U.S. and U.K. interest rate and pension assumptions to incorporate a lower-for-longer interest rate environment. And as Bill indicated earlier, we're targeting a dividend growth rate of about 4% per year through 2020, starting in 2017. 
Our assumptions for the 6% to 8% growth profile our domestic utilities includes the same strong growth factors as previously discussed, including domestic rate base growth of about 5%, minimal load growth in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky, transmission spending under FERC formula rates in Pennsylvania of between $600 million and $700 million per year, totaling $2.6 billion over the 4 years; and between $350 million and $400 million a year of continued environmental investment in Kentucky at an ROE of 10%. 
Over the 4 years, we expect to spend about $1.5 billion of environmental CapEx in Kentucky. Just this week, the Kentucky Public Service Commission approved our $1 billion environmental cost recovery plan with a 9.8% ROE. 
Moving to the U.K. The updates to the business plan reflect the macroeconomic impact following the U.K. referendum. We now project 4% to 6% growth in the U.K. from '17 through '20. The plan incorporates $1.30 per pound FX rate on our unhedged earnings from 2017 through 2020. With the monetization of the 2017 and 2018 hedges, we entered into new hedges for those years at current market rates. I'll discuss the hedge levels and the average rates we obtained when we get to the foreign currency hedging status slide. 
RAV growth is expected to be 5.4% through 2020, driving segment ROEs in the 12% to 14% range. We've also incorporated an update on the U.K. incentive revenues. Estimates are now $85 million for 2017, between $80 million and $100 million for 2018 and between $95 million and $115 million for '19 and '20. These estimates for incentives were adjusted for the assumed change in exchange rates and RPI as well as expected performance against those targets. You will find our progress against the 2016 and 2017 regulatory year targets in the appendix to the presentation. 
WPD's performance continues to be very strong and is on track to beat the new target. We've incorporated new RPI assumptions to reflect the latest forecast published by HM Treasury in late July. This forecast shows a slight uptick in RPI from previous forecasts, and we continue to expect an effective tax rate in the U.K. of approximately 17%. 
Moving to Slide 16. I'd like to review our updated cash repatriation strategy from the U.K., as this strategy has been modified beyond just the lower FX rate. Our previous guidance on cash repatriation from the U.K. was to distribute between $300 million and $500 million per year, with a target of $400 million, assuming an FX rate of $1.60 per pound. We've previously indicated the amount of repatriation within that range would depend on a number of factors, including the FX rate. The targeted $400 million per year represented distributions of about GBP 250 million per year. That GBP 250 million translated at $1.30  would result in U.S. dollar distributions of about $325 million. This lower value of $75 million per year does not immediately impact us from a cash perspective, since the in-the-money hedge value of about $450 million provides about 5 to 6 years of coverage against that lower U.S. dollar amount. But while these hedges kept us whole from a cash perspective with a historically low FX rate and higher corporate tax rates in the U.S. versus the U.K., we have an opportunity to optimize our cash coming back from the U.K. even further. We are currently planning to repatriate between $100 million and $200 million per year in the near term. This lower cash amount will minimize the amount of translation impact on cash coming back from the U.K. at these historically low exchange rates. We will replace the lower repatriation level with debt in the U.S. Debt in the U.K., however, will be reduced by the same amount. Therefore, total debt at the PPL consolidated level will remain the same. This shift in borrowing from the U.K. to the U.S. captures the benefit of tax rate differential between the 2 countries. This benefit becomes even more pronounced as the U.K. continues to reduce their corporate tax rate. Since the distributions are reducing our U.K. tax basis, these lower distribution levels also extend our tax-efficient repatriation strategy well beyond our original expectation of 2021 or 2022. And on an annual basis, we will continue to evaluate the most efficient level of cash repatriation, taking into account prospective changes in the exchange rate, tax rates in both the U.K. and the U.S. as well as our overall tax strategy. 
Moving to Slide 17. The primary change to our revised capital plan is updating the U.K. projections for 2017 through 2020 based on an FX rate of $1.30 compared to the $1.60 previously used and to an average rate of $1.37 for 2016. We are not projecting any impact on the U.K. capital forecast in local currency, as those business plans have been accepted by Ofgem. On a U.S. dollar basis, we are now investing approximately $1 billion annually in each of our 3 business lines, and the 5-year spending plan from 2016 through 2020 is about $15.4 billion. 
Moving to Slide 18. We have also updated our rate base growth projections and have shown updated RAV balances to reflect the $1.30 FX rate assumption. Our overall growth rate of 5% has decreased slightly, as we have reset our base year to 2016. And to enhance comparability, we have assumed $1.30 per pound for all periods. 
Moving to Slide 19. As we've discussed earlier, at the same time we monetize the 2017 and 2018 hedges, we put new hedges on at slightly higher levels at current market rates. You can see our average hedge levels for 2017 and 2018 and the average rates we achieved when we put the new hedges on. We used forward contracts to hedge 2017, which locks in from an FX perspective the new guidance we just provided for 2017. However, we used a combination of forward contracts and zero-cost collars to rehedge 2018, providing us with some potential upside if the pound appreciates before then. The average hedge rates noted on the slide are based on the forwards and the floors in the collars for 2018. So we've protected the downside below $1.30, but retained some upside potential above the rate shown on the slide. We've also provided updated sensitivities, which show there is more upside potential for 2018 than downside risk given the collars. But the rule of thumb of a $0.01 movement in the FX rate equaling a $0.01 movement in EPS still applies for a fully open year by 2019. 
Moving to Slide 20. On this slide, our updated forecast assumptions are shown for RPI, again, using the July HM Treasury forecast of the U.K. economy. The rates for 2017, '18 and '19 have been incorporated into our updated revenue projection. As a result, the RPI sensitivity for 0.5% movement is now off our updated forecast and would increase or decrease earnings by $0.02 in 2018. I know that was a lot of information, so let me just recap. We felt the most appropriate course of action in light of Brexit was to, one, monetize the large mark-to-market value of the hedges, which enables us to preserve our dividend growth strategy for the PPL dividend; two, update our business plan to assume $1.30 per pound FX rate for all open positions, thus, rebasing our earnings projections for 2017 forward; three, provide a very clear path for earnings growth beyond 2017 through the end of the decade based on the underlying growth of both the U.S. and U.K. businesses; and four, optimize our strategy of U.K. cash distributions back to the U.S. by lowering the amount of distributions to the minimum required, capturing the tax rate differential between the U.S. and the U.K. and preserving our tax-efficient cash repatriation strategy for significantly longer. An added benefit of this approach is that if the pound or RPI increases over time, there will be upside to the new EPS forecast and growth rates we just provided. That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call over to Bill for the question-and-answer period. Bill?"

By monetizing those hedges, we have not only helped to secure our dividend growth objectives, but our earnings growth is also now clarified on a foreign currency basis that is more reflective of the current market. Clearly, Brexit was a unique event, but our positive view of the U.K. business model remains unchanged.

So in this case, it was 2017. So we thought it was appropriate even though we issued guidance a little bit early to go ahead and hedge that up a little bit further than we normally would at this point. So looking at '18, we would begin hedging in -- or looking to hedge in the rest of '18 sometime beginning next year and then probably start to layer in some 2019 hedges next year as well. We probably look to -- depending on the volatility in the currency rate and other market conditions, we may look to do something similar with collars like we've done here to either preserve some of the upside and protect the downside or to lock in something above our plan. So to the extent that we can improve upon the growth rate by hedging in at a number stronger than the plan, that would obviously be something we look closely at doing."

I think as we've also -- when we come out and kind of reset our earnings, we wanted to make sure we had a strong degree of confidence in those earnings that we were coming out within the growth rates that we provided. As we talked with economists in the U.K., banks, a number of banks both in the U.K., here in the U.S., I think there was some view that in the back half of '16, there could be some additional pressure on the pound. I think the consensus estimate for the back half of '16 is about $1.28, but I think there are some that show $1.20 to $1.30. And then '17, I would say consensus is kind of in that $1.30 to $1.35 range. Coincidentally, the collars that we put on basically give us an effective collar of $1.30 to $1.36, so right in line kind of with consensus estimates for the pound over the next, say, 1.5 years. So I think from our perspective, it was a win-win. We got to take the cash. Also, the reason why we didn't take off the 2016 hedges that's supporting our $2.35 guidance that we reaffirmed today, plus again if the bias is for the pound to go down a little bit more in the short term, those hedges will be more in the money. So I think, as we just took the whole position and thought about it holistically, it made sense to put the hedges back on at the current market. Also I think when you look at the hedge program and the way the stock trades in normal, say, FX conditions, I think the hedges work very well, and we do get the credit for the hedges. It's in these extreme cases where we tend to trade on a fully open basis. And if $1.30 is the new norm, we would expect, and I think investors would expect us to rehedge."

With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; and the presidents of our U.S. and U.K. utility businesses. 
Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda this morning starts with an overview of our quarterly and year-to-date 2016 earnings results. We will also provide an update to our 2016 full year earnings guidance, which we are reaffirming today. We will then turn our discussion to the impact that the U.K. decision to leave the European Union has had on PPL. We're also initiating earnings guidance for 2017 and updating our long-term EPS growth rates. 
Following my remarks, Vince will review our segment results and provide an overview of the assumptions we've used in planning for growth through the end of the decade. As always, we'll leave time to answer your questions. 
Turning next to Slide 4. Today, we announced second quarter 2016 reported earnings of $0.71 per share compared with a reported loss of $1.13 per share in the second quarter of 2015. Second quarter 2015 results reflected a onetime charge of $1.50 per share from discontinued operations associated with the June 1, 2015 spinoff of our supply business. 
Year-to-date through the second quarter, reported earnings were $1.41 per share compared with a loss of $0.17 per share through the same period in 2015. 
Reported earnings for the first 6 months of 2015 reflect a loss from discontinued operations of $1.36 per share, resulting, again, primarily from the supply spinoff. Adjusting for special items, second quarter 2016 earnings from ongoing operations were $0.56 per share compared with $0.49 per share a year ago, representing a 14% increase on a per-share basis. This increase was driven largely by higher base electricity rates at our Pennsylvania and Kentucky Utilities, along with higher transmission margins from additional transmission investments in Pennsylvania. Through the first 6 months of 2016, earnings from ongoing operations were $1.23 per share compared with $1.26 per share a year ago, with the lower earnings year-to-date driven by the lower U.K. earnings in the first quarter of 2016 as a result of the RIIO-ED1 revenue reset that occurred in April of 2015. Vince will go into greater detail on second quarter results a little later in the call, but we're very pleased with the results for the second quarter and so far this year. 
Moving to Slide 5. Today, we're reaffirming our 2016 ongoing earnings forecast of $2.25 to $2.45 per share, with a midpoint of $2.35 per share. The higher-than-expected results in all of our business units so far this year gives us a high degree of confidence in our ability to meet our 2016 earnings forecast. We continue to execute our plans for sustainable growth across our 7 high-performing utilities, while delivering award-winning customer service, strengthening reliability and improving our efficiencies. And to reflect the current market for the pound, our 2016 forecast now assumes $1.30 per pound on our open positions. 
Turning to Slide 6. Looking beyond 2016, the fundamentals of the business remain strong and intact despite the recent U.K. vote to withdraw from the European Union and the resulting weakening of the British pound sterling exchange rates. The vote to leave the EU has created broader economic uncertainty in the U.K. and is clearly a unique event that has led to significant volatility in the currency and worldwide markets. Despite this reaction, there is no change in our underlying business in the U.K. Our revenues are set for 7 more years. We are essentially sheltered from an economic recession, since we would be made whole in future periods for any volume variances that may result from an economic slowdown in the U.K. And as a reminder, our base revenues are also adjusted for inflation using the Retail Price Index, or RPI. The July RPI forecast has actually already increased from the forecast published just a month ago in June. Further, we expect no change to our investment in infrastructure, since our business plans have already been accepted by Ofgem, the U.K. regulator. The volatility created in the currency markets, however, does have an impact on our U.S. dollar financial projections. The lower pound exchange rate will impact our translated earnings and the WPD dividend coming back to the U.S. 
Moving to Slide 7. We know that without providing updates to our earnings growth profile, there would continue to be uncertainty for investors as to our longer-term earnings profile given the sharp decline in the British pound exchange rates. With no near-term catalysts that would signal a move higher in the pound, we took action to update our business plans to reflect current market conditions, starting with the monetization of our existing 2017 and 2018 hedges, which I'll discuss in more detail shortly. 
Today, we're providing new earnings growth projections and a target dividend growth rate as well as updates to our U.K. cash repatriation and FX hedging strategies, all of which should provide clarity around our earnings and dividend targets through the end of the decade. The post-Brexit decline in the pound sterling drove our existing foreign currency hedges to be about $450 million in the money, which we don't believe is being appropriately reflected in PPL's stock price. We believe investors are largely valuing the company on an open basis, excluding the value of these hedges. As a result, we were looking for an opportunity to optimize the value of these existing hedges. We decided to monetize the gains associated with our 2017 and 2018 earnings hedges, capturing approximately $310 million in value. This monetization in combination with the higher-than-expected gains on the remaining 2016 hedges will offset lower expected cash repatriation amounts from the U.K., resulting from the lower expected exchange rate, providing about 5 to 6 years of coverage and will support the company's future dividend growth. 
Cashing in the hedges, though, did result in us remarking our future earnings using current market rates, which is expected to result in 2017 earnings being lower than 2016 earnings. Since we didn't think we were getting credit in the stock price for the hedges, we felt it was prudent to lock in the value of those hedges and protect the dividend growth despite the resetting of our future earnings. We have reestablished hedges for 2017 and 2018 at current foreign exchange rates at slightly higher hedge levels than existed prior to the monetization. We've updated our business plan to reflect current market conditions, including $1.30 foreign currency rate on unhedged positions from 2017 through 2020. Rehedging about 95% of the 2017 U.K. earnings at current rates protects the 2017 earnings guidance that we are providing today against any further near-term decline in the pound, and resetting our unhedged earnings in our business plan to the $1.30 exchange rate allows for potential upside to our earnings projections if there is a recovery in the pound. We're also announcing an update to our cash repatriation strategy, with an expectation of lower amounts being repatriated from the U.K. going forward. On an annual basis, we will determine the appropriate level of distributions from the U.K., taking into account foreign exchange rates as well as tax rates in both the U.S. and the U.K., but in the near-term, we anticipate that we would repatriate about $100 million to $200 million annually. Vince will provide more details on this updated strategy in his prepared remarks. 
The actions we have taken reinforce our dividend growth projections and reestablish a baseline of PPL earnings and future earnings growth reflective of the Brexit decision, the current market and our underlying business growth. 
Today, we're providing a 2017 guidance range of $2.05 to $2.25 per share for PPL, with a midpoint of $2.15 per share. We now expect per share compound annual earnings growth of 5% to 6% from 2017 through 2020, based on the midpoint of our 2017 guidance. 
Moving forward, we will continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and strong cash flows, and our investment-grade credit ratings remain unchanged, with a stable outlook. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, with the cash out of the hedges, we are not changing our expectation of a more meaningful dividend growth beginning in 2017. We're now targeting dividend growth of about 4% annually through the end of the decade. This will result in our total return proposition being projected to be in the 8% to 10% range over this period. While we were not expecting the U.K. to vote to leave the EU, after careful consideration and deliberation with our Board of Directors, we decided to take these actions now as it recognizes the reality of the current market conditions is reflective of the underlying growth of the business, and it enables us to focus our attention on providing safe, reliable service to customers and delivering long-term value for shareowners as opposed to being overly focused on the FX rate. 
Turning to Slide 8. We've prepared a walk from the midpoint of our 2016 earnings forecast of $2.35 per share to the $2.15 per share midpoint of our 2017 earnings forecast. As you can see on this slide, there is a $0.20 per share decline from 2016 to 2017, directly attributable to the impact of resetting the exchange rate to the updated hedge rate of $1.32 per pound. The U.K. earnings, excluding currency, are expected to be $0.04 lower in 2017 compared to 2016 as a result of lower incentive revenues that we've discussed on prior calls. The higher depreciation and interest expense is offset by the annual price increase under RIIO-ED1 in the U.K. We are forecasting both the Pennsylvania and Kentucky Regulated segments to be $0.02 higher in 2017 compared to 2016. In both cases, higher margins are driving the higher earnings. Corporate and other expenses are expected to be relatively flat year-over-year. 
Moving on to Slide 9. Our fundamental businesses -- business fundamentals rather and investment proposition have not changed significantly. We still expect strong compound annual rate base growth of about 5% from year-end 2016 through 2020, with rate base expected to grow to $29 billion by 2020. The constructive regulatory climate, in which we do business, is also the same. We still expect about 80% of our $12 billion infrastructure investment over the period to receive real-time recovery. Our core business is growing in support of our longer-term growth projection of 5% to 6% from 2017 through 2020. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Vince to walk you through a detailed look at segment earnings and a full review of the detailed assumptions used in planning for our updated guidance.

Let's move to Slide 11. Our second quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased by $0.07 per share, driven primarily by higher earnings from the Pennsylvania Regulated segment and the Kentucky Regulated segment, while the U.K. Regulated segment remained flat compared to a year ago. 
Corporate and other costs were slightly favorable compared to prior year. We should note that for the second quarter compared to prior year, domestic weather was relatively flat and weather was about $0.01 positive compared to budget. 
Let's move to a more detailed review of the second quarter segment earnings drivers, starting with the Pennsylvania results on Slide 12. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.11 per share in the second quarter of 2016, a $0.04 increase compared to the same period last year. This increase was primarily driven by higher gross margins due to higher distribution margins as a result of the 2015 rate case that became effective January 1, 2016, and higher transmission margins due to additional capital investments. 
Moving to Slide 13. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.11 per share in the second quarter of 2016, a $0.02 increase compared to a year ago. This result was primarily due to higher gross margins from higher base rates that were effective July 1 of last year. 
Turning to Slide 14. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.36 per share in the second quarter of 2016, the same as a year ago. This result was due to higher gross margins, primarily resulting from higher prices due to the April 1, 2016, price increase, partially offset by one month of lower prices from the April 1, 2015, price decrease from the commencement of RIIO-ED1. Higher margins were offset by higher depreciation and interest expense as a result of continued investment in CapEx, and lower O&M expense of $0.01 was offset by unfavorable FX of $0.01. 
Let's move to Slide 15 and take a closer look at our earnings growth drivers. As Bill discussed, we are initiating our 2017 earnings guidance range of $2.05 to $2.25 per share, with a midpoint of $2.15 per share. We now expect a 5% to 6% long-term compound annual growth rate off of the 2017 midpoint of $2.15 through the end of the decade. The key drivers in support of this new guidance include updating the GBP exchange rate to $1.30 per pound for all open positions and updating RPI using the July HM Treasury forecast for the U.K. economy. 
We have also updated our U.S. and U.K. interest rate and pension assumptions to incorporate a lower-for-longer interest rate environment. And as Bill indicated earlier, we're targeting a dividend growth rate of about 4% per year through 2020, starting in 2017. 
Our assumptions for the 6% to 8% growth profile our domestic utilities includes the same strong growth factors as previously discussed, including domestic rate base growth of about 5%, minimal load growth in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky, transmission spending under FERC formula rates in Pennsylvania of between $600 million and $700 million per year, totaling $2.6 billion over the 4 years; and between $350 million and $400 million a year of continued environmental investment in Kentucky at an ROE of 10%. 
Over the 4 years, we expect to spend about $1.5 billion of environmental CapEx in Kentucky. Just this week, the Kentucky Public Service Commission approved our $1 billion environmental cost recovery plan with a 9.8% ROE. 
Moving to the U.K. The updates to the business plan reflect the macroeconomic impact following the U.K. referendum. We now project 4% to 6% growth in the U.K. from '17 through '20. The plan incorporates $1.30 per pound FX rate on our unhedged earnings from 2017 through 2020. With the monetization of the 2017 and 2018 hedges, we entered into new hedges for those years at current market rates. I'll discuss the hedge levels and the average rates we obtained when we get to the foreign currency hedging status slide. 
RAV growth is expected to be 5.4% through 2020, driving segment ROEs in the 12% to 14% range. We've also incorporated an update on the U.K. incentive revenues. Estimates are now $85 million for 2017, between $80 million and $100 million for 2018 and between $95 million and $115 million for '19 and '20. These estimates for incentives were adjusted for the assumed change in exchange rates and RPI as well as expected performance against those targets. You will find our progress against the 2016 and 2017 regulatory year targets in the appendix to the presentation. 
WPD's performance continues to be very strong and is on track to beat the new target. We've incorporated new RPI assumptions to reflect the latest forecast published by HM Treasury in late July. This forecast shows a slight uptick in RPI from previous forecasts, and we continue to expect an effective tax rate in the U.K. of approximately 17%. 
Moving to Slide 16. I'd like to review our updated cash repatriation strategy from the U.K., as this strategy has been modified beyond just the lower FX rate. Our previous guidance on cash repatriation from the U.K. was to distribute between $300 million and $500 million per year, with a target of $400 million, assuming an FX rate of $1.60 per pound. We've previously indicated the amount of repatriation within that range would depend on a number of factors, including the FX rate. The targeted $400 million per year represented distributions of about GBP 250 million per year. That GBP 250 million translated at $1.30  would result in U.S. dollar distributions of about $325 million. This lower value of $75 million per year does not immediately impact us from a cash perspective, since the in-the-money hedge value of about $450 million provides about 5 to 6 years of coverage against that lower U.S. dollar amount. But while these hedges kept us whole from a cash perspective with a historically low FX rate and higher corporate tax rates in the U.S. versus the U.K., we have an opportunity to optimize our cash coming back from the U.K. even further. We are currently planning to repatriate between $100 million and $200 million per year in the near term. This lower cash amount will minimize the amount of translation impact on cash coming back from the U.K. at these historically low exchange rates. We will replace the lower repatriation level with debt in the U.S. Debt in the U.K., however, will be reduced by the same amount. Therefore, total debt at the PPL consolidated level will remain the same. This shift in borrowing from the U.K. to the U.S. captures the benefit of tax rate differential between the 2 countries. This benefit becomes even more pronounced as the U.K. continues to reduce their corporate tax rate. Since the distributions are reducing our U.K. tax basis, these lower distribution levels also extend our tax-efficient repatriation strategy well beyond our original expectation of 2021 or 2022. And on an annual basis, we will continue to evaluate the most efficient level of cash repatriation, taking into account prospective changes in the exchange rate, tax rates in both the U.K. and the U.S. as well as our overall tax strategy. 
Moving to Slide 17. The primary change to our revised capital plan is updating the U.K. projections for 2017 through 2020 based on an FX rate of $1.30 compared to the $1.60 previously used and to an average rate of $1.37 for 2016. We are not projecting any impact on the U.K. capital forecast in local currency, as those business plans have been accepted by Ofgem. On a U.S. dollar basis, we are now investing approximately $1 billion annually in each of our 3 business lines, and the 5-year spending plan from 2016 through 2020 is about $15.4 billion. 
Moving to Slide 18. We have also updated our rate base growth projections and have shown updated RAV balances to reflect the $1.30 FX rate assumption. Our overall growth rate of 5% has decreased slightly, as we have reset our base year to 2016. And to enhance comparability, we have assumed $1.30 per pound for all periods. 
Moving to Slide 19. As we've discussed earlier, at the same time we monetize the 2017 and 2018 hedges, we put new hedges on at slightly higher levels at current market rates. You can see our average hedge levels for 2017 and 2018 and the average rates we achieved when we put the new hedges on. We used forward contracts to hedge 2017, which locks in from an FX perspective the new guidance we just provided for 2017. However, we used a combination of forward contracts and zero-cost collars to rehedge 2018, providing us with some potential upside if the pound appreciates before then. The average hedge rates noted on the slide are based on the forwards and the floors in the collars for 2018. So we've protected the downside below $1.30, but retained some upside potential above the rate shown on the slide. We've also provided updated sensitivities, which show there is more upside potential for 2018 than downside risk given the collars. But the rule of thumb of a $0.01 movement in the FX rate equaling a $0.01 movement in EPS still applies for a fully open year by 2019. 
Moving to Slide 20. On this slide, our updated forecast assumptions are shown for RPI, again, using the July HM Treasury forecast of the U.K. economy. The rates for 2017, '18 and '19 have been incorporated into our updated revenue projection. As a result, the RPI sensitivity for 0.5% movement is now off our updated forecast and would increase or decrease earnings by $0.02 in 2018. I know that was a lot of information, so let me just recap. We felt the most appropriate course of action in light of Brexit was to, one, monetize the large mark-to-market value of the hedges, which enables us to preserve our dividend growth strategy for the PPL dividend; two, update our business plan to assume $1.30 per pound FX rate for all open positions, thus, rebasing our earnings projections for 2017 forward; three, provide a very clear path for earnings growth beyond 2017 through the end of the decade based on the underlying growth of both the U.S. and U.K. businesses; and four, optimize our strategy of U.K. cash distributions back to the U.S. by lowering the amount of distributions to the minimum required, capturing the tax rate differential between the U.S. and the U.K. and preserving our tax-efficient cash repatriation strategy for significantly longer. An added benefit of this approach is that if the pound or RPI increases over time, there will be upside to the new EPS forecast and growth rates we just provided. That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call over to Bill for the question-and-answer period. Bill?"

Before we take your questions, let me just say that we had another strong quarter, and we remain confident on our plans for future growth. I believe today's actions are very important because they provide clarity and transparency in our response to the U.K.'s decision to exit the EU. By providing longer-term earnings expectations, our actions also illustrate the confidence we have in the strong business fundamentals of our 7 high-performing utilities. It was clear to us that the volatility in our stock was correlated to changes in the pound, and the benefits of our financial hedges were not being reflected in our valuation.

Clearly, Brexit was a unique event, but our positive view of the U.K. business model remains unchanged. PPL's senior management team is committed to delivering 5% to 6% annual earnings growth through 2020.

I just have one clarifying question, and I thought your presentation was pretty clear. But when you look at the balance sheets of the U.K. versus the U.S. entities, presumably before you were going to be leveraging up a little bit in the U.K. in order to repatriate that cash, now you're going to have a higher equity capitalization in the U.K., but where on the U.S. corporate structure are you going to be issuing the incremental leverage? And how does that change in the capital structure in the U.K. flow through the U.K. earnings, essentially because you have an 8-year deal? The real cost of capital will essentially now be slightly different than the higher projected cost of capital. I'm sorry I'm asking a belabored question, but I just want a little more details on how to bridge the cash flow."

I think as we've also -- when we come out and kind of reset our earnings, we wanted to make sure we had a strong degree of confidence in those earnings that we were coming out within the growth rates that we provided. As we talked with economists in the U.K., banks, a number of banks both in the U.K., here in the U.S., I think there was some view that in the back half of '16, there could be some additional pressure on the pound. I think the consensus estimate for the back half of '16 is about $1.28, but I think there are some that show $1.20 to $1.30. And then '17, I would say consensus is kind of in that $1.30 to $1.35 range. Coincidentally, the collars that we put on basically give us an effective collar of $1.30 to $1.36, so right in line kind of with consensus estimates for the pound over the next, say, 1.5 years. So I think from our perspective, it was a win-win. We got to take the cash. Also, the reason why we didn't take off the 2016 hedges that's supporting our $2.35 guidance that we reaffirmed today, plus again if the bias is for the pound to go down a little bit more in the short term, those hedges will be more in the money. So I think, as we just took the whole position and thought about it holistically, it made sense to put the hedges back on at the current market. Also I think when you look at the hedge program and the way the stock trades in normal, say, FX conditions, I think the hedges work very well, and we do get the credit for the hedges. It's in these extreme cases where we tend to trade on a fully open basis. And if $1.30 is the new norm, we would expect, and I think investors would expect us to rehedge."

But most of those, Steve, would be pretty late in this decade into the next decade. So no real significant spending on those bigger projects until probably you get out to 2019, 2020 and even then it would probably be a slow build and then really more significant in the '21-'22 time frame. But we continue to look at some competitive transmission projects both within PJM and outside of PJM, none of which are embedded in our guidance. So those margins would all be upside to the plan."

With me are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; as well as the Presidents of our U.S. and U.K. utility businesses. 
Starting with Slide 3. Our agenda this morning begins with an overview of our quarterly and year-to-date 2016 earnings results. Following that, I'll address our 2016 and 2017 earnings forecast as we are raising the midpoint of our 2016 forecast and reaffirming our 2017 guidance. I'll provide a brief operational overview as well as an update on our U.K. currency hedging. Following my remarks, Vince will review our segment results and provide a more detailed financial overview. As always, we'll leave time to answer questions. 
Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced third quarter 2016 reported earnings of $0.69 [ph] per share compared with reported earnings of $0.58 per share in the third quarter of 2015. Year-to-date through the third quarter, reported earnings were $2.11 per share compared with $0.42 per share through the same period a year ago. Reported earnings for the first 9 months of 2015 reflected a loss from discontinued operations of $1.36 per share, which resulted primarily from the spin-off of our competitive generation business. 
Adjusting for special items, third quarter 2016 earnings from ongoing operations were $0.63 [ph] per share compared with $0.51 [ph] per share a year ago. That represents a 23% increase on a per-share basis. The increase was driven largely by an April 1, 2016, price increase in the U.K., higher base electricity rates and higher transmission earnings from additional transmission capital investments in Pennsylvania and higher sales volumes due to favorable weather in Kentucky. 
Through the first 9 months of 2016, earnings from ongoing operations were $1.86 per share compared with $1.77 per share a year ago. 
Higher earnings year-to-date were primarily driven by higher base rates in Kentucky and Pennsylvania and returns on additional capital investments. Vince will go into greater detail on third quarter results a little later in the call, but we're pleased with the strong results across our business units. 
Moving to Slide 5. Based on our strong performance year-to-date, we've narrowed our guidance range from the previous $2.25 to $2.45 per share to $2.30 to $2.45 per share, increasing the midpoint of our 2016 ongoing earnings forecast from $2.35 per share to $2.38 per share. Vince will provide a walk on the drivers contributing to this 2016 increased performance later in his remarks. 
As we discussed on our October 12 call, we took steps to significantly reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk by restriking our remaining in the money 2016 hedges. The impact to 2016 ongoing earnings was a negative $0.06 [ph], but because of our strong business line results, we're increasing our 2016 earnings guidance even as we've leveraged the strength of our 26 [ph] performance -- 2016 performance, rather, to minimize future currency risk. 
We also discussed on the October 12 call the opportunity to further leverage 2017 hedge gains targeting no more than $0.05 of EPS exposure for 2019 even at an exchange rate of $1.15 per pound. 
As of today, we've completed all the restrikes for 2016 and 2017, and we've achieved our targeted hedge levels. Vince will provide the details of our updated hedge positions in his remarks. 
The higher-than-projected earnings in 2017 that enabled us to restrike a portion of our 2017 hedges was partially driven by lower-than-anticipated U.K. property taxes. In the revised earnings guidance, we provided on the second quarter call, we were expecting fairly significant property tax increases starting next year and continuing through 2020. But based on the property tax valuation recently completed by the U.K. government, our property tax increases are lower compared to our previous expectation. 
Additionally, some of the earnings strength we are experiencing in 2016 as a result of lower O&M in the U.K. is expected to continue into 2017. These positive factors provide us with the confidence to reaffirm our 2017 earnings forecast of $2.05 to $2.25 per share with a midpoint of $2.15 per share despite executing about $0.06 of 2017 hedge restrikes. 
Lastly, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our long-term growth projections. We expect to achieve 5% to 6% compound annual earnings growth from 2017 to 2020 and are targeting annual dividend growth of about 4% over the same period. 
Let's move to Slide 6. Kentucky utilities and [indiscernible] gas and electric are announcing today that they intend to file rate request on November 23 with the Kentucky Public Service Commission. KU and LG&E expected to seek revenue increases of $103 million and $93 million, respectively, through adjustments to annual base electric rates. 
LG&E meanwhile anticipates seeking a revenue increase of $14 [ph] million in annual base natural gas rates. 
In total, we're expecting to seek the revenue increase of approximately $210 million. 
The requested increases are driven by additional capital investments that are focused on enhancing our reliability programs across the operational groups, along with technology and infrastructure investments in our customer service areas. This will allow us to continue to provide safe, reliable electric and gas service to customers while meeting federal regulations. 
Even with the increases, it's anticipated that LG&E and KU rates will remain well below national averages. 
If approved by the commission, the increases would take effect in July of 2017. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7 for some additional operational highlights. In Kentucky, KU and LG&E will be seeking approval to invest in an advanced metering system and a distribution automation program as part of their rate case proceeding. 
They will include applications for certificates of public convenience and necessity for implementing these new initiatives, which focus on enhancing service offerings to customers with a continued emphasis on the reliability. 
In recognition of continued efforts to focus on the customer experience, LG&E ranked highest among mid-sized gas utilities in the Midwest. In J.D. Power's 2016 survey, a residential customer satisfaction. This J.D Power award is the third by PPL Utility this year and the 41st overall for PPL companies, demonstrating our commitment to provide customers with the highest level of service. 
As we highlighted on our second quarter call, both PPL Electric Utilities and Kentucky Utilities earned J.D. Power award in July. 
In Pennsylvania, PPL Electric Utilities is on track to execute more than $1 billion in capital improvements to modernize the grid and strengthen reliability for our customers. The company's automated power restoration system has now restored within minutes more than 58,000 customers since that system became fully operational this past June. 
We also continued to add new smart devices to extend these benefits and improve grid resiliency even more. The company is also completing preparations to replace 1.4 million meters in Pennsylvania with new smart meters. The meter replacements are expected to begin before the end of the year and the full $471 million project is expected to be completed by 2019. 
Transmission expansion also continues, with additional investments focused on reinforcing, expanding and hardening the bulk power system, adding redundancy and making the grid more secure. 
In the U.K., we continue to execute on our plans. And while there are still considerable time left in the current regulatory year, we're on pace to achieve our projected performance against the 2016, 2017 incentive targets for customer minutes lost and customers interruptions. In addition, we're on pace to be at/or near the maximum reward levels for customer satisfaction. 
We provided updates to incentive revenue performance in Slides 20 to 22 of the appendix. 
Also in the U.K., we're leading the way according to the regulator [indiscernible] in connecting renewable generation to local distribution networks. 
To date, we've connected or offered to connect almost 20 gigawatts of renewable power. We've already connected approximately 200,000 private solar installations, along with 7,500 commercial distributed generation facilities. 
The company has also launched what we believe to be the world's largest electric vehicle trial to explore charging patterns and the ability of markets to influence those patterns. The trial involving up to 700 vehicles will inform future network planning. 
And finally, as I've already discussed, we have taken steps to reduce our 2018 and 2019 exposure to foreign currency. 
Vince will now walk you through a more detailed look at earnings and our hedging strategy. Vince?"

Let's move to Slide 9. Our third quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased by $0.12 per share driven by $0.05 of higher earnings from the Pennsylvania Regulated segment, $0.02 from the Kentucky Regulat",896,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 9. Our third quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased by $0.12 per share driven by $0.05 of higher earnings from the Pennsylvania Regulated segment, $0.02 from the Kentucky Regulated segments and $0.06 from the U.K. Regulated segment. 
We should note that for the third quarter, we saw warmer weather compared to last year, and as a result, domestic weather was favorable $0.03 compared to last year and weather was about $0.02 positive compared to budget. 
However, with the warmer winter earlier this year, on a year-to-date basis, domestic weather is only positive about $0.01 compared to budget. 
Year-to-date weather in the U.K. is negative $0.01 compared to the prior year and negative $0.02 compared to budget. 
So for the company in total, weather has not been a significant driver of our financial performance this year. 
Let's move to a more detailed review of the second quarter segment earnings drivers, starting with the Pennsylvania results on Slide 10. 
Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.13 [ph] per share in the third quarter of 2016, a $0.05 increase compared to the same period last year. This increase was primarily driven by higher gross margins due to higher distribution margins as a result of new rates going to effect January 1 of this year, higher transmission margins due to additional capital investments and the favorable effects of weather. 
Moving to Slide 11. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.18 per share in the third quarter of 2016, a $0.02 increase compared to a year ago. This result was primarily due to higher gross margins due to favorable weather. 
Turning to Slide 12. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.35 per share in the third quarter of 2016, a $0.06 increase compared to a year ago. This result was primarily driven by higher gross margins, primarily resulting from higher prices from the April 1, 2016, price increase, partially offset by lower volumes due to weather and lower O&M expense, including pension expense. 
Moving to Slide 13. As Bill mentioned, strong performance at each of our regulated utilities led to very solid results due to first 9 months of the year compared to our plan, enabling us to raise our 2016 guidance. This slide provides a walk from the midpoint of our original 2016 earnings guidance of $2.35 per share to our new forecasted midpoint of $2.38 per share. 
The $0.03 improvement in the forecast is coming from $0.02 in Pennsylvania and $0.01 in Kentucky. 
While we were experiencing better-than-expected earnings in the U.K. as well, that was fully offset by the $0.06 of 2016 restrikes. The outperformance to the U.K. is driven by higher margins as well as lower operating expenses. 
In Pennsylvania, we are expecting higher margins from favorable weather and usage as well as higher transmission margins. In Kentucky, we are expecting slightly lower operating expenses. 
Additionally, across all the segments we are seeing lower interest expense from lower interest rates and deferrals of debt issuances in part due to caching in $310 million of 2017 and 2018 U.K. earnings hedges. 
Moving to Slide 14. As we discussed on our October 12 call, we took action in early October to restrike our remaining in the money 2016 hedges to hedge more of our 2018 exposure. Since the call, we have taken additional action and have completed the execution of the 2017 restrikes, further increasing our hedge levels for 2018. 
You can see we are now hedged 94% for 2017 at an average hedge rate over $1.25 per pound. We are well hedged for 2018 as a result of the actions we've taken. 
The combined results of the 2016 and '17 restrikes is that we have increased our 2018 hedge levels to 93% at an average hedge rate of $1.42 per pound. This creates the flexibility to restrike about $0.12 of 2018 hedge gain to help hedge 2019 earnings at our budgeted rate of $1.30 [ph] per pound. 
The 2019 hedge attainment table reflects the targeted hedge levels in 2019 assuming we restrike 2018 hedge gains and layer on 2019 hedges at our budgeted rate. So if market rates are around $1.20 per pound when we execute the 2018 restrike, we would be able to hedge 100% of 2019 earnings at our budgeted rate, leaving no additional currency exposure for 2019. 
If market rates were to drop to $1.15 [ph] per pound at the time we execute the 2018 restrikes, we would be able to hedge about 73% of 2019 earnings, leaving about $0.04 of exposure on the remaining open position. 
In the bottom right part of the chart, we also show sensitivities on the open position at various market rates from $1.15 [ph] to $1.45 per pound. 
To the extent the incremental hedge value that we've created in 2018, is not needed to hedge 2019 earnings, which would be the case if the pound rebounds closer to our budgeted rate, we could use it to hedge 2020 earnings. 
And before I turn the call back over to Bill, you will find an update on RPI in the appendix on Slide 23. That slide has been updated for the October RPI forecast from [indiscernible] Treasury and is consistent with our forecast with assumptions. 
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn it back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period. Bill?"

The actions we're taken as part of our foreign currency hedging strategy has substantially minimized foreign currency risk through 2019 and provide greater assurance to our earnings growth targets.

Our agenda this",1387,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for today's call. With me are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; as well as the Presidents of our U.S. and U.K. Utility Businesses. 
Starting with Slide 3. Our agenda this morning begins with an overview of our quarterly and year-to-date 2016 earnings results. Following that, I'll address our 2016 and 2017 earnings forecast as we are raising the midpoint of our 2016 forecast and reaffirming our 2017 guidance. I'll provide a brief operational overview as well as an update on our U.K. currency hedging. Following my remarks, Vince will review our segment results and provide a more detailed financial overview. As always, we'll leave time to answer your questions. 
Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced third quarter 2016 reported earnings of $0.69 per share, compared with reported earnings of $0.58 per share in the third quarter of 2015. Year-to-date through the third quarter, reported earnings were $2.11 per share, compared with $0.42 per share through the same period a year ago. Reported earnings for the first 9 months of 2015 reflected a loss from discontinued operations of $1.36 per share, which resulted primarily from the spin-off of our competitive generation business. 
Adjusting for special items, third quarter 2016 earnings from ongoing operations were $0.63 per share, compared with $0.51 per share a year ago. That represents a 23% increase on a per share basis. The increase was driven largely by an April 1, 2016, price increase in the U.K., higher base electricity rates and higher transmission earnings from additional transmission capital investments in Pennsylvania and higher sales volumes due to favorable weather in Kentucky. Through the first 9 months of 2016, earnings from ongoing operations were $1.86 per share, compared with $1.77 per share a year ago. 
Higher earnings year-to-date were primarily driven by higher base rates in Kentucky and Pennsylvania and returns on additional capital investments. Vince will go into greater detail on third quarter results a little later in the call, but we're pleased with the strong results across our business units. 
Moving to Slide 5. Based on our strong performance year-to-date, we've narrowed our guidance range from the previous $2.25 to $2.45 per share to $2.30 to $2.45 per share, increasing the midpoint of our 2016 ongoing earnings forecast from $2.35 per share to $2.38 per share. Vince will provide a walk on the drivers contributing to this 2016 increased performance later in his remarks. 
As we discussed on our October 12 call, we took steps to significantly reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk by restriking our remaining in-the-money 2016 hedges. The impact to 2016 ongoing earnings was a negative $0.06, but because of our strong business line results, we're increasing our 2016 earnings guidance even as we've leveraged the strength of our 26 performance -- 2016 performance, rather, to minimize future currency risk. We also discussed on the October 12 call the opportunity to further leverage 2017 hedge gains, targeting no more than $0.05 of EPS exposure for 2019, even at an exchange rate of $1.15 per pound. 
As of today, we've completed all the restrikes for 2016 and 2017, and we've achieved our targeted hedge levels. Vince will provide the details of our updated hedge positions in his remarks. 
The higher-than-projected earnings in 2017 that enabled us to restrike a portion of our 2017 hedges was partially driven by lower-than-anticipated U.K. property taxes. In the revised earnings guidance we provided on the second quarter call, we were expecting fairly significant property tax increases starting next year and continuing through 2020. But based on the property tax valuation recently completed by the U.K. government, our property tax increases are lower compared to our previous expectation. 
Additionally, some of the earnings strength we are experiencing in 2016 as a result of lower O&M in the U.K. is expected to continue into 2017. These positive factors provide us with the confidence to reaffirm our 2017 earnings forecast of $2.05 to $2.25 per share, with a midpoint of $2.15 per share, despite executing about $0.06 of 2017 hedge restrikes. 
Lastly, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our long-term growth projections. We expect to achieve 5% to 6% compound annual earnings growth from 2017 to 2020 and are targeting annual dividend growth of about 4% over the same period. 
Let's move to Slide 6. Kentucky Utilities and Louisville Gas and Electric are announcing today that they intend to file a rate request on November 23 with the Kentucky Public Service Commission. KU and LG&E expect to seek revenue increases of $103 million and $93 million, respectively, through adjustments to annual base electric rates. LG&E meanwhile anticipates seeking a revenue increase of $14 million in annual base natural gas rates. In total, we're expecting to seek the revenue increase of approximately $210 million. 
The requested increases are driven by additional capital investments that are focused on enhancing our reliability programs across the operational groups, along with technology and infrastructure investments in our customer service areas. This will allow us to continue to provide safe, reliable electric and gas service to customers while meeting federal regulations. Even with the increases, it's anticipated that LG&E and KU rates will remain well below national averages. If approved by the commission, the increases would take effect in July of 2017. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7 for some additional operational highlights. In Kentucky, KU and LG&E will be seeking approval to invest in an advanced metering system and a distribution automation program as part of their rate case proceeding. They will include applications for certificates of public convenience and necessity for implementing these new initiatives, which focus on enhancing service offerings to customers with a continued emphasis on our reliability. 
In recognition of continued efforts to focus on the customer experience, LG&E ranked highest among midsized gas utilities in the Midwest, in J.D. Power's 2016 survey, a residential customer satisfaction. This J.D. Power award is the third by PPL Utility this year and the 41st overall for PPL companies, demonstrating our commitment to provide customers with the highest level of service. As we highlighted on our second quarter call, both PPL Electric Utilities and Kentucky Utilities earned J.D. Power awards in July. 
In Pennsylvania, PPL Electric Utilities is on track to execute more than $1 billion in capital improvements to modernize the grid and strengthen reliability for our customers. The company's automated power restoration system has now restored within minutes more than 58,000 customers since that system became fully operational this past June. 
We also continue to add new smart devices to extend these benefits and improve grid resiliency even more. The company is also completing preparations to replace 1.4 million meters in Pennsylvania with new smart meters. The meter replacements are expected to begin before the end of the year and the full $471 million project is expected to be completed by 2019. Transmission expansion also continues with additional investments focused on reinforcing, expanding and hardening the bulk power system, adding redundancy and making the grid more secure. 
In the U.K., we continue to execute on our plans. And while there are still considerable time left in the current regulatory year, we're on pace to achieve our projected performance against the 2016, 2017 incentive targets for customer minutes lost and customer interruptions. In addition, we're on pace to be at or near the maximum reward levels for customer satisfaction. We've provided updates to our incentive revenue performance in Slides 20 to 22 of the appendix. 
Also in the U.K., we're leading the way according to the regulator, Ofgem, in connecting renewable generation to local distribution networks. To date, we've connected or offered to connect almost 20 gigawatts of renewable power. We've already connected approximately 200,000 private solar installations, along with 7,500 commercial distributed generation facilities. The company has also launched what we believe to be the world's largest electric vehicle trial to explore charging patterns and the ability of markets to influence those patterns. The trial, involving up to 700 vehicles, will inform future network planning. 
And finally, as I've already discussed, we have taken steps to reduce our 2018 and 2019 exposure to foreign currency. Vince will now walk you through a more detailed look at earnings and our hedging strategy. Vince?"

Let's move to Slide 9. Our third quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased by $0.12 per share driven by $0.05 of higher earnings from the Pennsylvania Regulated segment, $0.02 from the Kentucky Regulat",890,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 9. Our third quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased by $0.12 per share driven by $0.05 of higher earnings from the Pennsylvania Regulated segment, $0.02 from the Kentucky Regulated segment and $0.06 from the U.K. Regulated segment. 
We should note that for the third quarter, we saw warmer weather compared to last year. And as a result, domestic weather was favorable $0.03 compared to last year, and weather was about $0.02 positive compared to budget. However, with the warmer winter earlier this year, on a year-to-date basis, domestic weather is only positive about $0.01 compared to budget. 
Year-to-date weather in the U.K. is negative $0.01 compared to the prior year and negative $0.02 compared to budget. So for the company in total, weather has not been a significant driver of our financial performance this year. 
Let's move to a more detailed review of the second quarter segment earnings drivers starting with the Pennsylvania results on Slide 10. 
Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.13 per share in the third quarter of 2016, a $0.05 increase compared to the same period last year. This increase was primarily driven by higher gross margins due to higher distribution margin as a result of new rates going into effect January 1 of this year, higher transmission margins due to additional capital investments and the favorable effects of weather. 
Moving to Slide 11. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.18 per share in the third quarter of 2016, a $0.02 increase compared to a year ago. This result was primarily due to higher gross margins due to favorable weather. 
Turning to Slide 12. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.35 per share in the third quarter of 2016, a $0.06 increase compared to a year ago. This result was primarily driven by higher gross margins, primarily resulting from higher prices from the April 1, 2016, price increase, partially offset by lower volumes due to weather and lower O&M expense, including pension expense. 
Moving to Slide 13. As Bill mentioned, strong performance at each of our regulated utilities led to very solid results to the first 9 months of the year compared to our plan, enabling us to raise our 2016 guidance. This slide provides a walk from the midpoint of our original 2016 earnings guidance of $2.35 per share to our new forecasted midpoint of $2.38 per share. The $0.03 improvement in the forecast is coming from $0.02 in Pennsylvania and $0.01 in Kentucky. While we were experiencing better-than-expected earnings in the U.K. as well, that was fully offset by the $0.06 of 2016 restrikes. The outperformance in the U.K. is driven by higher margins as well as lower operating expenses. 
In Pennsylvania, we are expecting higher margins from favorable weather and usage as well as higher transmission margins. In Kentucky, we are expecting slightly lower operating expenses. Additionally, across all the segments we, are seeing lower interest expense from lower interest rates and deferrals of debt issuances in part due to cashing in $310 million of 2017 and 2018 U.K. earnings hedges. 
Moving to Slide 14. As we discussed on our October 12 call, we took action in early October to restrike our remaining in-the-money 2016 hedges to hedge more of our 2018 exposure. Since the call, we have taken additional action and have completed the execution of the 2017 restrikes, further increasing our hedge levels for 2018. You can see we are now hedged 94% for 2017 at an average hedged rate of $1.25 per pound. We are well hedged for 2018 as a result of the actions we've taken. 
The combined result of the 2016 and '17 restrikes is that we have increased our 2018 hedge levels to 93% at an average hedged rate of $1.42 per pound. This creates the flexibility to restrike about $0.12 of 2018 hedge gains to help hedge 2019 earnings at our budgeted rate of $1.30 per pound. The 2019 hedge attainment table reflects the targeted hedge levels in 2019 assuming we restrike 2018 hedge gains and layer on 2019 hedges at our budgeted rate. So if market rates are around $1.20 per pound when we execute the 2018 restrike, we would be able to hedge 100% of 2019 earnings at our budgeted rate, leaving no additional currency exposure for 2019. If market rates were to drop to $1.15 per pound at the time we execute the 2018 restrikes, we would be able to hedge about 73% of 2019 earnings, leaving about $0.04 of exposure on the remaining open position. 
In the bottom right part of the chart, we also show sensitivities on the open position at various market rates from $1.15 to $1.45 per pound. To the extent the incremental hedge value that we've created in 2018 is not needed to hedge 2019 earnings, which would be the case if the pound rebounds closer to our budgeted rate, we could use it to hedge 2020 earnings. 
And before I turn the call back over to Bill, you will find an update on RPI in the appendix on Slide 23. That slide has been updated for the October RPI forecast from HM Treasury and is consistent with our forecast with assumptions. 
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn it back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period. Bill?"

Our agenda this",1387,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for today's call. With me are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; as well as the Presidents of our U.S. and U.K. Utility Businesses. 
Starting with Slide 3. Our agenda this morning begins with an overview of our quarterly and year-to-date 2016 earnings results. Following that, I'll address our 2016 and 2017 earnings forecast as we are raising the midpoint of our 2016 forecast and reaffirming our 2017 guidance. I'll provide a brief operational overview as well as an update on our U.K. currency hedging. Following my remarks, Vince will review our segment results and provide a more detailed financial overview. As always, we'll leave time to answer your questions. 
Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced third quarter 2016 reported earnings of $0.69 per share, compared with reported earnings of $0.58 per share in the third quarter of 2015. Year-to-date through the third quarter, reported earnings were $2.11 per share, compared with $0.42 per share through the same period a year ago. Reported earnings for the first 9 months of 2015 reflected a loss from discontinued operations of $1.36 per share, which resulted primarily from the spin-off of our competitive generation business. 
Adjusting for special items, third quarter 2016 earnings from ongoing operations were $0.63 per share, compared with $0.51 per share a year ago. That represents a 23% increase on a per share basis. The increase was driven largely by an April 1, 2016, price increase in the U.K., higher base electricity rates and higher transmission earnings from additional transmission capital investments in Pennsylvania and higher sales volumes due to favorable weather in Kentucky. Through the first 9 months of 2016, earnings from ongoing operations were $1.86 per share, compared with $1.77 per share a year ago. 
Higher earnings year-to-date were primarily driven by higher base rates in Kentucky and Pennsylvania and returns on additional capital investments. Vince will go into greater detail on third quarter results a little later in the call, but we're pleased with the strong results across our business units. 
Moving to Slide 5. Based on our strong performance year-to-date, we've narrowed our guidance range from the previous $2.25 to $2.45 per share to $2.30 to $2.45 per share, increasing the midpoint of our 2016 ongoing earnings forecast from $2.35 per share to $2.38 per share. Vince will provide a walk on the drivers contributing to this 2016 increased performance later in his remarks. 
As we discussed on our October 12 call, we took steps to significantly reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk by restriking our remaining in-the-money 2016 hedges. The impact to 2016 ongoing earnings was a negative $0.06, but because of our strong business line results, we're increasing our 2016 earnings guidance even as we've leveraged the strength of our 26 performance -- 2016 performance, rather, to minimize future currency risk. We also discussed on the October 12 call the opportunity to further leverage 2017 hedge gains, targeting no more than $0.05 of EPS exposure for 2019, even at an exchange rate of $1.15 per pound. 
As of today, we've completed all the restrikes for 2016 and 2017, and we've achieved our targeted hedge levels. Vince will provide the details of our updated hedge positions in his remarks. 
The higher-than-projected earnings in 2017 that enabled us to restrike the portion of our 2017 hedges was partially driven by lower-than-anticipated U.K. property taxes. In the revised earnings guidance we provided on the second quarter call, we were expecting fairly significant property tax increases starting next year and continuing through 2020. But based on the property tax valuation recently completed by the U.K. government, our property tax increases are lower compared to our previous expectation. 
Additionally, some of the earnings strength we are experiencing in 2016 as a result of lower O&M in the U.K. is expected to continue into 2017. These positive factors provide us with the confidence to reaffirm our 2017 earnings forecast of $2.05 to $2.25 per share, with a midpoint of $2.15 per share, despite executing about $0.06 of 2017 hedge restrikes. 
Lastly, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our long-term growth projections. We expect to achieve 5% to 6% compound annual earnings growth from 2017 to 2020 and are targeting annual dividend growth of about 4% over the same period. 
Let's move to Slide 6. Kentucky Utilities and Louisville Gas and Electric are announcing today that they intend to file a rate request on November 23 with the Kentucky Public Service Commission. KU and LG&E expect to seek revenue increases of $103 million and $93 million, respectively, through adjustments to annual base electric rates. LG&E meanwhile anticipates seeking a revenue increase of $14 million in annual base natural gas rates. In total, we're expecting to seek the revenue increase of approximately $210 million. 
The requested increases are driven by additional capital investments that are focused on enhancing our reliability programs across the operational groups, along with technology and infrastructure investments in our customer service areas. This will allow us to continue to provide safe, reliable electric and gas service to customers while meeting federal regulations. Even with the increases, it's anticipated that LG&E and KU rates will remain well below national averages. If approved by the commission, the increases would take effect in July of 2017. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7 for some additional operational highlights. In Kentucky, KU and LG&E will be seeking approval to invest in an advanced metering system and a distribution automation program as part of their rate case proceeding. They will include applications for certificates of public convenience and necessity for implementing these new initiatives, which focus on enhancing service offerings to customers with a continued emphasis on our reliability. 
In recognition of continued efforts to focus on the customer experience, LG&E ranked highest among midsized gas utilities in the Midwest, in J.D. Power's 2016 survey, a residential customer satisfaction. This J.D. Power award is the third by PPL Utility this year and the 41st overall for PPL companies, demonstrating our commitment to provide customers with the highest level of service. As we highlighted on our second quarter call, both PPL Electric Utilities and Kentucky Utilities earned J.D. Power awards in July. 
In Pennsylvania, PPL Electric Utilities is on track to execute more than $1 billion in capital improvements to modernize the grid and strengthen reliability for our customers. The company's automated power restoration system has now restored within minutes more than 58,000 customers since that system became fully operational this past June. 
We also continue to add new smart devices to extend these benefits and improve grid resiliency even more. The company is also completing preparations to replace 1.4 million meters in Pennsylvania with new smart meters. The meter replacements are expected to begin before the end of the year and the full $471 million project is expected to be completed by 2019. Transmission expansion also continues with additional investments focused on reinforcing, expanding and hardening the bulk power system, adding redundancy and making the grid more secure. 
In the U.K., we continue to execute on our plans. And while there are still considerable time left in the current regulatory year, we're on pace to achieve our projected performance against the 2016, 2017 incentive targets for customer minutes lost and customer interruptions. In addition, we're on pace to be at or near the maximum reward levels for customer satisfaction. We've provided updates to our incentive revenue performance in Slides 20 to 22 of the appendix. 
Also in the U.K., we're leading the way according to the regulator, Ofgem, in connecting renewable generation to local distribution networks. To date, we've connected or offered to connect almost 20 gigawatts of renewable power. We've already connected approximately 200,000 private solar installations, along with 7,500 commercial distributed generation facilities. The company has also launched what we believe to be the world's largest electric vehicle trial to explore charging patterns and the ability of markets to influence those patterns. The trial, involving up to 700 vehicles, will inform future network planning. 
And finally, as I've already discussed, we have taken steps to reduce our 2018 and 2019 exposure to foreign currency. Vince will now walk you through a more detailed look at earnings and our hedging strategy. Vince?"

Let's move to Slide 9.

Let's move to Slide 9. Our third quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased by $0.12 per share driven by $0.05 of higher earnings from the Pennsylvania Regulated segment, $0.02 from the Kentucky Regulated segment and $0.06 from the U.K. Regulated segment. 
We should note that for the third quarter, we saw warmer weather compared to last year. And as a result, domestic weather was favorable $0.03 compared to last year, and weather was about $0.02 positive compared to budget. However, with the warmer winter earlier this year, on a year-to-date basis, domestic weather is only positive about $0.01 compared to budget. 
Year-to-date weather in the U.K. is negative $0.01 compared to the prior year and negative $0.02 compared to budget. So for the company in total, weather has not been a significant driver of our financial performance this year. 
Let's move to a more detailed review of the second quarter segment earnings drivers starting with the Pennsylvania results on Slide 10. 
Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.13 per share in the third quarter of 2016, a $0.05 increase compared to the same period last year. This increase was primarily driven by higher gross margins due to higher distribution margin as a result of new rates going into effect January 1 of this year, higher transmission margins due to additional capital investments and the favorable effects of weather. 
Moving to Slide 11. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.18 per share in the third quarter of 2016, a $0.02 increase compared to a year ago. This result was primarily due to higher gross margins due to favorable weather. 
Turning to Slide 12. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.35 per share in the third quarter of 2016, a $0.06 increase compared to a year ago. This result was primarily driven by higher gross margins, primarily resulting from higher prices from the April 1, 2016, price increase, partially offset by lower volumes due to weather and lower O&M expense, including pension expense. 
Moving to Slide 13. As Bill mentioned, strong performance at each of our regulated utilities led to very solid results to the first 9 months of the year compared to our plan, enabling us to raise our 2016 guidance. This slide provides a walk from the midpoint of our original 2016 earnings guidance of $2.35 per share to our new forecasted midpoint of $2.38 per share. The $0.03 improvement in the forecast is coming from $0.02 in Pennsylvania and $0.01 in Kentucky. While we were experiencing better-than-expected earnings in the U.K. as well, that was fully offset by the $0.06 of 2016 restrikes. The outperformance in the U.K. is driven by higher margins as well as lower operating expenses. 
In Pennsylvania, we are expecting higher margins from favorable weather and usage as well as higher transmission margins. In Kentucky, we are expecting slightly lower operating expenses. Additionally, across all the segments, we are seeing lower interest expense from lower interest rates and deferrals of debt issuances in part due to cashing in $310 million of 2017 and 2018 U.K. earnings hedges. 
Moving to Slide 14. As we discussed on our October 12 call, we took action in early October to restrike our remaining in-the-money 2016 hedges to hedge more of our 2018 exposure. Since the call, we have taken additional action and have completed the execution of the 2017 restrikes, further increasing our hedge levels for 2018. You can see we are now hedged 94% for 2017 at an average hedged rate of $1.25 per pound. We are well hedged for 2018 as a result of the actions we've taken. 
The combined result of the 2016 and '17 restrikes is that we have increased our 2018 hedge levels to 93% at an average hedged rate of $1.42 per pound. This creates the flexibility to restrike about $0.12 of 2018 hedge gains to help hedge 2019 earnings at our budgeted rate of $1.30 per pound. The 2019 hedge attainment table reflects the targeted hedge levels in 2019 assuming we restrike 2018 hedge gains and later on 2019 hedges at our budgeted rate. So if market rates are around $1.20 per pound when we execute the 2018 restrike, we would be able to hedge 100% of 2019 earnings at our budgeted rate, leaving no additional currency exposure for 2019. If market rates were to drop to $1.15 per pound at the time we execute the 2018 restrikes, we would be able to hedge about 73% of 2019 earnings, leaving about $0.04 of exposure on the remaining open position. 
In the bottom right part of the chart, we also show sensitivities on the open position at various market rates from $1.15 to $1.45 per pound. To the extent the incremental hedge value that we've created in 2018 is not needed to hedge 2019 earnings, which would be the case if the pound rebounds closer to our budgeted rate, we could use it to hedge 2020 earnings. 
And before I turn the call back over to Bill, you will find an update on RPI in the appendix on Slide 23. That slide has been updated for the October RPI forecast from HM Treasury and is consistent with our forecast with assumptions. 
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn it back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period. Bill?"

Our agenda this",1387,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for today's call. With me are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; as well as the Presidents of our U.S. and U.K. Utility Businesses. 
Starting with Slide 3. Our agenda this morning begins with an overview of our quarterly and year-to-date 2016 earnings results. Following that, I'll address our 2016 and 2017 earnings forecast as we are raising the midpoint of our 2016 forecast and reaffirming our 2017 guidance. I'll provide a brief operational overview as well as an update on our U.K. currency hedging. Following my remarks, Vince will review our segment results and provide a more detailed financial overview. As always, we'll leave time to answer your questions. 
Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced third quarter 2016 reported earnings of $0.69 per share, compared with reported earnings of $0.58 per share in the third quarter of 2015. Year-to-date through the third quarter, reported earnings were $2.11 per share, compared with $0.42 per share through the same period a year ago. Reported earnings for the first 9 months of 2015 reflected a loss from discontinued operations of $1.36 per share, which resulted primarily from the spin-off of our competitive generation business. 
Adjusting for special items, third quarter 2016 earnings from ongoing operations were $0.63 per share, compared with $0.51 per share a year ago. That represents a 23% increase on a per share basis. The increase was driven largely by an April 1, 2016, price increase in the U.K., higher base electricity rates and higher transmission earnings from additional transmission capital investments in Pennsylvania and higher sales volumes due to favorable weather in Kentucky. Through the first 9 months of 2016, earnings from ongoing operations were $1.86 per share, compared with $1.77 per share a year ago. 
Higher earnings year-to-date were primarily driven by higher base rates in Kentucky and Pennsylvania and returns on additional capital investments. Vince will go into greater detail on third quarter results a little later in the call, but we're pleased with the strong results across our business units. 
Moving to Slide 5. Based on our strong performance year-to-date, we've narrowed our guidance range from the previous $2.25 to $2.45 per share to $2.30 to $2.45 per share, increasing the midpoint of our 2016 ongoing earnings forecast from $2.35 per share to $2.38 per share. Vince will provide a walk on the drivers contributing to this 2016 increased performance later in his remarks. 
As we discussed on our October 12 call, we took steps to significantly reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk by restriking our remaining in-the-money 2016 hedges. The impact to 2016 ongoing earnings was a negative $0.06, but because of our strong business line results, we're increasing our 2016 earnings guidance even as we've leveraged the strength of our 26 performance -- 2016 performance, rather, to minimize future currency risk. We also discussed on the October 12 call the opportunity to further leverage 2017 hedge gains, targeting no more than $0.05 of EPS exposure for 2019, even at an exchange rate of $1.15 per pound. 
As of today, we've completed all the restrikes for 2016 and 2017, and we've achieved our targeted hedge levels. Vince will provide the details of our updated hedge positions in his remarks. 
The higher-than-projected earnings in 2017 that enabled us to restrike the portion of our 2017 hedges was partially driven by lower-than-anticipated U.K. property taxes. In the revised earnings guidance we provided on the second quarter call, we were expecting fairly significant property tax increases starting next year and continuing through 2020. But based on the property tax valuation recently completed by the U.K. government, our property tax increases are lower compared to our previous expectation. 
Additionally, some of the earnings strength we are experiencing in 2016 as a result of lower O&M in the U.K. is expected to continue into 2017. These positive factors provide us with the confidence to reaffirm our 2017 earnings forecast of $2.05 to $2.25 per share, with a midpoint of $2.15 per share, despite executing about $0.06 of 2017 hedge restrikes. 
Lastly, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our long-term growth projections. We expect to achieve 5% to 6% compound annual earnings growth from 2017 to 2020 and are targeting annual dividend growth of about 4% over the same period. 
Let's move to Slide 6. Kentucky Utilities and Louisville Gas and Electric are announcing today that they intend to file a rate request on November 23 with the Kentucky Public Service Commission. KU and LG&E expect to seek revenue increases of $103 million and $93 million, respectively, through adjustments to annual base electric rates. LG&E meanwhile anticipates seeking a revenue increase of $14 million in annual base natural gas rates. In total, we're expecting to seek the revenue increase of approximately $210 million. 
The requested increases are driven by additional capital investments that are focused on enhancing our reliability programs across the operational groups, along with technology and infrastructure investments in our customer service areas. This will allow us to continue to provide safe, reliable electric and gas service to customers while meeting federal regulations. Even with the increases, it's anticipated that LG&E and KU rates will remain well below national averages. If approved by the commission, the increases would take effect in July of 2017. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7 for some additional operational highlights. In Kentucky, KU and LG&E will be seeking approval to invest in an advanced metering system and a distribution automation program as part of their rate case proceeding. They will include applications for certificates of public convenience and necessity for implementing these new initiatives, which focus on enhancing service offerings to customers with a continued emphasis on our reliability. 
In recognition of continued efforts to focus on the customer experience, LG&E ranked highest among midsized gas utilities in the Midwest, in J.D. Power's 2016 survey, a residential customer satisfaction. This J.D. Power award is the third by PPL Utility this year and the 41st overall for PPL companies, demonstrating our commitment to provide customers with the highest level of service. As we highlighted on our second quarter call, both PPL Electric Utilities and Kentucky Utilities earned J.D. Power awards in July. 
In Pennsylvania, PPL Electric Utilities is on track to execute more than $1 billion in capital improvements to modernize the grid and strengthen reliability for our customers. The company's automated power restoration system has now restored within minutes more than 58,000 customers since that system became fully operational this past June. 
We also continue to add new smart devices to extend these benefits and improve grid resiliency even more. The company is also completing preparations to replace 1.4 million meters in Pennsylvania with new smart meters. The meter replacements are expected to begin before the end of the year and the full $471 million project is expected to be completed by 2019. Transmission expansion also continues with additional investments focused on reinforcing, expanding and hardening the bulk power system, adding redundancy and making the grid more secure. 
In the U.K., we continue to execute on our plans. And while there are still considerable time left in the current regulatory year, we're on pace to achieve our projected performance against the 2016, 2017 incentive targets for customer minutes lost and customer interruptions. In addition, we're on pace to be at or near the maximum reward levels for customer satisfaction. We've provided updates to our incentive revenue performance in Slides 20 to 22 of the appendix. 
Also in the U.K., we're leading the way according to the regulator, Ofgem, in connecting renewable generation to local distribution networks. To date, we've connected or offered to connect almost 20 gigawatts of renewable power. We've already connected approximately 200,000 private solar installations, along with 7,500 commercial distributed generation facilities. The company has also launched what we believe to be the world's largest electric vehicle trial to explore charging patterns and the ability of markets to influence those patterns. The trial, involving up to 700 vehicles, will inform future network planning. 
And finally, as I've already discussed, we have taken steps to reduce our 2018 and 2019 exposure to foreign currency. Vince will now walk you through a more detailed look at earnings and our hedging strategy. Vince?"
185508,405270725,1069264,"PPL Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","PPL Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 9. Our third quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased by $0.12 per share driven by $0.05 of higher earnings from the Pennsylvania Regulated segment, $0.02 from the Kentucky Regulat",890,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 9. Our third quarter earnings from ongoing operations increased by $0.12 per share driven by $0.05 of higher earnings from the Pennsylvania Regulated segment, $0.02 from the Kentucky Regulated segment and $0.06 from the U.K. Regulated segment. 
We should note that for the third quarter, we saw warmer weather compared to last year. And as a result, domestic weather was favorable $0.03 compared to last year, and weather was about $0.02 positive compared to budget. However, with the warmer winter earlier this year, on a year-to-date basis, domestic weather is only positive about $0.01 compared to budget. 
Year-to-date weather in the U.K. is negative $0.01 compared to the prior year and negative $0.02 compared to budget. So for the company in total, weather has not been a significant driver of our financial performance this year. 
Let's move to a more detailed review of the second quarter segment earnings drivers starting with the Pennsylvania results on Slide 10. 
Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.13 per share in the third quarter of 2016, a $0.05 increase compared to the same period last year. This increase was primarily driven by higher gross margins due to higher distribution margin as a result of new rates going into effect January 1 of this year, higher transmission margins due to additional capital investments and the favorable effects of weather. 
Moving to Slide 11. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.18 per share in the third quarter of 2016, a $0.02 increase compared to a year ago. This result was primarily due to higher gross margins due to favorable weather. 
Turning to Slide 12. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.35 per share in the third quarter of 2016, a $0.06 increase compared to a year ago. This result was primarily driven by higher gross margins, primarily resulting from higher prices from the April 1, 2016, price increase, partially offset by lower volumes due to weather and lower O&M expense, including pension expense. 
Moving to Slide 13. As Bill mentioned, strong performance at each of our regulated utilities led to very solid results to the first 9 months of the year compared to our plan, enabling us to raise our 2016 guidance. This slide provides a walk from the midpoint of our original 2016 earnings guidance of $2.35 per share to our new forecasted midpoint of $2.38 per share. The $0.03 improvement in the forecast is coming from $0.02 in Pennsylvania and $0.01 in Kentucky. While we were experiencing better-than-expected earnings in the U.K. as well, that was fully offset by the $0.06 of 2016 restrikes. The outperformance in the U.K. is driven by higher margins as well as lower operating expenses. 
In Pennsylvania, we are expecting higher margins from favorable weather and usage as well as higher transmission margins. In Kentucky, we are expecting slightly lower operating expenses. Additionally, across all the segments, we are seeing lower interest expense from lower interest rates and deferrals of debt issuances in part due to cashing in $310 million of 2017 and 2018 U.K. earnings hedges. 
Moving to Slide 14. As we discussed on our October 12 call, we took action in early October to restrike our remaining in-the-money 2016 hedges to hedge more of our 2018 exposure. Since the call, we have taken additional action and have completed the execution of the 2017 restrikes, further increasing our hedge levels for 2018. You can see we are now hedged 94% for 2017 at an average hedged rate of $1.25 per pound. We are well hedged for 2018 as a result of the actions we've taken. 
The combined result of the 2016 and '17 restrikes is that we have increased our 2018 hedge levels to 93% at an average hedged rate of $1.42 per pound. This creates the flexibility to restrike about $0.12 of 2018 hedge gains to help hedge 2019 earnings at our budgeted rate of $1.30 per pound. The 2019 hedge attainment table reflects the targeted hedge levels in 2019 assuming we restrike 2018 hedge gains and later on 2019 hedges at our budgeted rate. So if market rates are around $1.20 per pound when we execute the 2018 restrike, we would be able to hedge 100% of 2019 earnings at our budgeted rate, leaving no additional currency exposure for 2019. If market rates were to drop to $1.15 per pound at the time we execute the 2018 restrikes, we would be able to hedge about 73% of 2019 earnings, leaving about $0.04 of exposure on the remaining open position. 
In the bottom right part of the chart, we also show sensitivities on the open position at various market rates from $1.15 to $1.45 per pound. To the extent the incremental hedge value that we've created in 2018 is not needed to hedge 2019 earnings, which would be the case if the pound rebounds closer to our budgeted rate, we could use it to hedge 2020 earnings. 
And before I turn the call back over to Bill, you will find an update on RPI in the appendix on Slide 23. That slide has been updated for the October RPI forecast from HM Treasury and is consistent with our forecast with assumptions. 
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn it back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period. Bill?"

To summarize, we continue to perform very well across all 3 of our business segments, and we're solidly on track to deliver on our increased 2016 earnings guidance. And even with the $0.06 of restrikes we've executed for 2017, we are reaffirming our 2017 earnings guidance. The actions we've taken as part of our foreign currency hedging strategy has substantially minimized foreign currency risk through 2019 and provide greater assurance to our earnings growth targets. And we're confident in our ability to achieve competitive earnings growth of 5% to 6% a year from 2017 through 2020. 
The strength of our underlying business plans also provides us with confidence in targeting about 4% annual dividend growth beginning in 2017 and running through 2020. 
With that, operator, let's open the call for questions."

I should also point out that, given the current status environment of regulation, I still would expect that there'll be substantial expenditures associated with our ECR, both in terms of the $1 billion that we've just been recently authorized by the commission to meet some of our coal combustion residual requirements. And then also now we have the -- some water issues that are going to require us to file under the ECR. So I still think there'll be a lot of money running through the ECR.
