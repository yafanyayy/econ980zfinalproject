It's under construction this year, so next year, we'll be back. Rick Dierker is with me today, our new CFO. We have the entire management team here as well who will come up here when we're done with the presentation and they'll be available for Q&A. So let's begin. 
So we have the obligatory safe harbor statement. I encourage everybody to read it, and here's the agenda. We're going to talk about who we are, the categories that are most important to us, that'll be laundry and vitamins. How we deliver, how we run the company and then Rick is going to take everybody through the financials. Okay. Here's what you're going to hear today. I'm just going to pull it all up on the screen for you viewers at home, but the short story goes like this. 
We had a terrific 2015. So we had 8% EPS growth and on an all-in basis, it's 12% local currency. We have full year organic sales growth of 3.6%. This puts us well above our evergreen target of 3%. We had a strong finish as we saw the consumer business growth 3.3% in the fourth quarter and we had really good momentum going into 2016. Our new product pipeline is off to a good start. You can ask a few questions about that when we get to Q&A and we expect 3% organic revenue growth again in 2016. 
On the EPS front, 2016 outlook is again, up 7% to 9% all-in, and that's 9% to 11% on a total currency basis. That's tops in CPG as you know. We announced a dividend increase today, that's the key for our payout ratio of 40%. And finally, we closed a small bolt-on acquisition in early January. We're always on the hunt for a good brand acquisitions, so we're excited about the future. So let's begin. 
Okay, Church & Dwight was founded in 1846. So we have our 170th birthday coming up this year and in the 19th century, it was founded with ARM & HAMMER baking soda. Today, we have 10 brands that drive our revenues and profit. These are our 10 power brands. In the year 2000, the only big brand we had was ARM & HAMMER. All 9 of those other bands were acquired since the year 2000. Our most recent power brand is now Batiste. Batiste is a business of dry shampoo that we bought in 2011 and in 2016, the global sales of that brand will cross 100 million. Okay, those 10 brands drive our revenues and profits. 80% of our sales and over 80% of our profits. 
And of those 10, 4 are megabrands. These are 4 strong brands that have the ability to go into adjacent categories. And of those megabrands, those megabrands drives 60% of our revenue and over 60% of our profits. As I said, we are an acquirer. Those are the 9 brands that we've acquired and as you can see, also we generally are focused on #1 band. Okay. We're primarily a U.S. company, today 82% U.S., 18% international. This has the benefit of having minimal exposure to the weakening foreign economies and we're very balanced, about half personal care and half households, with Specialty Products business rounding it out at 8%. 
Okay, we are in the land of the giants. So we are a small company. In 2016, we'll have about $3.5 billion in sales. Small company, but big returns. So the shareholder return 1, 3, 5 and 10-year period is stellar for our shareholders. I'm going to talk about the categories that are important to us. So first, laundry. So here's a depiction of the laundry category for the past 4 years. 2012, '13, '14 and '15. As you can see in '12, '13 and '14, both the total category and the liquid category declined in each of those 3 years. That turned around in 2015, particularly in the second half. So on a full-year basis, the total category is up 1.6 and liquid up 0.7. One of the added benefits of '14 going into '15 it was actually stable environment, so that contributed to the rise. 
Let's continue on the second category I want to talk about is vitamins. As you know, in 2012 we acquired the added business that got us into gummy vitamins. Why we're attracted to gummy vitamins? It's because it's been a fast-growing category. In fact, the vitamin, mineral and supplement category has been a mid-single digit grower for many, many years. That flattened out in 2014. Why? Because of negative press and the growth has been rekindled again in 2015. So the category is growing. The other thing I want you to focus on is the gummy form. So the reason this is attractive is because pills and capsules are becoming less popular and gummies are becoming more popular. 
As we look into 2012, you can see only 70% of the category was gummy. Today, it's 12%. And if you look at what headed the gummy form grow in 2015, it grew 16%. And the good news is that we are the #1 brand in both adults and in children's vitamins -- gummy vitamins, okay. Here's the where I want to end on as far as trends go. This is dry shampoo. So I mentioned earlier that we acquired Batiste in 2011, and in 2016, we're growing across $100 million in sales. We're the #1 dry shampoo in the U.K. and in the U.S. In the U.K., we have a 75 share, in the U.S., we have 15 share. Round numbers. So here's the interesting factoid. 
So the U.K. has a retail category of $60 million with a population of 65 million. In the U.S., where the dry shampoo category is in the early innings, it's only a $9 million category with a population of 319 million. So we see a lot of runway ahead of us in this category and for this brand. Okay. How we deliver. If you're a shareholder, you're well aware of the 10 drivers of shareholder return. Let's review. First, we have a recession-resistant portfolio. This is very important. So we have a portfolio that's going to perform well in any economy, 60% [ph] premium and 40% value. Okay, here's an illustration of some of our products. You can see in many cases our value brand is about 50% less expensive than the premium brand. 
Now let's talk about new products. Okay, first up is ARM & HAMMER. So we're really excited about our 2016 product offerings. On the left-hand side, you see CLUMP & SEAL. So we have a new variant coming to CLUMP & SEAL, that's CLUMP & SEAL micro guard. Now micro guard not only seals and destroys orders, but it also prevents future bacterial odors. On the right-hand, see bio enzymes, so we have a new laundry variant in detergent and that's bio enzyme, which is formulated to meet the safer choice environmental standards promulgated by the EPA. A third thing that's not on the screen is we also have a dual chamber pod that we're launching under the ARM & HAMMER banner in 2016. 
A little bit more on CLUMP & SEAL so in 2016, we came out with lightweight and naturals followed by microguard in 2016. But here's a story that's worth telling. We have been an innovator in cat littler for years, so if you go back to 2011, double Judy, followed by Ultra Last and then you see what happens when you don't have innovation in the year, you flat line. So in 2014, we came out with CLUMP & SEAL, the best cat litter that's out there. In '15, we followed with naturals and lightweight. And in '16, we followed with micro guard. Great story.

So we have a new liquid laundry detergent called OxiClean preserve. This laundry detergent reduces pilling in your clothing and just as we have a dual chamber pod for ARM & HAMMER, we also have one for OxiClean, called OxiClean HD. Just -- let's review the OxiClean mega brand for a minute. So let's start with laundry additives. So laundry additives, we had a record share, 45.9%, up 130 basis points, led by White Revive, which is our entry into the bleach category. Second is the laundry detergent. We ended the year with a 1 share. We had a 0.8 share at the end of 2014. It's not moving as fast as we had hoped. The good news is that trial, repeat and consumption were all up year-over-year and then finally, Autodesk detergent category, that's a difficult category, we got a 1 3 [ph] in 2015. 
Okay, TROJAN. We've got 3 new offerings for TROJAN. First, condoms. So we had TROJAN groove. So this is a groove condom that retains the lubricant on the condom during sex. Number two, is TROJAN rivière, for those of you who have been waiting for a lubricant for use in the shower, you now have one. So long-lasting lubrication. And the third one is TROJAN Divine, which is the multi speed vibrating massager. I'm not sure if 1, 2 or all 3 of these are in your goodie bags today, so you'll have a little bit of a surprise. 
Okay, so vitamins. So lots of new products into vitamins space. So first, beauty. So we have a new beauty line with a really attractive new packaging, a couple of offerings for teen, both teen sport and also teen hair, skin and nails. And then licenses. Licenses have become increasingly important in the children's category. So we've had Barbie and Mario launched in 2015 and then this month, we have minions as well. So that bodes well for our children's Gummy Vitamins. And finally, FIRST RESPONSE. So there is now a Bluetooth pregnancy test kit. So you download the app to your iPhone, you take the -- use the pregnancy kit. It sends the result to your app and what the app does for view, it provides you a lot of information throughout the pregnancy. So this is we've all heard about the Internet of Things, so this is our 4 first foray into the Internet of Things. So it's in our ability to test and learn. 
All right. Marketing. So you've also heard us talk about how much money we spend on marketing. We're the 15th largest advertiser in the U.S., so we're in pretty good company here, as you can see on this slide. And we've also said that our marketing would generally bring around between 12% and 13% of sales. So you can see over the last 4 years, we've been averaged around 12.5%. And that all is going to show up in your shares. So if I call your attention to the right-hand side of the slide, this is our report card. So on the top, you have your mega brands and on the bottom, you have your remaining power brands. So 3 out of 4 of our mega brands grew share in 2015. 
Vitamins is yellow, why? We went sideways this past year, it's well known we had some difficulties with the new plant start up. It's all behind us now. And then with respect to this -- the 06 [ph] power brands. You see XTRA is red, but actually XTRA profits were up in '15 versus '14, as we didn't shave the competition down in discounting and battery-operated toothbrushes has been a perennial difficult category. That's also red, but 7 out of 10, we're Green. Okay. Distribution. So this is a new information for you. We took a look at our distribution gains over the past 6 years. So we looked at 2009 to '12, and the separately 2012 to 2015. So we're happy to report that we've been consistent in expanding our distribution year after year, after year. We expect to continue to do this in the future. And while we're on the topic of distribution, Batiste was a 15.2 share today, that share is only going to grow because we're expanding in the top retailers in 2016. Another good story. Okay. 
Defense of our brands. It's no secret that the laundry category has been a difficult category for all competitors for several years now. So in 2014, you had simply tied show up in the value tier, 2015 at Priscilla show up in the premium tier. And on top of that, you have price worth breaking out. So what happened? So to left or right, 2014 we had a 14 share 2014, 14.2; 2015, 14.4. So each in of the past few years, we've expanded share in spite of the new entrants and the press wars, and we expect to continue to expand here in the future. 
International. So just as I said in the year 2000, the only big brand we had was ARM & HAMMER. Near 2001, we were just a U.S. company. Today, we're a little bit more diverse with 82% as I said earlier is U.S. and 18% is international. Here's how it's spread out, we have a European business unit, which is our largest business unit that encompasses the U.K. and France. It's 37% of the business, followed by the #2, Canada then Mexico then Australia. Our international business has been a stellar performer for many years, so you could look at the CAGR for the last 5 years. Virtually every business, every country is at or above our 3% evergreen target. 
Now gross margin. So here's a 6-year look at gross margin. So if you think about the first 3 years, so '10, '11, '12, we're all still dealing with the commodity super cycle, that was depressing margins. And then more recently, you had price worth breakout and it's a bit of an offset from a combined abatement, but we've been around 44.5% gross margins for a good long time in spite of all those factors. 
The 4 ways we drive gross margin, this is familiar to many of our shareholders and we'll go clock wise here. So good to great, that's the name of our continuous improvement program. Second is supply-chain optimization. As you know, we've built a couple of plants in the last 5 years. Number three, new products. So when we launch new products, those products need to have higher than average gross margins. And then finally, acquisitions. When we buy businesses, one of our requirements is that, we buy businesses that are at or above our existing corporate gross margin. 
Okay. And as you know, we have a very simple compensation structure. Now we promote financial literacy within the company. One of the ways we do that is we tie gross margin, that -- it's 25% of all employees annual bonuses, it's tied to us achieving the gross margin target. Next is acquisition. So we have a very strict criteria with respect to acquisition. Consequently, we're very fuzzy about the brands and businesses we're going to buy. This category hasn't change in quite a few years. Long history of acquisitions, obviously, that contributed to our top line growth. 
In 2004, we were about $1.5 billion, $3.5 billion today, good chunk of that was driven by acquisitions. And a good way to think about Church & Dwight is an acquisition platform. So when we acquire businesses, we grow the revenue and we get cost synergies. So how do we do that? So with respect to the revenue growth, we have veteran markers within the company. We have a separate new product development process, separate from the business unit and we expand shares. As far as the cost synergies go, we're leveraging the new brand across all classes of trade and we have a supply-chain and an R&D organization that are very versatile, so we can handle liquids, aerosols, powders, gels, devices, et cetera. 
And our track record is stellar, 9 out of 10 power brands, so we get cost synergies every time and Rick's going to tell a little bit more about access to capital when he gets up here. Okay. SO how have we done? So we acquire a business, what was the preacquisition share? What's the share today? In every case, you see that we expand shares. And TOPPIK, you probably read in the release that we acquired this brand, this -- earlier this month. We were entering the hair thinning category. This is a problem solution brand. You have to think about the characteristics of it. We think it's very much like Batiste. We had a couple of non-CHD investors agreed to demo the product. Here's a male, before and after. And here's a woman, before and after. 
And happily, if you've retained more than 50% of your hair, you know who you are, particularly sell-side analysts, this product is for you. A nice side benefit of this by the way, is that they have a very robust sales and marketing team online, so we're going to learn a lot from them. If you want to learn more about the product, you can go to TOPPIK.com. Okay. Best-in-class free cash flow. Rick's going to take you through that, but we've averaged well above our peers for many years. 
SG&A, this is the hallmark of the company. You can see that we have extremely productive employees and we're the lowest SG&A of any CPG company and we intend to stay there. We have an expert management team. We have lots of people who have lots of experience in all of these seats. And driven by a simple compensation program, I said earlier that gross margin is 25% of the annual bonus. The rest is cash from operations, EPS and net revenue. Very easy to explain, very easy to remember. And our long-term compensation is 100% stock options and we're called required to be heavily invested in the company's stock. 
And here are the results again. So stellar returns to our shareholder, over the 1, 3, and 5 and 10-year period. Okay. How we run the company? As you know, we have an evergreen model, so we always target 3% organic growth annually and 50 basis points of operating margin expansion, and we're targeting 8% EPS growth. Okay. As far as our operating system goes, first is the evergreen model. Second is we know what geographies we're focusing on. North America first, that's Canada, U.S. and Mexico. And secondarily, Europe and Asia. Allocation of the capital, Rick's going to take you through but at the top of the list and these are in order of importances as TSR accretive acquisitions. And finally, those acquisition criteria haven't changed in years. 
And we have 4 operating principles. So we have #1 brands we leverage. We're very asset-light were, not capital-intensive, we enjoy a lot of cash flow so we leverage assets and we have very productive employees, the most productive employees in the CPG space. All of that combined for good returns, but when you leverage acquisitions on top of that, you get spectacular returns. Okay. I'm going to bring Rick up here to talk about financials."
261105,320856620,924781,"Church & Dwight Co. Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2016",2016-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Executives","Okay, thank you, Matt. I'm going to cover 3 topics. We're going to talk about the quarter, Q4 and just how we came in. We'll go through 2015 and some of the details there and talk about 2016 outlook. But if there's one thing to take away from the financia",1603,"Okay, thank you, Matt. I'm going to cover 3 topics. We're going to talk about the quarter, Q4 and just how we came in. We'll go through 2015 and some of the details there and talk about 2016 outlook. But if there's one thing to take away from the financials today is really 2015 ended well, and we have a lot of momentum as we go into 2016, a lot of optimism. 
So Q4 2.6% organic sales growth, 3.3% for the Consumer Domestic division, largely driven by volume, we'll get into the details in a second, but 2.5% volume. Growth gross margin expanded 50 basis points behind commodity improvement, behind our productivity programs. A lot of our price in the laundry is normalized, same as you hear about it all year long. Marketing was down 10 basis points, so essentially flat and SG&A was up 10%, so operating margin was up 50. 
So EPS was up 5 and currency-neutral, EPS is up 9. Great result. So to the quarters of 2015, pretty consistent, 2.6% in Q4 remember versus a year ago, we're a 5.2%. So really strong growth in Q4, off of a high, high comp year-ago. And you guys like to look at the snack bar, so we threw it in here for consumer business. This is just the strength, relative strength of the consumer business, a lot of momentum going into Q4. 7.2% in Q4, so we're exiting the year at a strong rate. Categories are strong. 
So volume is the growth driver, 2.5, and a 2.6 on the organic side of the company. 3.2 for the domestic division. With international division, we do get a little priced as we go into the FX headwinds. And then SPD, we're down 4% largely on volume because no prices have come down. Great trend, great momentum on gross margin as well, 45 5 for the quarter and as I said before, normalized pricing environment, commodity -- commodities are a tailwind, and productivity programs continue. A lot of our vitamin issues for startup happened early in the year. 
Marketing spend, highest percentage, highest dollar amount of the year. And that leads to share growth, 7 out of our 10 power brands and Matt walked you through those details, 3 or 4 megabrands proves well. So let's recap on the full year, 3.5% organic sales growth the compares to 3% outlook earlier in the year, largely volume-driven. Gross margin is up 40 basis points for all the reasons I already walked through. Marketing is down 30, and now we talked about that a little on our Q3 call. We reallocate some of the marketing spend and put it in the trade line for OxiClean to drive trial, and as Matt alluded to trial and share -- trial and consumption are both up. 
Adjusted SG&A is flat and operating margin is up 70 basis points. So great result. EPS is up 8 and free cash flow is a record of $544 million. Adjusted free cash flow conversion is 125%. That is a very important metric to the company, we'll be talking about that even more as we go forward. And that should be important to every shareholder as well. So while can we drive great in a cash flow productivity, is because partly of working capital improvement. Our cash conversion cycle, which is inventory, which is receivables minus payables is gone from 40 days to 27 days over the last 5 years. We continue to believe we can continue to make that go down over time. 
Free cash flow conversion is 125% in 2015, average for the last 5 years, 119%. So just stellar result. We did dip our toe in the water in 2015 on AR factory. So that 125%, if we take that out, we're still at 119%. So as Matt alluded to, 118% for the last 7 years or so, which is far above the industry average and far above some other competitors who target 90%. We have a strong balance sheet, 1.4x levered. Why is that important? It's important because we have a lot of fire power, a lot of dry powder waiting to do an acquisition. In this example, we could do a $2.8 billion deal and maintain our credit rating. Okay. So that's '15. 
So why don't I go through 2016. First, organic, 3%. So there's a couple of things behind that number, so that would be SPD, 1% to 3% head growth. International, 4% growth and for the consumer business domestically 2% to 3%. And you might ask why is that coming down from 3.5% in 2015, there's really 2 assumptions in there. One is the international business comes back down to Earth. We had a phenomenal year this year, behind [indiscernible] this team. 8% going to 4%, so back under there. And then the categories, our assumption for that is growth of 2% to 3%. So if categories are doing better, then our top line will do better as well. 
Gross margin, 40 basis points of expansion. The easy way to think about that is really 70 basis points from productivity programs, from commodities, not having any of the startup costs for York, for the vitamin plant, offset by the 30 basis point drag from currency. And I'll walk you through it when we talk about currency a little bit more, but we have a 30 basis point drag largely because of the transactional currency impacts from the U.S. and Canada. 
Marketing is flat, but there's a little bit more of a story there as well. SG&A is down 10 basis points, leveraging the top line. Operating margin is up 50, EPS 7% to 9%, currency adjusted, 9 to 11. And we have share count number for you, 1 31, what's behind that? $300 million of buyback and we've already gotten ahead of ourselves, up $100 million in December, so $200 million left for '16. 
Okay. Here's how we stack up versus our evergreen TSR model of 3%. You can tell we've hit our beat at 3% number over time. Focus on gross margin, absolutely 2010, 2014 in the face of commodity headwinds and the face of laundry competitiveness, we maintained our gross margin. In '15, we expanded and we're going to expand again in 2016. Consistent marketing spend. So 12.3 to 12.3, so I just want to leave you guys with this comment. The core business were increasing marketing spend by around 10 basis points, okay? A lot of our competitors are cutting 20%, we're actually increasing our core business and the marketing spend associated with that. 
When we -- later on the TOPPIK acquisition, it is a $30 million deal, about 1/3 of that revenue is direct. So the marketing spend is a little bit lower. So when you do the math, it becomes 12 3 to 12 3. SG&A management is the hallmark of the company. This is what our people do great things here. This is leveraging the top line and many companies do 0 base plant process, I'd say we've been doing this for many, many years. Operating profit, 2015 was a big year. We hit 20%. So a lot of personal care premium companies are in the neighborhood of 20%, so we're happy to be there and then in 2015, we think we're going to expand by 50 basis points again. 
EBITDA is a good circuit for cash generation, and we think the stairstep tells the Church & Dwight  and story very well, so we've gone from 20 to the mid-20s, 24.2. For EPS, we're 3 48 to 3 54, that's the range of 7% to 9%. Again, once you backup currency, it's 9% to 11%. Okay. Here's the FX story. So in 2015, as a refresher, we had about a 2.5% drag on currency on the top line and a 4% drag for EPS. That was a 30 bps impact on gross margin. In 2015, we had a 1% drag for revenue and 2% drag on EPS, but we still have a 30 bps drag in gross margin. It might surprise you, I would just tell you that in 2015, 70% of the drag for currency was translation and in '15, 70% transactions, so that's a gross margin impact 
Okay. Allocation of capital. Number one, by far, TSR accretive M&A. If we want to do the -- we look at deals all the time. The management team, the senior leadership team, we look for deals all the time. You'd be shocked at how much time we actually spend on that. What I want to leave you with though is we're looking for the right deal and it's #1, but we want to make sure it's the right field. Number two is new product development that drives our organic growth. Number three is CapEx. Number four is return of cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. And number five is debt reduction. 
We're not a capital-intensive company. In 2016, our outlook is really $55 million of CapEx, you might say hey, Rick, you guys have typically been high 50s, low 70s. And I'd say no, the base does actually in the 50s, and when we have incremental capacity demands for vitamins or for a new plant, that's when we spike up to a higher number. And then as Matt alluded to, 6% dividend increase to 1 42. That gives us right at our 40% payout ratio that we've been very clear on for many years. 
And with that, I'll welcome up the rest of the management team and we'll take your questions."

But we're not giving up on OxiClean. We have obviously, the new 2 variants coming up this year, with the preserved product and also the pods, the dual chamber pods, and don't underestimate that. Just remember, we had a powder pod for many years. We focused on liquid and we did put a lot of effort behind the pod side of this as we're coming out with a dual chamber this year, because consumers are looking for multiple benefits and you need multiple chambers.

If I look at the Nielsen data and some of the vitamin products you've launched,  over the years, a different variants beyond like the basic multivitamin. Because you can get share then they lose it, right? And that's been a pretty repeated pattern when you look at this sort of not SKU, but SKU, but the title by title in the Nielsen data on vitamins. So what's a cost to keep stuff on shelf when it's not really selling through? What pressure are you under from retailers to get it out and get something new? And the same would go for OxiClean, so on the retailers, where you're 20 basis points of share gain, this will be starting year 3. How easy is it to keep it on shelf when you're at those share levels?"

On OxiClean, you ask an OxiClean question, I would step back to provide this input because there are a lot of really good things that I think we should all feel terrific about. Those being as Matt showed, the category is growing again, right? So first time in a while that, that's happened. Second big thing is that there are 2 new premium products in the category. That's a good thing for a couple of reasons, one being it promotes healthy competitive environment and two, it allows us to build our business. And last year, if you remember on OxiClean, we said that we would incrementally spend against that brand and we did, and as Matt showed on his slide, our consumption is up 25%, our trial is up above 50%, and our repeat purchases is up about 40%. So although it's a difficult environment because consumers are used to buying for over 50 years, 1 particular brand, we believe in our brand. We will continue to support that brand moving forward."

And keep in mind that we have the #1 nasal hygiene product in Europe. It's called Stare More. So we say, we know a little bit about this category, it's not only successful in Europe, but it's successful in export markets. This is a pretty safe move for us to move into nasal hygiene. Now as you quote on in the U.S., as the way it is in other countries. But high-margin business, there's no point came along with it, so I thought, okay, this just makes some sense for us. Feline time, it was #1 or #2 natural cat litter that was really invoked at the time when we looked at it, we said, hey this looks like one that might make sense for us. Again, no plan, that was copack. So we had the criteria, it was a solid brand. That one hasn't taken off. But when you buy it, you know we're looking at trends, if it doesn't make sense, you mentioned REPHRESH and. So a year ago, we buy REPHRESH, so this is the #1 gel vaginal moisturizer. People with that issue will look high and low for a product that's going to solve their problem. So again, problem solution brand, you put some money behind that as soon as we bought it, and it's grown really nicely in 2015. So we're real happy about that acquisition. And coming back to TOPPIK, again a problem solution. We learned a lot about the hair category through Batiste. We're not going to get into what could be a shampoo company, liquid shampoo. But we feel really good about hair thinning. And that is an issue that you don't have a good solution there because today, the big brand in the hair thinning is a real gain. It's a J&J product, and its chemicals, right? And so if you look at the consumer research, people aren't happy with what the offerings are out there to solve the problem. And we think TOPPIK, if you go online, look at Amazon, some of the reviews for that product, people love it. And this business has people that have been customers for 20 years. So again, it's kind of thing we use to say, hey, this looks like a really solid brand. It's not going to go backwards, it's going to grow quite a bit. And again, the asset-light, high-margin throws off a lot of cash."

It's under construction this year, so next year, we'll be back. Rick Dierker is with me today, our new CFO. We have the entire management team here as well, who will come up here when we're done with the presentation and they'll be available for Q&A. So let's begin. 
So we have the obligatory safe harbor statement. I encourage everybody to read it, and here's the agenda. I'm going to talk about who we are, the categories that are most important to us, that'll be laundry and vitamins. How we deliver, how we run the company and then Rick is going to take everybody through the financials. Okay. Here's what you're going to hear today. I'm just going to pull it all up on the screen for you viewers at home, but the short story goes like this. 
We had a terrific 2015. So we had 8% EPS growth and on an all-in basis, it's 12% local currency. We had full year organic sales growth of 3.6%. This puts us well above our evergreen target of 3%. We had a strong finish as we saw the consumer business grow 3.3% in the fourth quarter and we had really good momentum going into 2016. Our new product pipeline is off to a good start. You can ask a few questions about that when we get to Q&A and we expect 3% organic revenue growth again in 2016. 
On the EPS front, 2016 outlook is again, up 7% to 9% all-in, and that's 9% to 11% on a total currency basis. That's tops in CPG as you know. We announced a dividend increase today, that's to keep our payout ratio at 40%. And finally, we closed a small bolt-on acquisition in early January. We're always on the hunt for good brand acquisitions, so excited about the future. So let's begin. 
Okay, church & Dwight was founded in 1846. So we have our 170th birthday coming up this year and in the 19th century, it was founded with ARM & HAMMER baking soda. Today, we have 10 brands that drive our revenues and profit. These are our 10 power brands. In the year 2000, the only big brand we had was ARM & HAMMER. All 9 of those other brands were acquired since the year 2000. Our most recent power brand is now BATISTE. BATISTE is a business of dry shampoo that we bought in 2011 and in 2016, the global sales of that brand will cross $100 million. Okay, those 10 brands drive our revenues and profits. 80% of our sales and over 80% of our profits. 
And of those 10, 4 are megabrands. These are 4 strong brands that have the ability to go into adjacent categories. And of those megabrands, those megabrands drive 60% of our revenue and over 60% of our profits. As I said, we are an acquirer. Those are the 9 brands that we've acquired and as you can see also, we generally are focused on #1 brands. Okay, we're primarily a U.S. company, today 82% U.S., 18% international. This has the benefit of having minimal exposure to the weakening foreign economies and we're very balanced, about half personal care and half household, with Specialty Products business rounding it out at 8%. 
Okay, we are in the land of the giants. So we are a small company. In 2016, we'll have about $3.5 billion in sales. Small company, but big returns. So the shareholder return 1, 3, 5 and 10-year period been stellar for our shareholders. I'm going to talk about the categories that are important to us. So first, laundry. So here's a depiction of the laundry category for the past 4 years. 2012, '13, '14 and '15. As you can see in '12, '13 and '14, both the total category and the liquid category declined in each of those 3 years. That turned around in 2015, particularly in the second half. So on a full year basis, the total category is up 1.6 and liquid up 0.7. One of the added benefits of '14 going into '15 it was actually a stable promotional environment, so that contributed to the rise. 
To continue on the second category I want to talk about is vitamins. As you know, in 2012 we acquired the Avid business that got us into Gummy Vitamins. Why are we attracted to Gummy Vitamins? It's because it's been a fast-growing category. In fact, the vitamin, mineral and supplement category has been a mid-single digit grower for many, many years. That flattened out in 2014. Why? Because of negative press and the growth has been rekindled again in 2015. So the category is growing. The other thing I want you to focus on is the gummy form. So the reason this is attractive is because pills and capsules are becoming less popular and gummies are becoming more popular. 
So if you look in 2012, you can see only 7% of the category was gummy. Today, it's 12%. And if you look at what headed the gummy form grow in 2015, it grew 16%. And the good news is that we are the #1 brand in both adult and in children's vitamins, gummy vitamins, okay. Here's the one I want to end on as far as trends go. This is dry shampoo. So I mentioned earlier that we acquired BATISTE in 2011, and in 2016, we're growing across $100 million in sales. We're the #1 dry shampoo in the U.K. and in the U.S. In the U.K., we have a 75 share, in the U.S., we have 15 share. Round numbers. So here's the interesting factoid. 
So the U.K. has a retail category of $60 million with a population of 65 million. In the U.S., where the dry shampoo category is in the early innings, it's only a $90 million category with a population of 319 million. So we see a lot of runway ahead of us in this category and for this brand. Okay. How we deliver. If you're a shareholder, you're well aware of the 10 drivers of shareholder return. Let's review. First, we have a recession-resistant portfolio. This is very important. So we have a portfolio that's going to perform well in any economy, 60% premium and 40% value. Okay, here's an illustration of some of our products. You can see in many cases our value brand is about 50% less expensive than the premium brand. 
Now let's talk about new products. Okay, first up is ARM & HAMMER. So we're really excited about our 2016 product offerings. On the left-hand side, you see CLUMP & SEAL. So we have a new variant coming to CLUMP & SEAL, that's CLUMP & SEAL MicroGuard. Now MicroGuard not only seals and destroys odors, but it also prevents future bacterial odors. On the right-hand, see bio enzymes, so we have a new laundry variant in detergent and that's bio enzyme, it's formulated to meet the safer choice environmental standards promulgated by the EPA. The third thing that's not on the screen is we also have a dual chamber pod that we're launching under the ARM & HAMMER banner in 2016. 
A little bit more on CLUMP & SEAL. So in 2015, we came out with lightweight and naturals followed by MicroGuard in 2016. But here's a story that's worth telling. We have been an innovator in cat litter for years, so if you go back to 2011, you see DOUBLE DUTY, followed by ULTRA LAST. And then you see what happens when you don't have innovation in the year, you flat line. So in 2014, we came out with CLUMP & SEAL, the best cat litter that's out there. In '15, we followed with naturals and lightweight. And then '16, we followed with MicroGuard. Great story.

So we have a new liquid laundry detergent called OxiClean preserve. This laundry detergent reduces pilling in your clothing and just as we have a dual chamber pod for ARM & HAMMER, we also have one for OxiClean, called OxiClean HD. Just -- let's review the OxiClean mega brand for a minute. So start with laundry additives. So laundry additives, we had a record share, 45.9%, up 130 basis points, led by White Revive, which was our entry into the bleach category. Second is the laundry detergent. We end the year with a 1 share. We had a 0.8 share at the end of 2014. It's not moving as fast as we had hoped. The good news is that trial, repeat and consumption are all up year-over-year. And then finally, auto dish detergent category, that's a difficult category, we got a 1.3 in 2015. 
Okay, TROJAN. So 3 new offerings for TROJAN. First, condoms. So we have TROJAN Groove. So this is a grooved condom that retains the lubricant on the condom during sex. Number two, is TROJAN Riviera, for those of you who have been waiting for a lubricant for use in the shower, you now have one. So long-lasting lubrication. And the third one is TROJAN Divine, which is a multi-speed vibrating massager. I'm not sure if 1, 2 or all 3 of these are in your goodie bags today, that will be a little bit of a surprise. 
Okay, so vitamins. So lots of new products into vitamins space. So first, beauty. So we have a new beauty line with a really attractive new packaging, a couple of offerings for teen, both teen sport and also teen hair, skin and nails. And then licenses. Licenses have become increasingly important in the children's category. So we had Barbie and Mario launched in 2015 and then this month, we have Minions as well. So that bodes well for our children's Gummy Vitamins. And finally, FIRST RESPONSE. So there is now a Bluetooth pregnancy test kit. So you download the app to your iPhone, you take the -- use the pregnancy kit. It sends the result to your app and what the app does for you, it provides you lots of information throughout your pregnancy. So this is -- we've all heard about the Internet of Things, so this is our 4 first foray into the Internet of Things. So it's in our ability to test and learn. 
All right. Marketing. So you've often heard us talk about how much money we spend on marketing. We're the 15th largest advertiser in the U.S., so we're in pretty good company here, as you can see on this slide. And we've also said that our marketing would generally bank around between 12% and 13% of sales. So you can see over the last 4 years, we've been averaged around 12.5%. And that all is going to show up in your shares. So if I call your attention to the right-hand side of this slide, this is our report card. So on the top, you have your mega brands and on the bottom, you have your remaining power brands. So 3 out of 4 of our mega brands grew share in 2015. 
Vitamins is yellow, why? We went sideways this past year, it's well known we had some difficulties with the new plant start up. That's all behind us now. And then with respect to this -- the other 6 power brands. You see XTRA is red, but actually XTRA profits were up in '15 versus '14, as we didn't shave the competition down in discounting and battery-operated toothbrushes has been a perennial difficult category, that's also red. But 7 out of 10, we're green. Okay. Distribution. So this is a new information for you. We took a look at our distribution gains over the past 6 years. So we looked at 2009 to '12, and then separately 2012 to 2015. So we're happy to report that we've been consistent in expanding our distribution year after year, after year. We expect to continue to do this in the future. And while we're on the topic of distribution, BATISTE with a 15.2 share today, that share is only going to grow because we're expanding in the top retailers in 2016. Another good story. Okay. 
Defense of our brands. It's no secret that the laundry category has been a difficult category for all competitors for several years now. So in 2014, you had Simply Tide show up in the value tier, 2015 had Priscilla show up in their premium tier. And on top of that, you have price worth breaking out. So what happened? So just left or right, 2013 we had a 14 share 2014, 14.2; 2015, 14.4. So in each of the past few years, we've expanded share in spite of the new entrants and the price wars, and we expect to continue to expand share in the future. 
International. So just as I said in the year 2000, the only big brand we had was ARM & HAMMER. Near 2001, we were just a U.S. company. Today, we're a little bit more diverse with 82% as I said earlier is U.S. and 18% is international. Here's how it's spread out, we have a European business unit, which is our largest business unit that encompasses the U.K. and France. That's 37% of the business, followed by the #2, Canada, then Mexico and Australia. Our international business has been a stellar performer for many years, so you can look at the CAGR for the last 5 years. Virtually every business, every country is at or above our 3% evergreen target. 
Now gross margin. So here's a 6-year look at gross margin. So if you think about the first 3 years, so '10, '11, '12, we're all still dealing with the commodity super cycle, that was depressing margins. And then more recently, you had price worth breakout and it's a bit of an offset from a combined abatement, but we've been around 44.5% gross margins for a good long time in spite of all those factors. 
The 4 ways we drive gross margin, this is familiar to many of our shareholders and we'll go clockwise here. So Good to Great, that's the name of our continuous improvement program. Second is supply-chain optimization. As you know, we built a couple of plants in the last 5 years. Number three, new products. So when we launch new products, those new products need to have higher than average gross margins. And finally, acquisitions. So when we buy businesses, one of our requirements is that, we buy businesses that are at or above our existing corporate gross margin. 
Okay. And as you know, we have a very simple compensation structure. Now we promote financial literacy within the company. One of the ways we do that is we tie gross margin, it's 25% of any -- of all employees annual bonus, it's tied to us achieving the gross margin target. Next is acquisition. So we have a very strict criteria with respect to acquisitions. Consequently, we're very fuzzy about the brands and the businesses we're going to buy. And this criteria hasn't change in quite a few years. Long history of acquisitions, obviously, that contributed to our top line growth. 
In 2004, we were about $1.5 billion, we're $3.5 billion today, good chunk of that was driven by acquisitions. And a good way to think about Church & Dwight is an acquisition platform. So when we acquire businesses, we grow the revenue and we get cost synergies. So how do we do that? So with respect to the revenue growth, we have veteran marketers within the company. We have a separate new product development process, separate from the business units and as a result we expand shares. As far as the cost synergies go, we're leveraging the new brand across all classes of trade and we have a supply-chain and an R&D organization that are very versatile. So we can handle liquids, aerosols, powders, gels, devices, et cetera. 
And our track record is stellar, 9 out of 10 power brands, so we get cost synergies every time and Rick's going to tell a little bit more about access to capital when he gets up here. Okay. How have we done? So if we acquire a business, what was the preacquisition share? What's the share today? In every case, you see that we expand shares. And TOPPIK, you've probably read in the release that we acquired this brand, this -- earlier this month. We were entering the hair thinning category. This is a problem solution brand. If you think about the characteristics of it. We think it's very much like BATISTE. We had a couple of non-CHD investors agreed to demo the product. Here's a male, before and after. And here's a woman, before and after. 
And happily, if you've retained more than 50% of your hair, and you know who you are, particularly sell-side analysts, this product is for you. A nice side benefit of this by the way, is that they have a very robust sales and marketing team online, so we're going to learn a lot from them. If you want to learn more about the product, you can go to TOPPIK.com. Okay. Best-in-class free cash flow. Rick's going to take you through that, but we've averaged well above our peers for many years. 
SG&A, this is the hallmark of the company. You can see that we have extremely productive employees and we're the lowest SG&A of any CPG company and we intend to stay there. We have an expert management team. We have lots of people with lots of experience in all of these seats. And driven by a simple compensation program, I said earlier that gross margin is 25% of the annual bonus. The rest is cash from operations, EPS and net revenue. Very easy to explain, very easy to remember. And our long-term compensation is 100% stock options and we're all called required to be heavily invested in the company's stock. 
And here are the results again. So stellar returns to our shareholder, over the 1, 3, 5 and 10-year period. Okay. How we run the company? Because you know, we have an evergreen model, so we always target 3% organic growth annually and 50 basis points of operating margin expansion, and we target 8% EPS growth. Okay. As far as our operating system goes, first is the evergreen model. Second is we know what geographies we're focusing on. North America first, that's Canada, U.S. and Mexico. And secondarily, Europe and Asia. Allocation of capital, Rick's going to take you through but at the top of the list and these are in order of importance is TSR accretive acquisitions. And finally, those acquisition criteria haven't changed in years. 
And we have 4 operating principles. So we have #1 brands that we leverage. We're very asset-light, we're not capital-intensive. We're turn in lots of cash flow so we leverage assets and we have very productive employees, the most productive employees in the CPG space. All of that combines for good returns, but when you leverage acquisitions on top of that, you get spectacular returns. Okay. Now I'm going to bring Rick up here to talk about the financials."

Gross margin expanded 50 basis points behind commodity improvement, behind our productivity programs. A lot of our price in the laundry is normalized, the same theme you've been hearing about all year long. Marketing was down 10 basis points, so essentially flat and SG&A was up 10%, so operating margin was up 50. 
So EPS was up 5 and currency-neutral EPS is up 9. Great result. So to the quarters of 2015, pretty consistent, 2.6% in Q4 remember versus a year ago, we're at 5.2%. So really strong growth in Q4, off of a high comp year ago. And you guys like to look at the stack bar, so we threw in here for consumer business. This is just the strength, relative strength of the consumer business, a lot of momentum going into Q4. 7.2% in Q4, so we're exiting the year at a strong rate. Categories are strong. 
So volume is the growth driver, 2.5%, [ph] and a 2.6% from the organic side for the company. 3.2% for the domestic division. With international division, we do get a little price as we go into the FX headwinds. And then SPD, we're down 4% largely on volume because no prices have come down. Great trend, great momentum on gross margin as well, 45.5% for the quarter and as I've said before, normalized pricing environment, commodity -- commodities are a tailwind, and productivity programs continue. A lot of our vitamin issues for startup happened early in the year. 
Marketing spend, highest percentage, highest dollar amount of the year. And that leads to share growth, 7 out of our 10 power brands and Matt walked you through those details, 3 or 4 megabrands proves well. So let's recap on the full year, 3.5% organic sales growth compares to 3% outlook earlier in the year, largely volume-driven. Gross margin is up 40 basis points for all the reasons I already walked through. Marketing is down 30, and now we talked about that a little bit on our Q3 call. We reallocated some of the marketing spend and put it in the trade line for OxiClean to drive trial, and as Matt alluded to trial and share -- trial and consumption are both up. 
Adjusted SG&A is flat and operating margin is up 70 basis points. So great result. EPS is up 8 and free cash flow is a record of $544 million. Adjusted free cash flow conversion is 125%. That is a very important metric to the company, we'll be talking about that even more as we go forward. And that should be very important to every shareholder as well. So why can we drive great cash flow productivity, is because partly of working capital improvement. Our cash conversion cycle, which is inventory, which is receivables minus payables is gone from 40 days to 27 days over the last 5 years. We continue to believe that we can continue to make that go down over time. 
Free cash flow conversion is 125% in 2015, average for the last 5 years, 119%. So just stellar result. We did dip our toe in the water in 2015 on AR factory. So that -- is in that 125%, if we take that out, we're still at 119%. So as Matt alluded to, 118% for the last 7 years or so, which is far above the industry average and far above some other competitors who target 90%. We have a strong balance sheet, 1.4x levered. Why is that important? It's important because we have a lot of fire power, a lot of dry powder waiting to do an acquisition. And as an example, we could do a $2.8 billion deal and maintain our credit rating. Okay. So that's '15. 
So why don't we go through 2016. First, organic, 3%. So there's a couple of things behind that number, so that will be SPD, 1% to 3% type of growth. International, 4% growth and for the consumer business domestically 2% to 3%. And you might ask why is that coming down from 3.5% in 2015, there's really 2 assumptions in there. One is the international business comes back down to Earth. We had a phenomenal year this year, behind Steve Cugine and this team. 8% going to 4%, so back [ph] under there. And then the categories, our assumption for that is growth of 2% to 3%. So if categories are doing better, then our top line will do better as well. 
Gross margin, 40 basis points of expansion. The easy way to think about that is really 70 basis points from productivity programs, from commodities, not having any of the startup costs for York, for the vitamin plant, offset by about 30 basis point drag from currency. And I'll walk you through it when we talk about currency a little bit more, but we have a 30 basis point drag largely because of the transactional currency impacts from the U.S. to Canada. 
Marketing is flat, but there's a little bit more of a story there as well. SG&A is down 10 basis points, leveraging the top line. Operating margin is up 50, EPS 7% to 9%, currency adjusted, 9% to 11%. And we have share count number for you, 131, what's behind that? $300 million of buyback and we've already gotten ahead of ourselves, up $100 million in December. So $200 million left for '16. 
Okay. Here's how we stack up versus our evergreen TSR model of 3%. You can tell we've hit or beat that 3% number over time. Focus on gross margin, absolutely 2010, 2014 in the face of commodity headwinds in the face of laundry competitiveness, we maintained our gross margin. In '15, we expanded and we're going to expand again in 2016. Consistent marketing spend. So 12.3% to 12.3%, so I just want to leave you guys with this comment. The core business were increasing marketing spend by around 10 basis points, okay? Where a lot of our competition is cutting 20%, we're actually increasing our core business and the marketing spend associated with that. 
When we layer on the TOPPIK acquisition, it is a $30 million deal, about 1/3 of that revenue is direct. So the marketing spend is a little bit lower. So when you do the math, it becomes 12.3% to 123%. SG&A management is the hallmark of the company. This is our people do great things here. This is leveraging the top line, many companies do zero-based planning process, I'd say we've been doing this for many, many years. Operating profit, 2015 was a big year. We hit 20%. So a lot of personal care premium companies are in the neighborhood of 20%, so we're happy to be there and then in 2016, we think we're going to expand by 50 basis points again. 
EBITDA is a good surrogate for cash generation, and we think the stair step tells the Church & Dwight story very well, so we've gone from 20% to the mid-20s, 24.2%. For EPS, we're $3.48 to $3.54, that's the range of 7% to 9%. Again, once you backup currency, it's 9% to 11%. Okay. Here's the FX story. So in 2015, as a refresher, we had about a 2.5% drag on currency on the top line and a 4% drag for EPS. That was a 30 bps impact on gross margin. In 2016, we had a 1% drag for revenue and 2% drag on EPS, but we still have a 30 bps drag from gross margin. And that might surprise you, I would just tell you that in 2015, 70% of the drag for currency was translation and in '16, 70% transactions, so that's more of a gross margin impact 
Okay. Allocation of capital. Number one, by far, TSR accretive M&A. We want to do the -- we look at deals all the time. The management team, the senior leadership team, we look for deals all the time. You'd be shocked at how much time we actually spend on that. What I want to leave you with though is we're looking for the right deal and it's #1, but we want to make sure it's the right field. Number two is new product development that drives our organic growth. Number three is CapEx. Number four is return of cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. And number five is debt reduction. 
We're not a capital-intensive company. In 2016, our outlook is really $55 million of CapEx, you might say ""Hey, Rick, you guys have typically been high 60s, low 70s.""  And I'd say, ""No, the base business is actually in the 50s,"" and then we have incremental capacity demands for vitamins or for a new plant, that's when we spike up to a higher number. And then as Matt alluded to, 6% dividend increase to $1.42. That gives us right at or 40% payout ratio that we've been very clear on for many years. 
And with that, I'll welcome up the rest of the management team and we'll take your questions."

Just remember, we had a powder pod for many years. We focused on liquid and we didn't put a lot of effort behind the pod side of business.

Sometimes I think when you launch new products, clearly your P&L structure can afford a lot. But I am curious of the cost of keeping things on the shelf when I look like in the Nielsen data that some of the vitamin products you've launched over the years, a different variants beyond like the basic multivitamin, kind of get share, then they lose it, right? And that's been a pretty repeated pattern when you look at this sort of not SKU by SKU, but the title by title in the Nielsen data on vitamins. So what's the cost to keep stuff on shelf when it's not really selling through? What pressure are you under from retailers to get it out and get something new? And the same would go for OxiClean, so on the retailers, where you're 20 basis points of share gain, this will be starting year 3. How easy is it to keep it on shelf when you're at those share levels?"

And it is common knowledge within the company that's going to have a lot of SKUs that which drives the supply-chain guys crazy. They need to be on shelf because some consumers are looking for them. So that is the way to think about it. And yes, you're right some things cost money to get on shelf, you may have to pay [indiscernible] sliding, et cetera.

On OxiClean, you asked an OxiClean question, I would step back to provide this input because there are a lot of really good things that I think we should all feel terrific about. Those being as Matt showed, the category is growing again, right? So first time in a while that happened. Second big thing is that there are 2 new premium products in the category. That's a good thing for a couple of reasons, one being it promotes healthy competitive environment and two, it allows us to build our business. And last year, if you remember on OxiClean, we said we would incrementally spend against that brand and we did, and as Matt showed on his slide, our consumption is up 25%, our trial is up above 50%, and our repeat purchase is up about 40%. So although it's a difficult environment because consumers are used to buying for over 50 years, 1 particular brand, we believe in our brand. We will continue to support that brand moving forward."

So like Batiste, or Batiste and Feline Pine is the same on day 1, and Batiste just really worked and Feline Pine less so, because there are roles that the different acquisitions are meant to play when you bring them in?

So we say, we know a little bit about this category, it's not only successful in Europe, but it's successful in export markets. This is a pretty safe move for us to move into nasal hygiene. Now, as you quote on in the U.S., as the way it is in other countries, no. But it's a high-margin business, there's no plant [ph] came along with it, so I thought, okay, this makes some sense for us. Feline Pine, it was #1 or #2 natural cat litter that was really in vogue at the time when we looked at it, we said, hey, this looks like one that might make some sense for us. Again, no plant, that was co-packed. So we had the criteria, it was a solid brand. That one hasn't taken off. But when you buy it, we know we're looking at trends, if it doesn't make sense, you mentioned REPHRESH and. REPLENS. So a year ago, we buy REPHRESH and REPLENS, so this is the #1 gel vaginal moisturizer. People with that issue will look high and low for a product that's going to solve their problem. So again, problem solution brand, you put some money behind that as soon as we bought it, and it's grown really nicely in 2015. So we're real happy about that acquisition. And coming back to TOPPIK, again for [indiscernible] solution. We learned a lot about the hair category through Batiste. We're not going to get into what could be a shampoo company, liquid shampoo. But we feel really good about hair thinning, and that is an issue that you don't have a good solution there because today the big brand in the hair thinning is ROGAINE. It's a J&J product, and its in chemicals, right? And so if you look at the consumer research, people aren't happy with what the offerings are out there to solve the problem. And we think TOPPIK, if you go online, look at Amazon, some of the reviews for that product, people love it. And this business has people that have been customers for 20 years. So again, it's kind of thing we use to say, hey, this looks like a really solid brand. It's not going to go backwards, it's going to grow quite a bit.

I would say REPHRESH, REPLENS, internationally, off to a very good start as well. Again, we do a lot of doctor detailing, for example, in international markets. We feel that's a great product for us.

If you think back Q4, a year ago, was when we started seeing it was normalized pricing environment in laundry. So Q1, Q2, Q3 on paper looks like favorable pricing year over year in '15 versus '14, but that was just normalized pricing environment. So in Q4, there wasn't -- you're comping a time period that didn't have any pricing difference. So in general, I'd say 2015 versus '14 was the absence of the competitiveness in the pricing laundry category. 2016, as I said earlier, I think it's going to be very comparable to '15."

We have the entire management team here as well, who'll come up here when we're done with the presentation, and they'll be available for Q&A. So let's begin. 
So we have the obligatory safe harbor statement. I encourage everybody to read it, and here's the agenda. I'm going to talk about who we are, the categories that are most important to us -- That'll be laundry and vitamins -- how we deliver, how we run the company and then Rick is going to take everybody through the financials. 
Okay. Here's what you're going to hear today. I'm just going to pull it all up on the screen for you viewers at home, but the short story goes like this: We had a terrific 2015. So we had 8% EPS growth, and on an all-in basis, it's 12% local currency. We had full year organic sales growth of 3.6%. This puts us well above our evergreen target of 3%. We had a strong finish as we saw the consumer business grow 3.3% in the fourth quarter, and we have really good momentum going into 2016. Our new product pipeline is off to a good start. You can ask Lou a few questions about that when we get to Q&A. And we expect 3% organic revenue growth again in 2016. 
On the EPS front, 2016 outlook is, again, up 7% to 9% all-in, and that's 9% to 11% on a total currency basis. That's tops in CPG as you know. We announced a dividend increase today. That's to keep our payout ratio at 40%. And finally, we closed a small bolt-on acquisition in early January. We're always on the hunt for good brand acquisitions, so we're excited about the future. So let's begin. 
Okay, Church & Dwight was founded in 1846. So we have our 170th birthday coming up this year, and in the 19th century, it was founded with ARM & HAMMER baking soda. Today, we have 10 brands that drive our revenues and profit. These are our 10 power brands. In the year 2000, the only big brand we had was ARM & HAMMER. All 9 of those other brands were acquired since the year 2000. 
Our most recent power brand is now BATISTE. BATISTE is a business, a dry shampoo that we bought in 2011, and in 2016, the global sales of that brand will cross $100 million. Okay, those 10 brands drive our revenues and profits, 80% of our sales and over 80% of our profits. 
And of those 10, 4 are megabrands. These are 4 strong brands that have the ability to go into adjacent categories. And of those megabrands, those megabrands drive 60% of our revenue and over 60% of our profits. 
As I said, we are an acquirer. Those are the 9 brands that we've acquired, and as you can see also, we generally are focused on #1 brands. 
Okay, we're primarily a U.S. company, today 82% U.S., 18% international. This has the benefit of having minimal exposure to the weakening foreign economies. And we're very balanced, about half personal care and half household -- with Specialty Products business rounding it out at 8%. 
Okay, we are in the land of the giants. So we are a small company. In 2016, we'll have about $3.5 billion in sales. Small company but big returns. So the shareholder return 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year period have been stellar for our shareholders. 
I'm going to talk about the categories that are important to us. So first, laundry. So here's a depiction of the laundry category for the past 4 years: 2012, '13, '14 and '15. As you can see in '12, '13 and '14, both the total category and the liquid category declined in each of those 3 years. That turned around in 2015, particularly in the second half. So on a full year basis, the total category is up 1.6% and liquid up 0.7%. One of the added benefits of '14 going into '15, it was actually a stable promotional environment, so that contributed to the rise. 
Let's continue on the second category I want to talk about, is vitamins. As you know, in 2012 we acquired the Avid business. That got us into gummy vitamins. Why are we attracted to gummy vitamins? It's because it had been a fast-growing category. In fact, the vitamin, mineral and supplement category has been a mid-single digit grower for many, many years. That flattened out in 2014. Why? Because of negative press, and the growth has been rekindled again in 2015. So the category is growing. The other thing I want you to focus on is the gummy form. So the reason this is attractive is because pills and capsules are becoming less popular and gummies are becoming more popular. 
So if you look in 2012, you can see only 7% of the category was gummy. Today, it's 12%. And if you look at what headed the gummy form grow in 2015, it grew 16%. And the good news is that we are the #1 brand in both adult and in children's vitamins -- gummy vitamins. 
Okay. Here's the one I want to end on as far as trends go. This is dry shampoo. So I mentioned earlier that we acquired BATISTE in 2011, and in 2016, we're growing across $100 million in sales. We're the #1 dry shampoo in the U.K. and in the U.S. In the U.K., we have a 75 share, in the U.S., we have 15 share, round numbers. 
So here's the interesting factoid. So the U.K. has a retail category of $60 million with a population of 65 million. In the U.S., where the dry shampoo category is in the early innings, it's only a $90 million category with a population of 319 million. So we see a lot of runway ahead of us in this category and for this brand. 
Okay. How we deliver. If you're a shareholder, you're well aware of the 10 drivers of shareholder return. Let's review. First, we have a recession-resistant portfolio. This is very important. So we have a portfolio that's going to perform well in any economy, 60% premium and 40% value. Okay, here's an illustration of some of our products. You can see in many cases our value brand is about 50% less expensive than the premium brand. 
Now let's talk about new products. Okay, first up is ARM & HAMMER. So we're really excited about our 2016 product offerings. On the left-hand side, you see CLUMP & SEAL. So we have a new variant coming through CLUMP & SEAL. That's CLUMP & SEAL MicroGuard. Now MicroGuard not only seals and destroys odors, but it also prevents future bacterial odors. On the right-hand, you see BioEnzyme. So we have a new laundry variant in detergent and that's BioEnzyme, it's formulated to meet the safer choice environmental standards promulgated by the EPA. The third thing that's not on the screen is we also have a dual-chamber pod that we're launching under the ARM & HAMMER banner in 2016. 
A little bit more on CLUMP & SEAL. So in 2015, we came out with lightweight and naturals followed by MicroGuard in 2016. But here's a story that's worth telling. We have been an innovator in cat litter for years, so if you go back to 2011, you see DOUBLE DUTY, followed by ULTRA LAST. And then you see what happens when you don't have innovation in a year, you flatline. So in 2014, we came out with CLUMP & SEAL, the best cat litter that's out there. In '15, we followed with Naturals and Lightweight. And then '16, we followed with MicroGuard. Great story.

So we have a new liquid laundry detergent called OxiClean Preserve. This laundry detergent reduces pilling in your clothing, and just as we have a dual chamber pod for ARM & HAMMER, we also have one for OxiClean, called OxiClean HD. Just -- let's review the OxiClean mega brand for a minute. So start with laundry additives. So laundry additives, we had a record share, 45.9%, up 130 basis points, led by White Revive, which was our entry into the bleach category. Second is the laundry detergent. We end the year with a 1 share. We had a 0.8 share at the end of 2014. It's not moving as fast as we had hoped. The good news is that trial, repeat and consumption are all up year-over-year. And then finally, auto dish detergent category. That's a difficult category, we got a 1.3 in 2015. 
Okay, TROJAN. So 3 new offerings for TROJAN. First, condoms. So we have TROJAN Groove. So this is a grooved condom that retains the lubricant on the condom during sex. Number two, is TROJAN riviera, for those of you who have been waiting for a lubricant for use in the shower, you now have one. So long-lasting lubrication. And the third one is TROJAN divine, which is a multi-speed vibrating massager. I'm not sure if 1, 2 or all 3 of these are in your goodie bags today. That will be a little bit of a surprise. 
Okay, so vitamins. So lots of new products into vitamins space. So first, beauty. So we have a new beauty line with really attractive new packaging, also a couple offerings for teen, both teen sport and also teen hair, skin and nails. And then licenses. Licenses have become increasingly important in the children's category. So we had Barbie and Mario launch in 2015 and then this month, we have Minions as well. So that bodes well for our children's Gummy Vitamins. And finally, FIRST RESPONSE. So there's now a Bluetooth pregnancy test kit. So you download the app to your iPhone, you take the -- use the pregnancy kit. It sends the result to your app, and what the app does for you, it provides you lots of information throughout your pregnancy. So this is -- we've all heard about the Internet of Things, so this is our first foray into the Internet of Things. So it's in our ability to test and learn. 
All right. Marketing. So you've often heard us talk about how much money we spend on marketing. We're the 15th-largest advertiser in the U.S., so we're in pretty good company here, as you can see on this slide. And we've also said that our marketing would generally bang around between 12% and 13% of sales. So you can see over the last 4 years, we've been averaged around 12.5%. And it all -- it's going to show up in your shares. So if I call your attention to the right-hand side of this slide, this is our report card. So on the top, you have your mega brands. On the bottom, you have your remaining power brands. So 3 out of 4 of our mega brands grew share in 2015. 
Vitamins is yellow, why. We went sideways this past year. It's well known we had some difficulties with the new plant start-up. That's all behind us now. And then with respect to this -- the other 6 power brands. You see XTRA is red. But actually XTRA profits were up in '15 versus '14 as we didn't chase the competition down in discounting. And battery-operated toothbrushes has been a perennial difficult category. That's also red. But 7 out of 10 were green. 
Okay. Distribution. So this is new information for you. We took a look at our distribution gains over the past 6 years. So we looked at 2009 to '12, and then separately, 2012 to 2015. So we're happy to report that we've been consistent in expanding our distribution year after year after year. We expect to continue to do this in the future. And while we're on the topic of distribution, BATISTE with a 15.2 share today, that share is only going to grow because we're expanding in top retailers in 2016. Another good story.
Defense of our brands. It's no secret that the laundry category has been a difficult category for all competitors for several years now. So in 2014, you had Simply Tide show up in the value tier. 2015 had Persil show up in your premium tier. And on top of that, you have price wars breaking out. So what happened? So just left to right, 2013 we had a 14 share; 2014, 14.2; 2015, 14.4. So in each of the past few years, we've expanded share in spite of the new entrants and the price wars, and we expect to continue to expand share in the future. 
International. So just as I said in the year 2000, the only big brand we had was ARM & HAMMER. Near 2001, we were just a U.S. company. Today, we're a little bit more diverse, 82%, as I said earlier, is U.S. and 18% is international. 
Here's how it's spread out, we have a European business unit, which is our largest business unit. That encompasses the U.K. and France. That's 37% of the business, followed by #2 Canada, then Mexico and Australia. 
Our international business has been a stellar performer for many years, so you can look at the CAGR for the last 5 years. Virtually every business, every country is at or above our 3% evergreen target. 
Now gross margin. So here's a 6-year look at gross margin. So if you think about the first 3 years, so '10, '11, '12, we're all still dealing with the commodity super cycle, so that was depressing margins. And then more recently, you had price wars breakout, and it's a bit of an offset from a combined abatement, but we've been around 44.5% gross margins for a good long time in spite of all those factors. 
The 4 ways we drive gross margin. This is familiar to many of our shareholders and we'll go clockwise here. So Good to Great, that's the name of our continuous improvement program. Second is supply chain optimization. As you know, we built a couple of plants in the last 5 years. Number three, new products. So when we launch new products, those new products need to have higher-than-average gross margins. And finally, acquisitions. So when we buy businesses, one of our requirements is that we buy businesses at, at or above our existing corporate gross margin. 
Okay. And as you know, we have a very simple compensation structure. Now we promote financial literacy within the company. One of the ways we do that is we tie gross margin -- it is -- 25% of any -- of all employee's annual bonus is tied to us achieving the gross margin target. 
Next is acquisitions. So we have very strict criteria with respect to acquisitions. Consequently, we're very fussy about the brands and the businesses we're going to buy. And this criteria hasn't changed in quite a few years. 
Long history of acquisitions, obviously, that contributed to our top line growth. 2004, we were about $1.5 billion. We're $3.5 billion today. Good chunk of that was driven by acquisitions. 
And a good way to think about Church & Dwight is an acquisition platform. So when we acquire businesses, we grow the revenue and we get cost synergies. So how do we do that? So with respect to the revenue growth, we have veteran marketers within the company. We have a separate new product development process, separate from the business units, and as a result, we expand shares. As far as the cost synergies go, we're leveraging the new brand across all classes of trade, and we have a supply chain and an R&D organization that are very versatile. So we can handle liquids, aerosols, powders, gels, devices, et cetera. 
And our track record is stellar. 9 out of 10 power brands, so we get cost synergies every time, and Rick's going to tell a little bit more about access to capital when he gets up here. 
Okay. How have we done? So if we acquire a business, what was the preacquisition share? What's the share today? In every case, you see that we expand shares. 
And TOPPIK. You've probably read in the release that we acquired this brand, this -- earlier this month. We were entering the hair thinning category. This is a problem solution brand. If you think about the characteristics of it. We think it's very much like BATISTE. We had a couple of non-CHD investors agreed to demo the product. Here's a male, before and after. And here's a woman, before and after. 
And happily, if you've retained more than 50% of your hair, and you know who you are, particularly sell-side analysts, this product is for you. A nice side benefit of this, by the way, is that they have a very robust sales and marketing team online, so we're going to learn a lot from them. If you want to learn more about the product, you can go to toppik.com. 
Okay. Best-in-class free cash flow. Rick's going to take you through that, but we've averaged well above our peers for many years. 
SG&A. This is a hallmark of the company. You can see that we have extremely productive employees, and we're the lowest SG&A of any CPG company, and we intend to stay there. 
We have an expert management team. We have lots of people with lots of experience in all of these seats and driven by a simple compensation program. 
I said earlier that gross margin is 25% of the annual bonus. The rest is cash from operations, EPS and net revenue. Very easy to explain, very easy to remember. And our long-term compensation is 100% stock options and we're all called required to be heavily invested in the company's stock. 
And here are the results again. So stellar returns to our shareholders over the 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods. 
Okay. How we run the company? Because we have an evergreen model, so we always target 3% organic growth annually and 50 basis points of operating margin expansion, and we target 8% EPS growth. 
Okay. As far as our operating system goes, first is the evergreen model. Second is we know what geographies we're focusing on: North America first, that's Canada, U.S. and Mexico; and secondarily, Europe and Asia. Allocation of capital. Rick's going to take you through but at the top of the list and these are in order of importance is TSR accretive acquisitions and finally, those acquisition criteria haven't changed in years. 
And we have 4 operating principles. So we have #1 brands that we leverage. We're very asset light. We're not capital intensive. We generate lots of cash flow so we leverage assets, and we have very productive employees, the most productive employees in the CPG space. All of that combines for good returns, but when you leverage acquisitions on top of that, you get spectacular returns. Okay. Now I'm going to bring Rick up here to talk about the financials."
261105,320856620,925053,"Church & Dwight Co. Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2016",2016-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thank you, Matt. I'm going to cover 3 topics. We're going to talk about the quarter, Q4, and just how we came in. We'll go through 2015 and some of the details there, and then talk about 2016 outlook. But if there's one theme to take away from the f",1611,"Okay. Thank you, Matt. I'm going to cover 3 topics. We're going to talk about the quarter, Q4, and just how we came in. We'll go through 2015 and some of the details there, and then talk about 2016 outlook. But if there's one theme to take away from the financials today, it's really 2015 ended well, and we have a lot of momentum as we go into 2016, a lot of optimism. 
So Q4: 2.6% organic sales growth, 3.3% for the Consumer Domestic division. Largely driven by volume. We'll get into the details in a second. But 2.5% volume growth. Gross margin expanded 50 basis points behind commodity improvement, behind our productivity programs. A lot of our price in the laundry is normalized, the same theme you've been hearing about all year long. Marketing was down 10 basis points, so essentially flat, and SG&A was up 10%, so operating margin was up 50. So EPS was up 5 and currency neutral EPS is up 9. Great result. 
So to the quarters of 2015, pretty consistent. 2.6% in Q4. Remember versus a year ago, we were at 5.2%. So really strong growth in Q4 off of a high comp year-ago. 
And you guys like to look at the stack bar, so we threw one in here for consumer business. This is just the strength -- relative strength of the consumer business, a lot of momentum going into Q4. 7.2% in Q4, so we're exiting the year at a strong rate. Categories are strong. 
So volume is the growth driver, 2.5% out of 2.6% from the organic side for the company. 3.2% for the domestic division. With international division, we do get a little price as we go into the FX headwinds. And then SPD, we're down 4% largely on volume because no prices have come down. 
Great trend, great momentum on gross margin as well, 45.5% for the quarter, and as I said before, normalized pricing environment, commodity -- commodities are a tailwind, and productivity programs continue. A lot of our vitamin issues for start-up happened earlier in the year. 
Marketing spend. Highest percentage, highest dollar amount of the year. And that leads to share growth, 7 out of our 10 power brands and Matt walked you through those details. 3 of 4 megabrands proves well. 
So let's recap on the full year: 3.5% organic sales growth compares to 3% outlook earlier in the year, largely volume-driven. Gross margin is up 40 basis points for all the reasons I already walked through. Marketing is down 30. Now we talked about that a little bit on our Q3 call. We reallocated some of the marketing spend and put it in the trade line for OxiClean to drive trial, and as Matt alluded to, trial and share -- trial and consumption are both up. 
Adjusted SG&A is flat and operating margin is up 70 basis points. So great result. EPS is up 8%, and free cash flow is a record of $544 million. Adjusted free cash flow conversion is 125%. That is a very important metric to the company. We'll be talking about that even more as we go forward. And that should be very important to every shareholder as well. 
So why can we drive great cash flow productivity? It's because partly of working capital improvement. Our cash conversion cycle, which is inventory, which is receivables minus payables has gone from 40 days to 27 days over the last 5 years. We continue to believe that we can continue to make that go down over time. 
Free cash flow conversion is 125% in 2015, average for the last 5 years, 119%. So just stellar result. We did dip our toe in the water in 2015 on AR factory. So that is in that 125%. If we take that out, we're still at 119%. 
So as Matt alluded to, 118% for the last 7 years or so, which is far above the industry average and far above some other competitors who target 90%. 
We have a strong balance sheet, 1.4x levered. Why is that important? It's important because we have a lot of fire power, a lot of dry powder waiting to do an acquisition. And as an example, we could do a $2.8 billion deal and maintain our credit rating. Okay. So that's '15. 
So why don't I go through 2016. First, organic, 3%. So there's a couple things behind that number, so that'll be SPD, 1% to 3% type of growth. International, 4% growth, and for the consumer business, domestically 2% to 3%. And you might ask why is that coming down from 3.5% in 2015. There's really 2 assumptions in there. One is the international business comes back down to earth. We had a phenomenal year this year, behind Steve Cugine and this team. 8% going to 4%, so back [ph] under it there. And then the categories, our assumption for that is growth of 2% to 3%. So if categories are doing better, then our top line will do better as well. 
Gross margin. 40 basis points of expansion. The easy way to think about that is really 70 basis points from productivity programs, from commodities, not having any of the start-up costs for York, for the vitamin plant, offset by about a 30 basis point drag from currency. And I'll walk you through it when we talk about currency a little bit more, but we have a 30 basis point drag largely because of the transactional currency impacts from the U.S. to Canada. 
Marketing is flat, but there's a little bit more of a story there as well. SG&A is down 10 basis points, leveraging the top line. Operating margin is up 50, EPS 7% to 9%; currency adjusted, 9% to 11%. And we have share count number for you. 131 million. What's behind that? $300 million of buyback, and we've already gotten ahead of ourselves of 100 million in December. So $200 million left for '16. 
Okay. Here's how we stack up versus our evergreen TSR model of 3%. You can tell we've hit or beat that 3% number over time. 
Focus on gross margin. Absolutely, 2010, 2014, in the face of commodity headwinds, in the face of laundry competitiveness, we've maintained our gross margin. In '15, we expanded, and we're going to expand again in 2016. 
Consistent marketing spend. So 12.3% to 12.3%. So I just want to leave you guys with this comment. The core business, we're increasing marketing spend by around 10 basis points, okay. Where a lot of our competition is cutting 20%, we're actually increasing our core business and the marketing spend associated with that. When we layer on the TOPPIK acquisition, it is a $30 million deal. About 1/3 of that revenue is direct. So the marketing spend is a little bit lower. So when you do the math, it becomes 12.3% to 12.3%. 
SG&A management is a hallmark of the company. This is -- our people do great things here. This is leveraging the top line. Many companies do zero-based planning process. I'd say we've been doing this for many, many years. 
Operating profit. 2015 was a big year. We hit 20%. So a lot of personal care premium companies are in the neighborhood of 20%, so we're happy to be there, and then in 2016, we think we're going to expand by 50 basis points again. 
EBITDA is a good surrogate for cash generation, and we think the stair step tells the Church & Dwight story very well, so we've gone from 20% to the mid-20s, 24.2%. 
For EPS, we're $3.48 to $3.54. That's the range at 7% to 9%. Again, once you back up currency, it's 9% to 11%. 
Okay. Here's the FX story. So in 2015, as a refresher, we had about a 2.5% drag on currency on the top line and a 4% drag for EPS. That was a 30 bps impact on gross margin. In 2016, we had a 1% drag for revenue and a 2% drag on EPS, but we still have a 30 bps drag from gross margin. And that might surprise you. I would just tell you that, in 2015, 70% of the drag for currency was translation, and in '16, 70% transaction, so that's more of a gross margin impact 
Okay. Allocation of capital. Number one, by far, TSR-accretive M&A. We want to do the -- we look at deals all the time. The management team, the senior leadership team, we look for deals all the time. You'd be shocked at how much time we actually spend on that. What I want to leave you with, though, is we're looking for the right deal, and it's #1, but we want to make sure it's the right deal. Number two is new product development. That drives our organic growth. Number three is CapEx. Number four is return of cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. And number five is debt reduction. 
We're not a capital-intensive company. In 2016, our outlook is really $55 million of CapEx. You might say ""Hey, Rick, you guys have typically been high 60s, low 70s.""  And I'd say, ""No, the base business is actually in the 50s,"" and then when we have incremental capacity demands for vitamins or for a new plant, that's when we spike up to a higher number. 
And then as Matt alluded to, 6% dividend increase to $1.42. That gets us right at our 40% payout ratio that we've been very clear on for many years. 
And with that, I'll welcome up the rest of the management team, and we'll take your questions."

Just remember, we had a powder pod for many years. We focused on liquid, and we didn't put a lot of effort behind the pod side of business.

And that's been a pretty repeated pattern when you look at this sort of, not SKU by SKU but the title by title in the Nielsen data on vitamins. So what's the cost to keep stuff on shelf when it's not really selling through? What pressure are you under from retailers to get it out and get something new? And the same would go for OxiClean.

It's not only successful in Europe, but it's successful in export markets. This is a pretty safe move for us to move into nasal hygiene. Now, has it caught on in the U.S. the way it is in other countries? No. But it's a high-margin business. There -- no plant came along with it, so we thought, okay, this makes some sense for us. FELINE PINE. It was a #1 or #2 natural cat litter that was really en vogue at the time when we looked at it. We said, hey, this looks like one that might make some sense for us. Again, no plant.

So again, problem solution brand. We put some money behind that as soon as we bought it, and it's grown really nicely in 2015. So we're real happy about that acquisition. And coming back to TOPPIK, again problem solution. We learned a lot about the hair category through BATISTE. We're not going to get into what could be a shampoo company, liquid shampoo. But we feel really good about hair thinning, and that is an issue that you don't have a good solution there because today the big brand in hair thinning is ROGAINE. It's a J&J product, and its putting chemicals, right. And so if you look at the consumer research, people aren't happy with what offerings are out there to solve the problem. And we think TOPPIK, if you go online, look at Amazon, some of the reviews for that product, people love it. And this business has people that have been customers for 20 years.

From a market share perspective, 6 of our 10 power brands grew share so all in these result are top-tier and consumer products. Now I'd like to provide you with some color on a few of our categories. That'll be laundry, litter, vitamins and dry shampoo. 
The laundry category is strong, growing 6.4% versus a year ago. This is the fourth quarter in a row of laundry category growth. The value segment grew 6.1% and this is the sixth consecutive quarter of value segment growth. In fact, for the last 4 quarters, value has grown on average 4.5% per quarter. The laundry category growth was driven by growth in both the unit dose and liquid segments. This value liquid segment grew at an 8% clip, driven by ARM & HAMMER liquid, which grew consumption a whopping 11% year-over-year. 
With respect to unit dose, this form now represents 15% of the laundry category. Our unit dose consumption grew 15% in the quarter. More recently, we have launched new 2 chamber unit dose products under the OxiClean and ARM & HAMMER brands. We expect these new products to contribute to future consumption growth. Most of the resets for these launches happened in late March and early April. 
Now I'd like to take a few minutes to talk about our 3 laundry brands. ARM & HAMMER has been our big franchise in laundry for many years and the ARM & HAMMER laundry share continue to grow this quarter, up 30 basis points. To illustrate the strength of the ARM & HAMMER brand, ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry has grown share year-over-year in 25 consecutive quarters. Our XTRA brand backed off commercial volumes in Q1, which improved our year-over-year profitability but resulted in our giving up 40 basis points per share. On a full-year basis, we expect XTRA next sales and [indiscernible] to be up year-over-year. 
Oxi laundry share was down 10 basis points year-over-year. As we, like others saw the impact of Persil's promotional activity. In the most recent 4-week period, we are back to a 1 share. So promotional phasing does influence shares. If we look at how OxiClean is doing in the stain fighter or additive category, OxiClean's share hit an all-time high of 40% [ph], 80% share. 
Now I'm going to turn my comments to cat litter. The clumping litter segment continued to show strong growth at 5.3%. ARM & HAMMER litter was 1 of the winners in the quarter. We continue to grow faster than the segment. Our consumption grew 6.7% behind our latest innovation, MicroGuard CLUMP & SEAL litter. Just a quick commercial. MicroGuard seals and destroys odors, and prevents future bacterial odors from forming. It's an innovative product and we are broadcasting that message on our package that 98% of consumers who have tried the product would recommend it. 
Now let's talk about vitamins. The overall VMS category continues to show steady growth, up 3%. The gummy segment of VMS grew almost 15% in Q1. And so let me break down the 15% for you. The adult gummy segment grew 23% while the kids gummy segment declined 8%. Adult gums is where we are putting our focus as it is underdeveloped and it will be the source of future growth for us. Our brand, Vitafusion, is the largest brand in the adult gummy category and was the biggest driver of the 23% adult segment category growth. The good news this quarter is that our gummy business is growing again. 
We have had wide retailer acceptance of our new adult beauty line, which hit shores -- which hit store shelves in March. So we are off to a good start this year for vitamins. The last category I want to address is dry shampoo. This category grew 26% in Q1 year-over-year. A, the category in the U.S. is nearly $100 million with the potential to be a $300 million category in the U.S. if we match the historical category growth experienced in the U.K. BATISTE is the #1 brand in the U.S. with a 17.2% share. BATISTE global net sales will cross $100 million this year, making it the #1 dry shampoo brand globally. So it's no surprise that the BATISTE brand is expected to be 1 of our fastest growing brands in the future. 
Many new products are shipping right now. I've mentioned dual chamber pods, MicroGuard glitter and the vitamin beauty line. In addition, we have the new groove condom and Riviera lubricant by TROJAN, and the new Bluetooth-enabled pregnancy test kit from FIRST RESPONSE. We feel good about our distribution, and we look forward to these products contributing to our organic growth in 2016. Our goal is to continue to focus on consumer insights, leading us to innovative new products to drive share and category growth. 
Next up is Rick to give you details on our first quarter results and the outlook for Q2 and the full year."
261105,329530354,973746,"Church & Dwight Co. Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. I'll start with EPS.

The $0.86 was better than our $0.83 outlook, largely due to organic revenue beat and gross margin expansi",1009,"Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. I'll start with EPS. First quarter reported EPS was $0.86 per share compared to $0.80 in 2015, up 7.5%. The $0.86 was better than our $0.83 outlook, largely due to organic revenue beat and gross margin expansion beat. Netted in that $0.86 is $0.02 or 2.5% drag from currency year-over-year. Reported revenue were up 4.5% to $849 million. Organic sales were 5.2%, exceeding our Q1 outlook of approximately 2% to 3%. The organic sales beat was driven by our consumer business both domestic and international. 
Now let's review the segments. The Consumer Domestic businesses organic sales increased by 4.5%, driven by the continued success of our ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry, detergent, Vitafusion Gummy Vitamin, BATISTE dry shampoo and ARM & HAMMER CLUMP & SEAL cat litter. We now expect the full year organic sales to be approximately 3% for the Consumer Domestic business. International organic growth was up an impressive 13.3%. Now some of that was timing as orders are a little lumpy in the export business. But underlying growth was very strong at approximately 9%. Here again, we're raising our expectation for the full year. Organic growth from 4% to approximately 5% to 6% from the consumer international business. 
For Specialty Products Division, organic sales was down 2%, driven by further declines in milk pricing and a difficult comp of 11% growth a year ago. Prices have come down 10% in the last 90 days as there is an oversupply globally. And as a result, U.S. exports, which historically had been 15% plus of U.S. production, are now around 10%. We have lowered our expectations for the full year for the SPD division from up 1% to 3% to down 2%. This is a headwind that we expect to overcome for the full year and we still like this business, but we do experience these cycles from time to time. 
Turning now to gross margins. Our reported first quarter gross margin was 44.6%, an 80 basis point increase from a year ago. Q1 gross margin benefited from 3 factors: lower commodities, productivity programs and the higher-margin from acquired businesses. These factors were partially offset by foreign exchange, negative product mix and higher fixed costs associated with our new vitamin capacity in our New York facility. 
Moving to marketing. We increased marketing spend by 4.2% year-over-year. Marketing as a percent of revenue was consistent with 2015 at 10.9%. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 12.6%, a 90 basis point increase from the prior year. This was primarily due to incremental amortization from acquisitions and the timing of management stock compensation. 
Now to operating profit. The reported operating margin for the quarter was 21.1%, which was 10 basis points lower than the prior year. Other income and expense was $6.4 million, largely $7 million of expense related to interest expense. Next is income taxes. Our effective tax rate for the quarter is 34.7%. And turning to cash. We had a strong cash flow quarter. We generated $178 million of net cash for the first quarter and $33 million increase from the same quarter a year ago. So in conclusion, the first quarter highlights include 5.2% organic, 7.5% EPS growth, which again equates to a 10% currency-neutral EPS growth. 
Turning to the second quarter outlook. We expect Q2 organic sales growth of approximately 2% to 3%, and I know a lot of you guys like to look at growth on a 2-year stacked basis. Remember for the total company, year ago, Q2 was 5% organic. So on the 2-year stacked, Q1 and Q2 were pretty similar at approximately 8%. Now if we just focus in on the Consumer Domestic business for a minute. The 2 year stacked is going from 6.1% in Q1 to almost 8% in Q2. So a lot of positive momentum continuing on. We expect marketing as a percentage of revenue to be flat year-over-year and gross margin to expand in Q2. We expect second quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.79 compared to an adjusted $0.73 per share year ago or an 8% increase year-over-year. 
And now turning to the full year. To summarize our thinking, we're raising our expectations organic sales growth from 3% to 3% or 4%. In February, we called approximately 40 basis points of gross margin expansion and we're pleased to say that now, we're calling 70 basis points of gross margin expansion -- 75. Back in February, this broke out as 70 basis points of health and commodities and productivity, offset by 30 basis points from currency headwind. The 75 basis points we expect now is 100 basis points from commodities and productivity programs, offset by a 25 basis point drag from currency. We're more optimistic about the stability of commodity pricing across the entire commodity basket for the full year than we were a quarter ago. 
Our full-year marketing expectation continues to be 12.3% of sales consistent with 2015 and prior years. Moving to SG&A. Our original expectations were 10 basis point reduction. We now expect a 25 basis point increase largely behind R&D, IT and Internet international sales force investments. Let me give you a little color on these investments. First, investing in R&D projects behind our future project portfolio. Second, investing in our international sales force, footprint, specifically in high-growth areas of our business to drive our future growth. And third, we expect higher ongoing IT infrastructure costs as we implement 2 new important systems: our spec management system for R&D and our trade management system for sales. We are positioning ourselves well for the future. 
We continue to expect the 2 basis points of operating margin expansion. Next is income tax. We now expect 34.7% for the full year. So it's a little higher than our previous outlook of 34.5%. We continue to expect $630 million of free cash flow net of approximately $65 million of CapEx for full-year 2016. This represents 125% free cash flow conversion. 
So now Matt and I will open it up for questions."

If you remember, when we spoke downtown in February and we showed a chart that showed our innovations over the past 3 or 4 years. So we've clearly been the catalyst of that category. And we have a winner again this year with the MicroGuard product. So we're driving growth from that category, which is a big category. And we're taking share. And we generally have a big new idea every year. So we think we can continue that in the future. With respect to laundry. As I said earlier, well, ARM & HAMMER has been quite a powerhouse for us for a long time. The new product this year is, one of them is the bioenzyme product, which has the EPA safer choice label, which is becoming more meaningful to all shoppers. So we think that's a nice new variant for us to help us continue to grow the franchise. Some of the other things I mentioned. Vitamins, what we did was we decided to shrinkwrap our products so we got beautiful new packaging, which obviously, speak out -- pops on shelf. And we think that, that is going to be a winner for us this year as well. Continuing down the line. In the TROJAN Riviera, so this a [indiscernible] can be used in the shower. So that's another consumer insight that we think is going to expand the share for TROJAN and as you know, TROJAN's share continues to grow. We're up slightly year-over-year a little over 76% share. And FIRST RESPONSE again, is the #1 brand in pregnancy test kits. And we're the first people to come out to try a Bluetooth-enabled pregnancy test kit. So that's our -- what we're trying to do there is test and learn in what we call the Internet of Things. So we have a very robust new product development process. We're very focused on consumer insights and that does lead us to really cool ideas with respect to new products. And we've got a nice pipeline for 2017 and 2018. So that gives us confidence that we continue to grow the top line organically."

But I agree with his general premise that mathematically, it's not that hard to get well above where you're guiding to. So a couple of questions just to help us sort of understand this. First, commodities. Is there something to consider in terms of your hedge positions for last year, this year, et cetera that may cause your benefit or lack thereof to be greater or worse than what you're seeing in spot markets. And then secondly, the leakage on the fixed costs resource for the new vitamin plant I appreciate that that's here to stay for a while but are suing going to lap the start-up expenses to those to effectively wash?

So we had said previously, and it's still of the case of in general, resin was down 10% was down 20%.

We entered the year was about 30% hedged, which is really our lowest level of quite a few years because we thought we should float most of the market. We do have a couple of hedges on surfactants. But so may be we're not getting the entire spot market benefit. But in general, 200 basis points is not realistic for us at all. So we do have that as a tailwind. In general, from commodities, fixed cost for vitamins now remember we told you guys this was a 75% increase in capacity. So a $300 million business becomes $525 million. it's going to take some time to really grow into those fixed overheads. And you're right, we had start-up costs last year.

I'll start with a brief review of our first quarter results, which you read about in this morning's press release. I'll then direct the rest of my comments towards our categories. 
I'm going to turn the call over to Rick Dierker when I'm done. Rick will comment on each business. That's Domestic, International and Specialty Products and also review the outlook for Q2 and for the full year. When Rick is finished, I'll get back on and we'll open the call up to questions. 
So here are the highlights. In short, Q1 was a terrific quarter for Church & Dwight. We delivered organic sales growth of 5.2% and 7.5% EPS growth, which is 10% EPS growth on a currency-neutral basis. Category growth was broad-based in that 11 of our 15 categories grew in the quarter. From a market share perspective, 6 of our 10 power brands grew share. So all-in, these results are top-tier in consumer products. Now I'd like to provide you with some color on a few of our categories. That would be laundry, litter, vitamins and dry shampoo. 
The laundry category is strong, growing 6.4% versus year-ago. This is the fourth quarter in a row of laundry category growth. The value segment grew 6.1%, and this is the sixth consecutive quarter of value segment growth. In fact, for the last 4 quarters, value has grown on average 4.5% per quarter. The laundry category growth was driven by growth in both the unit dose and liquid segments. The value liquid segment grew at an 8% clip, driven by ARM & HAMMER liquid, which grew consumption a whopping 11% year-over-year. 
With respect to unit dose, this form now represents 15% of the laundry category. Our unit dose consumption grew 15% in the quarter. More recently, we have launched new 2-chamber unit dose products under the OxiClean and ARM & HAMMER brands. We expect these new products to contribute to future consumption growth. Most of the resets for these launches happened in late March and early April. 
Now I'd like to take a few minutes to talk about our 3 laundry brands. ARM & HAMMER has been our big franchise in laundry for many years. And the ARM & HAMMER laundry share continued to grow this quarter, up 30 basis points. To illustrate the strength of the ARM & HAMMER brand, ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry has grown share year-over-year in 25 consecutive quarters. 
Our XTRA brand backed off promotional volume in Q1, which improved our year-over-year profitability but resulted in our giving up 40 basis points of share. On a full-year basis, we expect XTRA net sales and profits to be up year-over-year. 
Oxi laundry share was down 10 basis points year-over-year. As we, like others, felt the effect of Persil's promotional activity. In the most recent 4-week period, we are back to a 1 share. So promotional phasing does influence shares. If we look at how OxiClean is doing in the stain fighter additive category, OxiClean's share hit an all-time high of 48% share. 
Now I'm going to turn my comments to cat litter. The clumping litter segment continued to show strong growth at 5.3%. ARM & HAMMER litter was one of the winners in the quarter. We continue to grow faster than the segment. Our consumption grew 6.7% behind our latest innovation, MicroGuard CLUMP & SEAL litter. 
Just a quick commercial. MicroGuard seals and destroys odors, and prevents future bacterial odors from forming. It's an innovative product and we are broadcasting that message on our package that 98% of consumers, who have tried the product, would recommend it. 
Now let's talk about vitamins. The overall VMS category continues to show steady growth, up 3%. The gummy segment of VMS grew almost 15% in Q1. And so let me break down the 15% for you. The adult gummy segment grew 23% while the kids gummy segment declined 8%. Adult gummies is where we are putting our focus as it is underdeveloped and it will be the source of future growth for us. Our brand, Vitafusion, is the largest brand in the adult gummy category and was the biggest driver of the 23% adult segment category growth. The good news this quarter is that our gummy business is growing again. 
We have had wide retailer acceptance of our new adult beauty line, which hit shores -- which hit store shelves in March. So we are off to a good start this year for vitamins. The last category I want to address is dry shampoo. This category grew 26% in Q1 year-over-year. A, the category in the U.S. is nearly $100 million with the potential to be a $300 million category in the U.S. if we match the historical category growth experienced in the U.K. 
Batiste is the #1 brand in the U.S. with a 17.2% share. Batiste global net sales will cross $100 million this year, making it the #1 dry shampoo brand globally. So it's no surprise that the Batiste brand is expected to be one of our fastest growing brands in the future. 
Many new products are shipping right now. I've mentioned dual chamber pods, MicroGuard litter and the vitamin beauty line. In addition, we have the new GROOVE condom and RIVIERA lubricant by TROJAN; and the new Bluetooth-enabled pregnancy test kit from First Response. 
We feel good about our distribution, and we look forward to these products contributing to our organic growth in 2016. Our goal is to continue to focus on consumer insights, leading us to innovative new products to drive share and category growth. 
Next up is Rick to give you details on our first quarter results and the outlook for Q2 and the full year."
261105,329530354,974192,"Church & Dwight Co. Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. I'll start with EPS. First quarter reported EPS was $0.86 per share compared to $0.80 in 2015, up 7.5%. The $0.86 was better than our $0.83 outlook, largely due to organic revenue beat and gross margin expansi",1005,"Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. I'll start with EPS. First quarter reported EPS was $0.86 per share compared to $0.80 in 2015, up 7.5%. The $0.86 was better than our $0.83 outlook, largely due to organic revenue beat and gross margin expansion beat. Netted in that $0.86 is $0.02 or 2.5% drag from currency year-over-year. 
Reported revenues were up 4.5% to $849 million. Organic sales were 5.2%, exceeding our Q1 outlook of approximately 2% to 3%. The organic sales beat was driven by our consumer business, both domestic and international. 
Now let's review the segments. The Consumer Domestic business' organic sales increased by 4.5%, driven by the continued success of our ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent, Vitafusion gummy vitamin, Batiste dry shampoo and ARM & HAMMER CLUMP & SEAL cat litter. We now expect the full year organic sales to be approximately 3% for the Consumer Domestic business. 
International organic growth was up an impressive 13.3%. Now some of that was timing as orders are a little lumpy in the export business, but underlying growth was very strong at approximately 9%. Here again, we are raising our expectation for the full year. Organic growth from 4% to approximately 5% to 6% for the consumer international business. 
For our Specialty Products Division, organic sales was down 2%, driven by further declines in milk pricing and a difficult comp of 11% growth year-ago. Milk prices have come down 10% in the last 90 days as there is an oversupply globally. And as a result, U.S. exports, which historically have been 15% plus of U.S. production, are now around 10%. We have lowered our expectations for the full year for the SPD division from up 1% to 3% to down 2%. This is a headwind that we expect to overcome for the full year and we still like this business, but we do experience these cycles from time to time. 
Turning now to gross margin. Our reported first quarter gross margin was 44.6%, an 80 basis point increase from year-ago. Q1 gross margin benefited from 3 factors: lower commodities, productivity programs and the higher-margin from acquired businesses. These factors were partially offset by foreign exchange, negative product mix and higher fixed costs associated with our new vitamin capacity in our York facility. 
Moving to marketing. We increased marketing spend by 4.2% year-over-year. Marketing as a percent of revenue was consistent with 2015 at 10.9%. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 12.6%, a 90 basis point increase from the prior year. This was primarily due to incremental amortization from acquisitions and the timing of management stock compensation. 
Now to operating profit. The reported operating margin for the quarter was 21.1%, which was 10 basis points lower than the prior year. Other income and expense was $6.4 million, largely $7 million of expense related to interest expense. Next is income taxes. Our effective rate for the quarter is 34.7%. 
And turning to cash. We had a strong cash flow quarter. We generated $178 million of net cash for the first quarter, a $33 million increase from the same quarter year-ago. So in conclusion, the first quarter highlights include 5.2% organic, 7.5% EPS growth, which again equates to a 10% currency-neutral EPS growth. 
Turning to the second quarter outlook. We expect Q2 organic sales growth of approximately 2% to 3%, and I know a lot of you guys like to look at growth on a 2-year stack basis. Remember, for the total company, year ago, Q2 was 5% organic. So on a 2-year stack, Q1 and Q2 look pretty similar at approximately 8%. 
And if we just focus in on the Consumer Domestic business for a minute. The 2-year stack is going from 6.1% in Q1 to almost 8% in Q2. So a lot of positive momentum continuing on. 
We expect marketing as a percentage of revenue to be flat year-over-year and gross margin to expand in Q2. We expect second quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.79 compared to an adjusted $0.73 per share year-ago or an 8% increase year-over-year. 
And now turning to the full year. To summarize our thinking, we are raising our expectations for organic sales growth from 3% to 3% to 4%. In February, we called approximately 40 basis points of gross margin expansion, and we're pleased to say that now, we're calling 70 basis points of gross margin expansion -- 75. 
Back in February, this broke out as 70 basis points of help from commodities and productivity, offset by 30 basis points from currency headwinds. The 75 basis points we expect now is 100 basis points from commodities and productivity programs, offset by a 25 basis point drag from currency. We're more optimistic about the stability of commodity pricing across the entire commodity basket for the full year than we were a quarter ago. Our full-year marketing expectation continues to be 12.3% of sales, consistent with 2015 and prior years. 
Moving to SG&A. Our original expectations were a 10 basis point reduction. We now expect a 25 basis point increase largely behind R&D, IT and Internet international sales force investments. 
Let me give you a little color on these investments. First, investing in R&D projects behind our future product portfolio. Second, investing in our international sales force, footprint, specifically in high-growth areas of our business to drive future growth. And third, we expect higher ongoing IT infrastructure costs as we implement 2 new important systems: our spec management system for R&D and our trade management system for sales. We are positioning ourselves well for the future. We continue to expect the 2 basis points of operating margin expansion. 
Next is income tax. We now expect 34.7% for the full year. So it's a little higher than our previous outlook of 34.5%. We continue to expect $630 million of free cash flow net of approximately $55 million of CapEx for full year 2016. This represents 125% free cash flow conversion. 
So now Matt and I will open it up for questions."

If you remember when we spoke downtown in February and we showed a chart that showed our innovations over the past 3 or 4 years.

So we're driving growth in the category, which is a big category, and we're taking share. And we generally have a big new idea every year, so we think we can continue that in the future. With respect to laundry, as I said earlier, well, ARM & HAMMER has been quite a powerhouse for us for a long time. The new product this year is -- one of them, is the BioEnzyme product, which has the EPA/Safer Choice label, which is becoming more meaningful to all shoppers. So we think that's a nice new variant for us that's going to help us continue to grow the franchise. Some of these other things that I mentioned, vitamins, what we did was we decided to shrinkwrap our products. So we got beautiful new packaging, which obviously speaks out or pops on shelf, and we think that, that is going to be a winner for us this year as well. Continuing down the line, in the TROJAN, TROJAN RIVIERA, so this is -- you may recall this is a lubricant that can be used in the shower. So that's another consumer insight that we think is going to help expand the share for TROJAN. And as you know, TROJAN's share continues to grow. We're up slightly year over year, a little over 76% share. And First Response, again, is the #1 brand in pregnancy test kits. And we're the first people to come out to try a Bluetooth-enabled pregnancy test kit. So that's our -- what we're trying to do there is test and learn in, what we call, the Internet of Things. So we have a very robust new product development process. We're very focused on consumer insights, and that does lead us to really cool ideas with respect to new products, and we've got a nice pipeline for 2017 and 2018.

And the speculation around that is that once upon a time, before the advent of adult gummies, the adults took kids gummies. And that with a lot of adult gummies now coming on shelf, adults are using the adult gummies and not the kids. So that's why I said earlier is that our focus is on adults. Kids is a very mature category. Even when we bought the business, if you looked at vitamins, 2/3 of all the vitamins that children took in the U.S. were gummies. So it was just already saturated and so there is some migration from kids to adults."

And then, secondly, the leakage on the fixed-cost absorption for the new vitamin plant, I appreciate that's -- it's here to stay for a while, but you're soon going to start to lap the startup expenses.

We went into the year with about 30% hedge, which is really our lowest level in quite a few years because we thought we should float most of the market. We do have a couple hedges on surfactants, but -- so maybe we're not getting the entire spot market benefit. But in general 300 basis points is not realistic for us at all. So we do have that as a tailwind, in general, from commodities. Fixed costs for vitamins, now remember we told you guys this was a 75% increase in capacity. So a $300 million business becomes $525 million. It's going to take some time to really grow into those fixed overheads.

I'll start with a brief review of our first quarter results, which you read about in this morning's press release. I'll then direct the rest of my comments towards our categories. 
I'm going to turn the call over to Rick Dierker when I'm done. Rick will comment on each business. That's Domestic, International and Specialty Products and also review the outlook for Q2 and for the full year. When Rick is finished, I'll get back on and we'll open the call up to questions. 
So here are the highlights. In short, Q1 was a terrific quarter for Church & Dwight. We delivered organic sales growth of 5.2% and 7.5% EPS growth, which is 10% EPS growth on a currency-neutral basis. Category growth was broad-based in that 11 of our 15 categories grew in the quarter. From a market share perspective, 6 of our 10 power brands grew share. So all-in, these results are top-tier in consumer products. Now I'd like to provide you with some color on a few of our categories. That would be laundry, litter, vitamins and dry shampoo. 
The laundry category is strong, growing 6.4% versus year-ago. This is the fourth quarter in a row of laundry category growth. The value segment grew 6.1%, and this is the sixth consecutive quarter of value segment growth. In fact, for the last 4 quarters, value has grown on average 4.5% per quarter. The laundry category growth was driven by growth in both the unit dose and liquid segments. The value liquid segment grew at an 8% clip, driven by ARM & HAMMER liquid, which grew consumption a whopping 11% year-over-year. 
With respect to unit dose, this form now represents 15% of the laundry category. Our unit dose consumption grew 15% in the quarter. More recently, we have launched new 2-chamber unit dose products under the OxiClean and ARM & HAMMER brands. We expect these new products to contribute to future consumption growth. Most of the resets for these launches happened in late March and early April. 
Now I'd like to take a few minutes to talk about our 3 laundry brands. ARM & HAMMER has been our big franchise in laundry for many years. And the ARM & HAMMER laundry share continued to grow this quarter, up 30 basis points. To illustrate the strength of the ARM & HAMMER brand, ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry has grown share year-over-year in 25 consecutive quarters. 
Our XTRA brand backed off promotional volume in Q1, which improved our year-over-year profitability but resulted in our giving up 40 basis points of share. On a full-year basis, we expect XTRA net sales and profits to be up year-over-year. 
Oxi laundry share was down 10 basis points year-over-year. As we, like others, felt the effect of Persil's promotional activity. In the most recent 4-week period, we are back to a 1 share. So promotional phasing does influence shares. If we look at how OxiClean is doing in the stain fighter additive category, OxiClean's share hit an all-time high of 48% share. 
Now I'm going to turn my comments to cat litter. The clumping litter segment continued to show strong growth at 5.3%. ARM & HAMMER litter was one of the winners in the quarter. We continue to grow faster than the segment. Our consumption grew 6.7% behind our latest innovation, MicroGuard CLUMP & SEAL litter. 
Just a quick commercial. MicroGuard seals and destroys odors, and prevents future bacterial odors from forming. It's an innovative product and we are broadcasting that message on our package that 98% of consumers, who have tried the product, would recommend it. 
Now let's talk about vitamins. The overall VMS category continues to show steady growth, up 3%. The gummy segment of VMS grew almost 15% in Q1. And so let me break down the 15% for you. The adult gummy segment grew 23% while the kids gummy segment declined 8%. Adult gummies is where we are putting our focus as it is underdeveloped and it will be the source of future growth for us. Our brand, Vitafusion, is the largest brand in the adult gummy category and was the biggest driver of the 23% adult segment category growth. The good news this quarter is that our gummy business is growing again. 
We have had wide retailer acceptance of our new adult beauty line, which hit shores -- which hit store shelves in March. So we are off to a good start this year for vitamins. The last category I want to address is dry shampoo. This category grew 26% in Q1 year-over-year. A, the category in the U.S. is nearly $100 million with the potential to be a $300 million category in the U.S. if we match the historical category growth experienced in the U.K. 
Batiste is the #1 brand in the U.S. with a 17.2% share. Batiste global net sales will cross $100 million this year, making it the #1 dry shampoo brand globally. So it's no surprise that the Batiste brand is expected to be one of our fastest growing brands in the future. 
Many new products are shipping right now. I've mentioned dual chamber pods, MicroGuard litter and the vitamin beauty line. In addition, we have the new GROOVE condom and RIVIERA lubricant by TROJAN; and the new Bluetooth-enabled pregnancy test kit from First Response. 
We feel good about our distribution, and we look forward to these products contributing to our organic growth in 2016. Our goal is to continue to focus on consumer insights, leading us to innovative new products to drive share and category growth. 
Next up is Rick to give you details on our first quarter results and the outlook for Q2 and the full year."
261105,329530354,974441,"Church & Dwight Co. Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. I'll start with EPS. First quarter reported EPS was $0.86 per share compared to $0.80 in 2015, up 7.5%. The $0.86 was better than our $0.83 outlook, largely due to organic revenue beat and gross margin expansi",1004,"Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. I'll start with EPS. First quarter reported EPS was $0.86 per share compared to $0.80 in 2015, up 7.5%. The $0.86 was better than our $0.83 outlook, largely due to organic revenue beat and gross margin expansion beat. Netted in that $0.86 is $0.02 or 2.5% drag from currency year-over-year. 
Reported revenues were up 4.5% to $849 million. Organic sales were 5.2%, exceeding our Q1 outlook of approximately 2% to 3%. The organic sales beat was driven by our consumer business, both domestic and international. 
Now let's review the segments. The Consumer Domestic business' organic sales increased by 4.5%, driven by the continued success of our ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent, Vitafusion gummy vitamin, Batiste dry shampoo and ARM & HAMMER CLUMP & SEAL cat litter. We now expect the full year organic sales to be approximately 3% for the Consumer Domestic business. 
International organic growth was up an impressive 13.3%. Now some of that was timing as orders are a little lumpy in the export business, but underlying growth was very strong at approximately 9%. Here again, we are raising our expectation for the full year. Organic growth from 4% to approximately 5% to 6% for the consumer international business. 
For our Specialty Products Division, organic sales was down 2%, driven by further declines in milk pricing and a difficult comp of 11% growth year-ago. Milk prices have come down 10% in the last 90 days as there is an oversupply globally. And as a result, U.S. exports, which historically have been 15% plus of U.S. production, are now around 10%. We have lowered our expectations for the full year for the SPD division from up 1% to 3% to down 2%. This is a headwind that we expect to overcome for the full year and we still like this business, but we do experience these cycles from time to time. 
Turning now to gross margin. Our reported first quarter gross margin was 44.6%, an 80 basis point increase from year-ago. Q1 gross margin benefited from 3 factors: lower commodities, productivity programs and the higher-margin from acquired businesses. These factors were partially offset by foreign exchange, negative product mix and higher fixed costs associated with our new vitamin capacity in our York facility. 
Moving to marketing. We increased marketing spend by 4.2% year-over-year. Marketing as a percent of revenue was consistent with 2015 at 10.9%. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 12.6%, a 90 basis point increase from the prior year. This was primarily due to incremental amortization from acquisitions and the timing of management stock compensation. 
Now to operating profit. The reported operating margin for the quarter was 21.1%, which was 10 basis points lower than the prior year. Other income and expense was $6.4 million, largely $7 million of expense related to interest expense. Next is income taxes. Our effective rate for the quarter is 34.7%. 
And turning to cash. We had a strong cash flow quarter. We generated $178 million of net cash for the first quarter, a $33 million increase from the same quarter year-ago. So in conclusion, the first quarter highlights include 5.2% organic, 7.5% EPS growth, which again equates to a 10% currency-neutral EPS growth. 
Turning to the second quarter outlook. We expect Q2 organic sales growth of approximately 2% to 3%, and I know a lot of you guys like to look at growth on a 2-year stack basis. Remember, for the total company, year ago, Q2 was 5% organic. So on a 2-year stack, Q1 and Q2 look pretty similar at approximately 8%. 
And if we just focus in on the Consumer Domestic business for a minute. The 2-year stack is going from 6.1% in Q1 to almost 8% in Q2. So a lot of positive momentum continuing on. 
We expect marketing as a percentage of revenue to be flat year-over-year and gross margin to expand in Q2. We expect second quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.79 compared to an adjusted $0.73 per share year-ago or an 8% increase year-over-year. 
And now turning to the full year. To summarize our thinking, we are raising our expectations for organic sales growth from 3% to 3% to 4%. In February, we called approximately 40 basis points of gross margin expansion, and we're pleased to say that now, we're calling 70 basis points of gross margin expansion -- 75. 
Back in February, this broke out as 70 basis points of help from commodities and productivity, offset by 30 basis points from currency headwinds. The 75 basis points we expect now is 100 basis points from commodities and productivity programs, offset by a 25 basis point drag from currency. We're more optimistic about the stability of commodity pricing across the entire commodity basket for the full year than we were a quarter ago. Our full-year marketing expectation continues to be 12.3% of sales, consistent with 2015 and prior years. 
Moving to SG&A. Our original expectations were a 10 basis point reduction. We now expect a 25 basis point increase largely behind R&D, IT and Internet international sales force investments. 
Let me give you a little color on these investments. First, investing in R&D projects behind our future product portfolio. Second, investing in our international sales force, footprint, specifically in high-growth areas of our business to drive future growth. And third, we expect higher ongoing IT infrastructure costs as we implement 2 new important systems: our spec management system for R&D and our trade management system for sales. We are positioning ourselves well for the future. We continue to expect 50 basis points of operating margin expansion. 
Next is income tax. We now expect 34.7% for the full year. So it's a little higher than our previous outlook of 34.5%. We continue to expect $630 million of free cash flow net of approximately $55 million of CapEx for full year 2016. This represents 125% free cash flow conversion. 
So now Matt and I will open it up for questions."

If you remember when we spoke downtown in February and we showed a chart that showed our innovations over the past 3 or 4 years. So we've clearly been the catalyst for that category, and we have a winner again this year with the MicroGuard product. So we're driving growth in the category, which is a big category, and we're taking share. And we generally have a big new idea every year, so we think we can continue that in the future. With respect to laundry, as I said earlier, well, ARM & HAMMER has been quite a powerhouse for us for a long time. The new product this year is -- one of them, is the BioEnzyme product, which has the EPA/Safer Choice label, which is becoming more meaningful to all shoppers. So we think that's a nice new variant for us that's going to help us continue to grow the franchise. Some of these other things that I mentioned, vitamins, what we did was we decided to shrinkwrap our products. So we got beautiful new packaging, which obviously speaks out or pops on shelf, and we think that, that is going to be a winner for us this year as well. Continuing down the line, in the TROJAN, TROJAN RIVIERA, so this is -- you may recall this is a lubricant that can be used in the shower. So that's another consumer insight that we think is going to help expand the share for TROJAN. And as you know, TROJAN's share continues to grow. We're up slightly year over year, a little over 76% share. And First Response, again, is the #1 brand in pregnancy test kits. And we're the first people to come out to try a Bluetooth-enabled pregnancy test kit. So that's our -- what we're trying to do there is test and learn in, what we call, the Internet of Things. So we have a very robust new product development process. We're very focused on consumer insights, and that does lead us to really cool ideas with respect to new products, and we've got a nice pipeline for 2017 and 2018. So that gives us confidence that we continue to grow the top line organically."

For our part, when I say change very quickly, I mean, it's not going to go to 5% or 10% in just a couple years, but it will change over time. So we've decided that we want to get really good at that. So it's one of our focuses right now. It did not -- was not a big contributor, I would say, to the first quarter results.

So a couple of questions, just to help us sort of understand this. First, commodities, is there something to consider in terms of your hedge positions for last year, this year, et cetera, that may cause your benefit or lack thereof to be greater or worse than what we'd see in sort of spot markets? And then, secondly, the leakage on the fixed-cost absorption for the new vitamin plant, I appreciate that's -- it's here to stay for a while, but you're soon going to start to lap the startup expenses.

So we had said previously, and it's still the case that, in general, resin was down 10%, surfactants were down 20%, paper was relatively flat. You guys know what oil and diesel are doing, and those are favorable year-over-year as well. I think in general, we do have some hedges out there. We went into the year with about 30% hedge, which is really our lowest level in quite a few years because we thought we should float most of the market. We do have a couple hedges on surfactants, but -- so maybe we're not getting the entire spot market benefit. But in general 300 basis points is not realistic for us at all. So we do have that as a tailwind, in general, from commodities. Fixed costs for vitamins, now remember we told you guys this was a 75% increase in capacity. So a $300 million business becomes $525 million. It's going to take some time to really grow into those fixed overheads. And you're right, we had startup costs last year, but those fixed overheads are more in totality than the startup costs were a year ago."

Thanks for joining us today. I'm going to start with a brief review of our second quarter results, which you read about in today's press release. I'll then say a few words about our categories before I turn the call over to Rick Di",1056,"Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'm going to start with a brief review of our second quarter results, which you read about in today's press release. I'll then say a few words about our categories before I turn the call over to Rick Dierker. Rick will comment on each of our businesses and review the outlook for Q3 and the full year. And when Rick is finished, I'll get back on and we'll open the call up for questions.
So here are the highlights. Q2 was a terrific quarter for our company. We posted organic sales growth of 3.7% and 16.4% EPS growth, which is 17.8% EPS growth on a currency-neutral basis. Category growth was broad-based and that 9 of our 15 categories grew in the quarter. From a market share perspective, 4 of our 10 power brands grew share. 
And now I'll comment on a few of our categories that will be laundry, litter, vitamins and dry shampoo. The laundry category continues to be healthy, growing 2.5% year-over-year. This is the fifth quarter in a row of laundry category growth. The value segment grew 4%, led by ARM & HAMMER, Simply Tide and Sun. The mid- and premium tier segments grew slower than the category. The laundry category growth was driven by both the unit dose and liquid segments.
Now I'll comment on our 3 laundry brands. ARM & HAMMER has been our big franchise in laundry for many years. ARM & HAMMER laundry share continue to grow this quarter, up 10 basis points. To illustrate the consistency of the brand, ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry has grown share year-over-year in 26 consecutive quarters. 
Our unit dose products are gaining traction. ARM & HAMMER unit dose in the quarter grew twice the unit dose category growth rate. Our growth was driven by our bi-layer and dual chamber innovations. Growth was equally driven by base and promoted volume, signaling a healthy balance. These are encouraging signs, and we are really pleased with the results. ARM & HAMMER unit dose grew 40 basis points to a 3 [ph] share in the quarter. 
Our Xtra brand lost share in the quarter as we continue to see deep competitive discounting. Similar to what we said in Q1, we expect Xtra net sales and profits to increase year-over-year for full year 2016. Oxi laundry share was down 10 basis points year-over-year as we, like others, felt the effect of Persil's promotional activity and increased distribution. As we have said before, we are committed to Oxi laundry detergent and are in this for the long haul.
As you know, Henkel has plans to acquire the Sun products company, which owns all Whisk and Snuggle brands and competes in private label. It's too early to know the impact on the category. There are 2 obvious goals of We may experience a disciplined competitor who competes with innovation or the laundry category could see even more discounting but we'll have to just wait and see. Regardless of what happens, we believe our brands are important to consumers. Consumer insights leading to the right products at the right price point will be our formula for success.
Moving on to stain fighters. OxiClean is the leading stain fighter in the additive category. This is the second consecutive quarter that OxiClean's share hit a 48% share, growing 2% versus last year. 
Now I'm going to turn my comments to cat litter. The clumping litter  is healthy with consumption growth of 4.5%. Q2 saw a significant increase in the amount sold on deal by competitors, notably Clorox and Tidy Cat. At the same time, our amounts sold on deal was significantly lower than the prior year, resulting in a pullback in share. In the end, innovation carries the day. We are very pleased with performance of our new premium priced CLUMP & SEAL MicroGuard. 
And while we're on the topic of innovation, I'd like to acknowledge that ARM & HAMMER CLUMP & SEAL litter received the prestigious 2016 Nielsen Innovation Award for Food and Household Products. CLUMP & SEAL was selected from a field of 3,500 new product launches over a 2-year period. Innovation is the key to long-term organic growth and we continue to focus on litter innovation.
Now let's talk about vitamins. The overall VMS category continues to show steady growth, up 3%. The gummy segment of VMS grew at 15% in Q2. Let me break that down for you. The adult gummy segment grew 21% while the kids gummy segment declined 4%. The vitamins is a good news story for us. Both Vitafusion and Li'l Critters grew in the quarter. Vitafusion adult gummy consumption grew 9% and Li'l Critters children's gummy also recorded positive growth of 40 basis points. 
Most notable, our combined points of distribution for our vitamin business grew 5% year-on-year, reflecting continued distribution gains. Our strong quarter was the result of new item reductions, expanded distribution of existing SKUs and the quality issues that we experienced last year are behind us. In adult and children's gummy vitamins category, Vitafusion and Li'l Critters are the #1 brands, with shares of 31% and 32%, respectively. 
Adult gummies is where we are putting our focus. It is underdeveloped and will be the source of future growth for us. Remember when we bought the business out of the entire adult VMS category, only 3% was in the gummy form. Today, it is 9%. 
The last category I want to address is dry shampoo. This category grew 28% in Q2 after growing 26% in Q1. The category in the U.S. is now nearly $100 million, with the potential to be a $300 million category if we mask the historical category growth experienced in the U.K. where the product originated. 
Batiste is the #1 brand in the U.S., with a 22.3 [ph] share. Batiste was the fastest-growing brand in the category and Batiste original dry shampoo is now the fastest turning SKU in the category. Batiste global net sales will cross $100 million this year for us, making it the #1 dry shampoo brand globally, and the Batiste brand is expected to be one of our fastest growing brands in the future. 
Next up is Rick to give you details of our second quarter results and the outlook for Q3 and the full year."

Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. I'll start with EPS. Second quarter reported EPS was $0.85 per share compared to an adjusted $0.73 in 2015, up 16.4%. The $0.85 was better than our $0.79 outlook, largely due to our organic revenue beat and gr",1301,"Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. I'll start with EPS. Second quarter reported EPS was $0.85 per share compared to an adjusted $0.73 in 2015, up 16.4%. The $0.85 was better than our $0.79 outlook, largely due to our organic revenue beat and gross margin expansion beat. Netted in that $0.85 is $0.01 or a 1.4% drag from currency year-over-year.
Reported revenues were up 3.6% to $877 million. Organic sales were 3.7%, exceeding our Q2 outlook of approximately 2% to 3%. Our organic sales beat was driven by our consumer business, both domestic and international. This may surprise some of you who track our consumption reports every few weeks. The Nielsen and IRI numbers are a barometer of consumption growth. The difference is on measured channels. 
I want to remind everyone about our strength in CLUB and a growing strength of our online business. For example, you read in the release that online sales for our vitamin business doubled. So third-party consumption reporting is directional but doesn't give the whole picture. 
Now let's review the segments. Consumer Domestic's organic sales increased by 4.4%, driven by VITAFUSION gummy vitamins, Batiste Dry Shampoo, OxiClean additives and partially offset by Kaboom cleaners. We continue to expect full year organic sales to be approximately 3% to the domestic business. 
International organic growth was up an impressive 7.4%, driven largely by higher sales in Australia, Mexico and Canada. We are raising our expectation for the full year for organic growth from approximately 5% to 6% to approximately 7% to 8% for the international business. 
For our Specialty Products Division, organic sales were down 7.7%. Milk prices are still relatively low as there is an oversupply globally. And as a result, U.S. exports, which historically have been around 15%-plus of U.S. production, are now around 10%. We are lowering our expectations for the full year for the SPD division to be down 4% to 5%. We like this business but we do experience cycles from time to time.
Turning now to gross margin. Our reported second quarter gross margin was 46.5%, a 250 basis point increase from a year ago, which was quite a bit better than we originally expected, largely due to continued improvements in vitamin manufacturing, greater distribution efficiencies and higher personal care sales. Since we spent quite a bit of time less quarter on gross margin, I'd like to break out the detail now for the quarter improvement versus a year ago. I will do the same thing for our full year gross margin outlook in a few minutes.
Q2 gross margin benefited from lower commodities worth 70 basis points. Productivity programs, lower manufacturing costs, which include the absence of vitamin startup costs, together is worth 130 basis points. Price volume mix is worth 60 basis points as we had higher personal care organic sales, up almost 8% versus a year ago. And in general, we had a low level of promotion across portfolio. Finally, we had 20 basis points from the higher-margin acquired businesses offset by a 30 basis points drag from currency. 
Moving to marketing. We increased marketing spend by 3.8% year-over-year. Marketing as a percent of revenue was consistent with 2015 at 13.7%. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 12.8%, an 80 basis point decrease from the prior year on a reported basis. Remember in 2015, we had a pension settlement charge of $8.9 million, so on an adjusted basis, SG&A was up 30 basis points, in line with our full year expectations.
Now to operating profit. The reported operating margin for the quarter was 20%, which is 320 basis points higher in the prior year on a reported basis and 220 basis points better on an adjusted basis, largely driven by the gross margin improvement. Other expense was $6.8 million for the quarter. 
Next, our income taxes. Our effective rate for the quarter is 34.7%. We are raising our effective tax rate forecast for the full year to 35%, largely due to geographic mix so there's a bigger drag from tax.
Turning to cash. We had a strong cash flow quarter, so on a year-to-date basis, we have generated $297 million of cash from operations, which is a $48 million increase from the same period a year ago. So in conclusion, the second quarter highlights include 3.7% organic, 16.4% EPS growth, which again equate to a 17.8% currency-neutral EPS growth.
Turning to the third quarter outlook. We expect Q3 organic sales growth of approximately 1% to 2%, behind stronger promotions and slower growth for our international and SPD divisions. We expect marketing as a percentage of revenue to increase both in dollars and as a percentage of sales as we begin to spend back our gross margin expansion.
We expect third quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.92 compared to $0.90 per share a year ago or a 2% increase year-over-year, which reflects the step-up in marketing, the higher promotional activities, slightly higher SG&A due to incentive comp and a higher tax rate. 
And now turning to the full year. We continue to expect organic sales growth to be 3% to 4%, which has been increased from 3% when we started the year. We posted 4.4% organic growth in the first half. And in the second half, as we plan to spend back a bit more in promotional activities, results in lower second half organic sales growth. We will likely end up in the middle of the range.
In May, we called approximately 75 basis points of gross margin expansion, and we are pleased to say that we are raising our outlook to 110 basis points of expansion. We can attribute this increase to continued improvements in vitamin manufacturing, greater distribution efficiencies, offset by incremental promotional activities.
I'd like to break out the detail now for the full year gross margin outlook versus a year ago. For the full year, gross margin benefits from lower commodities and that's worth 60 [ph] basis points. Productivity programs, lower manufacturing costs, including the absence of vitamin startup costs, is worth 50 basis points. Price volume mix is worth 10 basis points as we invest a bit more in higher promotions in the back half. And finally, we forecast 20 basis points from the higher-margin acquired businesses, offset by 30 basis point drag from currency. We are increasing our full year marketing expectation by 10 basis points to 12.4% as we spend back some of the gross margin beat. 
Moving to SG&A. Adjusting for the 2015 pension settlement charge, we are now forecasted to increase by 40 basis points. We had previously called 25 basis points for the increase. The higher SG&A rate is due to significantly higher medical costs and higher incentive comp. So now we expect 60 [ph] basis points of operating margin expansion for the full year. 
Next is income tax. As I mentioned before, we now expect 35% for the full year so it's about 30 basis points greater than our previous outlook. In terms of EPS, we dropped the low end of the range and are now targeting 8% to 9% of adjusted EPS growth despite the incremental spending on marketing and promotion as well as the higher tax rate.
We now expect $640 million of operating cash flow, which is $10 million better than our previous outlook of $630 million. We continue to expect $55 million [ph] of CapEx for the full year. This equates to $585 million of free cash flow, which represents 125%-plus of free cash flow conversion. 
Wrapping up, as you read in our earnings release today, we also announced the 2-for-1 stock split and [indiscernible]. The split will increase our total shares outstanding from approximately 128.8 million and 257.6 million shares. Now Matt and I will open it up for questions."

Whereas if you looked at Tide, tide or Sun or -- and especial points, we're way up in amounts sold on deal year-over-year. So every quarter is different you got to react to what's going on in the marketplace. And as I said, we're going to stay behind in OxiClean of the clean laundry in for the long haul there. And here and there is some other categories of their some competitive moves that we need to react to. So fortunately, we have financial flexibility in order to do that.

What I will do for you though is help you with attractors and there's 2 or 3 drivers on that disconnect. For example, there's probably around 200 basis points from club and online plus the fact that Batiste isn't really tracking Nielsen data in the reports you guys get. There's also a disconnect when you don't spend on promotion. So for example, XTRA, consumption is down 6%. Our net sales is essentially flat because we're not spending as deeper on promotions. Same thing with SPINBRUSH, which we talked about before as well. We're up 10% consumption, net sales are up 15%. So when you're trying to bridge consumption all the way back to organic, those are a couple of the reasons why, and I'll turn it back to Matt for online."

We're spending quite a bit of money back on marketing, right? And that's going to take some time to really pull through demand. On incremental trade and really couponing spending, those investments are really to drive trial from new products. That's the crux of it. And so we wanted to get that repeat rate up. It's too early to call volume upside from driving trial. So really, we're just really in the process, Jason.

Thanks for joining us today. I'm going to start with a brief review of our second quarter results, which you read about in today's press release. I'll then say a few words about our categories before I turn the call over to Rick Di",1054,"Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'm going to start with a brief review of our second quarter results, which you read about in today's press release. I'll then say a few words about our categories before I turn the call over to Rick Dierker. Rick will comment on each of our businesses and review the outlook for Q3 and the full year. And when Rick is finished, I'll get back on. And we'll open the call up for questions.
So here are the highlights. Q2 was a terrific quarter for our company. We posted organic sales growth of 3.7% and 16.4% EPS growth, which is 17.8% EPS growth on a currency-neutral basis. Category growth was broad-based and that 9 of our 15 categories grew in the quarter. From a market share perspective, 4 of our 10 power brands grew share. 
And now, I'll comment on a few of our categories. That will be laundry, litter, vitamins and dry shampoo. The laundry category continues to be healthy, growing 2.5% year-over-year. This is the fifth quarter in a row of laundry category growth. The value segment grew 4%, led by ARM & HAMMER, Simply Tide and Sun. The mid- and premium tier segments grew slower than the category. The laundry category growth was driven by both the unit dose and liquid segments.
Now I'll comment on our 3 laundry brands. ARM & HAMMER has been our big franchise in laundry for many years. ARM & HAMMER laundry share continue to grow this quarter, up 10 basis points. To illustrate the consistency of the brands, ARM & HAMMER's liquid laundry has grown share year-over-year in 26 consecutive quarters. 
Our unit dose products are gaining traction. ARM & HAMMER unit dose in the quarter grew twice the unit dose category growth rate. Our growth was driven by our bi-layer and dual chamber innovations. Growth was equally driven by base and promoted volume, signaling a healthy balance. These are encouraging signs, and we are really pleased with the results. ARM & HAMMER unit dose grew 40 basis points to a 3 share in the quarter. 
Our XTRA brand lost share in the quarter as we continue to see deep competitive discounting. Similar to what we said in Q1, we expect XTRA net sales and profits to increase year-over-year for full year 2016. Oxi laundry share was down 10 basis points year-over-year as we, like others, felt the effect of Persil's promotional activity and increased distribution. As we have said before, we are committed to Oxi laundry detergent and are in this for the long haul.
As you know, Henkel has plans to acquire the Sun products company, which owns all Whisk and Snuggle brands and competes in private label. It's too early to know the impact on the category. There are 2 obvious goals of thought: We may experience a disciplined competitor, who competes with innovation; or the laundry category could see even more discounting. We'll have to just wait and see. Regardless of what happens, we believe our brands are important to consumers. Consumer insights leading to the right products at the right price point will be our formula for success.
Moving on to stain fighters. OxiClean is the leading stain fighter in the additive category. This is the second consecutive quarter that OxiClean's share hit a 48% share, growing 2% versus last year. 
Now I'm going to turn my comments to cat litter. The clumping litter segment is healthy with consumption growth of 4.5%. Q2 saw a significant increase in the amount sold on deal by competitors, notably Clorox and Tidy Cats. At the same time, our amount sold on deal was significantly lower than the prior year, resulting in a pullback in share. In the end, innovation carries the day. We are very pleased with the performance of our new premium priced CLUMP & SEAL MicroGuard. 
And while we're on the topic of innovation, I'd like to acknowledge that ARM & HAMMER CLUMP & SEAL litter received the prestigious 2016 Nielsen Innovation Award for Food and Household Products. CLUMP & SEAL was selected from a field of 3,500 new product launches over a 2-year period. Innovation is the key to long-term organic growth, and we continue to focus on litter innovation.
Now let's talk about vitamins. The overall VMS category continues to show steady growth, up 3%. The Gummy segment of VMS grew at 15% in Q2. Let me break that down for you. The adult Gummy segment grew 21%, while the kids' Gummy segment declined 4%. So vitamins is a good news story for us. Both Vitafusion and Li'l Critters grew in the quarter. Vitafusion adult gummy consumption grew 9%, and Li'l Critters children's gummy also recorded positive growth of 40 basis points. 
Most notable, our combined points of distribution for our vitamin business grew 5% year-on-year, reflecting continued distribution gains. Our strong quarter was the result of new item introductions, expanded distribution of existing SKUs and the quality issues that we experienced last year are behind us. In adult and children's gummy vitamins category, Vitafusion and Li'l Critters are the #1 brands with shares of 31% and 32%, respectively. Adult gummies is where we are putting our focus. It is underdeveloped and will be the source of future growth for us. Remember when we bought the business out of the entire adult VMS category, only 3% was in the gummy form. Today, it is 9%. 
The last category I want to address is dry shampoo. This category grew 28% in Q2 after growing 26% in Q1. The category in the U.S. is now nearly $100 million with the potential to be a $300 million category if we mask the historical category growth experienced in the U.K. where the product originated. 
Batiste is the #1 brand in the U.S., with a 22.3 share. Batiste was the fastest-growing brand in the category, and Batiste original dry shampoo is now the fastest-turning SKU in the category. Batiste global net sales will cross $100 million this year for us, making it the #1 dry shampoo brand globally. And the Batiste brand is expected to be one of our fastest-growing brands in the future. 
Next up is Rick to give you details of our second quarter results and the outlook for Q3 and the full year."
261105,372150959,1025441,"Church & Dwight Co. Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. I'll start with EPS. Second quarter reported EPS was $0.85 per share compared to an adjusted $0.73 in 2015, up 16.4%. The $0.85 was better than our $0.79 outlook, largely due to our organic revenue beat and gr",1303,"Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. I'll start with EPS. Second quarter reported EPS was $0.85 per share compared to an adjusted $0.73 in 2015, up 16.4%. The $0.85 was better than our $0.79 outlook, largely due to our organic revenue beat and gross margin expansion; beat. Netted in that $0.85 is $0.01 or a 1.4% drag from currency year-over-year.
Reported revenues were up 3.6% to $877 million. Organic sales were 3.7%, exceeding our Q2 outlook of approximately 2% to 3%. Our organic sales beat was driven by our consumer business, both domestic and international. This may surprise some of you who track our consumption reports every 2 weeks. The Nielsen and IRI numbers are a barometer of consumption growth. The difference is on measured channels. 
I want to remind everyone about our strength in club and a growing strength of our online business. For example, you read in the release that online sales for our vitamin business doubled. So third-party consumption reporting is directional, but doesn't give the whole picture. 
Now let's review the segments. Consumer Domestic's organic sales increased by 4.4%, driven by Vitafusion gummy vitamins, Batiste Dry Shampoo, OxiClean additives and partially offset by Kaboom cleaners. We continue to expect full year organic sales to be approximately 3% to the domestic business. 
International organic growth was up an impressive 7.4%, driven largely by higher sales in Australia, Mexico and Canada. We are raising our expectation for the full year for organic growth from approximately 5% to 6% to approximately 7% to 8% for the international business. 
For our Specialty Products Division, organic sales were down 7.7%. Milk prices are still relatively low as there is an oversupply globally. And as a result, U.S. exports, which historically have been around 15%-plus of U.S. production, are now around 10%. We are lowering our expectations for the full year for the SPD division to be down 4% to 5%. We like this business, but we do experience these cycles from time to time.
Turning now to gross margin. Our reported second quarter gross margin was 46.5%, a 250 basis point increase from a year ago, which was quite a bit better than we originally expected, largely due to continued improvements in vitamin manufacturing, greater distribution efficiencies and higher personal care sales. Since we spent quite a bit of time last quarter on gross margin, I'd like to break out the detail now for the quarter improvement versus a year ago. I will do the same thing for our full year gross margin outlook in a few minutes.
Q2 gross margin benefited from lower commodities worth 70 basis points. Productivity programs, lower manufacturing costs, which include the absence of vitamin start-up costs, together is worth 130 basis points. Price/volume mix is worth 60 basis points as we had higher personal care organic sales, up almost 8% versus a year ago. And in general, we had a low level of promotion across the portfolio. Finally, we had 20 basis points from the higher margin-acquired businesses offset by a 30 basis point drag from currency. 
Moving to marketing. We increased marketing spend by 3.8% year-over-year. Marketing, as a percent of revenue, was consistent with 2015 at 13.7%. SG&A, as a percentage of net sales, was 12.8%, an 80 basis point decrease from the prior year on a reported basis. Remember in 2015, we had a pension settlement charge of $8.9 million. So on an adjusted basis, SG&A was up 30 basis points, in line with our full year expectations.
Now to operating profit. The reported operating margin for the quarter was 20%, which is 320 basis points higher in the prior year on a reported basis and 220 basis points better on an adjusted basis, largely driven by the gross margin improvement. Other expense was $6.8 million for the quarter. 
Next, our income taxes. Our effective rate for the quarter is 34.7%. We are raising our effective tax rate forecast for the full year to 35%, largely due to geographic mix. So there's a bigger drag from tax.
Turning to cash. We had a strong cash flow quarter. So on a year-to-date basis, we have generated $297 million of cash from operations, which is a $48 million increase from the same period a year ago. So in conclusion, the second quarter highlights include 3.7% organic, 16.4% EPS growth, which again equate to a 17.8% currency-neutral EPS growth.
Turning to the third quarter outlook. We expect Q3 organic sales growth of approximately 1% to 2%, behind stronger promotions and slower growth for our international and SPD divisions. We expect marketing as a percentage of revenue to increase both in dollars and as a percentage of sales as we begin to spend back our gross margin expansion.
We expect third quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.92 compared to $0.90 per share a year ago or a 2% increase year-over-year, which reflects the step-up in marketing, the higher promotional activities, slightly higher SG&A due to incentive comp and a higher tax rate. 
And now turning to the full year. We continue to expect organic sales growth to be 3% to 4%, which has been increased from 3% when we started the year. We posted 4.4% organic growth in the first half. And in the second half, as we plan to spend back a bit more on promotional activities, it results in lower second half organic sales growth. We will likely end up in the middle of the range.
In May, we called approximately 75 basis points of gross margin expansion. And we are pleased to say that we are raising our outlook to 110 basis points of expansion. We can attribute this increase to continued improvements in vitamin manufacturing, greater distribution efficiencies, offset by incremental promotional activities.
I'd like to break out the detail now for the full year gross margin outlook versus a year ago. For the full year, gross margin benefits from lower commodities. And that's worth 60 basis points. Productivity programs, lower manufacturing costs, including the absence of vitamin start-up costs is worth 50 basis points. Price/volume mix is worth 10 basis points as we invest a bit more in higher promotions in the back half. And finally, we forecast 20 basis points from the higher margin acquired businesses, offset by 30 basis point drag from currency. We are increasing our full year marketing expectation by 10 basis points to 12.4% as we spend back some of the gross margin beat. 
Moving to SG&A. Adjusting for the 2015 pension settlement charge, we are now forecasted to increase by 40 basis points. We had previously called 25 basis points for the increase. The higher SG&A rate is due to significantly higher medical costs and higher incentive comp. So now we expect 60 basis points of operating margin expansion for the full year. 
Next is income tax. As I mentioned before, we now expect 35% for the full year, so it's about 30 basis points greater than our previous outlook. In terms of EPS, we dropped the low end of the range and are now targeting 8% to 9% of adjusted EPS growth despite the incremental spending on marketing and promotion as well as the higher tax rate.
We now expect $640 million of operating cash flow, which is $10 million better than our previous outlook of $630 million. We continue to expect $55 million of CapEx for the full year. This equates to $585 million of free cash flow, which represents 125% plus of free cash flow conversion. 
Wrapping up, as you read in our earnings release today, we also announced the 2-for-1 stock split of our common stock. The split will increase our total shares outstanding from approximately 128.8 million and 257.6 million shares.
Now, Matt and I will open it up for questions."

In my remarks, I said, ""Hey, there's a lot of discounting going on in laundry and litter.""  And in litter, for example, we actually pulled back on trade promotions year-over-year in Q2. While at the same time, if you looked at Tidy Cat or Fresh Step, they were up significantly in Q2. And even in laundry, the amount sold on deal for ARM & HAMMER was actually lower year-over-year in Q2. Whereas if you looked at Tide, Simply Tide or Sun or -- and especially, Purex, they're way up in amounts sold on deal year-over-year. So every quarter is different. You got to react to what's going on in the marketplace. And as I said, we want to stay behind OxiClean. OxiClean laundry, we're in for the long haul there. And here and there in some other categories, there's some competitive moves that we need to react to. So fortunately, we have financial flexibility in order to do that. And as you know, we got a big portfolio of brands, so we're in a position where we need some help -- we're going to put the help there."

That implies very strong double-digit growth in nontracked, just using sort of back-of-the-napkin sort of map based on reasonable assumptions for channel mix. So can you guys help me a bit? What is online now as a percent of sales and understanding that the club is not the Nielsen data as well? But curious what that number is if you care to share it. What do your market shares look like online versus nontracked? Proctor talks about having higher market share in the online channel relative to more traditional mass channels. And then Matt, maybe touch on a little bit, if this continues to evolve and the consumer continues to move online, talk about the implications a bit for your business from even broadly margin perspective. It's seemingly less trade spend at this point, et cetera."

What I will do for you though is help you with the tracked versus nontracked. And there's 2 or 3 drivers on that disconnect. For example, there's probably around 200 basis points from club and online, plus the fact that Batiste isn't really tracking Nielsen data in the reports you guys get. There's also a disconnect when you don't spend on promotion. So for example, XTRA, consumption's down 6%. Our net sales is essentially flat because we're not spending as deeper on promotions. Same thing with SPINBRUSH, which we talked about before as well. We're up 10% consumption, net sales are up 15%. So when you're trying to bridge consumption all the way back to organic, those are a couple of the reasons why. And I'll turn it back to Matt for online."

So we need to -- we're looking at this as just another class of trade. We have a convergence going on between research and advertising. So a lot of the research now, a lot of consumer behavior research is digital. It's online. Same time, a lot of the advertising is online. So we're -- we understand that we're weaving both our advertising and our research efforts together as a result. It's the early innings for everybody. And everybody's going to look at, do we have the right pack sizes for online? You're going to have different packs online than you have in the store just to take the weight up.

Condoms, that kind of ebbs and flows, so we generally don't worry too much about the condom share because we have approximately 75 share in that category. First Response though, there's been a lot of couponing and competition that we have to address. So some of that, by the way, for the earlier questions is pregnancy kits is also an area that we're putting some money behind in the second half because we lost some share as a result of competition in the second quarter.

If you're thinking about all the commodities that we sweat -- I'm just going to run down on this. So surfactants, which is derived from ethylene and then your -- and then you have resin, right? Diesel, which is going to affect our transportation cost but that affects everything. Latex for condoms but that's actually a small part of the cost of goods sold.

So can you just comment there if there's something that I'm missing on that are specifically concerned about lapping."

Thanks for joining us today. I'm going to start with a brief review of our second quarter results, which you read about in today's press release. I'll then say a few words about our categories before I turn the call over to Rick Di",1054,"Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'm going to start with a brief review of our second quarter results, which you read about in today's press release. I'll then say a few words about our categories before I turn the call over to Rick Dierker. Rick will comment on each of our businesses and review the outlook for Q3 and the full year. And when Rick is finished, I'll get back on. And we'll open the call up for questions.
So here are the highlights. Q2 was a terrific quarter for our company. We posted organic sales growth of 3.7% and 16.4% EPS growth, which is 17.8% EPS growth on a currency-neutral basis. Category growth was broad-based in that 9 of our 15 categories grew in the quarter. From a market share perspective, 4 of our 10 power brands grew share. 
And now, I'll comment on a few of our categories. That will be laundry, litter, vitamins and dry shampoo. The laundry category continues to be healthy, growing 2.5% year-over-year. This is the fifth quarter in a row of laundry category growth. The value segment grew 4%, led by ARM & HAMMER, Simply Tide and Sun. The mid- and premium tier segments grew slower than the category. The laundry category growth was driven by both the unit dose and liquid segments.
Now I'll comment on our 3 laundry brands. ARM & HAMMER has been our big franchise in laundry for many years. ARM & HAMMER laundry share continued to grow this quarter, up 10 basis points. To illustrate the consistency of the brand, ARM & HAMMER's liquid laundry has grown share year-over-year in 26 consecutive quarters. 
Our unit dose products are gaining traction. ARM & HAMMER unit dose in the quarter grew twice the unit dose category growth rate. Our growth was driven by our bi-layer and dual chamber innovations. Growth was equally driven by base and promoted volume, signaling a healthy balance. These are encouraging signs, and we are really pleased with the results. ARM & HAMMER unit dose grew 40 basis points to a 3 share in the quarter. 
Our XTRA brand lost share in the quarter as we continued to see deep competitive discounting. Similar to what we said in Q1, we expect XTRA net sales and profits to increase year-over-year for full year 2016. Oxi laundry share was down 10 basis points year-over-year as we, like others, felt the effect of Persil's promotional activity and increased distribution. As we have said before, we are committed to Oxi laundry detergent and are in this for the long haul.
As you know, Henkel has plans to acquire the Sun products company, which owns all Wisk and Snuggle brands and competes in private label. It's too early to know the impact on the category. There are 2 obvious schools of thought: We may experience a disciplined competitor, who competes with innovation; or the laundry category could see even more discounting. But we'll have to just wait and see. Regardless of what happens, we believe our brands are important to consumers. Consumer insights leading to the right products at the right price point will be our formula for success.
Moving on to stain fighters. OxiClean is the leading stain fighter in the additive category. This is the second consecutive quarter that OxiClean's share hit a 48% share, growing 2% versus last year. 
Now I'm going to turn my comments to cat litter. The clumping litter segment is healthy with consumption growth of 4.5%. Q2 saw a significant increase in the amount sold on deal by competitors, notably Clorox and Tidy Cats. At the same time, our amount sold on deal was significantly lower than the prior year, resulting in a pullback in share. In the end, innovation carries the day. We are very pleased with the performance of our new premium-priced CLUMP & SEAL MicroGuard. And while we're on the topic of innovation, I'd like to acknowledge that ARM & HAMMER CLUMP & SEAL litter received the prestigious 2016 Nielsen Innovation Award for Food and Household Products. CLUMP & SEAL was selected from a field of 3,500 new product launches over a 2-year period. Innovation is the key to long-term organic growth, and we continue to focus on litter innovation.
Now let's talk about vitamins. The overall VMS category continues to show steady growth, up 3%. The Gummy segment of VMS grew at 15% in Q2. Let me break that down for you. The adult Gummy segment grew 21%, while the kids' Gummy segment declined 4%. So vitamins is a good news story for us. Both Vitafusion and Li'l Critters grew in the quarter. Vitafusion adult gummy consumption grew 9%, and Li'l Critters children's gummy also recorded positive growth of 40 basis points. 
Most notable, our combined points of distribution for our vitamin business grew 5% year-on-year, reflecting continued distribution gains. Our strong quarter was the result of new item introductions, expanded distribution of existing SKUs and the quality issues that we experienced last year are behind us. In adult and children's gummy vitamins category, Vitafusion and Li'l Critters are the #1 brands with shares of 31% and 32%, respectively. Adult gummies is where we are putting our focus. It is underdeveloped and will be the source of future growth for us. Remember when we bought the business, out of the entire adult VMS category, only 3% was in the gummy form. Today, it is 9%. 
The last category I want to address is dry shampoo. This category grew 28% in Q2 after growing 26% in Q1. The category in the U.S. is now nearly $100 million with the potential to be a $300 million category if we match the historical category growth experienced in the U.K. where the product originated. 
Batiste is the #1 brand in the U.S., with a 22.3 share. Batiste was the fastest-growing brand in the category, and Batiste original dry shampoo is now the fastest-turning SKU in the category. Batiste global net sales will cross $100 million this year for us, making it the #1 dry shampoo brand globally. And the Batiste brand is expected to be one of our fastest-growing brands in the future. 
Next up is Rick to give you details of our second quarter results and the outlook for Q3 and the full year."

Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. I'll start with EPS. Second quarter reported EPS was $0.85 per share compared to an adjusted $0.73 in 2015, up 16.4%. The $0.85 was better than our $0.79 outlook, largely due to our organic revenue beat and gr",1300,"Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. I'll start with EPS. Second quarter reported EPS was $0.85 per share compared to an adjusted $0.73 in 2015, up 16.4%. The $0.85 was better than our $0.79 outlook, largely due to our organic revenue beat and gross margin expansion beat. Netted in that $0.85 is $0.01 or a 1.4% drag from currency year-over-year.
Reported revenues were up 3.6% to $877 million. Organic sales were 3.7%, exceeding our Q2 outlook of approximately 2% to 3%. Our organic sales beat was driven by our consumer business, both domestic and international. This may surprise some of you who track our consumption reports every 2 weeks. The Nielsen and IRI numbers are a barometer of consumption growth. The difference is unmeasured channels. 
I want to remind everyone about our strength in club and the growing strength of our online business. For example, you read in the release that online sales for our vitamin business doubled. So third-party consumption reporting is directional, but doesn't give the whole picture. 
Now let's review the segments. Consumer Domestic's organic sales increased by 4.4%, driven by Vitafusion gummy vitamins, Batiste Dry Shampoo, OxiClean additives and partially offset by Kaboom cleaners. We continue to expect full year organic sales to be approximately 3% for domestic business. 
International organic growth was up an impressive 7.4%, driven largely by higher sales in Australia, Mexico and Canada. We are raising our expectation for the full year organic growth from approximately 5% to 6% to approximately 7% to 8% for the international business. 
For our Specialty Products Division, organic sales were down 7.7%. Milk prices are still relatively low as there is an oversupply globally. And as a result, U.S. exports, which historically have been around 15%-plus of U.S. production, are now around 10%. We are lowering our expectations for the full year for the SPD division to be down 4% to 5%. We like this business, but we do experience these cycles from time to time.
Turning now to gross margin. Our reported second quarter gross margin was 46.5%, a 250 basis point increase from a year ago, which was quite a bit better than we originally expected, largely due to continued improvements in vitamin manufacturing, greater distribution efficiencies and higher personal care sales. Since we spent quite a bit of time last quarter on gross margin, I'd like to break out the detail now for the quarter improvement versus a year ago. I will do the same thing for our full year gross margin outlook in a few minutes.
Q2 gross margin benefited from lower commodities worth 70 basis points. Productivity programs, lower manufacturing costs, which include the absence of vitamin start-up costs, together is worth 130 basis points. Price/volume mix is worth 60 basis points as we had higher personal care organic sales, up almost 8% versus a year ago. And in general, we had a low level of promotion across the portfolio. Finally, we had 20 basis points from the higher margin-acquired businesses offset by a 30 basis point drag from currency. 
Moving to marketing. We increased marketing spend by 3.8% year-over-year. Marketing, as a percent of revenue, was consistent with 2015 at 13.7%. SG&A, as a percentage of net sales, was 12.8%, an 80 basis point decrease from the prior year on a reported basis. Remember, in 2015, we had a pension settlement charge of $8.9 million. So on an adjusted basis, SG&A was up 30 basis points, in line with our full year expectations.
Now to operating profit. The reported operating margin for the quarter was 20%, which is 320 basis points higher in the prior year on a reported basis and 220 basis points better on an adjusted basis, largely driven by the gross margin improvement. Other expense was $6.8 million for the quarter. 
Next, our income taxes. Our effective rate for the quarter was 34.7%. We are raising our effective tax rate forecast for the full year to 35%, largely due to geographic mix. So there's a bigger drag from tax.
Turning to cash. We had a strong cash flow quarter. So on a year-to-date basis, we have generated $297 million of cash from operations, which is a $48 million increase from the same period a year ago. So in conclusion, the second quarter highlights include 3.7% organic, 16.4% EPS growth, which again equate to a 17.8% currency-neutral EPS growth.
Turning to the third quarter outlook. We expect Q3 organic sales growth of approximately 1% to 2%, behind stronger promotions and slower growth for our international and SPD divisions. We expect marketing as a percentage of revenue to increase both in dollars and as a percentage of sales as we begin to spend back our gross margin expansion.
We expect third quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.92 compared to $0.90 per share a year ago or a 2% increase year-over-year, which reflects the step-up in marketing, the higher promotional activities, slightly higher SG&A due to incentive comp and a higher tax rate. 
And now turning to the full year. We continue to expect organic sales growth to be 3% to 4%, which has been increased from 3% when we started the year. We posted 4.4% organic growth in the first half. And in the second half, as we plan to spend back a bit more on promotional activities, it results in lower second half organic sales growth. We will likely end up in the middle of the range.
In May, we called approximately 75 basis points of gross margin expansion. And we are pleased to say that we are raising our outlook to 110 basis points of expansion. We can attribute this increase to continued improvements in vitamin manufacturing, greater distribution efficiencies, offset by incremental promotional activities.
I'd like to break out the detail now for the full year gross margin outlook versus a year ago. For the full year, gross margin benefits from lower commodities. And that's worth 60 basis points. Productivity programs, lower manufacturing costs, including the absence of vitamin start-up costs, is worth 50 basis points. Price/volume mix is worth 10 basis points as we invest a bit more in higher promotions in the back half. And finally, we forecast 20 basis points from the higher margin-acquired businesses, offset by a 30 basis point drag from currency. We are increasing our full year market expectation by 10 basis points to 12.4% as we spend back some of the gross margin beat. 
Moving to SG&A. Adjusting for the 2015 pension settlement charge, we are now forecasted to increase by 40 basis points. We had previously called 25 basis points for the increase. The higher SG&A rate is due to significantly higher medical costs and higher incentive comp. So now we expect 60 basis points of operating margin expansion for the full year. 
Next is income tax. As I mentioned before, we now expect 35% for the full year, so it's about 30 basis points greater than our previous outlook. In terms of EPS, we dropped the low end of the range and are now targeting 8% to 9% of adjusted EPS growth despite the incremental spending on marketing and promotion as well as the higher tax rate.
We now expect $640 million of operating cash flow, which is $10 million better than our previous outlook of $630 million. We continue to expect $55 million of CapEx for the full year. This equates to $585 million of free cash flow, which represents 125% plus of free cash flow conversion. 
Wrapping up, as you read in our earnings release today, we also announced the 2-for-1 stock split of our common stock. The split will increase our total shares outstanding from approximately 128.8 million to 257.6 million shares.
Now, Matt and I will open it up for questions."

In my remarks, I said, ""Hey, there's a lot of discounting going on in laundry and litter.""  And in litter, for example, we actually pulled back on trade promotions year-over-year in Q2. While at the same time, if you looked at Tidy Cat or Fresh Step, they were up significantly in Q2. And even in laundry, the amount sold on deal for ARM & HAMMER was actually lower year-over-year in Q2. Whereas if you looked at Tide, Simply Tide or Sun or -- and especially, Purex, they were way up in amounts sold on deal year-over-year. So every quarter is different. You got to react to what's going on in the marketplace. And as I said, we want to stay behind OxiClean. OxiClean laundry, we're in for the long haul there. And here and there in some other categories, there's some competitive moves that we need to react to. So fortunately, we have financial flexibility in order to do that. And as you know, we got a big portfolio of brands, so we're in a position where we need some help -- we're going to put the help there."

That implies very strong double-digit growth in nontrack, just using sort of back-of-the-napkin sort of map based on reasonable assumptions for channel mix. So can you guys help me a bit? What is online now as a percent of sales and understanding that the club is not in the Nielsen data as well? But curious what that number is if you care to share it. What do your market shares look like online versus nontracked? Proctor talks about having higher market share in the online channel relative to more traditional mass channels. And then, Matt, maybe touch on a little bit, as this continues to evolve and the consumer continues to move online, talk about the implications a bit for your business. From an even broadly margin perspective, it's seemingly less trade spend at this point, et cetera."

What I will do for you though is help you with the tracked versus nontracked. And there's 2 or 3 drivers on that disconnect. For example, there's probably around 200 basis points from club and online, plus the fact that Batiste isn't really tracked in the Nielsen data in the reports you guys get. There's also a disconnect when you don't spend on promotion. So for example, XTRA, consumption's down 6%. Our net sales is essentially flat because we're not spending as deeper on promotions. Same thing with SPINBRUSH, which we talked about before as well. We're up 10% consumption, net sales are up 15%. So when you're trying to bridge consumption all the way back to organic, those are a couple of the reasons why. And I'll turn it back to Matt for online."

So we need to -- we're looking at this as just another class of trade. We have a convergence going on between research and advertising. So a lot of the research now, a lot of consumer behavior research is digital, it's online. Same time, a lot of the advertising is online. So we're -- we understand that, so we're weaving both our advertising and our research efforts together as a result. It's the early innings for everybody. And everybody's going to look at, do we have the right pack sizes for online? You're going to have different packs online than you have in the store just to take the weight out. We always look at change as our friend because we're a small company. So we think that we can react to change a lot faster than other companies.

And then international growth, the first half was a 10% and the full year is at 7% to 8%, so that implies a second half of 4% to 5%. So all those reasons are why we're decelerating a little bit.

So we'll obviously have to react to that. But laundry is our biggest category, and that's one we'll also to react. XTRA continues to lose share. We're managing that for profit, but there is a line that we won't cross, right, so we have to make sure we shore that up in the second half."

First Response though, there's been a lot of couponing and competition that we have to address.

So we've said previously in Q1 and Q2, for example, that resin was down 10%, surfactants were down 20%, and that was true. The second half, we're starting to lap those comparisons. So resin will likely be closer to flat, and surfactants will probably be closer to up slightly -- just for context."

Thanks for joining us today. I'm going to start with a brief review of our second quarter results, which you read about in today's press release. I'll then say a few words about our categories before I turn the call over to Rick Di",1054,"Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'm going to start with a brief review of our second quarter results, which you read about in today's press release. I'll then say a few words about our categories before I turn the call over to Rick Dierker. Rick will comment on each of our businesses and review the outlook for Q3 and the full year. And when Rick is finished, I'll get back on. And we'll open the call up for questions.
So here are the highlights. Q2 was a terrific quarter for our company. We posted organic sales growth of 3.7% and 16.4% EPS growth, which is 17.8% EPS growth on a currency-neutral basis. Category growth was broad-based in that 9 of our 15 categories grew in the quarter. From a market share perspective, 4 of our 10 power brands grew share. 
And now I'll comment on a few of our categories. That will be laundry, litter, vitamins and dry shampoo. The laundry category continues to be healthy, growing 2.5% year-over-year. This is the fifth quarter in a row of laundry category growth. The value segment grew 4%, led by ARM & HAMMER, Simply Tide and Sun. The mid- and premium tier segments grew slower than the category. The laundry category growth was driven by both the unit dose and liquid segments.
Now I'll comment on our 3 laundry brands. ARM & HAMMER has been our big franchise in laundry for many years. ARM & HAMMER laundry share continued to grow this quarter, up 10 basis points. To illustrate the consistency of the brand, ARM & HAMMER's liquid laundry has grown share year-over-year in 26 consecutive quarters. 
Our unit dose products are gaining traction. ARM & HAMMER unit dose in the quarter grew twice the unit dose category growth rate. Our growth was driven by our bi-layer and dual chamber innovations. Growth was equally driven by base and promoted volume, signaling a healthy balance. These are encouraging signs, and we are really pleased with the results. ARM & HAMMER unit dose grew 40 basis points to a 3 share in the quarter. 
Our XTRA brand lost share in the quarter as we continued to see deep competitive discounting. Similar to what we said in Q1, we expect XTRA net sales and profits to increase year-over-year for full year 2016. Oxi laundry share was down 10 basis points year-over-year as we, like others, felt the effect of Persil's promotional activity and increased distribution. As we have said before, we are committed to Oxi laundry detergent and are in this for the long haul.
As you know, Henkel has plans to acquire the Sun products company, which owns all Wisk and Snuggle brands and competes in private label. It's too early to know the impact on the category. There are 2 obvious schools of thought: We may experience a disciplined competitor, who competes with innovation; or the laundry category could see even more discounting. But we'll have to just wait and see. Regardless of what happens, we believe our brands are important to consumers. Consumer insights leading to the right products at the right price point will be our formula for success.
Moving on to stain fighters. OxiClean is the leading stain fighter in the additive category. This is the second consecutive quarter that OxiClean's share hit a 48% share, growing 2% versus last year. 
Now I'm going to turn my comments to cat litter. The clumping litter segment is healthy with consumption growth of 4.5%. Q2 saw a significant increase in the amount sold on deal by competitors, notably Clorox and Tidy Cats. At the same time, our amount sold on deal was significantly lower than the prior year, resulting in a pullback in share. In the end, innovation carries the day. We are very pleased with the performance of our new premium-priced CLUMP & SEAL MicroGuard. And while we're on the topic of innovation, I'd like to acknowledge that ARM & HAMMER CLUMP & SEAL litter received the prestigious 2016 Nielsen Innovation Award for Food and Household Products. CLUMP & SEAL was selected from a field of 3,500 new product launches over a 2-year period. Innovation is the key to long-term organic growth, and we continue to focus on litter innovation.
Now let's talk about vitamins. The overall VMS category continues to show steady growth, up 3%. The Gummy segment of VMS grew at 15% in Q2. Let me break that down for you. The adult Gummy segment grew 21%, while the kids' Gummy segment declined 4%. So vitamins is a good news story for us. Both Vitafusion and Li'l Critters grew in the quarter. Vitafusion adult gummy consumption grew 9%, and Li'l Critters children's gummy also recorded positive growth of 40 basis points. 
Most notable, our combined points of distribution for our vitamin business grew 5% year-on-year, reflecting continued distribution gains. Our strong quarter was the result of new item introductions, expanded distribution of existing SKUs and the quality issues that we experienced last year are behind us. In adult and children's gummy vitamins category, Vitafusion and Li'l Critters are the #1 brands with shares of 31% and 32%, respectively. Adult gummies is where we are putting our focus. It is underdeveloped and will be the source of future growth for us. Remember when we bought the business, out of the entire adult VMS category, only 3% was in the gummy form. Today, it is 9%. 
The last category I want to address is dry shampoo. This category grew 28% in Q2 after growing 26% in Q1. The category in the U.S. is now nearly $100 million with the potential to be a $300 million category if we match the historical category growth experienced in the U.K. where the product originated. 
Batiste is the #1 brand in the U.S., with a 22.3 share. Batiste was the fastest-growing brand in the category, and Batiste original dry shampoo is now the fastest-turning SKU in the category. Batiste global net sales will cross $100 million this year for us, making it the #1 dry shampoo brand globally. And the Batiste brand is expected to be one of our fastest-growing brands in the future. 
Next up is Rick to give you details of our second quarter results and the outlook for Q3 and the full year."
261105,372150959,1026367,"Church & Dwight Co. Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. I'll start with EPS. Second quarter reported EPS was $0.85 per share compared to an adjusted $0.73 in 2015, up 16.4%. The $0.85 was better than our $0.79 outlook, largely due to our organic revenue beat and gr",1300,"Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. I'll start with EPS. Second quarter reported EPS was $0.85 per share compared to an adjusted $0.73 in 2015, up 16.4%. The $0.85 was better than our $0.79 outlook, largely due to our organic revenue beat and gross margin expansion beat. Netted in that $0.85 is $0.01 or a 1.4% drag from currency year-over-year.
Reported revenues were up 3.6% to $877 million. Organic sales were 3.7%, exceeding our Q2 outlook of approximately 2% to 3%. Our organic sales beat was driven by our consumer business, both domestic and international. This may surprise some of you who track our consumption reports every 2 weeks. The Nielsen and IRI numbers are a barometer of consumption growth. The difference is unmeasured channels. 
I want to remind everyone about our strength in club and the growing strength of our online business. For example, you read in the release that online sales for our vitamin business doubled. So third-party consumption reporting is directional, but doesn't give the whole picture. 
Now let's review the segments. Consumer Domestic's organic sales increased by 4.4%, driven by Vitafusion gummy vitamins, Batiste Dry Shampoo, OxiClean additives and partially offset by Kaboom cleaners. We continue to expect full year organic sales to be approximately 3% for domestic business. 
International organic growth was up an impressive 7.4%, driven largely by higher sales in Australia, Mexico and Canada. We are raising our expectation for the full year organic growth from approximately 5% to 6% to approximately 7% to 8% for the international business. 
For our Specialty Products Division, organic sales were down 7.7%. Milk prices are still relatively low as there is an oversupply globally. And as a result, U.S. exports, which historically have been around 15%-plus of U.S. production, are now around 10%. We are lowering our expectations for the full year for the SPD division to be down 4% to 5%. We like this business, but we do experience these cycles from time to time.
Turning now to gross margin. Our reported second quarter gross margin was 46.5%, a 250 basis point increase from a year ago, which was quite a bit better than we originally expected, largely due to continued improvements in vitamin manufacturing, greater distribution efficiencies and higher personal care sales. Since we spent quite a bit of time last quarter on gross margin, I'd like to break out the detail now for the quarter improvement versus a year ago. I will do the same thing for our full year gross margin outlook in a few minutes.
Q2 gross margin benefited from lower commodities worth 70 basis points. Productivity programs, lower manufacturing costs, which include the absence of vitamin start-up costs, together is worth 130 basis points. Price/volume mix is worth 60 basis points as we had higher personal care organic sales, up almost 8% versus a year ago. And in general, we had a low level of promotion across the portfolio. Finally, we had 20 basis points from the higher margin-acquired businesses offset by a 30 basis point drag from currency. 
Moving to marketing. We increased marketing spend by 3.8% year-over-year. Marketing, as a percent of revenue, was consistent with 2015 at 13.7%. SG&A, as a percentage of net sales, was 12.8%, an 80 basis point decrease from the prior year on a reported basis. Remember, in 2015, we had a pension settlement charge of $8.9 million. So on an adjusted basis, SG&A was up 30 basis points, in line with our full year expectations.
Now to operating profit. The reported operating margin for the quarter was 20%, which is 320 basis points higher in the prior year on a reported basis and 220 basis points better on an adjusted basis, largely driven by the gross margin improvement. Other expense was $6.8 million for the quarter. 
Next, our income taxes. Our effective rate for the quarter was 34.7%. We are raising our effective tax rate forecast for the full year to 35%, largely due to geographic mix. So there's a bigger drag from tax.
Turning to cash. We had a strong cash flow quarter. So on a year-to-date basis, we have generated $297 million of cash from operations, which is a $48 million increase from the same period a year ago. So in conclusion, the second quarter highlights include 3.7% organic, 16.4% EPS growth, which again equate to a 17.8% currency-neutral EPS growth.
Turning to the third quarter outlook. We expect Q3 organic sales growth of approximately 1% to 2%, behind stronger promotions and slower growth for our international and SPD divisions. We expect marketing as a percentage of revenue to increase both in dollars and as a percentage of sales as we begin to spend back our gross margin expansion.
We expect third quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.92 compared to $0.90 per share a year ago or a 2% increase year-over-year, which reflects the step-up in marketing, the higher promotional activities, slightly higher SG&A due to incentive comp and a higher tax rate. 
And now turning to the full year. We continue to expect organic sales growth to be 3% to 4%, which has been increased from 3% when we started the year. We posted 4.4% organic growth in the first half. And in the second half, as we plan to spend back a bit more on promotional activities, it results in lower second half organic sales growth. We will likely end up in the middle of the range.
In May, we called approximately 75 basis points of gross margin expansion. And we are pleased to say that we are raising our outlook to 110 basis points of expansion. We can attribute this increase to continued improvements in vitamin manufacturing, greater distribution efficiencies, offset by incremental promotional activities.
I'd like to break out the detail now for the full year gross margin outlook versus a year ago. For the full year, gross margin benefits from lower commodities. And that's worth 60 basis points. Productivity programs, lower manufacturing costs, including the absence of vitamin start-up costs, is worth 50 basis points. Price/volume mix is worth 10 basis points as we invest a bit more in higher promotions in the back half. And finally, we forecast 20 basis points from the higher margin-acquired businesses, offset by a 30 basis point drag from currency. We are increasing our full year market expectation by 10 basis points to 12.4% as we spend back some of the gross margin beat. 
Moving to SG&A. Adjusting for the 2015 pension settlement charge, we are now forecasted to increase by 40 basis points. We had previously called 25 basis points for the increase. The higher SG&A rate is due to significantly higher medical costs and higher incentive comp. So now we expect 60 basis points of operating margin expansion for the full year. 
Next is income tax. As I mentioned before, we now expect 35% for the full year, so it's about 30 basis points greater than our previous outlook. In terms of EPS, we dropped the low end of the range and are now targeting 8% to 9% of adjusted EPS growth despite the incremental spending on marketing and promotion as well as the higher tax rate.
We now expect $640 million of operating cash flow, which is $10 million better than our previous outlook of $630 million. We continue to expect $55 million of CapEx for the full year. This equates to $585 million of free cash flow, which represents 125% plus of free cash flow conversion. 
Wrapping up, as you read in our earnings release today, we also announced the 2-for-1 stock split of our common stock. The split will increase our total shares outstanding from approximately 128.8 million to 257.6 million shares.
Now Matt and I will open it up for questions."

While at the same time, if you looked at Tidy Cat or Fresh Step, they were up significantly in Q2. And even in laundry, the amount sold on deal for ARM & HAMMER was actually lower year-over-year in Q2. Whereas if you looked at Tide, Simply Tide or Sun or -- and especially, Purex, they were way up in amounts sold on deal year-over-year. So every quarter is different. You got to react to what's going on in the marketplace. And as I said, we want to stay behind OxiClean. OxiClean laundry, we're in for the long haul there. And here and there in some other categories, there's some competitive moves that we need to react to. So fortunately, we have financial flexibility in order to do that. And as you know, we got a big portfolio of brands, so we're in a position where we need some help -- we're going to put the help there."

That implies very strong double-digit growth in nontrack, just using sort of back-of-the-napkin sort of map based on reasonable assumptions for channel mix. So can you guys help me a bit? What is online now as a percent of sales and understanding that the club is not in the Nielsen data as well? But curious what that number is if you care to share it. What do your market shares look like online versus nontracked? Proctor talks about having higher market share in the online channel relative to more traditional mass channels. And then, Matt, maybe touch on a little bit, as this continues to evolve and the consumer continues to move online, talk about the implications a bit for your business. From an even broadly margin perspective, it's seemingly less trade spend at this point, et cetera."

What I will do for you though is help you with the tracked versus nontracked. And there's 2 or 3 drivers on that disconnect. For example, there's probably around 200 basis points from club and online, plus the fact that Batiste isn't really tracked in the Nielsen data in the reports you guys get. There's also a disconnect when you don't spend on promotion. So for example, XTRA, consumption's down 6%. Our net sales is essentially flat because we're not spending as deeper on promotions. Same thing with SPINBRUSH, which we talked about before as well. We're up 10% consumption, net sales are up 15%. So when you're trying to bridge consumption all the way back to organic, those are a couple of the reasons why. And I'll turn it back to Matt for online."

So we need to -- we're looking at this as just another class of trade. We have a convergence going on between research and advertising. So a lot of the research now, a lot of consumer behavior research is digital, it's online. Same time, a lot of the advertising is online. So we're -- we understand that, so we're weaving both our advertising and our research efforts together as a result. It's the early innings for everybody. And everybody's going to look at, do we have the right pack sizes for online? You're going to have different packs online than you have in the store just to take the weight out. We always look at change as our friend because we're a small company. So we think that we can react to change a lot faster than other companies.

Diesel, which is going to affect our transportation cost but that affects everything. Latex for condoms but that's actually a small part of the cost of goods sold. And then you have paper, right, so we have so many things that are packaged in paper board. So -- and then you get a lot smaller after that, soda ash, which is pretty tepid right now, and things like palm fatty acid distillate. So we would say, with the exception of laundry, there aren't a lot of categories that we'd say are going to be dramatically affected by commodities."

So we're not throwing a whole ton of money back into -- across the brand. The other thing I'd say, just from a commodity perspective, commodities are starting to inch up. So we've said previously in Q1 and Q2, for example, that resin was down 10%, surfactants were down 20%, and that was true. The second half, we're starting to lap those comparisons. So resin will likely be closer to flat, and surfactants will probably be closer to up slightly -- just for context."

Now I'm going to talk about international. Our international consumer business has emerged as a growth driver for Church & Dwight. After growing 3% to 4% annually from 2011 to 2014, our international business grew 8% in 2015, and is expected to hit 9% in 2016. 
Batiste is only part of the story. Many brands have contributed to the success story. We have enjoyed stellar growth in Europe, Canada and Mexico this year, while our export business continues to open new doors for our brand. We look forward to steady strong growth from the international business in the future. 
Our Q3 total company organic growth was held back by significantly lower volume in our animal nutrition business, which reflects suppressed milk prices. When we began the year, we expected full year growth from this business to be 1% to 3%, and now we're expecting a 9% decline on a full-year basis. That is quite a reversal. Thanks to the strength of our consumer business, we expect to deliver 8% EPS growth and 3% organic growth for full year 2016. 
We said we're early in our 2017 planning process. We'll say more about that in February. But for now, we again expect high single-digit EPS growth next year. 
Next up is Rick to give you details about third quarter results, the outlook for Q4 and the full year."

Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. I'll start with EPS. Third quarter reported EPS was up 4.4% to $0.47 per share compared to $0.45 in 2015, which was $0.01 ahead of our $0.46 outlook. Reported net sales were up 1% to $871 million. Organic sale",954,"Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. I'll start with EPS. Third quarter reported EPS was up 4.4% to $0.47 per share compared to $0.45 in 2015, which was $0.01 ahead of our $0.46 outlook. Reported net sales were up 1% to $871 million. Organic sales growth of 1.2% was in line with our 1% to 2% range but at the lower end, drive down by the 70 basis point hit from our SPD business. When we spoke to you in August, we assumed the 3% decline in that business versus the 11% decline we experienced. 
Now let's review the segments. Consumer Domestic's organic sales increased by 0.8% in the quarter. Volume growth was solid at 2.1%, offset by 1.3% drag from pricing. Now we expected approximately 1% organic for that business as we had anticipated the incremental coupon incident to support our new products and Q4 promotional shifts. As mentioned, we were a little below 1% as we also got hit with returns due to a small product recall from our Orajel business. 
I know you guys are a fan of stack numbers, so I wanted to call out our volume results. For Q3, of the 3.5% stack organic, all of it is volume. Looking ahead to Q4. We expect organic sales to be 2.5% for the domestic business. That translates to maintaining our full year organic sales outlook of 3%. 
Consumer International organic growth was up an impressive 12.1%. Batiste continues to build depth of distribution in many countries. OxiClean and ARM & HAMMER continue to expand in North America, and TROJAN continues to do well in Latin America. We're raising our expectation for the full year organic growth from 7% to approximately 9% for the international business. 
To recap, 3% for the Consumer Domestic business for the full year and 9% for Consumer International business equates to 4% full year growth for the global consumer business, and we are really pleased with that result. 
For our SPD division. Organic sales were down 11.5%. Milk prices continue to be low due to an excess global supply of milk and weak exports due to a strong dollar. As said in the past, we like this business but we do experience these cycles from time to time. On the bright side, the industry does forecast a slight improvement in milk prices in 2017. 
Turning now to gross margin. Our reported third quarter gross margin was 45.4%, a 60 basis point increase from year ago, primarily due to lower commodities and our productivity programs. Q3 gross margin benefited from lower commodities worth 40 basis points. Productivity programs, the lower manufacturing costs, worth 60 basis points. We also had 30 basis points from higher-margin acquired business, and going the other way, we had a drag of 50 basis points from price/volume mix as we had those higher promotional investments, largely the couponing we discussed earlier, plus we had a 20 basis points drag from currency. 
Now moving to marketing. We increased marketing spend by 5.8% year-over-year. Marketing as a percent of net sales increased 50 basis points to 11.3%. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 11.6%, a 30 basis point decrease from the prior year. This decline was primarily due to the timing of R&D spend and lower litigation costs. 
Now on to operating margin. The reported operating margin for the quarter was 22.5%, which is 40 basis points higher than the prior year. And the other good news is that a proxy for cash earnings or EBITDA margin was up to 26% in the quarter. 
Next, income taxes. Our effective tax rate for the quarter is 35.6%, and we continue to expect our full year rate to be 35%. 
Turning to cash. We had a really strong cash flow quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we have generated $495 million of cash from operations, an $86 million increase from the same period a year ago, primarily due to higher cash earnings and improved working capital. 
So in conclusion, the third quarter highlights include a small consumer organic growth rate of 2.5%, increased gross margin expansion as we exceeded our outlook by $0.01, even after absorbing a hit from the SPD revenue decline and a small product recall. 
Turning now to fourth quarter outlook. We expect Q4 organic sales growth of approximately 1% to 2%. The consumer business is expected to pick up steam in the fourth quarter at 2.5% organic growth while we expect the dairy business to be down 13% and a drag on the total company organic sales growth. We expect fourth quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.42 compared to $0.41 a share a year ago or a 2% increase year-over-year. 
For contacts. The significant year-over-year decline in SPD revenues equates to a $0.01 drag to the EPS line, and we also have a higher tax rate that equates to about $0.01. You may recall that Q4 2015 tax rate has a full year R&D credit all in one quarter. 
Turning to the full year. We now expect organic sales growth to be at the lower end of our 3% to 4% range, which reflects the previously discussed headwind from our Specialty Products Division. We continue to expect gross margin expansion of 110 basis points due to continued lower commodity cost and greater distribution efficiencies. And we also continue to expect 60 basis points of full year operating margin expansion and to deliver 8% EPS growth. 
Finally, we now expect $650 million of operating cash flow and $50 million of CapEx for the full year. This equates to $600 million of free cash flow, which represents over 125% free cash flow conversion. 
Now Matt and I will open up for questions."

And I guess, just given what milk prices did there, a disappointing result, does a quarter like this give you any pause with respect to the fit in the portfolio? I think your commentary in the past has been around a relatively comparable margin profile, somewhat attractive return on operating asset kind of business. But I guess, the rebuttal would be, it seems to be noncore and arguably a distraction. If investors wanted exposure to dairy prices, they could do so by investing in other assets. And I guess, more fundamentally, a concern could potentially be that from 1 quarter to the next, you could be in a position where you're faced with pulling back on investment behind a mega brand as milk prices tank in order to hit the guide on the quarter. So if you could revisit, I guess, some thoughts there and whether a quarter like this gives you any pause, that'd be helpful. And I have a follow-up."

I'm sure a lot of people are questioning their hearts because the business had such a falling off this quarter versus even our expectations when we spoke to everybody in August. But we did take the long view on this business. So we don't look at it as simply a -- the dairy business that it is today, and it is one dimensional. And it's largely doing business in the U.S. and largely in dairy. But we have changed the focus of that business from simply dairy to animal productivity. And what we did was we bought this business 1.5 years ago called VI-COR, early 2015. And then what that did was that got us into poultry, swine and cattle and also some international products. So it got us exposure to other species. So we want to even out the cycles over time by growing interspecies [ph] and also with more acquisitions. So you might say, well, if I want to invest in an animal productivity business, I can go to -- so why not serve one of these other companies. And I would say, look, this is an asset-light business. We have the good fortune of the legacy business of this company, which is sodium bicarbonate, having more out of that into animal productivity. And we have a lot of science in that part of the company, which is probably not well understood, PhD chemists, veterinarians, et cetera. So we have a great list of people to build upon. And because it's asset-light, because you know we're a cash-driven company, it has all the characteristics we want to grow over time. And the big macro is you've got 7 billion people today, going to 9 billion in 2050. So it's a long answer, but it probably deserves a long answer concerning the fact that it influenced the numbers this quarter. Now looking ahead to '17. The good news is the milk prices are forecasted to start recovering next year. So it's not going to be as bad next year as this year. So we would expect some growth out of this Specialty Products business in '17, but it's certainly a legitimate question, Kevin."

That was largely a Q3 event, but we do have a little bit in Q4. And in general, Q4 going to 2.5% organic is predominantly a volume-driven result. And there's a little bit of price mix in there too.

So OxiClean as you know, we launched a couple of years ago. And then Persil came in the scene, we went sideways for a while.

And that's why we would have the confidence to say, hey, we're going to hit our Evergreen model again in 2017. Your larger question might be about the economy. And of course, we see everything that you see, right? Unemployment is pretty steady. But GDP is only 1.5% and gasoline price is creeping up. Health care costs and those are increasing for consumers and the median household income around $51,000. So that is the consumer. So obviously, that's hitting the consumer in the pocketbook. So it's -- I wouldn't say it's the best outlook for the consumer. But from our point of view, we think that we have so many different ways to win here. We have -- we get 10 brands, we've got a great international business in Specialty Products, have some ups and downs. But that'll be back next year. So it's going to have a 12 cylinder engine.

Today, I'll provide some color on the quarter and then turn the call over to Rick Dierker. When Rick is finished, we'll open the call up for questions. 
So Q3 was a solid quarter for our company. EPS exceeded our outlook. Organic sales growth of 1.2% was in line with our August outlook of 1% to 2%. We would've been at the high end of the range if not for a
[Audio Gap]
Percent compared to a 5% decline in the category. This is the second consecutive quarter that we have outpaced the children's gummy category. Today, the gummy form of the entire adult VMS category is 10%. It was 3% when we bought the business 4 years ago. Vitafusion and Li'l Critters are the #1 brands with shares of 28% and 30% in measured channels, respectively. Adult gummies is where we are putting our focus. It is underdeveloped and will be the source of future growth for us. 
The last category I'll address is dry shampoo. This category grew almost 27% in Q3 after growing 26% in Q1 and 28% in Q2. The category in the U.S. is now over $100 million with the potential to be a $300 million category if we max the historical category growth experienced in the U.K. where the product originated. Batiste is the #1 brand in the U.S., with a 23.6% share. The Batiste brand is expected to be one of the fastest growing brands in the future for us. 
Now I'm going to talk about international. Our international consumer business has emerged as a growth driver for Church & Dwight. After growing 3% to 4% annually from 2011 to 2014, our international business grew 8% in 2015, and is expected to hit 9% in 2016. 
Batiste is only part of the story. Many brands have contributed to the success story. We have enjoyed stellar growth in Europe, Canada and Mexico this year, while our export business continues to open new doors for our brand. We look forward to steady strong growth from the international business in the future. 
Our Q3 total company organic growth was held back by significantly lower volume in our animal nutrition business, which reflects suppressed milk prices. When we began the year, we expected full year growth from this business to be 1% to 3%, and now we're expecting a 9% decline on a full-year basis. That is quite a reversal. Thanks to the strength of our consumer business, we expect to deliver 8% EPS growth and 3% organic growth for full year 2016. 
We said we're early in our 2017 planning process. We'll say more about that in February. But for now, we again expect high single-digit EPS growth next year. 
Next up is Rick to give you details about third quarter results, the outlook for Q4 and the full year."

Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. I'll start with EPS. Third quarter reported EPS was up 4.4% to $0.47 per share compared to $0.45 in 2015, which was $0.01 ahead of our $0.46 outlook. Reported net sales were up 1% to $871 million. Organic sale",954,"Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. I'll start with EPS. Third quarter reported EPS was up 4.4% to $0.47 per share compared to $0.45 in 2015, which was $0.01 ahead of our $0.46 outlook. Reported net sales were up 1% to $871 million. Organic sales growth of 1.2% was in line with our 1% to 2% range but at the lower end, drive down by the 70 basis point hit from our SPD business. When we spoke to you in August, we assumed the 3% decline in that business versus the 11% decline we experienced. 
Now let's review the segments. Consumer Domestic's organic sales increased by 0.8% in the quarter. Volume growth was solid at 2.1%, offset by 1.3% drag from pricing. Now we expected approximately 1% organic for that business as we had anticipated the incremental coupon incident to support our new products and Q4 promotional shifts. As mentioned, we were a little below 1% as we also got hit with returns due to a small product recall from our Orajel business. 
I know you guys are a fan of stack numbers, so I wanted to call out our volume results. For Q3, of the 3.5% stack organic, all of it is volume. Looking ahead to Q4. We expect organic sales to be 2.5% for the domestic business. That translates to maintaining our full year organic sales outlook of 3%. 
Consumer International organic growth was up an impressive 12.1%. Batiste continues to build depth of distribution in many countries. OxiClean and ARM & HAMMER continue to expand in North America, and TROJAN continues to do well in Latin America. We're raising our expectation for the full year organic growth from 7% to approximately 9% for the international business. 
To recap, 3% for the Consumer Domestic business for the full year and 9% for Consumer International business equates to 4% full year growth for the global consumer business, and we are really pleased with that result. 
For our SPD division. Organic sales were down 11.5%. Milk prices continue to be low due to an excess global supply of milk and weak exports due to a strong dollar. As said in the past, we like this business but we do experience these cycles from time to time. On the bright side, the industry does forecast a slight improvement in milk prices in 2017. 
Turning now to gross margin. Our reported third quarter gross margin was 45.4%, a 60 basis point increase from year ago, primarily due to lower commodities and our productivity programs. Q3 gross margin benefited from lower commodities worth 40 basis points. Productivity programs, the lower manufacturing costs, worth 60 basis points. We also had 30 basis points from higher-margin acquired business, and going the other way, we had a drag of 50 basis points from price/volume mix as we had those higher promotional investments, largely the couponing we discussed earlier, plus we had a 20 basis points drag from currency. 
Now moving to marketing. We increased marketing spend by 5.8% year-over-year. Marketing as a percent of net sales increased 50 basis points to 11.3%. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 11.6%, a 30 basis point decrease from the prior year. This decline was primarily due to the timing of R&D spend and lower litigation costs. 
Now on to operating margin. The reported operating margin for the quarter was 22.5%, which is 40 basis points higher than the prior year. And the other good news is that a proxy for cash earnings or EBITDA margin was up to 26% in the quarter. 
Next, income taxes. Our effective tax rate for the quarter is 35.6%, and we continue to expect our full year rate to be 35%. 
Turning to cash. We had a really strong cash flow quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we have generated $495 million of cash from operations, an $86 million increase from the same period a year ago, primarily due to higher cash earnings and improved working capital. 
So in conclusion, the third quarter highlights include a small consumer organic growth rate of 2.5%, increased gross margin expansion as we exceeded our outlook by $0.01, even after absorbing a hit from the SPD revenue decline and a small product recall. 
Turning now to fourth quarter outlook. We expect Q4 organic sales growth of approximately 1% to 2%. The consumer business is expected to pick up steam in the fourth quarter at 2.5% organic growth while we expect the dairy business to be down 13% and a drag on the total company organic sales growth. We expect fourth quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.42 compared to $0.41 a share a year ago or a 2% increase year-over-year. 
For contacts. The significant year-over-year decline in SPD revenues equates to a $0.01 drag to the EPS line, and we also have a higher tax rate that equates to about $0.01. You may recall that Q4 2015 tax rate has a full year R&D credit all in one quarter. 
Turning to the full year. We now expect organic sales growth to be at the lower end of our 3% to 4% range, which reflects the previously discussed headwind from our Specialty Products Division. We continue to expect gross margin expansion of 110 basis points due to continued lower commodity cost and greater distribution efficiencies. And we also continue to expect 60 basis points of full year operating margin expansion and to deliver 8% EPS growth. 
Finally, we now expect $650 million of operating cash flow and $50 million of CapEx for the full year. This equates to $600 million of free cash flow, which represents over 125% free cash flow conversion. 
Now Matt and I will open up for questions."

And I guess, just given what milk prices did there, a disappointing result, does a quarter like this give you any pause with respect to the fit in the portfolio? I think your commentary in the past has been around a relatively comparable margin profile, somewhat attractive return on operating asset kind of business. But I guess, the rebuttal would be, it seems to be noncore and arguably a distraction. If investors wanted exposure to dairy prices, they could do so by investing in other assets. And I guess, more fundamentally, a concern could potentially be that from 1 quarter to the next, you could be in a position where you're faced with pulling back on investment behind a mega brand as milk prices tank in order to hit the guide on the quarter. So if you could revisit, I guess, some thoughts there and whether a quarter like this gives you any pause, that'd be helpful. And I have a follow-up."

I'm sure a lot of people are questioning their hearts because the business had such a falling off this quarter versus even our expectations when we spoke to everybody in August. But we did take the long view on this business. So we don't look at it as simply a -- the dairy business that it is today, and it is one dimensional. And it's largely doing business in the U.S. and largely in dairy. But we have changed the focus of that business from simply dairy to animal productivity. And what we did was we bought this business 1.5 years ago called VI-COR, early 2015. And then what that did was that got us into poultry, swine and cattle and also some international products. So it got us exposure to other species. So we want to even out the cycles over time by growing in other species and also with more acquisitions. So you might say, well, if I want to invest in an animal productivity business, I can go to -- so why not serve one of these other companies. And I would say, look, this is an asset-light business. We have the good fortune of the legacy business of this company, which is sodium bicarbonate, having more out of that into animal productivity. And we have a lot of science in that part of the company, which is probably not well understood, PhD chemists, veterinarians, et cetera. So we have a great list of people to build upon. And because it's asset-light, because you know we're a cash-driven company, it has all the characteristics we want to grow over time. And the big macro is you've got 7 billion people today, going to 9 billion in 2050. So it's a long answer, but it probably deserves a long answer concerning the fact that it influenced the numbers this quarter. Now looking ahead to '17. The good news is the milk prices are forecasted to start recovering next year. So it's not going to be as bad next year as this year. So we would expect some growth out of this Specialty Products business in '17, but it's certainly a legitimate question, Kevin."

That was largely a Q3 event, but we do have a little bit in Q4. And in general, Q4 going to 2.5% organic is predominantly a volume-driven result. And there's a little bit of price mix in there too.

Health care costs and those will be increasing for consumers. And the median household income around $51,000. So that is the consumer. So obviously, that's hitting the consumer in the pocketbook. So it's -- I wouldn't say it's the best outlook for the consumer. But from our point of view, we think that we have so many different ways to win here. And we have -- we get 10 brands. We've got a great international business. And Specialty Products has its ups and downs, but that'll be back next year. So it's going to have a 12-cylinder engine. And as we showed in this quarter, some of them is misfiring, others will. And we're able to hit our numbers. So we aim to hit the numbers again next year just as we did this year."

So one was flat, and that was ARM & HAMMER. So we had growth in laundry, but that was offset by litter. So if you said, where is that one that you would expect to improve next year? Yes, it would be ARM & HAMMER. So that 4 would become 5. So then you say, what are the other ones? The other ones would be TROJAN. And yes -- so in TROJAN, we had lost some share in measured channels, but we had strong growth in untracked channels and that will continue to be probably a bigger part of the discussion, measuring brand growth in measured channels versus all-in, which is harder to get your arms around. XTRA is certainly one that we've been suffering because of deep competitive discounting. So it's been more or less in the sidelines there. So that one, we expect to turn around, and obviously, it's pretty obvious what that's going to take. Orajel, there's been some pressure from private label, but we have an improved product offering that's coming out in Q4 to distinguish ourselves again further from private label. So we hope that's going to have a positive impact. First Response, the issue there is we have some retailers experimenting with the split between branded and private label. And SPINBRUSH, last quarter, adult grew 10% and kids were soft. This quarter, it's the reverse. Kids was way up and adult was soft. But the business grew, just not as the same pace as the category. So it's a mixed bag. As we said, what would be a good score? Every quarter would be -- we'd say 6. If you could get 6 out of 10 every quarter, that would be fantastic. And I think stellar would be 7 to 8. But 9 to 10 is aspirational, Caroline."

And the good news for us is that the category is growing rapidly. And our share keeps expanding. So our share expanded from Q2 to Q3 in a category that's growing rapidly. And what we have going for us is that Batiste is a European brand, number one. And number two, that exceeds far better than anything else that's on the market. So it's really product performance is what's winning. So people who have not used our product and then switch to Batiste, they don't go back. So it's -- we're not concerned about other entrants.

When Rick is finished, we'll open the call up for questions. 
So Q3 was a solid quarter for our company. EPS exceeded our outlook. Organic sales growth of 1.2% was in line with our August outlook of 1% to 2%. We would've been at the high end of the range if not for a far-worse than expected result in our animal nutrition business which was an unexpected 70 basis points drag on the outlook. The quality of earnings was high this quarter. We expanded gross margin. We invested in higher marketing of 50 bps and SG&A was lower year-over-year. We overcame a high tax rate, a small product recall, and a big decline in our animal nutrition business and still beat our EPS outlook by $0.01. Our consumer business delivered volume-driven organic sales growth of 2.5%, but by continued strong growth by our international consumer business. In the U.S., our organic sales growth met our expectations reflecting higher couponing, as we communicated back in August. The good news is, category growth was broad-based. 10 of our 15 categories grew in the quarter. 
Now, I'm going to say a few words about 4 of our categories. 
The laundry category continues to be healthy, growing 4% year-over-year and our laundry business grew with the category. This is the sixth quarter in a row of laundry category growth driven by both the unit dose and liquid segments. 
In liquid laundry detergent, this quarter marked the 27th consecutive quarter of share growth for ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry. In contrast, our XTRA  brand lost share in the quarter as we continued to see deep competitive discounting. Similar to what we said in Q2, we expect XTRA net profits to increase year-over-year for full-year 2016 and we have plans to turn around that brand. Also in the liquid category, OxiClean grew share to 1.8%, driven by strong promotional support. As we have said before, we are committed to OxiClean laundry detergent. We are encouraged by the trial activity in this most recent quarter and our repeat rate continues to improve. 
Turning to the unit-dose segment. Our unit dose products continue to gain traction and had some of the largest gains in the category. For the second consecutive quarter, ARM & HAMMER unit dose grew twice the unit dose category growth rate and our growth was driven by our bi-layer and dual chamber innovations. Most important, our unit dose business was equally driven by base and promoted volume with signaling a healthy balance. ARM & HAMMER unit dose grew 50 basis points to 3.2 share in the quarter. Similarly, OxiClean unit dose also grew share in the quarter and is now a 1.1 share. These are encouraging signs as we continue to go in the right direction. 
Finally, in fabric care, the stain-fighter category grew 3.2%; OxiClean grew consumption 7% and is the leading stain-fighter in the additive category with the 48% share. OxiClean grew share 170 basis points in the quarter.
The litter category continues to be very competitive with increased couponing. For the quarter, the litter category was up 3.7% while our brands were flat in measured channels. Our shipments were up as our online litter business more than doubled. Long term, we have won in this category through innovation which continues to be our focus.
Now, we'll talk about vitamins. The overall VMS category continues to show steady growth, up 3.8%. The gummy 
[Audio Gap]
percent compared to a 5% decline in the category. This is the second consecutive quarter that we have outpaced the children's gummy category. Today, the gummy form of the entire adult VMS category is 10%. It was 3% when we bought the business 4 years ago. Vitafusion and Li'l Critters are the #1 brands with shares of 28% and 30% in measured channels, respectively. Adult gummies is where we are putting our focus. It is underdeveloped and will be the source of future growth for us. 
The last category I'll address is dry shampoo. This category grew almost 27% in Q3 after growing 26% in Q1 and 28% in Q2. The category in the U.S. is now over $100 million with the potential to be a $300 million category if we max the historical category growth experienced in the U.K. where the product originated. Batiste is the #1 brand in the U.S., with a 23.6% share. The Batiste brand is expected to be one of the fastest growing brands in the future for us. 
Now I'm going to talk about international. Our international consumer business has emerged as a growth driver for Church & Dwight. After growing 3% to 4% annually from 2011 to 2014, our international business grew 8% in 2015, and is expected to hit 9% in 2016. 
Batiste is only part of the story. Many brands have contributed to the success story. We have enjoyed stellar growth in Europe, Canada and Mexico this year, while our export business continues to open new doors for our brands. We look forward to steady, strong growth from the international business in the future. 
Our Q3 total company organic growth was held back by significantly lower volume in our animal nutrition business, which reflects depressed milk prices. When we began the year, we expected full year growth from this business to be 1% to 3%, and now we're expecting a 9% decline on a full-year basis. That is quite a reversal. Thanks to the strength of our consumer business, we expect to deliver 8% EPS growth and 3% organic growth for full year 2016. 
We've said we're early in our 2017 planning process. We'll say more about that in February. But for now, we again expect high single-digit EPS growth next year. 
Next up is Rick to give you details about third quarter results, the outlook for Q4 and the full year."
261105,402643572,1073023,"Church & Dwight Co. Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. I'll start with EPS. Third quarter reported EPS was up 4.4% to $0.47 per share compared to $0.45 in 2015, which was $0.01 ahead of our $0.46 outlook. Reported net sales were up 1% to $871 million. Organic sale",955,"Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. I'll start with EPS. Third quarter reported EPS was up 4.4% to $0.47 per share compared to $0.45 in 2015, which was $0.01 ahead of our $0.46 outlook. Reported net sales were up 1% to $871 million. Organic sales growth of 1.2% was in line with our 1% to 2% range, but at the lower end, dragged down by the 70 basis point hit from our SPD business. When we spoke to you in August, we assumed a 3% decline in that business versus the 11% decline we experienced. 
Now let's review the segments. Consumer Domestic's organic sales increased by 0.8% in the quarter. Volume growth was solid at 2.1%, offset by 1.3% drag from pricing. Now we expected approximately 1% organic for that business as we had anticipated the incremental coupon to support our new products and Q4 promotional shifts. As mentioned, we were a little below 1% as we also got hit with returns due to a small product recall from our Orajel business. 
I know you guys are a fan of stack numbers, so I wanted to call out our volume results. For Q3, of the 3.5% stack organic, all of it is volume. Looking ahead to Q4. We expect organic sales to be 2.5% for the domestic business. That translates to maintaining our full year organic sales outlook of 3%. 
Consumer International organic growth was up an impressive 12.1%. Batiste continues to build depth of distribution in many countries. OxiClean and ARM & HAMMER continue to expand in North America, and TROJAN continues to do well in Latin America. We're raising our expectation for the full year organic growth from 7% to approximately 9% for the international business. 
To recap, 3% for the Consumer Domestic business for the full year and 9% for the Consumer International business equates to 4% full year growth for the global consumer business, and we are really pleased with that result. 
For our SPD division. Organic sales were down 11.5%. Milk prices continue to be low due to an excess global supply of milk and weak exports due to a strong dollar. As said in the past, we like this business but we do experience these cycles from time to time. On the bright side, the industry does forecast a slight improvement in milk prices in 2017. 
Turning now to gross margin. Our reported third quarter gross margin was 45.4%, a 60 basis point increase from year ago, primarily due to lower commodities and our productivity programs. Q3 gross margin benefited from lower commodities worth 40 basis points. Productivity programs and lower manufacturing costs, worth 60 basis points. We also had 30 basis points from higher-margin acquired business, and going the other way, we had a drag of 50 basis points from price/volume mix as we had those higher promotional investments, largely the couponing we discussed earlier, plus we had a 20 basis points drag from currency. 
Now moving to marketing. We increased marketing spend by 5.8% year-over-year. Marketing as a percent of net sales increased 50 basis points to 11.3%. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 11.6%, a 30 basis point decrease from the prior year. This decline was primarily due to the timing of R&D spend and lower litigation costs. 
Now on to operating margins. The reported operating margin for the quarter was 22.5%, which is 40 basis points higher than the prior year. And the other good news is that as a proxy for cash earnings, our EBITDA margin was up to 26% in the quarter. 
Next, income taxes. Our effective rate for the quarter is 35.6%, and we continue to expect our full year rate to be 35%. 
Turning to cash. We had a really strong cash flow quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we have generated $495 million of cash from operations, an $86 million increase from the same period a year ago, primarily due to higher cash earnings and improved working capital. 
So in conclusion, the third quarter highlights include a strong consumer organic growth rate of 2.5%, increased gross margin expansion as we exceeded our outlook by $0.01, even after absorbing a hit from the SPD revenue decline and a small product recall. 
Turning now to the fourth quarter outlook. We expect Q4 organic sales growth of approximately 1% to 2%. The consumer business is expected to pick up steam in the fourth quarter at 2.5% organic growth while we expect the dairy business to be down 13% and a drag on the total company organic sales growth. We expect fourth quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.42 compared to $0.41 a share a year ago or a 2% increase year-over-year. 
For context, the significant year-over-year decline in SPD revenues equates to $0.01 drag to the EPS line, and we also have a higher tax rate that equates to about $0.01. You may recall that Q4 2015 tax rate has a full year R&D credit all in one quarter. 
Turning to the full year. We now expect organic sales growth to be at the lower end of our 3% to 4% range, which reflects the previously discussed headwind from our Specialty Product Division. We continue to expect gross margin expansion of 110 basis points due to continued lower commodity costs and greater distribution efficiencies. And we also continue to expect 60 basis points of full year operating margin expansion and to deliver 8% EPS growth. 
Finally, we now expect $650 million of operating cash flow and $50 million of CapEx for the full year. This equates to $600 million of free cash flow, which represents over 125% free cash flow conversion. 
Now Matt and I will open it up for questions."

And I guess, just given what milk prices did there, a disappointing result, does a quarter like this give you any pause with respect to the fit in the portfolio? I think your commentary in the past has been around a relatively comparable margin profile, somewhat attractive return on operating asset kind of business. But I guess, the rebuttal would be, it seems to be noncore and arguably a distraction. If investors wanted exposure to dairy prices, they could do so by investing in other assets. And I guess, more fundamentally, a concern could potentially be that from 1 quarter to the next, you could be in a position where you're faced with pulling back on investment behind a mega brand as milk prices tank in order to hit the guide on the quarter. So if you could revisit, I guess, some thoughts there and whether a quarter like this gives you any pause, that'd be helpful. And I have a follow-up."

I'm sure a lot of people are clutching their hearts because the business had such a falling off this quarter versus even our expectations when we spoke to everybody in August. But we do take the long view on this business. So we don't look at it as simply a -- the dairy business that it is today, and it is one dimensional. And it's largely doing business in the U.S. and largely in dairy. But we have changed the focus of that business from simply dairy to animal productivity. And what we did was we bought this business 1.5 years ago called VI-COR, in early 2015. And then what that did was that got us into poultry, swine and cattle and also some international products. So it got us exposure to other species. So we want to even out the cycles over time by growing into other species and also with more acquisitions. So you might say, well, if I want to invest in an animal productivity business, I can go to Sawedis [ph] or one of these other companies. And I would say, look, this is an asset-light business. We have the good fortune of the legacy business of this company, which is sodium bicarbonate, having more out of that into animal productivity. And we have a lot of science in that part of the company, which is probably not well understood, Ph.D. chemists, veterinarians, et cetera. So we have a great nucleus of people to build upon. And because it's asset-light, because you know we're a cash-driven company, it has all the characteristics we want to grow over time. And the big macro is you've got 7 billion people today, going to 9 billion in 2050. So it's a long answer, but it probably deserves a long answer considering the fact that it influenced the numbers this quarter. Now looking ahead to '17. The good news is the milk prices are forecasted to start recovering next year. So it's not going to be as bad next year as this year. So we would expect some growth out of this Specialty Products business in '17, but it's certainly a legitimate question, Kevin."

And even -- so when I take a look at the comps, that still implies some slowing in the fourth quarter. Can you talk a little bit about what's driving that? The Personal Care number was a little bit weak in third quarter. I don't know if there's an expectation that persists. And then what exactly is driving that dynamic? Is there more couponing and heavier trade spend, given what's going on in laundry right now, where that's ramped? So just if you could help sort of -- help me understand a bit what's driving the 2-year average sort of slowdown into the fourth quarter as well."

We had recovered in a big way from all the cuts we experienced in the back half of '14 and early '15. So the back half was like 5.5% growth for example, and the first half was flat. So to some degree the comps were influenced by -- the slowdown was influenced by that. That's number one. Number two, we do have some incremental couponing to drive trial. That was largely a Q3 event, but we do have a little bit in Q4. And in general, Q4 going to 2.5% organic is predominantly a volume-driven result. And there's a little bit of price mix in there too. But personal care growth, which was a little bit negative in Q3, is expected to recover and be slightly positive in Q4 as well. So I hope that helps. It's a little bit more color."

So OxiClean, as you know, we launched a couple of years ago. And then Persil came on the scene, then we went sideways for a while.

And of course, we see everything that you see, right? Unemployment is pretty steady, but GDP is only 1.5%. And gasoline price is creeping up. Health care costs are noticeably increasing for consumers. And the median household income around $51,000. So that is the consumer. So obviously, that's hitting the consumer in the pocketbook. So it's -- I wouldn't say it's the best outlook for the consumer. But from our point of view, we think that we have so many different ways to win here. And we have -- we get 10 brands. We've got a great international business. And Specialty Products has its ups and downs, but that'll be back next year. So it's going to have a 12-cylinder engine.

Yes, it would be ARM & HAMMER. So that 4 would become 5. So then you say, what are the other ones? The other ones would be TROJAN. And yes -- so in TROJAN, we had lost some share in measured channels, but we have strong growth in untracked channels and that will continue to be probably a bigger part of the discussion, measuring brand growth in measured channels versus all-in, which is harder to get your arms around. XTRA is certainly one that we've been suffering because of deep competitive discounting. So it's been more or less in the sidelines there. So that one, we expect to turn around, and obviously, it's pretty obvious what that's going to take. Orajel, there's been some pressure from private label, but we have an improved product offering that's coming out in Q4 to distinguish ourselves again further from private label. So we hope that's going to have a positive impact. First Response, the issue there is we have some retailers experimenting with the split between branded and private label. And SPINBRUSH, last quarter, adult grew 10% and kids were soft. This quarter, it's the reverse. Kids was way up and adult was soft. But the business grew, just not at the same pace as the category. So it's a mixed bag. If you said, what would be a good score? Every quarter would be -- we'd say 6. If you could get 6 out of 10 every quarter, that would be fantastic.

And what we have going for us is that Batiste is a European brand, number one. And number two, its efficacy is far better than anything else that's on the market. So it's really product performance is what's winning. So people who have not used our product and then switch to Batiste, they don't go back. So it's -- we're not concerned about other entrants.

And then there are countries we're not in like Germany for example, which is the largest, strongest economy in Europe. So longer term, we'd say, yes, that's a place we'd want to be in. And then export is one that is just a fountain for us, because we have found that our products do travel well, and we have built an export team with great leadership there, and we think the sky's the limit with respect to driving our product internationally. So I think that's sort of the view with respect to international, Nik. That's why we're so positive about it. Your front-end question was, are we seen more asks on the part of the retailers?"

When Rick is finished, we'll open the call up for questions. 
So Q3 was a solid quarter for our company. EPS exceeded our outlook. Organic sales growth of 1.2% was in line with our August outlook of 1% to 2%. We would've been at the high end of the range if not for a far-worse than expected result in our animal nutrition business which was an unexpected 70 basis points drag on the outlook. The quality of earnings was high this quarter. We expanded gross margin. We invested in higher marketing of 50 bps and SG&A was lower year-over-year. We overcame a high tax rate, a small product recall, and a big decline in our animal nutrition business and still beat our EPS outlook by $0.01. Our consumer business delivered volume-driven organic sales growth of 2.5%, but by continued strong growth by our international consumer business. In the U.S., our organic sales growth met our expectations reflecting higher couponing, as we communicated back in August. The good news is, category growth was broad-based. 10 of our 15 categories grew in the quarter. 
Now I'm going to say a few words about 4 of our categories. 
The laundry category continues to be healthy, growing 4% year-over-year and our laundry business grew with the category. This is the sixth quarter in a row of laundry category growth driven by both the unit dose and liquid segments. 
In liquid laundry detergent, this quarter marked the 27th consecutive quarter of share growth for ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry. In contrast, our XTRA brand lost share in the quarter as we continued to see deep competitive discounting. Similar to what we said in Q2, we expect XTRA net profits to increase year-over-year for full-year 2016 and we have plans to turn around that brand. Also in the liquid category, OxiClean grew share to 1.8%, driven by strong promotional support. As we have said before, we are committed to OxiClean laundry detergent. We are encouraged by the trial activity in this most recent quarter and our repeat rate continues to improve. 
Turning to the unit-dose segment. Our unit dose products continue to gain traction and had some of the largest gains in the category. For the second consecutive quarter, ARM & HAMMER unit dose grew twice the unit dose category growth rate and our growth was driven by our bi-layer and dual chamber innovations. Most important, our unit dose business was equally driven by base and promoted volume with signaling a healthy balance. ARM & HAMMER unit dose grew 50 basis points to 3.2 share in the quarter. Similarly, OxiClean unit dose also grew share in the quarter and is now a 1.1 share. These are encouraging signs as we continue to go in the right direction. 
Finally, in fabric care, the stain-fighter category grew 3.2%; OxiClean grew consumption 7% and is the leading stain-fighter in the additive category with the 48% share. OxiClean grew share 170 basis points in the quarter.
The litter category continues to be very competitive with increased couponing. For the quarter, the litter category was up 3.7% while our brands were flat in measured channels. Our shipments were up as our online litter business more than doubled. Long term, we have won in this category through innovation which continues to be our focus.
Now we'll talk about vitamins. The overall VMS category continues to show steady growth, up 3.8%. The gummy 
[Audio Gap]
percent compared to a 5% decline in the category. This is the second consecutive quarter that we have outpaced the children's gummy category. Today, the gummy form of the entire adult VMS category is 10%. It was 3% when we bought the business 4 years ago. Vitafusion and Li'l Critters are the #1 brands with shares of 28% and 30% in measured channels, respectively. Adult gummies is where we are putting our focus. It is underdeveloped and will be the source of future growth for us. 
The last category I'll address is dry shampoo. This category grew almost 27% in Q3 after growing 26% in Q1 and 28% in Q2. The category in the U.S. is now over $100 million with the potential to be a $300 million category if we max the historical category growth experienced in the U.K. where the product originated. Batiste is the #1 brand in the U.S., with a 23.6% share. The Batiste brand is expected to be one of the fastest growing brands in the future for us. 
Now I'm going to talk about international. Our international consumer business has emerged as a growth driver for Church & Dwight. After growing 3% to 4% annually from 2011 to 2014, our international business grew 8% in 2015, and is expected to hit 9% in 2016. 
Batiste is only part of the story. Many brands have contributed to the success story. We have enjoyed stellar growth in Europe, Canada and Mexico this year, while our export business continues to open new doors for our brands. We look forward to steady, strong growth from the international business in the future. 
Our Q3 total company organic growth was held back by significantly lower volume in our animal nutrition business, which reflects depressed milk prices. When we began the year, we expected full year growth from this business to be 1% to 3%, and now we're expecting a 9% decline on a full-year basis. That is quite a reversal. Thanks to the strength of our consumer business, we expect to deliver 8% EPS growth and 3% organic growth for full year 2016. 
We've said we're early in our 2017 planning process. We'll say more about that in February. But for now, we again expect high single-digit EPS growth next year. 
Next up is Rick to give you details about third quarter results, the outlook for Q4 and the full year."
261105,402643572,1075132,"Church & Dwight Co. Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. I'll start with EPS. Third quarter reported EPS was up 4.4% to $0.47 per share compared to $0.45 in 2015, which was $0.01 ahead of our $0.46 outlook. Reported net sales were up 1% to $871 million. Organic sale",955,"Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. I'll start with EPS. Third quarter reported EPS was up 4.4% to $0.47 per share compared to $0.45 in 2015, which was $0.01 ahead of our $0.46 outlook. Reported net sales were up 1% to $871 million. Organic sales growth of 1.2% was in line with our 1% to 2% range, but at the lower end, dragged down by the 70 basis point hit from our SPD business. When we spoke to you in August, we assumed a 3% decline in that business versus the 11% decline we experienced. 
Now let's review the segments. Consumer Domestic's organic sales increased by 0.8% in the quarter. Volume growth was solid at 2.1%, offset by 1.3% drag from pricing. Now we expected approximately 1% organic for that business as we had anticipated the incremental coupon to support our new products and Q4 promotional shifts. As mentioned, we were a little below 1% as we also got hit with returns due to a small product recall from our Orajel business. 
I know you guys are a fan of stack numbers, so I wanted to call out our volume results. For Q3, of the 3.5% stack organic, all of it is volume. Looking ahead to Q4. We expect organic sales to be 2.5% for the domestic business. That translates to maintaining our full year organic sales outlook of 3%. 
Consumer International organic growth was up an impressive 12.1%. Batiste continues to build depth of distribution in many countries. OxiClean and ARM & HAMMER continue to expand in North America, and TROJAN continues to do well in Latin America. We're raising our expectation for the full year organic growth from 7% to approximately 9% for the international business. 
To recap, 3% for the Consumer Domestic business for the full year and 9% for the Consumer International business equates to 4% full year growth for the global consumer business, and we are really pleased with that result. 
For our SPD division. Organic sales were down 11.5%. Milk prices continue to be low due to an excess global supply of milk and weak exports due to a strong dollar. As said in the past, we like this business but we do experience these cycles from time to time. On the bright side, the industry does forecast a slight improvement in milk prices in 2017. 
Turning now to gross margin. Our reported third quarter gross margin was 45.4%, a 60 basis point increase from year ago, primarily due to lower commodities and our productivity programs. Q3 gross margin benefited from lower commodities worth 40 basis points. Productivity programs and lower manufacturing costs, worth 60 basis points. We also had 30 basis points from higher-margin acquired business, and going the other way, we had a drag of 50 basis points from price/volume mix as we had those higher promotional investments, largely the couponing we discussed earlier, plus we had a 20 basis points drag from currency. 
Now moving to marketing. We increased marketing spend by 5.8% year-over-year. Marketing as a percent of net sales increased 50 basis points to 11.3%. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 11.6%, a 30 basis point decrease from the prior year. This decline was primarily due to the timing of R&D spend and lower litigation costs. 
Now on to operating margins. The reported operating margin for the quarter was 22.5%, which is 40 basis points higher than the prior year. And the other good news is that as a proxy for cash earnings, our EBITDA margin was up to 26% in the quarter. 
Next, income taxes. Our effective rate for the quarter is 35.6%, and we continue to expect our full year rate to be 35%. 
Turning to cash. We had a really strong cash flow quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we have generated $495 million of cash from operations, an $86 million increase from the same period a year ago, primarily due to higher cash earnings and improved working capital. 
So in conclusion, the third quarter highlights include a strong consumer organic growth rate of 2.5%, increased gross margin expansion as we exceeded our outlook by $0.01, even after absorbing a hit from the SPD revenue decline and a small product recall. 
Turning now to the fourth quarter outlook. We expect Q4 organic sales growth of approximately 1% to 2%. The consumer business is expected to pick up steam in the fourth quarter at 2.5% organic growth while we expect the dairy business to be down 13% and a drag on the total company organic sales growth. We expect fourth quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.42 compared to $0.41 a share a year ago or a 2% increase year-over-year. 
For context, the significant year-over-year decline in SPD revenues equates to $0.01 drag to the EPS line, and we also have a higher tax rate that equates to about $0.01. You may recall that Q4 2015 tax rate has a full year R&D credit all in one quarter. 
Turning to the full year. We now expect organic sales growth to be at the lower end of our 3% to 4% range, which reflects the previously discussed headwind from our Specialty Product Division. We continue to expect gross margin expansion of 110 basis points due to continued lower commodity costs and greater distribution efficiencies. And we also continue to expect 60 basis points of full year operating margin expansion and to deliver 8% EPS growth. 
Finally, we now expect $650 million of operating cash flow and $50 million of CapEx for the full year. This equates to $600 million of free cash flow, which represents over 125% free cash flow conversion. 
Now Matt and I will open it up for questions."

And I guess, just given what milk prices did there, a disappointing result, does a quarter like this give you any pause with respect to the fit in the portfolio? I think your commentary in the past has been around a relatively comparable margin profile, somewhat attractive return on operating asset kind of business. But I guess, the rebuttal would be, it seems to be noncore and arguably a distraction. If investors wanted exposure to dairy prices, they could do so by investing in other assets. And I guess, more fundamentally, a concern could potentially be that from 1 quarter to the next, you could be in a position where you're faced with pulling back on investment behind a mega brand as milk prices tank in order to hit the guide on the quarter. So if you could revisit, I guess, some thoughts there and whether a quarter like this gives you any pause, that'd be helpful. And I have a follow-up."

I'm sure a lot of people are clutching their hearts because the business had such a falling off this quarter versus even our expectations when we spoke to everybody in August. But we do take the long view on this business. So we don't look at it as simply a -- the dairy business that it is today, and it is one dimensional. And it's largely doing business in the U.S. and largely in dairy. But we have changed the focus of that business from simply dairy to animal productivity. And what we did was we bought this business 1.5 years ago called VI-COR, in early 2015. And then what that did was that got us into poultry, swine and cattle and also some international products. So it got us exposure to other species. So we want to even out the cycles over time by growing into other species and also with more acquisitions. So you might say, well, if I want to invest in an animal productivity business, I can go to Zoetis or one of these other companies. And I would say, look, this is an asset-light business. We have the good fortune of the legacy business of this company, which is sodium bicarbonate, having more out of that into animal productivity. And we have a lot of science in that part of the company, which is probably not well understood, Ph.D. chemists, veterinarians, et cetera. So we have a great nucleus of people to build upon. And because it's asset-light, because you know we're a cash-driven company, it has all the characteristics we want to grow over time. And the big macro is you've got 7 billion people today, going to 9 billion in 2050. So it's a long answer, but it probably deserves a long answer considering the fact that it influenced the numbers this quarter. Now looking ahead to '17. The good news is the milk prices are forecasted to start recovering next year. So it's not going to be as bad next year as this year. So we would expect some growth out of this Specialty Products business in '17, but it's certainly a legitimate question, Kevin."

The Personal Care number was a little bit weak in third quarter. I don't know if there's an expectation that persists. And then what exactly is driving that dynamic? Is there more couponing and heavier trade spend, given what's going on in laundry right now, where that's ramped? So just if you could help sort of -- help me understand a bit what's driving the 2-year average sort of slowdown into the fourth quarter as well."

That was largely a Q3 event, but we do have a little bit in Q4. And in general, Q4 going to 2.5% organic is predominantly a volume-driven result. And there's a little bit of price mix in there too. But personal care growth, which was a little bit negative in Q3, is expected to recover and be slightly positive in Q4 as well. So I hope that helps. It's a little bit more color."

And that's why we would have the confidence to say, hey, we're going to hit our Evergreen model again in 2017. Your larger question might be about the economy. And of course, we see everything that you see, right? Unemployment is pretty steady, but GDP is only 1.5%. And gasoline price is creeping up. Health care costs are noticeably increasing for consumers. And the median household income around $51,000. So that is the consumer. So obviously, that's hitting the consumer in the pocketbook. So it's -- I wouldn't say it's the best outlook for the consumer. But from our point of view, we think that we have so many different ways to win here. And we have -- we get 10 brands. We've got a great international business. And Specialty Products has its ups and downs, but that'll be back next year. So it's going to have a 12-cylinder engine.

And then we give ourselves a report card and let our analysts and investors know as well. So the 4 that were up were Batiste, VMS, OxiClean and Nair. So you'd say, okay, what are the other 6? So one was flat, and that was ARM & HAMMER. So we had growth in laundry, but that was offset by litter. So if you said, where -- is there one that you would expect to improve next year? Yes, it would be ARM & HAMMER. So that 4 would become 5. So then you say, what are the other ones? The other ones would be TROJAN. And yes -- so in TROJAN, we had lost some share in measured channels, but we have strong growth in untracked channels and that will continue to be probably a bigger part of the discussion, measuring brand growth in measured channels versus all-in, which is harder to get your arms around. XTRA is certainly one that we've been suffering because of deep competitive discounting. So it's been more or less in the sidelines there. So that one, we expect to turn around, and obviously, it's pretty obvious what that's going to take. Orajel, there's been some pressure from private label, but we have an improved product offering that's coming out in Q4 to distinguish ourselves again further from private label. So we hope that's going to have a positive impact. First Response, the issue there is we have some retailers experimenting with the split between branded and private label. And SPINBRUSH, last quarter, adult grew 10% and kids were soft. This quarter, it's the reverse. Kids was way up and adult was soft. But the business grew, just not at the same pace as the category. So it's a mixed bag. If you said, what would be a good score? Every quarter would be -- we'd say 6. If you could get 6 out of 10 every quarter, that would be fantastic. And I think stellar would be 7 to 8. But 9 to 10 is aspirational, Caroline."

And the good news for us is that the category is growing rapidly. And our share keeps expanding. So our share expanded from Q2 to Q3 in a category that's growing rapidly. And what we have going for us is that Batiste is a European brand, number one. And number two, its efficacy is far better than anything else that's on the market. So it's really product performance is what's winning. So people who have not used our product and then switch to Batiste, they don't go back. So it's -- we're not concerned about other entrants. There are a lot of people in there already, right? Not Your Mother's, TRESemmé, et cetera. So there's plenty of big dogs in the category. So we certainly like our chances.
