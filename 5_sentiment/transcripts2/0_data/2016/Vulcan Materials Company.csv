Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials Company. 
Joining me today for this call are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO; and John McPherson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer. 
To facilitate our discussion today, we have made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental information. Rather than walk through each slide as we've done in past calls, Tom and John will summarize the highlights of our fourth quarter results and outlook for 2016. We believe this approach will assist your analysis and will allow more time to respond to your questions. 
With that said, please be reminded that comments regarding the company's results and projections may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, including general economic and business conditions, the timing and amount of federal state and local funding for infrastructure and the highly competitive nature of the construction materials industry. These and other risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the company's SEC reports, including our earnings release and our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
In addition, during this call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure and other related information in our earnings release and at the end of the supplemental presentation. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Vulcan's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Hill. Tom?"

I hope you've had time to review our earnings release and the supplemental information posted earlier today on our website. 
As Mark mentioned, John and I will summarize the highlights of our fourth quarter results and the outlook for 2016. Then we'll be happy to take your questions. 
We remain highly focused on the fundamentals of our business at Vulcan, on the clear opportunities in front of us. Regardless of recent concerns that have swept through global securities markets, we are focused on the things that we control and on our improving profitability. 
We've made a lot of progress over the last year, and we have a good report for you today. 
Aggregates volumes are up nicely, pricing is positive, our gross profit per ton numbers continue to be really impressive. We are controlling our cost. 
But first, I'd like to start the conversation by making 3 basic points. Number one, we finished the year strong. Our teams company-wide are executing our Aggregate focus strategy extremely well. 
Second, I assure you that we will sustain this focus into 2016. We believe these efforts will result in more than $1 billion in adjusted EBITDA this year. 
Circumstances obviously vary across our geographic footprint, but the gradual recovery and demand continues in each of our end use segments. 
Third, our performance throughout 2015 as we continued to move through the early stages of construction recovery demonstrated clear and steady progress towards the longer-range goals and the expectations we put forth at our Investor Day last year. With very few exceptions, construction activity and the markets we serve still remains well below long-term trends. However, we're positioned for multiple years of double-digit revenue growth, with strong conversion of those incremental sales to gross profit. 
Now I'd like to go a little deeper into our fourth quarter and full year results. John will then hit the highlights of our 2016 outlook, and I'll conclude with some observations about our path forward. 
Let me say upfront, I'm pleased with how we finished 2015. Our mindset at Vulcan is that we can always improve, and we work hard on getting better all the time in every aspect of the business. 
Shipments were strong in the fourth quarter, whenever and wherever the weather cooperate. As we noted in our third quarter call, many of our customers have seen their backlogs grow as demand continues to pick up and as they face capacity constraints. 
We saw higher levels of shipments on weekends and many of our customers were beginning to keep their crews on as long as the weather allow. Those trends held up through the fourth quarter. 
Firming demand and recently dry weather in California and Florida contributed to year-over-year shipment growth, exceeding 15% in those states. Shipments in Georgia grew by 22% despite wet weather. On the other hand, shipments increased in the low single digits in Texas. This was due to extremely wet weather in October, November.  The underlying shipment trends in each of these states continue to be good. 
In total, same-store shipments for the quarter were up more than 8% in our Aggregates segment, 4% in our Asphalt segment and 2% in our Concrete segment. 
For the year, we shipped 178 million tons of aggregates. This is slightly above our mid-year forecast of 177 million tons, and an increase of about 10% over 2014 shipments. All in all, this was a very solid year of volume growth. 
Remember, this is from an asset base that has delivered aggregate shipments of approximately 300 million tons. As we talked about before, we are still early in the recovery towards 255 million tons, which we believe represents a more normal, mid-cycle level of shipments. 
We have a broad base of demand, both in terms of geography and end use markets. We see each of our end use markets continuing to grow. 
Some of our Texas markets are of the upper end of the spectrum of normalized demand, having absorbed extremely strong growth. Most of our markets, however, are still well below normal demand and should enjoy steady growth for years to come.  We are seeing good growth on both coasts with still lot of upside. 
Other individual markets in the Central United States such as Nashville, Knoxville and Chattanooga are also continued to strengthen. When you put it all together, the longer-term shipment trends we focus on continue to look good across most of our markets. 
Regarding pricing. We continue to experience a positive pricing environment in most of our markets. This is a result of 3 factors. First, we've invested substantial capital in the business to serve our customers and need to earn a fair return. Second, we continue to see increasing customer confidence in the recovery. And third, the construction industry is increasingly focused on improving returns on capital as volumes remain well below normal levels. 
Overall, free adjusted average sales price for Aggregates increased 11% on same-store basis, or $1.18 per ton compared to the prior year's fourth quarter. 
In the quarter, we estimate $0.15 per ton helped from product and geographic mix.  For the full year, average selling prices increased 7%. 
Now I'd like to take -- make a few remarks regarding our customer service and cost control efforts. Throughout the quarter, our teams did an excellent job meeting our customers' needs, including tight deadlines and complex demands on big projects, both safely and efficiently. 
During the quarter, we saw improvement in repair maintenance costs and overtime labor costs. This improvement contributed to our strong finish for the year. Cost during the first 3 quarters of 2015 have begun to rise as increasing volumes required us to run our plants longer. This led to more repairs and higher spending on parts and supplies and associated labor. 
Now as said in our last call, we are very focused on improving these costs, and we're beginning to see these improvements in September. The improvements continued, and I'm proud of our operating people for the work they have done here. We remain intensely focused on managing these costs efficiently, balancing the factors affecting production quality, service and cost. 
Still, a clear picture comes with a longer term view.  For the year, our unit cost of sales in aggregates declined slightly as our employees remain focused on continuous improvement. We get better at controlling costs as the year progressed. 
We also saw reduced expenditures as diesel cost declined. Setting aside external forces, our strong emphasis on cost control, near-term and longer term, will not change. 
Overall, I'm pleased with the progress we've made with our execution and our focus. We continue to focus on customer service, employee development, cost control and our safety performance. We saw marked improvement in our safety performance in the fourth quarter. 
Let me emphasize, this is a continuous improvement track, a process of working to get better every day. We have made good progress, but there's still more to be done. 
A strong example of the progress we have made is the outstanding job our teams did converting incremental revenue into incremental gross profit. Flow through in the quarter was 89% on a same-store basis, obviously, strong results. But better to look at it on a trailing 12-month basis where it was 77%, well ahead of the 60% threshold we target longer term. 
Our unit profitability in aggregates continues to improve, something our employees work hard on and can be very proud of. 
Gross profit margin on a same-store basis increased 38% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year's quarter. Unit gross profit margin was $5.38 per ton. This marks 12 consecutive quarters of expanding unit margin. 
We will continue this trend. On a trailing 12-month basis, unit margin increased by 29% to $4.38 per ton. Now there's a slide you've seen before, Slide #11 that covers this, and I'd like to call your attention to it because it's impressive. 
Here, you will see that for the trailing 12 months, we shipped 178 million tons, 38 million tons more than the year prior to the start of the recovery. Aggregates segment gross profit for the year was $756 million or $398 million, ahead of the 12 months before the recovery began. 
So on 38 million tons of improvement, we've delivered almost $400 million in incremental segment gross profit. Gross profit per ton has increased $1.69 or 66% during this period. A 27% increase in shipments has been inverted into an increase in gross profit in excess of 100%. 
Looking at 2015 as a whole, you can clearly see the benefits of our aggregate focused strategy. We have the assets and capabilities in place to service our customers. We have the focus execution to drive profitability, and we have a very strong platform for continuing growth. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to John for additional comments on our earnings performance and outlook for the remainder of the year. John?"

So Tom just highlighted, and as you've seen in our release, we had a strong finish to a strong year, a year with same-store Aggregate shipments up 7%, Aggregates' pricing up 7%, strong conversion of that incremental revenue and to incremental gross profit, improved material margins in our Asphalt and Concrete businesses and continued leveraging of SAG to revenues.  We expect to see much of the same in 2016. Another year of continuous compounding improvement in our execution and in our results. 
To complement the information shared in our release, I'll first offer a few comments regarding the demand environment, then outline our performance expectations for the year and briefly note our plans for capital allocation. 
As Tom said, we see a broadening recovery and demand across each of our end-use segments and across most of our geographic footprint. In total, we see demand across the markets we serve growing approximately 7% with some upside potential based on the rate at which rising DOT budgets and public infrastructure funding convert into active construction projects and material shipments. 
We project private demand in the markets we serve to grow approximately 10% year-over-year, supported by growth in both residential and nonresidential activity. We see continued double-digit growth in residential construction across our footprint with nonresidential construction continuing to expand, albeit at a slower pace than 2015. 
Although certain measures of private nonresidential construction suggested some decline in the second half of the year, our on the ground view indicates continued solid growth.  And importantly, employment data and other macroeconomic and demographic factors further signal a sustained recovery in private demand across our markets. 
Much has been made about the potential impact of lower oil prices, and we continue to monitor trends in private construction activity in markets such as Houston. But to-date, we have not seen a materially negative impact when looking at our portfolio as a whole. 
I'll now turn to public demand, where we see 2016 being something of a transition year and in a positive way. 
Across our markets, we expect demand growth tied to public construction of approximately 5%. Longer-term visibility with respect to public demand has improved markedly with the passage of the federal highway bill, state-level funding initiatives and record levels of local tax receipts. 
In addition, the public construction share of tax receipts remains at 20-year lows and at ultimately unsustainable levels. 
This shift to higher levels of total public funding combined with greater visibility, should allow for a higher percentage of new construction in the mix, which bodes well for our materials demand and in our case, product balance. All of this is good. But at this point, we don't see the full benefit of these trends impacting our volumes until 2017 and beyond. 
We will monitor the lag between DOT budgets rising and commensurate increase in project activity throughout the year. But to be clear, rising public construction activity is beginning to kick in with the question being at what pace. 
Finally, we continue to see the overall rate of recovery in many markets constrained by construction labor shortages and other bottlenecks in the total construction supply chain. Although the situation can inhibit the overall rate of shipment growth in the near-term and lengthen the time required to return to normalized levels, it does provide further support for disciplined increases in pricing, margins and ultimately, returns on capital. 
So against this backdrop of approximately 7% total demand growth in 2016, what do we expect to deliver in terms of financial results? 
As we stated, our 2016 guidance is for between $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion in adjusted EBITDA and approximately 25% increase over 2015. 
We don't give quarterly guidance, as you know, and we encourage investors to consider longer-term trends in addition to quarter-to-quarter results. 
I'll now comment on certain of the factors and assumptions underpinning our annual guidance. You should consider these figures to be at midpoints of current management expectations and keep in mind that our results vary widely across the individual markets we serve. 
Starting with aggregate shipments. We're projecting a total of 191 million tons or an increase of 7% over the prior year. 
On a geographic basis, we expect the growth in 2016 to be relatively widespread, with higher rates in markets such as Arizona, Florida, Georgia and Southern California, offsetting lower-than-average rates in markets such as Texas, where we see continued growth but at a slower rate than a company as a whole and Illinois, where we project a small decline in year-over-year shipments. 
And as with 2015, we may see a greater share of shipments occur in the second half of the year, in part due to the impact of El Niño weather on our used Western states and in part due to the expected flow of large project activity throughout the year. 
Again, as Tom noted, the overall pricing climate for our materials remain as positive and constructive. We're entering the year with good momentum, and we currently expect freight adjusted average selling prices for Aggregates to increase 7% in 2016, in line with the increase seen in 2015. 
Please keep in mind that pricing decisions in our business are made locally with wide variances by product type and geography. Our local teams will continue to balance pricing, customer service, operating efficiencies and the overall sales and production mix, all with an eye toward improving total units margins and earning a fair return on capital employed. 
These shipment and pricing expectations, of course, are just mid-double-digit growth and freight-adjusted revenues for the Aggregates segment. We expect to continue converting these incremental revenues, into incremental gross profit at a 60% or higher rate. 
Consistent with this view, we expect gross profit in the segment to increase by approximately 25% year-over-year, and we expect to realize continued improvements in our per ton margins. 
We also expect to see continued profit improvement in our Asphalt and Concrete segments, following on the strong gains posted in 2015. We currently project gross profit for these segments combined to increase approximately 20% in 2016. These operations are well positioned the benefit from the continued recovery and demand due to improvements to our asset portfolio as well as our internal operating efficiencies. 
Our current forecast for SAG is $295 million, approximately 3% growth over 2016. We plan to continue to leverage SAG to sales even as we make important investments in our sales and customer service capabilities.  Administrative headcount should remain essentially flat year-over-year. 
So to recap, we expect to see in 2016 much the same of which you've seen in a very positive 2015. As well as through the entire early-stage of the recovery so far. Our people at all levels of the organization are focused on helping our customers grow, controlling what they can control and driving continuously improved results for our shareholders and other stakeholders. 
Now, I'll conclude with some brief remarks regarding capital allocation. Our aggregate-centric strategy and the way we manage it day by day is geared toward generating significant amounts of free cash flow even in periods of depressed demand. That's by design, as you'd expect, and we gave it a great deal of focus. 
Our priorities for allocating net cash flow and managing the inherent cyclicality of our business have not changed from those we've outlined at different times over the course of the last year or so. 
In short, we intend to balance 3 objectives: Reinvesting in the business for productivity and growth; maintaining adequate financial strength and flexibility; and a disciplined return of capital to shareholders. 
With respect to reinvestment, I'll note that we plan to allocate approximately $275 million of cash this year to what we call core CapEx. That is reinvestment to sustain and improve the performance and productivity of our current operations. 
In addition, we expect to invest a meaningful amount in growth, whether in the form of acquisitions or the internal development of new production and distribution capacity. 
With respect to financial strength and flexibility, I'll note that our debt-to-EBITDA ratio has lowered to 2.4x. Refinancing activities during 2015 extended our debt durations while lowering of weighed  average interest rate. 
We do not expect to use cash in the near term to lower our total debt of approximately $2 billion. Rather, we have the financing capacity and the liquidity needed to fund smart reinvestments and growth such as those I just mentioned. And we intend to maintain that flexibility throughout the cycle. 
And finally, we expect the amount of capital returned to shareholders to increase as the recovery moves forward. 
As noted previously, we expect the dividend to grow roughly in line with earnings during the recovery phase of the cycle. We also expect to use opportunistic share repurchase to return additional capital over time. 
And with that, I'll hand the call back to Tom."

You've heard me talk about the strong year we had and the things we consistently focus on to deliver superior results. Ours is a long-term business. We set long-range goals and work hard to get where we think we can be given our world-class assets and people. 
We are pleased with our 2015 results and the way we are positioned for future success. We've made clear progress towards the goals that we set forth in our Investor Day last February and are very much on track. 
We're on track to achieve $2 billion in EBITDA at normal levels of demand. We're on track moving steadily towards a normalized demand level of 255 million tons per year for Vulcan aggregates. We're on track for continuing gradual recovery in each major end market and in most of our geographies. We now have a fully funded long-term highway bill, and we are very pleased to see healthy increase is in state and local funding for highways and other public construction.  
We continue to anticipate Aggregates segment cash gross profit at normal demand in the range of $8.25 per ton. This will be the result of solid sales execution, continued growth weighted towards our more profitable geographies, pricing fundamentals that continue to strengthen and consistently strong incremental margins. 
At normal demand levels, we also see greater profitability in our non-Aggregates segment in the range of $175 million. Here, we benefit from continuing operating discipline and improvements, the strength in portfolio that came with our asset swap in early 2015 and improving materials margins. 
We also remain on track with SAG costs, moving towards 6% as a percent of sales. SAG as a percent of revenue declined 70 basis points in 2015. We intend to further leverage SAG to sales growth. 
As we look forward, we believe that we are well-positioned for several years of double-digit top line growth with strong conversion to the bottom line. 
No matter how you look at this, I'm pleased to tell you that we are executing well, and that is the watchword of our people: Execute, execute, execute. Control your own destiny and finish strong. I'm very proud of our people and the good work they are doing. I can promise you that we are all committed to making a good company better every day. We are excited about where we are today, and we're even more excited about where this company is going.

A couple of things we think about as we look at next year. One is that we expect to have higher stripping costs as we prepare for future growth. And those are items that are expensed in the current year, but they really prepare us for growth over multiple years. Sets a bit of a factor we're considering in our '16 outlook, and we're also keeping an eye on what happens with diesel prices throughout the year.

Keep in mind, that our Asphalt business overtime is really well exposed, if you will, to increases in public funding across many states. And so, while the short-term margin structure perhaps can fluctuate long term, the returns on capital can be very stable and very attractive. Again, tied to public funding, a little bit more unbalanced. To your point on Aggregate margins per ton, first, I'll draw your attention to the longer term, just kind of how we think about the business. As you heard Tom say, we think we're very much on track with the longer term outlook we put out at our Investor Day a year ago, which would imply on a cash basis per ton margin North of $8. And if you look and see what's happening at pricing, if you look and see what's happening in our operating leverage, if you look at our results so far to the recovery, we're at least on track with that long-term goal. And that's -- I want to dry attention to that because that's really how we think about it. In the shorter-term for '16, we continue to expect margins per ton to increase faster than the rate of pricing. So the year-over-year increase might be around 20% roughly, maybe slightly below that. And again, that ties back to a flow through that is above the long-term 60% threshold but a little bit below last year. So we think it's a reasonable expectation, something we're confident our teams can do it right."

Construction activity has a long way to recover. It's not even driven by new economic growth. And at the levels we're talking about, we still have multiple years before we get back to 45-year trends of normal consumption. Mid- to high single digits shipment growth, mid- to high-single-digit revenue growth, if I can do that math correctly, is more than double-digit revenue growth. And that's where the continue steady rate of gradual recovery. Is it going to be a perfect straight line? Absolutely quarter-to-quarter, of course, not history hasn't worked that way.

But unlike previous quarters, we did a better job of managing our per ton expenses of R&M and some other costs. And so on balance, we had a decline in cost of sales for the quarter, and I think you saw that. For the year, we had a slight decline in total cost of sales and that was really diesel benefits offsetting some rising per ton cost that we commented on throughout the year in terms of R&M process applies associated labor, et cetera, as well as some overtime laborers that ramped up production. We're really pleased with the execution we had in the fourth quarter. We're not taking for granted that all those issues are behind us, we're still ramping up production, and we're still well below what you would normally think of as the sweet spot of our production levels in many of our plants.

So my comments on SAG, which is probably a number I'd like to be 0 as a CFO, but our comments on SAG would be that administrative headcount year-on-year remain essentially flat, so that the core wage element of our SAG was well in control. The variances were driven by fringes, which is pension, payroll, taxes, some deferred comp calculations, those kinds of things, which we frankly didn't forecast as well as I would like to at the beginning of the year. Some of those were driven a little bit higher with our rising stock price. We also had higher outside services fees and professional fees. Those are legal and tax and a couple other items associated with some changes we're making some investments we're making the sales side of our business. And then finally, our sales headcount was modestly higher in the year and our SAG associated with that as we continue to invest in growth for the future. So again, I think the execution was solid. We like to see that number grow at more like 3% than what we saw in the past year. We'll work to control it, and we'll certainly continue to leverage the sales."

Does that mean that you sufficiently kind of stepped up some of these plans that have been meeting or borderline needing a second shot or what have you to the point where now it should be smoother sailing heading into 2016?"

But it's really what we really focus on, while we do that and do that appropriately what we really focus on is doing proper preventative maintenance and timing and fixing things to write with the first time so you're not throwing good money after bad. When it comes to whether it's labor or uses of diesel or cost in general, I think it's that continuous focus on operating efficiencies. You heard us talk about struggle with labor, we defy our folks to find it and actually in the back third of the year, it wasn't a just last quarter, it was September 4, they made significant improvements on their efficiencies and labor and in planning. And again, so you're correct about shifts where you're bringing things up, and you're running multiple crews between even more plants. Labor can be a challenge without appropriate planning. I'm very pleased with operating people that they've never being satisfied, they're campaigning for continuous improvement and they focus and work on every day and I give them credit, they're never satisfied, and they worked tirelessly on it. But all of this is about compounding that continues improvement to give us the margin expansion that we've enjoyed over the last 10 quarters. And that speaks to that never being satisfied and that continuous campaign to improve and improve operating efficiencies."

To facilitate our discussion today, we have made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental information. Rather than walk through each slide as we've done in past calls, Tom and John will summarize the highlights of our fourth quarter results and outlook for 2016. We believe this approach will assist your analysis and will allow more time to respond to your questions. 
With that said, please be reminded that comments regarding the company's results and projections may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, including general economic and business conditions, the timing and amount of federal, state and local funding for infrastructure and the highly competitive nature of the construction materials industry. These and other risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the company's SEC reports, including our earnings release and our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. 
In addition, during this call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure and other related information in our earnings release and at the end of the supplemental presentation.

I hope you've had time to review our earnings release and the supplemental information posted earlier today on our website. 
As Mark mentioned, John and I will summarize the highlights of our fourth quarter results and the outlook for 2016, then we'll be happy to take your questions. 
We remain highly focused on the fundamentals of our business at Vulcan, on the clear opportunities in front of us. Regardless of recent concerns that have swept through global securities markets, we are focused on the things that we control and on our improving profitability. 
We've made a lot of progress over the last year, and we have a good report for you today. 
Aggregates volumes are up nicely. Pricing is positive. Our gross profit per ton numbers continue to be really impressive. We are controlling our cost. 
But first, I'd like to start the conversation by making 3 basic points. Number one, we finished the year strong. Our teams company-wide are executing our aggregate-focused strategy extremely well. 
Second, I assure you that we will sustain this focus into 2016. We believe these efforts will result in more than $1 billion in adjusted EBITDA this year. 
Circumstances obviously vary across our geographic footprint, but the gradual recovery and demand continues in each of our end-use segments. 
Third, our performance throughout 2015, as we continue to move through the early stages of construction recovery, demonstrated clear and steady progress towards the longer-range goals and the expectations we put forth at our Investor Day last year. With very few exceptions, construction activity in the markets we serve still remains well below long-term trends. However, we're positioned for multiple years of double-digit revenue growth, with strong conversion of those incremental sales to gross profit. 
Now I'd like to go a little deeper into our fourth quarter and full year results. John will then hit the highlights of our 2016 outlook, and I'll conclude with some observations about our path forward. 
Let me say upfront, I'm pleased with how we finished 2015. Our mindset at Vulcan is that we can always improve, and we work hard on getting better all the time in every aspect of the business. 
Shipments were strong in the fourth quarter, whenever and wherever the weather cooperated. As we noted in our third quarter call, many of our customers have seen their backlogs grow as demand continues to pick up and as they face capacity constraints. 
We saw higher levels of shipments on weekends, and many of our customers were beginning to keep their crews on as long as the weather allowed. Those trends held up through the fourth quarter. 
Firming demand and reasonably dry weather in California and Florida contributed to year-over-year shipment growth, exceeding 15% in those states. Shipments in Georgia grew by 22% despite wet weather. On the other hand, shipments increased in the low single digits in Texas. This was due to extremely wet weather in October and November.  The underlying shipment trends in each of these states continue to be good. 
In total, same-store shipments for the quarter were up more than 8% in our Aggregates segment, 4% in our Asphalt segment and 2% in our Concrete segment. 
For the year, we shipped 178 million tons of aggregates. This is slightly above our midyear forecast of 177 million tons and an increase of about 10% over 2014 shipments. All in all, this was a very solid year of volume growth. 
Remember, this is from an asset base that has delivered aggregate shipments of approximately 300 million tons. As we talked about before, we are still early in the recovery towards 255 million tons, which we believe represents a more normal, mid-cycle level of shipments. 
We have a broad base of demand, both in terms of geography and end-use markets. We see each of our end-use markets continuing to grow. 
Some of our Texas markets are of the upper end of the spectrum of normalized demand, having enjoyed extremely strong growth. Most of our markets, however, are still well below normal demand and should enjoy steady growth for years to come. We are seeing good growth on both coasts with still a lot of upside. 
Other individual markets in the Central United States such as Nashville, Knoxville and Chattanooga are also continuing to strengthen. When you put it all together, the longer-term shipment trends we focus on continue to look good across most of our markets. 
Regarding pricing, we continue to experience a positive pricing environment in most of our markets. This is a result of 3 factors. First, we've invested substantial capital in the business to serve our customers and need to earn a fair return. Second, we continue to see increasing customer confidence in the recovery. And third, the construction industry is increasingly focused on improving returns on capital as volumes remain well below normal levels. 
Overall, freight-adjusted average sales price for aggregates increased 11% on a same-store basis or $1.18 per ton compared to the prior year's fourth quarter. 
In the quarter, we estimate $0.15 per ton helped from product and geographic mix.  For the full year, average selling prices increased 7%. 
Now I'd like to take a -- make a few remarks regarding our customer service and cost control efforts. Throughout the quarter, our teams did an excellent job meeting our customers' needs, including tight deadlines and complex demands on big projects, both safely and efficiently. 
During the quarter, we saw improvement in repair and maintenance costs and overtime labor costs. This improvement contributed to our strong finish for the year. Costs during the first 3 quarters of 2015 have begun to rise as increasing volumes required us to run our plants longer. This led to more repairs and higher spending on parts and supplies and associated labor. 
Now I said on our last call we are very focused on improving these costs, and we're beginning to see these improvements in September. The improvements continued, and I'm proud of our operating people for the work they have done here. We remain intensely focused on managing these costs efficiently, balancing the factors affecting production quality, service and cost.
Still, a clear picture comes with a longer-term view. For the year, our unit cost of sales in aggregates declined slightly as our employees remain focused on continuous improvement. We got better at controlling costs as the year progressed.
We also saw reduced expenditures as diesel cost declined. Setting aside external forces, our strong emphasis on cost control, near term and longer term, will not change. 
Overall, I'm pleased with the progress we've made with our execution and our focus. We continue to focus on customer service, employee development, cost control and our safety performance. We saw marked improvement in our safety performance in the fourth quarter. 
Let me emphasize, this is a continuous improvement track, a process of working to get better every day. We have made good progress, but there's still more to be done. 
A strong example of the progress we have made is the outstanding job our teams did converting incremental revenue into incremental gross profit. Flow-through in the quarter was 89% on a same-store basis, obviously, strong result. But better look at it on a trailing 12-month basis where it was 77%, well ahead of the 60% threshold we target longer term. 
Our unit profitability in aggregates continues to improve, something our employees work hard on and can be very proud of. 
Gross profit margin on a same-store basis increased 38% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year's quarter. Unit gross profit margin was $5.38 per ton. This marks 12 consecutive quarters of expanding unit margin. 
We will continue this trend. On a trailing 12-month basis, unit margin increased by 29% to $4.38 per ton. Now there's a slide you've seen before, Slide #11, that covers this, and I'd like to call your attention to it because it's impressive. 
Here, you will see that for the trailing 12 months, we shipped 178 million tons, 38 million tons more than the year prior to the start of the recovery. Aggregates segment gross profit for the year was $756 million or $398 million, ahead of the 12 months before the recovery began. 
So on 38 million tons of improvement, we have delivered almost $400 million in incremental segment gross profit. Gross profit per ton has increased $1.69 or 66% during this period. A 27% increase in shipments has been converted into an increase in gross profit in excess of 100%. 
Looking at 2015 as a whole, you can clearly see the benefits of our aggregate-focused strategy. We have the assets and capabilities in place to service our customers. We have the focused execution to drive profitability, and we have a very strong platform for continuing growth. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to John for additional comments on our earnings performance and outlook for the remainder of the year. John?"

So Tom just highlighted, and as you've seen in our release, we had a strong finish to a strong year, a year with same-store aggregate shipments up 7%; aggregates pricing up 7%; strong conversion of that incremental revenue into incremental gross profit; improved material margins in our Asphalt and Concrete businesses and continued leveraging of SAG to revenues.  We expect to see much of the same in 2016, another year of continuous compounding improvement in our execution and in our results. 
To complement the information shared in our release, I'll first offer a few comments regarding the demand environment, then outline our performance expectations for the year and briefly note our plans for capital allocation. 
As Tom said, we see a broadening recovery and demand across each of our end-use segments and across most of our geographic footprint. In total, we see demand across the markets we serve growing approximately 7% with some upside potential based on the rate at which rising DOT budgets and public infrastructure funding converts into active construction projects and material shipments. 
We project private demand in the markets we serve to grow approximately 10% year-over-year, supported by growth in both residential and nonresidential activity. We see continued double-digit growth in residential construction across our footprint with nonresidential construction continuing to expand, albeit at a slower pace than 2015. 
Although certain measures of private nonresidential construction suggested some decline in the second half of the year, our on-the-ground view indicates continued solid growth.  And importantly, employment data and other macroeconomic and demographic factors further signal a sustained recovery in private demand across our markets. 
Much has been made about the potential impact of lower oil prices, and we continue to monitor trends in private construction activity in markets such as Houston. But to date, we have not seen a materially negative impact when looking at our portfolio as a whole. 
I'll now turn to public demand, where we see 2016 being something of a transition year and in a positive way. 
Across our markets, we expect demand growth tied to public construction of approximately 5%. Longer-term visibility with respect to public demand has improved markedly with the passage of the federal highway bill, state-level funding initiatives and record levels of local tax receipts. 
In addition, the public construction share of tax receipts remains at 20-year lows and at ultimately unsustainable levels. 
This shift to higher levels of total public funding, combined with greater visibility, should allow for a higher percentage of new construction in the mix, which bodes well for our materials demand and, in our case, product balance. All of this is good. But at this point, we don't see the full benefit of these trends impacting our volumes until 2017 and beyond. 
We will monitor the lag between DOT budgets rising and a commensurate increase in project activity throughout the year. But to be clear, rising public construction activity is beginning to kick in with the question being at what pace. 
Finally, we continue to see the overall rate of recovery in many markets constrained by construction labor shortages and other bottlenecks in the total construction supply chain. Although the situation can inhibit the overall rate of shipment growth in the near term and lengthen the time required to return to normalized levels, it does provide further support for disciplined increases in pricing, margins, and ultimately, returns on capital. 
So against this backdrop of approximately 7% total demand growth in 2016, what do we expect to deliver in terms of financial results? As we have stated, our 2016 guidance is for between $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion in adjusted EBITDA and approximately 25% increase over 2015. 
We don't give quarterly guidance, as you know, and we encourage investors to consider longer-term trends, in addition to quarter-to-quarter results. 
I will now comment on certain of the factors and assumptions underpinning our annual guidance. You should consider these figures to be midpoints of current management expectations and keep in mind that our results vary widely across the individual markets we serve. 
Starting with aggregate shipments, we're projecting a total of 191 million tons or an increase of 7% over the prior year. 
On a geographic basis, we expect the growth in 2016 to be relatively widespread, with higher rates in markets such as Arizona, Florida, Georgia and Southern California offsetting lower-than-average rates in markets such as Texas, where we see continued growth but at a slower rate than the company as a whole, and Illinois, where we project a small decline in year-over-year shipments. 
And as with 2015, we may see a greater share of shipments occur in the second half of the year, in part due to the impact of El Niño weather on our Western states and in part due to the expected flow of large project activity throughout the year. 
Again, as Tom noted, the overall pricing climate for our materials remains positive and constructive. We're entering the year with good momentum, and we currently expect freight-adjusted average selling prices for aggregates to increase 7% in 2016, in line with the increase seen in 2015. 
Please keep in mind that pricing decisions in our business are made locally with wide variances by product type and geography. Our local teams will continue to balance pricing, customer service, operating efficiencies and the overall sales and production mix, all with an eye toward improving total unit margins and earning a fair return on capital employed. 
These shipment and pricing expectations, of course, suggest mid-double-digit growth in freight-adjusted revenues for the Aggregates segment. We expect to continue converting these incremental revenues into incremental gross profit at a 60% or higher rate. 
Consistent with this view, we expect gross profit in the segment to increase by approximately 25% year-over-year, and we expect to realize continued improvements in our per ton margins. 
We also expect to see continued profit improvement in our Asphalt and Concrete segments, following on the strong gains posted in 2015. We currently project gross profit for these segments combined to increase approximately 20% in 2016. These operations are well positioned to benefit from the continued recovery in demand due to improvements to our asset portfolio as well as our internal operating efficiencies. 
Our current forecast for SAG is $295 million, approximately 3% growth over 2016. We plan to continue to leverage SAG to sales even as we make important investments in our sales and customer service capabilities.  Administrative headcount should remain essentially flat year-over-year. 
So to recap, we expect to see in 2016 much the same of which you've seen in a very positive 2015 as well as through the entire early stage of the recovery so far. Our people at all levels of the organization are focused on helping our customers grow, controlling what they can control and driving continuously improved results for our shareholders and other stakeholders. 
Now I'll conclude with some brief remarks regarding capital allocation. Our aggregate-centric strategy and the way we manage it day by day is geared toward generating significant amounts of free cash flow, even in periods of depressed demand. That's by design, as you'd expect, and we gave it a great deal of focus. 
Our priorities for allocating net cash flow and managing the inherent cyclicality of our business have not changed from those we've outlined at different times over the course of the last year or so. 
In short, we intend to balance 3 objectives: reinvesting in the business for productivity and growth; maintaining adequate financial strength and flexibility; and a disciplined return of capital to shareholders. 
With respect to reinvestment, I'll note that we plan to allocate approximately $275 million of cash this year to what we call core CapEx. That is reinvestment to sustain and improve the performance and productivity of our current operations. 
In addition, we expect to invest a meaningful amount in growth, whether in the form of acquisitions or the internal development of new production and distribution capacity. 
With respect to financial strength and flexibility, I'll note that our debt-to-EBITDA ratio has lowered to 2.4x. Refinancing activities during 2015 extended our debt durations while lowering of weighed  average interest rate. 
We do not expect to use cash in the near term to lower our total debt of approximately $2 billion. Rather, we have the financing capacity and the liquidity needed to fund smart reinvestments and growth such as those I just mentioned. And we intend to maintain that flexibility throughout the cycle. 
And finally, we expect the amount of capital returned to shareholders to increase as the recovery moves forward. 
As noted previously, we expect the dividend to grow roughly in line with earnings during the recovery phase of the cycle. We also expect to use opportunistic share repurchase to return additional capital over time. 
And with that, I'll hand the call back to Tom."

You've heard me talk about the strong year we had and the things we consistently focus on to deliver superior results. Ours is a long-term business. We set long-range goals and work hard to get where we think we can be, given our world-class assets and people. 
We are pleased with our 2015 results and the way we are positioned for future success. We've made clear progress towards the goals that we set forth in our Investor Day last February and are very much on track. 
We're on track to achieve $2 billion in EBITDA at normal levels of demand. We're on track moving steadily towards a normalized demand level of 255 million tons per year for Vulcan aggregates. We're on track for continuing gradual recovery in each major end market and in most of our geographies. We now have a fully funded long-term highway bill, and we are very pleased to see healthy increases in state and local funding for highways and other public construction.  
We continue to anticipate Aggregates segment cash gross profit at normal demand in the range of $8.25 per ton. This will be the result of solid sales execution, continued growth weighted towards our more profitable geographies, pricing fundamentals that continue to strengthen and consistently strong incremental margins. 
At normal demand levels, we also see greater profitability in our non-Aggregates segment in the range of $175 million. Here, we benefit from continuing operating discipline and improvements, the strength in portfolio that came with our asset swap in early 2015 and improving materials margins. 
We also remain on track with SAG costs, moving towards 6% as a percent of sales. SAG as a percent of revenue declined 70 basis points in 2015. We intend to further leverage SAG to sales growth. 
As we look forward, we believe that we are well positioned for several years of double-digit top line growth with strong conversion to the bottom line. 
No matter how you look at this, I'm pleased to tell you that we are executing well, and that is the watchword of our people: execute, execute, execute. Control your own destiny and finish strong. I am very proud of our people and the good work they are doing. I can promise you that we are all committed to making a good company better every day. We are excited about where we are today, and we're even more excited about where this company is going.

So if there may be a little bit, but probably not a lot of deferred work from '15 into '16. Your second question was about Texas. And I think that how we look at Texas is, obviously, it's a very big state with multiple markets and multiple market dynamics. So kind of breaking that down a little bit, Dallas, Fort Worth, San Antonio, West Texas, all have very healthy demand growth that we think will flow into 2016. Houston and some of the coastal markets may have some softening in the private side. But overall, I think that when you look at Texas, it's still growing."

A couple of things we think about as we look at next year. One is that we expect to have higher stripping costs as we prepare for future growth. And those are items that are expensed in the current year, but they really prepare us for growth over multiple years. Sets a bit of a factor we're considering in our '16 outlook, and we're also keeping an eye on what happens with diesel prices throughout the year. So we continue to believe that 60% is a very good long-term number. We expect to see something north of that in 2016. But I'd also tell you, and I'm sure Tom will echo this, we're really confident and pleased with how our teams are executing because that's really where the rubber meets the road in our business.

Keep in mind that our Asphalt business over time is really well exposed, if you will, to increases in public funding across many states. And so while the short-term margin structure perhaps can fluctuate, long term, the returns on capital can be very stable and very attractive. Again, tied to public funding, a little bit more unbalanced. To your point on Aggregate margins per ton, first, I'll draw your attention to the longer term as kind of how we think about the business. As you heard Tom say, we think we're very much on track with the longer-term outlook we put out at our Investor Day a year ago, which would imply on a cash basis per ton margins north of $8. And if you look and see what's happening at pricing, if you look and see what's happening in our operating leverage, if you look at our results so far to the recovery, we are at least on track with that long-term goal. And that's -- I want to draw your attention to that because that's really how we think about it. In the shorter term for '16, we continue to expect margins per ton to increase faster than the rate of pricing. So the year-over-year increase might be around 20% roughly, maybe slightly below that. And again, that ties back to a flow-through that is above the long-term 60% threshold but a little bit below last year. So we think it's a reasonable expectation, something we're confident our teams can deliver on."

An example would be some very high-value product we shipped in South Carolina associated with some flood control. So some of that we call out as a little bit onetime. But what I'd underscore is that even if you take that out, our pricing for the year, the pricing trend we're on, was actually still a good bit above the 7% we've laid out for the year, particularly on a same-store basis. So I think about the trend going into next year, the momentum for next year on a percentage basis is more like 7% plus as opposed to 11% just because of -- kind of what you're comping over period to period. But I'll -- let me underscore one more thing. There is no deceleration happening on pricing. The environment is still positive construction. And so what I'd tell you is that we had 7% in '15. We expect 7% in '16. We're entering the year with good momentum. We have a lot of visibility to it, and it's a pretty strong story."

I think for the year, we executed better than we forecasted to be honest. So my comments on SAG, which is probably a number, I'd like to be 0 as a CFO. But our comments on SAG would be that administrative headcount year-on-year remained essentially flat, so the core wage element of our SAG was well in control. The variances were driven by fringes, which is pension, payroll, taxes, some deferred comp calculations, those kind of things, which we -- and frankly this didn't forecast as well as I would like to at the beginning of the year. Some of those were driven a little bit higher with our rising stock price. We also had higher outside services fees and professionals fees. Those were legal and tax, and a couple other items associated with some changes we're making and to some investments we're making in the sales side of our business. And then finally, our sales headcount was modestly higher in the year and our SAG is associated with that as we continue to invest in growth for the future. So again, I think the execution was solid. We'd like to see that number grow at more like 3% than what we saw in the past year. We'll work to control it, and we'll certainly continue to leverage its sales."

And, James, these days, most of our urban markets, which is a concentration for us, you've got a lot other barriers to long-haul shipping or truck -- long trucking that go way beyond diesel cost.

We define our folks to find it. And then actually in the back third of the year, it wasn't just the last quarter, it was September 4, they made significant improvements on their efficiencies on labor and their planning. And again -- so you're correct about shifts, where you're bringing things up and you're running multiple crews between even more plants. Labor can be a challenge without appropriate planning. I am very pleased with our operating people that they're never being satisfied, they're campaigning for continuous improvement and they focus and work on it every day, and I give them credit.

To facilitate our discussion today, we have made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental information. Rather than walk through each slide as we've done in past calls, Tom and John will summarize the highlights of our fourth quarter results and outlook for 2016. We believe this approach will assist your analysis and will allow more time to respond to your questions. 
With that said, please be reminded that comments regarding the company's results and projections may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, including general economic and business conditions, the timing and amount of federal, state and local funding for infrastructure and the highly competitive nature of the construction materials industry. These and other risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the company's SEC reports, including our earnings release and our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. 
In addition, during this call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure and other related information in our earnings release and at the end of the supplemental presentation.

I hope you've had time to review our earnings release and the supplemental information posted earlier today on our website. 
As Mark mentioned, John and I will summarize the highlights of our fourth quarter results and the outlook for 2016, then we'll be happy to take your questions. 
We remain highly focused on the fundamentals of our business at Vulcan, on the clear opportunities in front of us. Regardless of recent concerns that have swept through global securities markets, we are focused on the things that we control and on our improving profitability. 
We've made a lot of progress over the last year, and we have a good report for you today. 
Aggregates volumes are up nicely. Pricing is positive. Our gross profit per ton numbers continue to be really impressive. We are controlling our cost. 
But first, I'd like to start the conversation by making 3 basic points. Number one, we finished the year strong. Our teams company-wide are executing our aggregate-focused strategy extremely well. 
Second, I assure you that we will sustain this focus into 2016. We believe these efforts will result in more than $1 billion in adjusted EBITDA this year. 
Circumstances obviously vary across our geographic footprint, but the gradual recovery and demand continues in each of our end-use segments. 
Third, our performance throughout 2015, as we continue to move through the early stages of construction recovery, demonstrated clear and steady progress towards the longer-range goals and the expectations we put forth at our Investor Day last year. With very few exceptions, construction activity in the markets we serve still remains well below long-term trends. However, we're positioned for multiple years of double-digit revenue growth, with strong conversion of those incremental sales to gross profit. 
Now I'd like to go a little deeper into our fourth quarter and full year results. John will then hit the highlights of our 2016 outlook, and I'll conclude with some observations about our path forward. 
Let me say upfront, I'm pleased with how we finished 2015. Our mindset at Vulcan is that we can always improve, and we work hard on getting better all the time in every aspect of the business. 
Shipments were strong in the fourth quarter, whenever and wherever the weather cooperated. As we noted in our third quarter call, many of our customers have seen their backlogs grow as demand continues to pick up and as they face capacity constraints. 
We saw higher levels of shipments on weekends, and many of our customers were beginning to keep their crews on as long as the weather allowed. Those trends held up through the fourth quarter. 
Firming demand and reasonably dry weather in California and Florida contributed to year-over-year shipment growth, exceeding 15% in those states. Shipments in Georgia grew by 22% despite wet weather. On the other hand, shipments increased in the low single digits in Texas. This was due to extremely wet weather in October and November.  The underlying shipment trends in each of these states continue to be good. 
In total, same-store shipments for the quarter were up more than 8% in our Aggregates segment, 4% in our Asphalt segment and 2% in our Concrete segment. 
For the year, we shipped 178 million tons of aggregates. This is slightly above our midyear forecast of 177 million tons and an increase of about 10% over 2014 shipments. All in all, this was a very solid year of volume growth. 
Remember, this is from an asset base that has delivered aggregate shipments of approximately 300 million tons. As we talked about before, we are still early in the recovery towards 255 million tons, which we believe represents a more normal, mid-cycle level of shipments. 
We have a broad base of demand, both in terms of geography and end-use markets. We see each of our end-use markets continuing to grow. 
Some of our Texas markets are of the upper end of the spectrum of normalized demand, having enjoyed extremely strong growth. Most of our markets, however, are still well below normal demand and should enjoy steady growth for years to come. We are seeing good growth on both coasts with still a lot of upside. 
Other individual markets in the Central United States such as Nashville, Knoxville and Chattanooga are also continuing to strengthen. When you put it all together, the longer-term shipment trends we focus on continue to look good across most of our markets. 
Regarding pricing, we continue to experience a positive pricing environment in most of our markets. This is a result of 3 factors. First, we've invested substantial capital in the business to serve our customers and need to earn a fair return. Second, we continue to see increasing customer confidence in the recovery. And third, the construction industry is increasingly focused on improving returns on capital as volumes remain well below normal levels. 
Overall, freight-adjusted average sales price for aggregates increased 11% on a same-store basis or $1.18 per ton compared to the prior year's fourth quarter. 
In the quarter, we estimate $0.15 per ton, helped from product and geographic mix.  For the full year, average selling prices increased 7%. 
Now I'd like to take a -- make a few remarks regarding our customer service and cost control efforts. Throughout the quarter, our teams did an excellent job meeting our customers' needs, including tight deadlines and complex demands on big projects, both safely and efficiently. 
During the quarter, we saw improvement in repair and maintenance costs and overtime labor costs. This improvement contributed to our strong finish for the year. Costs during the first 3 quarters of 2015 had begun to rise as increasing volumes required us to run our plants longer. This led to more repairs and higher spending on parts and supplies and associated labor. 
Now I said on our last call we are very focused on improving these costs, and we're beginning to see these improvements in September. The improvements continued, and I'm proud of our operating people for the work they have done here. We remain intensely focused on managing these costs efficiently, balancing the factors affecting production quality, service and cost.
Still, a clear picture comes with a longer-term view. For the year, our unit cost of sales in aggregates declined slightly as our employees remained focused on continuous improvement. We got better at controlling costs as the year progressed.
We also saw reduced expenditures as diesel cost declined. Setting aside external forces, our strong emphasis on cost control, near term and longer term, will not change. 
Overall, I'm pleased with the progress we've made with our execution and our focus. We continue to focus on customer service, employee development, cost control and our safety performance. We saw marked improvement in our safety performance in the fourth quarter. 
Let me emphasize, this is a continuous improvement track, a process of working to get better every day. We have made good progress, but there's still more to be done. 
A strong example of the progress we have made is the outstanding job our teams did converting incremental revenue into incremental gross profit. Flow-through in the quarter was 89% on a same-store basis; obviously, strong result. But better look at it on a trailing 12-month basis where it was 77%, well ahead of the 60% threshold we target longer term. 
Our unit profitability in aggregates continues to improve, something our employees work hard on and can be very proud of. 
Gross profit margin on a same-store basis increased 38% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year's quarter. Unit gross profit margin was $5.38 per ton. This marks 12 consecutive quarters of expanding unit margin. 
We will continue this trend. On a trailing 12-month basis, unit margin increased by 29% to $4.38 per ton. Now there's a slide you've seen before, Slide #11, that covers this, and I'd like to call your attention to it because it's impressive. 
Here, you will see that for the trailing 12 months, we shipped 178 million tons, 38 million tons more than the year prior to the start of the recovery. Aggregates segment gross profit for the year was $756 million, or $398 million ahead of the 12 months before the recovery began. 
So on 38 million tons of improvement, we have delivered almost $400 million in incremental segment gross profit. Gross profit per ton has increased $1.69 or 66% during this period. A 27% increase in shipments has been converted into an increase in gross profit in excess of 100%. 
Looking at 2015 as a whole, you can clearly see the benefits of our aggregate-focused strategy. We have the assets and capabilities in place to service our customers. We have the focused execution to drive profitability, and we have a very strong platform for continuing growth. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to John for additional comments on our earnings performance and outlook for the remainder of the year. John?"

So Tom just highlighted, and as you've seen in our release, we had a strong finish to a strong year, a year with same-store aggregate shipments up 7%; aggregates pricing up 7%; strong conversion of that incremental revenue into incremental gross profit; improved material margins in our Asphalt and Concrete businesses; and continued leveraging of SAG to revenues.  We expect to see much of the same in 2016, another year of continuous compounding improvement in our execution and in our results. 
To complement the information shared in our release, I'll first offer a few comments regarding the demand environment, then outline our performance expectations for the year and briefly note our plans for capital allocation. 
As Tom said, we see a broadening recovery in demand across each of our end-use segments and across most of our geographic footprint. In total, we see demand across the markets we serve growing approximately 7% with some upside potential based on the rate at which rising DOT budgets and public infrastructure funding converts into active construction projects and material shipments. 
We project private demand in the markets we serve to grow approximately 10% year-over-year, supported by growth in both residential and nonresidential activity. We see continued double-digit growth in residential construction across our footprint, with nonresidential construction continuing to expand, albeit at a slower pace than 2015. 
Although certain measures of private nonresidential construction suggested some decline in the second half of the year, our on-the-ground view indicates continued solid growth.  And importantly, employment data and other macroeconomic and demographic factors further signal a sustained recovery in private demand across our markets. 
Much has been made about the potential impact of lower oil prices, and we continue to monitor trends in private construction activity in markets such as Houston. But to date, we have not seen a materially negative impact when looking at our portfolio as a whole. 
I'll now turn to public demand, where we see 2016 being something of a transition year and in a positive way. 
Across our markets, we expect demand growth tied to public construction of approximately 5%. Longer-term visibility with respect to public demand has improved markedly with the passage of the federal highway bill, state-level funding initiatives and record levels of local tax receipts. 
In addition, the public construction share of tax receipts remains at 20-year lows and at ultimately unsustainable levels. 
This shift to higher levels of total public funding, combined with greater visibility, should allow for a higher percentage of new construction in the mix, which bodes well for our materials demand and, in our case, product balance. All of this is good. But at this point, we don't see the full benefit of these trends impacting our volumes until 2017 and beyond. 
We will monitor the lag between DOT budgets rising and a commensurate increase in project activity throughout the year. But to be clear, rising public construction activity is beginning to kick in, with the question being at what pace. 
Finally, we continue to see the overall rate of recovery in many markets constrained by construction labor shortages and other bottlenecks in the total construction supply chain. Although the situation can inhibit the overall rate of shipment growth in the near term and lengthen the time required to return to normalized levels, it does provide further support for disciplined increases in pricing, margins, and ultimately, returns on capital. 
So against this backdrop of approximately 7% total demand growth in 2016, what do we expect to deliver in terms of financial results? As we have stated, our 2016 guidance is for between $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion in adjusted EBITDA, an approximately 25% increase over 2015. 
We don't give quarterly guidance, as you know, and we encourage investors to consider longer-term trends in addition to quarter-to-quarter results. 
I will now comment on certain of the factors and assumptions underpinning our annual guidance. You should consider these figures to be midpoints of current management expectations and keep in mind that our results vary widely across the individual markets we serve. 
Starting with aggregate shipments, we're projecting a total of 191 million tons or an increase of 7% over the prior year. 
On a geographic basis, we expect the growth in 2016 to be relatively widespread, with higher rates in markets such as Arizona, Florida, Georgia and Southern California offsetting lower-than-average rates in markets such as Texas, where we see continued growth but at a slower rate than the company as a whole, and Illinois, where we project a small decline in year-over-year shipments. 
And as with 2015, we may see a greater share of shipments occur in the second half of the year, in part due to the impact of El Niño weather on our Western states and in part due to the expected flow of large project activity throughout the year. 
Again, as Tom noted, the overall pricing climate for our materials remains positive and constructive. We're entering the year with good momentum, and we currently expect freight-adjusted average selling prices for aggregates to increase 7% in 2016, in line with the increase seen in 2015. 
Please keep in mind that pricing decisions in our business are made locally, with wide variances by product type and geography. Our local teams will continue to balance pricing, customer service, operating efficiencies and the overall sales and production mix, all with an eye toward improving total unit margins and earning a fair return on capital employed. 
These shipment and pricing expectations, of course, suggest mid-double-digit growth in freight-adjusted revenues for the Aggregates segment. We expect to continue converting these incremental revenues into incremental gross profit at a 60% or higher rate. 
Consistent with this view, we expect gross profit in the segment to increase by approximately 25% year-over-year, and we expect to realize continued improvements in our per ton margins. 
We also expect to see continued profit improvement in our Asphalt and Concrete segments, following on the strong gains posted in 2015. We currently project gross profit for these segments combined to increase approximately 20% in 2016. These operations are well positioned to benefit from the continued recovery in demand due to improvements to our asset portfolio as well as our internal operating efficiencies. 
Our current forecast for SAG is $295 million, approximately 3% growth over 2016. We plan to continue to leverage SAG to sales even as we make important investments in our sales and customer service capabilities.  Administrative headcount should remain essentially flat year-over-year. 
So to recap, we expect to see in 2016 much the same of which you've seen in a very positive 2015 as well as through the entire early stage of the recovery so far. Our people at all levels of the organization are focused on helping our customers grow, controlling what they can control and driving continuously improved results for our shareholders and other stakeholders. 
Now I'll conclude with some brief remarks regarding capital allocation. Our aggregate-centric strategy and the way we manage it day by day is geared toward generating significant amounts of free cash flow, even in periods of depressed demand. That's by design, as you'd expect, and we give it a great deal of focus. 
Our priorities for allocating net cash flow and managing the inherent cyclicality of our business have not changed from those we've outlined at different times over the course of the last year or so. 
In short, we intend to balance 3 objectives: reinvesting in the business for productivity and growth; maintaining adequate financial strength and flexibility; and a disciplined return of capital to shareholders. 
With respect to reinvestment, I'll note that we plan to allocate approximately $275 million of cash this year to what we call core CapEx. That is reinvestment to sustain and improve the performance and productivity of our current operations. 
In addition, we expect to invest a meaningful amount in growth, whether in the form of acquisitions or the internal development of new production and distribution capacity. 
With respect to financial strength and flexibility, I'll note that our debt-to-EBITDA ratio has lowered to 2.4x. Refinancing activities during 2015 extended our debt durations while lowering our weighed  average interest rate. 
We do not expect to use cash in the near term to lower our total debt of approximately $2 billion. Rather, we have the financing capacity and the liquidity needed to fund smart reinvestments and growth such as those I just mentioned. And we intend to maintain that flexibility throughout the cycle. 
And finally, we expect the amount of capital returned to shareholders to increase as the recovery moves forward. 
As noted previously, we expect the dividend to grow roughly in line with earnings during the recovery phase of the cycle. We also expect to use opportunistic share repurchase to return additional capital over time. 
And with that, I'll hand the call back to Tom."

You've heard me talk about the strong year we had and the things we consistently focus on to deliver superior results. Ours is a long-term business. We set long-range goals and work hard to get where we think we can be, given our world-class assets and people. 
We are pleased with our 2015 results and the way we are positioned for future success. We've made clear progress towards the goals that we set forth in our Investor Day last February and are very much on track. 
We're on track to achieve $2 billion in EBITDA at normal levels of demand. We're on track moving steadily towards a normalized demand level of 255 million tons per year for Vulcan aggregates. We're on track for continuing gradual recovery in each major end market and in most of our geographies. We now have a fully funded long-term highway bill, and we are very pleased to see healthy increases in state and local funding for highways and other public construction.  
We continue to anticipate Aggregates segment cash gross profit at normal demand in the range of $8.25 per ton. This will be the result of solid sales execution, continued growth weighted towards our more profitable geographies, pricing fundamentals that continue to strengthen and consistently strong incremental margins. 
At normal demand levels, we also see greater profitability in our non-Aggregates segment in the range of $175 million. Here, we benefit from continuing operating discipline and improvements, the strength in portfolio that came with our asset swap in early 2015 and improving materials margins. 
We also remain on track with SAG costs, moving towards 6% as a percent of sales. SAG as a percent of revenue declined 70 basis points in 2015. We intend to further leverage SAG to sales growth. 
As we look forward, we believe that we are well positioned for several years of double-digit top line growth with strong conversion to the bottom line. 
No matter how you look at this, I'm pleased to tell you that we are executing well, and that is the watchword of our people: execute, execute, execute. Control your own destiny and finish strong. I am very proud of our people and the good work they are doing. I can promise you that we are all committed to making a good company better every day. We are excited about where we are today, and we're even more excited about where this company is going. 
Now if the operator will give the required instructions, we will be happy to respond to your questions."

So if there may be a little bit, but probably not a lot of deferred work from '15 into '16. Your second question was about Texas. And I think that how we look at Texas is, obviously, it's a very big state with multiple markets and multiple market dynamics. So kind of breaking that down a little bit, Dallas, Fort Worth, San Antonio, West Texas, all have very healthy demand growth that we think will flow into 2016. Houston and some of the coastal markets may have some softening in the private side. But overall, I think that when you look at Texas, it's still growing."

And apart from all the attention Texas gets, I guess we would just also note that for us, we see very much a broadening of demand across our markets.

And we just think that's a better way to look at the business, given the timing of how various revenues and costs can flow quarter-to-quarter. Now if you -- you may have already done the math, but you'll see that our outlook for '16 implies a flow-through rate that's above the 60% threshold that we see as a long-term number, but it's below the 77% that we did in 2015. A couple of things we think about as we look at next year. One is that we expect to have higher stripping costs as we prepare for future growth. And those are items that are expensed in the current year, but they really prepare us for growth over multiple years. Sets a bit of a factor we're considering in our '16 outlook, and we're also keeping an eye on what happens with diesel prices throughout the year. So we continue to believe that 60% is a very good long-term number. We expect to see something north of that in 2016. But I'd also tell you, and I'm sure Tom will echo this, we're really confident and pleased with how our teams are executing because that's really where the rubber meets the road in our business. Our local teams are doing a fantastic job, and we expect that execution strength to continue into the new year."

Keep in mind that our Asphalt business over time is really well exposed, if you will, to increases in public funding across many states. And so while the short-term margin structure perhaps can fluctuate, long term, the returns on capital can be very stable and very attractive. Again, tied to public funding, a little bit more unbalanced. To your point on Aggregate margins per ton, first, I'll draw your attention to the longer term as kind of how we think about the business. As you heard Tom say, we think we're very much on track with the longer-term outlook we put out at our Investor Day a year ago, which would imply on a cash basis per ton margins north of $8. And if you look and see what's happening at pricing, if you look and see what's happening in our operating leverage, if you look at our results so far to the recovery, we are at least on track with that long-term goal. And that's -- I want to draw your attention to that because that's really how we think about it. In the shorter term for '16, we continue to expect margins per ton to increase faster than the rate of pricing. So the year-over-year increase might be around 20% roughly, maybe slightly below that. And again, that ties back to a flow-through that is above the long-term 60% threshold but a little bit below last year. So we think it's a reasonable expectation, something we're confident our teams can deliver on."

Mid- to high single-digit shipment growth with mid- to high-single-digit revenue growth, if I can do the math correctly, is more than double-digit revenue growth. And as with this continuous steady rate of gradual recovery, is it going to be a perfect straight line, an absolute linear quarter-to-quarter? Of course not. History hasn't worked that way.

We're really pleased with the execution we had in the fourth quarter. We're not taking for granted that all those issues are behind us.

I think for the year, we executed better than we forecasted to be honest. So my comments on SAG, which is probably a number I'd like to be 0 as a CFO, but our comments on SAG would be that administrative headcount year-on-year remained essentially flat, so the core wage element of our SAG was well in control. The variances were driven by fringes, which is pension, payroll taxes, some deferred comp calculations, those kind of things, which we -- and frankly just didn't forecast as well as I would like to at the beginning of the year. Some of those were driven a little bit higher with our rising stock price. We also had higher outside services fees and professionals fees. Those were legal and tax, and a couple other items associated with some changes we're making and to some investments we're making in the sales side of our business. And then finally, our sales headcount was modestly higher in the year and our SAG associated with that as we continue to invest in growth for the future. So again, I think the execution was solid. We'd like to see that number grow at more like 3% than what we saw in the past year. We'll work to control it, and we'll certainly continue to leverage its sales."

We defy our folks to find it. And then actually in the back third of the year, it wasn't just the last quarter, it was September 4, they made significant improvements on their efficiencies of labor and their planning. And again -- so you're correct about shifts, where you're bringing things up and you're running multiple crews between even more plants. Labor can be a challenge without appropriate planning. I am very pleased with our operating people that they're never being satisfied, they're campaigning for continuous improvement and they focus and work on it every day, and I give them credit. They're never satisfied, and they work tirelessly on it. But all of this is about compounding that continuous improvement to give us the margin expansion that we've enjoyed over the last 10 quarters.

To facilitate our discussion today, we have made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental information. Rather than walk through each slide as we've done in past calls, Tom and John will summarize the highlights of our fourth quarter results and outlook for 2016. We believe this approach will assist your analysis and will allow more time to respond to your questions. 
With that said, please be reminded that comments regarding the company's results and projections may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, including general economic and business conditions, the timing and amount of federal, state and local funding for infrastructure and the highly competitive nature of the construction materials industry. These and other risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the company's SEC reports, including our earnings release and our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. 
In addition, during this call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure and other related information in our earnings release and at the end of the supplemental presentation. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Vulcan's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Hill. Tom?"

I hope you've had time to review our earnings release and the supplemental information posted earlier today on our website. 
As Mark mentioned, John and I will summarize the highlights of our fourth quarter results and the outlook for 2016, then we'll be happy to take your questions. 
We remain highly focused on the fundamentals of our business at Vulcan, on the clear opportunities in front of us. Regardless of recent concerns that have swept through global securities markets, we are focused on the things that we control and on our improving profitability. 
We've made a lot of progress over the last year, and we have a good report for you today. 
Aggregates volumes are up nicely. Pricing is positive. Our gross profit per ton numbers continue to be really impressive. We are controlling our cost. 
But first, I'd like to start the conversation by making 3 basic points. Number one, we finished the year strong. Our teams company-wide are executing our aggregate-focused strategy extremely well. 
Second, I assure you that we will sustain this focus into 2016. We believe these efforts will result in more than $1 billion in adjusted EBITDA this year. 
Circumstances obviously vary across our geographic footprint, but the gradual recovery and demand continues in each of our end-use segments. 
Third, our performance throughout 2015, as we continue to move through the early stages of construction recovery, demonstrated clear and steady progress towards the longer-range goals and the expectations we put forth at our Investor Day last year. With very few exceptions, construction activity in the markets we serve still remains well below long-term trends. However, we're positioned for multiple years of double-digit revenue growth, with strong conversion of those incremental sales to gross profit. 
Now I'd like to go a little deeper into our fourth quarter and full year results. John will then hit the highlights of our 2016 outlook, and I'll conclude with some observations about our path forward. 
Let me say upfront, I'm pleased with how we finished 2015. Our mindset at Vulcan is that we can always improve, and we work hard on getting better all the time in every aspect of the business. 
Shipments were strong in the fourth quarter, whenever and wherever the weather cooperated. As we noted in our third quarter call, many of our customers have seen their backlogs grow as demand continues to pick up and as they face capacity constraints. 
We saw higher levels of shipments on weekends, and many of our customers were beginning to keep their crews on as long as the weather allowed. Those trends held up through the fourth quarter. 
Firming demand and reasonably dry weather in California and Florida contributed to year-over-year shipment growth, exceeding 15% in those states. Shipments in Georgia grew by 22% despite wet weather. On the other hand, shipments increased in the low single digits in Texas. This was due to extremely wet weather in October and November. The underlying shipment trends in each of these states continue to be good. 
In total, same-store shipments for the quarter were up more than 8% in our Aggregates segment, 4% in our Asphalt segment and 2% in our Concrete segment. 
For the year, we shipped 178 million tons of aggregates. This is slightly above our midyear forecast of 177 million tons and an increase of about 10% over 2014 shipments. All in all, this was a very solid year of volume growth. 
Remember, this is from an asset base that has delivered aggregate shipments of approximately 300 million tons. As we talked about before, we are still early in the recovery towards 255 million tons, which we believe represents a more normal, mid-cycle level of shipments. 
We have a broad base of demand, both in terms of geography and end-use markets. We see each of our end-use markets continuing to grow. 
Some of our Texas markets are of the upper end of the spectrum of normalized demand, having enjoyed extremely strong growth. Most of our markets, however, are still well below normal demand and should enjoy steady growth for years to come. We are seeing good growth on both coasts with still a lot of upside. 
Other individual markets in the Central United States such as Nashville, Knoxville and Chattanooga are also continuing to strengthen. When you put it all together, the longer-term shipment trends we focus on continue to look good across most of our markets. 
Regarding pricing, we continue to experience a positive pricing environment in most of our markets. This is a result of 3 factors. First, we've invested substantial capital in the business to serve our customers and need to earn a fair return. Second, we continue to see increasing customer confidence in the recovery. And third, the construction industry is increasingly focused on improving returns on capital as volumes remain well below normal levels. 
Overall, freight-adjusted average sales price for aggregates increased 11% on a same-store basis or $1.18 per ton compared to the prior year's fourth quarter. 
In the quarter, we estimate $0.15 per ton, helped from product and geographic mix. For the full year, average selling prices increased 7%. 
Now I'd like to take a -- make a few remarks regarding our customer service and cost control efforts. Throughout the quarter, our teams did an excellent job meeting our customers' needs, including tight deadlines and complex demands on big projects, both safely and efficiently. 
During the quarter, we saw improvement in repair and maintenance costs and overtime labor costs. This improvement contributed to our strong finish for the year. Costs during the first 3 quarters of 2015 had begun to rise as increasing volumes required us to run our plants longer. This led to more repairs and higher spending on parts and supplies and associated labor. 
Now I said on our last call we are very focused on improving these costs, and we're beginning to see these improvements in September. The improvements continued, and I'm proud of our operating people for the work they have done here. We remain intensely focused on managing these costs efficiently, balancing the factors affecting production quality, service and cost.
Still, a clear picture comes with a longer-term view. For the year, our unit cost of sales in aggregates declined slightly as our employees remained focused on continuous improvement. We got better at controlling costs as the year progressed.
We also saw reduced expenditures as diesel cost declined. Setting aside external forces, our strong emphasis on cost control, near term and longer term, will not change. 
Overall, I'm pleased with the progress we've made with our execution and our focus. We continue to focus on customer service, employee development, cost control and our safety performance. We saw marked improvement in our safety performance in the fourth quarter. 
Let me emphasize, this is a continuous improvement track, a process of working to get better every day. We have made good progress, but there's still more to be done. 
A strong example of the progress we have made is the outstanding job our teams did converting incremental revenue into incremental gross profit. Flow-through in the quarter was 89% on a same-store basis; obviously, strong result. But better look at it on a trailing 12-month basis where it was 77%, well ahead of the 60% threshold we target longer term. 
Our unit profitability in aggregates continues to improve, something our employees work hard on and can be very proud of. 
Gross profit margin on a same-store basis increased 38% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year's quarter. Unit gross profit margin was $5.38 per ton. This marks 12 consecutive quarters of expanding unit margin. 
We will continue this trend. On a trailing 12-month basis, unit margin increased by 29% to $4.38 per ton. Now there's a slide you've seen before, Slide #11, that covers this, and I'd like to call your attention to it because it's impressive. 
Here, you will see that for the trailing 12 months, we shipped 178 million tons, 38 million tons more than the year prior to the start of the recovery. Aggregates segment gross profit for the year was $756 million, or $398 million ahead of the 12 months before the recovery began. 
So on 38 million tons of improvement, we have delivered almost $400 million in incremental segment gross profit. Gross profit per ton has increased $1.69 or 66% during this period. A 27% increase in shipments has been converted into an increase in gross profit in excess of 100%. 
Looking at 2015 as a whole, you can clearly see the benefits of our aggregate-focused strategy. We have the assets and capabilities in place to service our customers. We have the focused execution to drive profitability, and we have a very strong platform for continuing growth. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to John for additional comments on our earnings performance and outlook for the remainder of the year. John?"

So Tom just highlighted, and as you've seen in our release, we had a strong finish to a strong year, a year with same-store aggregate shipments up 7%; aggregates pricing up 7%; strong conversion of that incremental revenue into incremental gross profit; improved material margins in our Asphalt and Concrete businesses; and continued leveraging of SAG to revenues. We expect to see much of the same in 2016, another year of continuous compounding improvement in our execution and in our results. 
To complement the information shared in our release, I'll first offer a few comments regarding the demand environment, then outline our performance expectations for the year and briefly note our plans for capital allocation. 
As Tom said, we see a broadening recovery in demand across each of our end-use segments and across most of our geographic footprint. In total, we see demand across the markets we serve growing approximately 7% with some upside potential based on the rate at which rising DOT budgets and public infrastructure funding converts into active construction projects and material shipments. 
We project private demand in the markets we serve to grow approximately 10% year-over-year, supported by growth in both residential and nonresidential activity. We see continued double-digit growth in residential construction across our footprint, with nonresidential construction continuing to expand, albeit at a slower pace than 2015. 
Although certain measures of private nonresidential construction suggested some decline in the second half of the year, our on-the-ground view indicates continued solid growth. And importantly, employment data and other macroeconomic and demographic factors further signal a sustained recovery in private demand across our markets. 
Much has been made about the potential impact of lower oil prices, and we continue to monitor trends in private construction activity in markets such as Houston. But to date, we have not seen a materially negative impact when looking at our portfolio as a whole. 
I'll now turn to public demand, where we see 2016 being something of a transition year and in a positive way. 
Across our markets, we expect demand growth tied to public construction of approximately 5%. Longer-term visibility with respect to public demand has improved markedly with the passage of the federal highway bill, state-level funding initiatives and record levels of local tax receipts. 
In addition, the public construction share of tax receipts remains at 20-year lows and at ultimately unsustainable levels. 
This shift to higher levels of total public funding, combined with greater visibility, should allow for a higher percentage of new construction in the mix, which bodes well for our materials demand and, in our case, product balance. All of this is good. But at this point, we don't see the full benefit of these trends impacting our volumes until 2017 and beyond. 
We will monitor the lag between DOT budgets rising and a commensurate increase in project activity throughout the year. But to be clear, rising public construction activity is beginning to kick in, with the question being at what pace. 
Finally, we continue to see the overall rate of recovery in many markets constrained by construction labor shortages and other bottlenecks in the total construction supply chain. Although the situation can inhibit the overall rate of shipment growth in the near term and lengthen the time required to return to normalized levels, it does provide further support for disciplined increases in pricing, margins, and ultimately, returns on capital. 
So against this backdrop of approximately 7% total demand growth in 2016, what do we expect to deliver in terms of financial results? As we have stated, our 2016 guidance is for between $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion in adjusted EBITDA, an approximately 25% increase over 2015. 
We don't give quarterly guidance, as you know, and we encourage investors to consider longer-term trends in addition to quarter-to-quarter results. 
I will now comment on certain of the factors and assumptions underpinning our annual guidance. You should consider these figures to be midpoints of current management expectations and keep in mind that our results vary widely across the individual markets we serve. 
Starting with aggregate shipments, we're projecting a total of 191 million tons or an increase of 7% over the prior year. 
On a geographic basis, we expect the growth in 2016 to be relatively widespread, with higher rates in markets such as Arizona, Florida, Georgia and Southern California offsetting lower-than-average rates in markets such as Texas, where we see continued growth but at a slower rate than the company as a whole, and Illinois, where we project a small decline in year-over-year shipments. 
And as with 2015, we may see a greater share of shipments occur in the second half of the year, in part due to the impact of El Niño weather on our Western states and in part due to the expected flow of large project activity throughout the year. 
Again, as Tom noted, the overall pricing climate for our materials remains positive and constructive. We're entering the year with good momentum, and we currently expect freight-adjusted average selling prices for aggregates to increase 7% in 2016, in line with the increase seen in 2015. 
Please keep in mind that pricing decisions in our business are made locally, with wide variances by product type and geography. Our local teams will continue to balance pricing, customer service, operating efficiencies and the overall sales and production mix, all with an eye toward improving total unit margins and earning a fair return on capital employed. 
These shipment and pricing expectations, of course, suggest mid-double-digit growth in freight-adjusted revenues for the Aggregates segment. We expect to continue converting these incremental revenues into incremental gross profit at a 60% or higher rate. 
Consistent with this view, we expect gross profit in the segment to increase by approximately 25% year-over-year, and we expect to realize continued improvements in our per ton margins. 
We also expect to see continued profit improvement in our Asphalt and Concrete segments, following on the strong gains posted in 2015. We currently project gross profit for these segments combined to increase approximately 20% in 2016. These operations are well positioned to benefit from the continued recovery in demand due to improvements to our asset portfolio as well as our internal operating efficiencies. 
Our current forecast for SAG is $295 million, approximately 3% growth over 2016. We plan to continue to leverage SAG to sales even as we make important investments in our sales and customer service capabilities. Administrative headcount should remain essentially flat year-over-year. 
So to recap, we expect to see in 2016 much the same of which you've seen in a very positive 2015 as well as through the entire early stage of the recovery so far. Our people at all levels of the organization are focused on helping our customers grow, controlling what they can control and driving continuously improved results for our shareholders and other stakeholders. 
Now I'll conclude with some brief remarks regarding capital allocation. Our aggregate-centric strategy and the way we manage it day by day is geared toward generating significant amounts of free cash flow, even in periods of depressed demand. That's by design, as you'd expect, and we give it a great deal of focus. 
Our priorities for allocating net cash flow and managing the inherent cyclicality of our business have not changed from those we've outlined at different times over the course of the last year or so. 
In short, we intend to balance 3 objectives: reinvesting in the business for productivity and growth; maintaining adequate financial strength and flexibility; and a disciplined return of capital to shareholders. 
With respect to reinvestment, I'll note that we plan to allocate approximately $275 million of cash this year to what we call core CapEx. That is reinvestment to sustain and improve the performance and productivity of our current operations. 
In addition, we expect to invest a meaningful amount in growth, whether in the form of acquisitions or the internal development of new production and distribution capacity. 
With respect to financial strength and flexibility, I'll note that our debt-to-EBITDA ratio has lowered to 2.4x. Refinancing activities during 2015 extended our debt durations while lowering our weighted average interest rate. 
We do not expect to use cash in the near term to lower our total debt of approximately $2 billion. Rather, we have the financing capacity and the liquidity needed to fund smart reinvestments and growth such as those I just mentioned. And we intend to maintain that flexibility throughout the cycle. 
And finally, we expect the amount of capital returned to shareholders to increase as the recovery moves forward. 
As noted previously, we expect the dividend to grow roughly in line with earnings during the recovery phase of the cycle. We also expect to use opportunistic share repurchase to return additional capital over time. 
And with that, I'll hand the call back to Tom."

You've heard me talk about the strong year we had and the things we consistently focus on to deliver superior results. Ours is a long-term business. We set long-range goals and work hard to get where we think we can be, given our world-class assets and people. 
We are pleased with our 2015 results and the way we are positioned for future success. We've made clear progress towards the goals that we set forth in our Investor Day last February and are very much on track. 
We're on track to achieve $2 billion in EBITDA at normal levels of demand. We're on track moving steadily towards a normalized demand level of 255 million tons per year for Vulcan aggregates. We're on track for continuing gradual recovery in each major end market and in most of our geographies. We now have a fully funded long-term highway bill, and we are very pleased to see healthy increases in state and local funding for highways and other public construction. 
We continue to anticipate Aggregates segment cash gross profit at normal demand in the range of $8.25 per ton. This will be the result of solid sales execution, continued growth weighted towards our more profitable geographies, pricing fundamentals that continue to strengthen and consistently strong incremental margins. 
At normal demand levels, we also see greater profitability in our non-Aggregates segment in the range of $175 million. Here, we benefit from continuing operating discipline and improvements, the strength in portfolio that came with our asset swap in early 2015 and improving materials margins. 
We also remain on track with SAG costs, moving towards 6% as a percent of sales. SAG as a percent of revenue declined 70 basis points in 2015. We intend to further leverage SAG to sales growth. 
As we look forward, we believe that we are well positioned for several years of double-digit top line growth with strong conversion to the bottom line. 
No matter how you look at this, I'm pleased to tell you that we are executing well, and that is the watchword of our people: execute, execute, execute. Control your own destiny and finish strong. I am very proud of our people and the good work they are doing. I can promise you that we are all committed to making a good company better every day. We are excited about where we are today, and we're even more excited about where this company is going.

That can be a little bit difficult to predict, and so I think that's a swing factor we'll look at during the year. And apart from all the attention Texas gets, I guess we would just also note that for us, we see very much a broadening of demand across our markets.

So I would encourage you to look at the 77% for the year as a more meaningful number than any individual quarter. And we just think that's a better way to look at the business, given the timing of how various revenues and costs can flow quarter-to-quarter. Now if you -- you may have already done the math, but you'll see that our outlook for '16 implies a flow-through rate that's above the 60% threshold that we see as a long-term number, but it's below the 77% that we did in 2015. A couple of things we think about as we look at next year. One is that we expect to have higher stripping costs as we prepare for future growth. And those are items that are expensed in the current year, but they really prepare us for growth over multiple years. Sets a bit of a factor we're considering in our '16 outlook, and we're also keeping an eye on what happens with diesel prices throughout the year. So we continue to believe that 60% is a very good long-term number. We expect to see something north of that in 2016. But I'd also tell you, and I'm sure Tom will echo this, we're really confident and pleased with how our teams are executing because that's really where the rubber meets the road in our business. Our local teams are doing a fantastic job, and we expect that execution strength to continue into the new year."

Keep in mind that our Asphalt business over time is really well exposed, if you will, to increases in public funding across many states. And so while the short-term margin structure perhaps can fluctuate, long term, the returns on capital can be very stable and very attractive. Again, tied to public funding, a little bit more unbalanced. To your point on Aggregate margins per ton, first, I'll draw your attention to the longer term as kind of how we think about the business. As you heard Tom say, we think we're very much on track with the longer-term outlook we put out at our Investor Day a year ago, which would imply on a cash basis per ton margins north of $8. And if you look and see what's happening at pricing, if you look and see what's happening in our operating leverage, if you look at our results so far to the recovery, we are at least on track with that long-term goal. And that's -- I want to draw your attention to that because that's really how we think about it. In the shorter term for '16, we continue to expect margins per ton to increase faster than the rate of pricing. So the year-over-year increase might be around 20% roughly, maybe slightly below that. And again, that ties back to a flow-through that is above the long-term 60% threshold but a little bit below last year. So we think it's a reasonable expectation, something we're confident our teams can deliver on."

The big impacts on the highway bill and as funding increases will be -- you take another step in '17, coupled with the state DOTs will start letting larger jobs with the visibility of having long-term funding.

Construction activity has a long way to recover. It's not even driven by new economic growth. And at the levels we're talking about, we'd still have multiple years before we get back to 45-year trends of normal consumption. Mid- to high single-digit shipment growth with mid- to high-single-digit revenue growth, if I can do the math correctly, is more than double-digit revenue growth. And as with this continuous steady rate of gradual recovery, is it going to be a perfect straight line, an absolute linear quarter-to-quarter? Of course not. History hasn't worked that way.

But in the quarter, you saw that our total cost of sales per unit declined and that was a combination of, as you said, continued diesel benefit year-over-year roughly in the range of what you discussed. But unlike previous quarters, we did a better job of managing our per ton expenses of R&M and some other costs. And so, on balance, we had a decline in cost of sales for the quarter, and I think you saw that. For the year, we had a slight decline in total cost of sales, and that was really diesel benefits offsetting some rising per ton of cost that were -- we commented on throughout the year in terms of R&M, parts and supplies, associated labor with that, et cetera, as well as some overtime labors that ramped up production. We're really pleased with the execution we had in the fourth quarter. We're not taking for granted that all those issues are behind us. We're still ramping up production, and we're still well below what you would normally think of as the sweet spot of our production levels in many of our plants.

I think for the year, we executed better than we forecasted to be honest. So my comments on SAG, which is probably a number I'd like to be 0 as a CFO, but our comments on SAG would be that administrative headcount year-on-year remained essentially flat, so the core wage element of our SAG was well in control. The variances were driven by fringes, which is pension, payroll taxes, some deferred comp calculations, those kind of things, which we -- and frankly just didn't forecast as well as I would like to at the beginning of the year. Some of those were driven a little bit higher with our rising stock price. We also had higher outside services fees and professionals fees. Those were legal and tax, and a couple other items associated with some changes we're making and to some investments we're making in the sales side of our business. And then finally, our sales headcount was modestly higher in the year and our SAG associated with that as we continue to invest in growth for the future. So again, I think the execution was solid. We'd like to see that number grow at more like 3% than what we saw in the past year. We'll work to control it, and we'll certainly continue to leverage its sales."

When it comes to whether it's labor or uses of diesel or cost in general, I think it's that continuous focus on operating efficiencies. You heard us talk about we struggled with labor. We defy our folks to find it. And then actually in the back third of the year, it wasn't just the last quarter, it was September 4, they made significant improvements on their efficiencies of labor and their planning. And again -- so you're correct about shifts, where you're bringing things up and you're running multiple crews between even more plants. Labor can be a challenge without appropriate planning. I am very pleased with our operating people that they're never being satisfied, they're campaigning for continuous improvement and they focus and work on it every day, and I give them credit. They're never satisfied, and they work tirelessly on it. But all of this is about compounding that continuous improvement to give us the margin expansion that we've enjoyed over the last 10 quarters.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials Company. 
Joining me today for this call are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO; and John McPherson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer. 
To facilitate our discussion today, we have made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental information. Rather than walk through each slide as we've done in past calls, Tom and John will summarize the highlights of our fourth quarter results and outlook for 2016. We believe this approach will assist your analysis and will allow more time to respond to your questions. 
With that said, please be reminded that comments regarding the company's results and projections may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, including general economic and business conditions, the timing and amount of federal, state and local funding for infrastructure and the highly competitive nature of the construction materials industry. These and other risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the company's SEC reports, including our earnings release and our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. 
In addition, during this call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure and other related information in our earnings release and at the end of the supplemental presentation. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Vulcan's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Hill. Tom?"

I hope you've had time to review our earnings release and the supplemental information posted earlier today on our website. 
As Mark mentioned, John and I will summarize the highlights of our fourth quarter results and the outlook for 2016, then we'll be happy to take your questions. 
We remain highly focused on the fundamentals of our business at Vulcan, on the clear opportunities in front of us. Regardless of recent concerns that have swept through global securities markets, we are focused on the things that we control and on our improving profitability. 
We've made a lot of progress over the last year, and we have a good report for you today. 
Aggregates volumes are up nicely. Pricing is positive. Our gross profit per ton numbers continue to be really impressive. We are controlling our cost. 
But first, I'd like to start the conversation by making 3 basic points. Number one, we finished the year strong. Our teams company-wide are executing our aggregate-focused strategy extremely well. 
Second, I assure you that we will sustain this focus into 2016. We believe these efforts will result in more than $1 billion in adjusted EBITDA this year. 
Circumstances obviously vary across our geographic footprint, but the gradual recovery and demand continues in each of our end-use segments. 
Third, our performance throughout 2015, as we continue to move through the early stages of construction recovery, demonstrated clear and steady progress towards the longer-range goals and the expectations we put forth at our Investor Day last year. With very few exceptions, construction activity in the markets we serve still remains well below long-term trends. However, we're positioned for multiple years of double-digit revenue growth, with strong conversion of those incremental sales to gross profit. 
Now I'd like to go a little deeper into our fourth quarter and full year results. John will then hit the highlights of our 2016 outlook, and I'll conclude with some observations about our path forward. 
Let me say upfront, I'm pleased with how we finished 2015. Our mindset at Vulcan is that we can always improve, and we work hard on getting better all the time in every aspect of the business. 
Shipments were strong in the fourth quarter, whenever and wherever the weather cooperated. As we noted in our third quarter call, many of our customers have seen their backlogs grow as demand continues to pick up and as they face capacity constraints. 
We saw higher levels of shipments on weekends, and many of our customers were beginning to keep their crews on as long as the weather allowed. Those trends held up through the fourth quarter. 
Firming demand and reasonably dry weather in California and Florida contributed to year-over-year shipment growth, exceeding 15% in those states. Shipments in Georgia grew by 22% despite wet weather. On the other hand, shipments increased in the low single digits in Texas. This was due to extremely wet weather in October and November. The underlying shipment trends in each of these states continue to be good. 
In total, same-store shipments for the quarter were up more than 8% in our Aggregates segment, 4% in our Asphalt segment and 2% in our Concrete segment. 
For the year, we shipped 178 million tons of aggregates. This is slightly above our midyear forecast of 177 million tons and an increase of about 10% over 2014 shipments. All in all, this was a very solid year of volume growth. 
Remember, this is from an asset base that has delivered aggregate shipments of approximately 300 million tons. As we talked about before, we are still early in the recovery towards 255 million tons, which we believe represents a more normal, mid-cycle level of shipments. 
We have a broad base of demand, both in terms of geography and end-use markets. We see each of our end-use markets continuing to grow. 
Some of our Texas markets are of the upper end of the spectrum of normalized demand, having enjoyed extremely strong growth. Most of our markets, however, are still well below normal demand and should enjoy steady growth for years to come. We are seeing good growth on both coasts with still a lot of upside. 
Other individual markets in the Central United States such as Nashville, Knoxville and Chattanooga are also continuing to strengthen. When you put it all together, the longer-term shipment trends we focus on continue to look good across most of our markets. 
Regarding pricing, we continue to experience a positive pricing environment in most of our markets. This is a result of 3 factors. First, we've invested substantial capital in the business to serve our customers and need to earn a fair return. Second, we continue to see increasing customer confidence in the recovery. And third, the construction industry is increasingly focused on improving returns on capital as volumes remain well below normal levels. 
Overall, freight-adjusted average sales price for aggregates increased 11% on a same-store basis or $1.18 per ton compared to the prior year's fourth quarter. 
In the quarter, we estimate $0.15 per ton, helped from product and geographic mix. For the full year, average selling prices increased 7%. 
Now I'd like to take a -- make a few remarks regarding our customer service and cost control efforts. Throughout the quarter, our teams did an excellent job meeting our customers' needs, including tight deadlines and complex demands on big projects, both safely and efficiently. 
During the quarter, we saw improvement in repair and maintenance costs and overtime labor costs. This improvement contributed to our strong finish for the year. Costs during the first 3 quarters of 2015 had begun to rise as increasing volumes required us to run our plants longer. This led to more repairs and higher spending on parts and supplies and associated labor. 
Now I said on our last call we are very focused on improving these costs, and we're beginning to see these improvements in September. The improvements continued, and I'm proud of our operating people for the work they have done here. We remain intensely focused on managing these costs efficiently, balancing the factors affecting production quality, service and cost.
Still, a clear picture comes with a longer-term view. For the year, our unit cost of sales in aggregates declined slightly as our employees remained focused on continuous improvement. We got better at controlling costs as the year progressed.
We also saw reduced expenditures as diesel cost declined. Setting aside external forces, our strong emphasis on cost control, near term and longer term, will not change. 
Overall, I'm pleased with the progress we've made with our execution and our focus. We continue to focus on customer service, employee development, cost control and our safety performance. We saw marked improvement in our safety performance in the fourth quarter. 
Let me emphasize, this is a continuous improvement track, a process of working to get better every day. We have made good progress, but there's still more to be done. 
A strong example of the progress we have made is the outstanding job our teams did converting incremental revenue into incremental gross profit. Flow-through in the quarter was 89% on a same-store basis; obviously, strong result. But better look at it on a trailing 12-month basis where it was 77%, well ahead of the 60% threshold we target longer term. 
Our unit profitability in aggregates continues to improve, something our employees work hard on and can be very proud of. 
Gross profit margin on a same-store basis increased 38% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year's quarter. Unit gross profit margin was $5.38 per ton. This marks 12 consecutive quarters of expanding unit margin. 
We will continue this trend. On a trailing 12-month basis, unit margin increased by 29% to $4.38 per ton. Now there's a slide you've seen before, Slide #11, that covers this, and I'd like to call your attention to it because it's impressive. 
Here, you will see that for the trailing 12 months, we shipped 178 million tons, 38 million tons more than the year prior to the start of the recovery. Aggregates segment gross profit for the year was $756 million, or $398 million ahead of the 12 months before the recovery began. 
So on 38 million tons of improvement, we have delivered almost $400 million in incremental segment gross profit. Gross profit per ton has increased $1.69 or 66% during this period. A 27% increase in shipments has been converted into an increase in gross profit in excess of 100%. 
Looking at 2015 as a whole, you can clearly see the benefits of our aggregate-focused strategy. We have the assets and capabilities in place to service our customers. We have the focused execution to drive profitability, and we have a very strong platform for continuing growth. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to John for additional comments on our earnings performance and outlook for the remainder of the year. John?"

So Tom just highlighted, and as you've seen in our release, we had a strong finish to a strong year, a year with same-store aggregate shipments up 7%; aggregates pricing up 7%; strong conversion of that incremental revenue into incremental gross profit; improved material margins in our Asphalt and Concrete businesses; and continued leveraging of SAG to revenues. We expect to see much of the same in 2016, another year of continuous compounding improvement in our execution and in our results. 
To complement the information shared in our release, I'll first offer a few comments regarding the demand environment, then outline our performance expectations for the year and briefly note our plans for capital allocation. 
As Tom said, we see a broadening recovery in demand across each of our end-use segments and across most of our geographic footprint. In total, we see demand across the markets we serve growing approximately 7% with some upside potential based on the rate at which rising DOT budgets and public infrastructure funding converts into active construction projects and material shipments. 
We project private demand in the markets we serve to grow approximately 10% year-over-year, supported by growth in both residential and nonresidential activity. We see continued double-digit growth in residential construction across our footprint, with nonresidential construction continuing to expand, albeit at a slower pace than 2015. 
Although certain measures of private nonresidential construction suggested some decline in the second half of the year, our on-the-ground view indicates continued solid growth. And importantly, employment data and other macroeconomic and demographic factors further signal a sustained recovery in private demand across our markets. 
Much has been made about the potential impact of lower oil prices, and we continue to monitor trends in private construction activity in markets such as Houston. But to date, we have not seen a materially negative impact when looking at our portfolio as a whole. 
I'll now turn to public demand, where we see 2016 being something of a transition year and in a positive way. 
Across our markets, we expect demand growth tied to public construction of approximately 5%. Longer-term visibility with respect to public demand has improved markedly with the passage of the federal highway bill, state-level funding initiatives and record levels of local tax receipts. 
In addition, the public construction share of tax receipts remains at 20-year lows and at ultimately unsustainable levels. 
This shift to higher levels of total public funding, combined with greater visibility, should allow for a higher percentage of new construction in the mix, which bodes well for our materials demand and, in our case, product balance. All of this is good. But at this point, we don't see the full benefit of these trends impacting our volumes until 2017 and beyond. 
We will monitor the lag between DOT budgets rising and a commensurate increase in project activity throughout the year. But to be clear, rising public construction activity is beginning to kick in, with the question being at what pace. 
Finally, we continue to see the overall rate of recovery in many markets constrained by construction labor shortages and other bottlenecks in the total construction supply chain. Although the situation can inhibit the overall rate of shipment growth in the near term and lengthen the time required to return to normalized levels, it does provide further support for disciplined increases in pricing, margins, and ultimately, returns on capital. 
So against this backdrop of approximately 7% total demand growth in 2016, what do we expect to deliver in terms of financial results? As we have stated, our 2016 guidance is for between $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion in adjusted EBITDA, an approximately 25% increase over 2015. 
We don't give quarterly guidance, as you know, and we encourage investors to consider longer-term trends in addition to quarter-to-quarter results. 
I will now comment on certain of the factors and assumptions underpinning our annual guidance. You should consider these figures to be midpoints of current management expectations and keep in mind that our results vary widely across the individual markets we serve. 
Starting with aggregate shipments, we're projecting a total of 191 million tons or an increase of 7% over the prior year. 
On a geographic basis, we expect the growth in 2016 to be relatively widespread, with higher rates in markets such as Arizona, Florida, Georgia and Southern California offsetting lower-than-average rates in markets such as Texas, where we see continued growth but at a slower rate than the company as a whole, and Illinois, where we project a small decline in year-over-year shipments. 
And as with 2015, we may see a greater share of shipments occur in the second half of the year, in part due to the impact of El Niño weather on our Western states and in part due to the expected flow of large project activity throughout the year. 
Again, as Tom noted, the overall pricing climate for our materials remains positive and constructive. We're entering the year with good momentum, and we currently expect freight-adjusted average selling prices for aggregates to increase 7% in 2016, in line with the increase seen in 2015. 
Please keep in mind that pricing decisions in our business are made locally, with wide variances by product type and geography. Our local teams will continue to balance pricing, customer service, operating efficiencies and the overall sales and production mix, all with an eye toward improving total unit margins and earning a fair return on capital employed. 
These shipment and pricing expectations, of course, suggest mid-double-digit growth in freight-adjusted revenues for the Aggregates segment. We expect to continue converting these incremental revenues into incremental gross profit at a 60% or higher rate. 
Consistent with this view, we expect gross profit in the segment to increase by approximately 25% year-over-year, and we expect to realize continued improvements in our per ton margins. 
We also expect to see continued profit improvement in our Asphalt and Concrete segments, following on the strong gains posted in 2015. We currently project gross profit for these segments combined to increase approximately 20% in 2016. These operations are well positioned to benefit from the continued recovery in demand due to improvements to our asset portfolio as well as our internal operating efficiencies. 
Our current forecast for SAG is $295 million, approximately 3% growth over 2016. We plan to continue to leverage SAG to sales even as we make important investments in our sales and customer service capabilities. Administrative headcount should remain essentially flat year-over-year. 
So to recap, we expect to see in 2016 much the same of which you've seen in a very positive 2015 as well as through the entire early stage of the recovery so far. Our people at all levels of the organization are focused on helping our customers grow, controlling what they can control and driving continuously improved results for our shareholders and other stakeholders. 
Now I'll conclude with some brief remarks regarding capital allocation. Our aggregate-centric strategy and the way we manage it day by day is geared toward generating significant amounts of free cash flow, even in periods of depressed demand. That's by design, as you'd expect, and we give it a great deal of focus. 
Our priorities for allocating net cash flow and managing the inherent cyclicality of our business have not changed from those we've outlined at different times over the course of the last year or so. 
In short, we intend to balance 3 objectives: reinvesting in the business for productivity and growth; maintaining adequate financial strength and flexibility; and a disciplined return of capital to shareholders. 
With respect to reinvestment, I'll note that we plan to allocate approximately $275 million of cash this year to what we call core CapEx. That is reinvestment to sustain and improve the performance and productivity of our current operations. 
In addition, we expect to invest a meaningful amount in growth, whether in the form of acquisitions or the internal development of new production and distribution capacity. 
With respect to financial strength and flexibility, I'll note that our debt-to-EBITDA ratio has lowered to 2.4x. Refinancing activities during 2015 extended our debt durations while lowering our weighted average interest rate. 
We do not expect to use cash in the near term to lower our total debt of approximately $2 billion. Rather, we have the financing capacity and the liquidity needed to fund smart reinvestments and growth such as those I just mentioned. And we intend to maintain that flexibility throughout the cycle. 
And finally, we expect the amount of capital returned to shareholders to increase as the recovery moves forward. 
As noted previously, we expect the dividend to grow roughly in line with earnings during the recovery phase of the cycle. We also expect to use opportunistic share repurchase to return additional capital over time. 
And with that, I'll hand the call back to Tom."

You've heard me talk about the strong year we had and the things we consistently focus on to deliver superior results. Ours is a long-term business. We set long-range goals and work hard to get where we think we can be, given our world-class assets and people. 
We are pleased with our 2015 results and the way we are positioned for future success. We've made clear progress towards the goals that we set forth in our Investor Day last February and are very much on track. 
We're on track to achieve $2 billion in EBITDA at normal levels of demand. We're on track moving steadily towards a normalized demand level of 255 million tons per year for Vulcan aggregates. We're on track for continuing gradual recovery in each major end market and in most of our geographies. We now have a fully funded long-term highway bill, and we are very pleased to see healthy increases in state and local funding for highways and other public construction. 
We continue to anticipate Aggregates segment cash gross profit at normal demand in the range of $8.25 per ton. This will be the result of solid sales execution, continued growth weighted towards our more profitable geographies, pricing fundamentals that continue to strengthen and consistently strong incremental margins. 
At normal demand levels, we also see greater profitability in our non-Aggregates segment in the range of $175 million. Here, we benefit from continuing operating discipline and improvements, the strength in portfolio that came with our asset swap in early 2015 and improving materials margins. 
We also remain on track with SAG costs, moving towards 6% as a percent of sales. SAG as a percent of revenue declined 70 basis points in 2015. We intend to further leverage SAG to sales growth. 
As we look forward, we believe that we are well positioned for several years of double-digit top line growth with strong conversion to the bottom line. 
No matter how you look at this, I'm pleased to tell you that we are executing well, and that is the watchword of our people: execute, execute, execute. Control your own destiny and finish strong. I am very proud of our people and the good work they are doing. I can promise you that we are all committed to making a good company better every day. We are excited about where we are today, and we're even more excited about where this company is going.

So kind of breaking that down a little bit, Dallas, Fort Worth, San Antonio, West Texas, all have very healthy demand growth that we think will flow into 2016. Houston and some of the coastal markets may have some softening in the private side. But overall, I think that when you look at Texas, it's still growing."

A couple of things we think about as we look at next year. One is that we expect to have higher stripping costs as we prepare for future growth. And those are items that are expensed in the current year, but they really prepare us for growth over multiple years. Sets a bit of a factor we're considering in our '16 outlook, and we're also keeping an eye on what happens with diesel prices throughout the year.

Keep in mind that our Asphalt business over time is really well exposed, if you will, to increases in public funding across many states. And so while the short-term margin structure perhaps can fluctuate, long term, the returns on capital can be very stable and very attractive. Again, tied to public funding, a little bit more unbalanced. To your point on Aggregate margins per ton, first, I'll draw your attention to the longer term as kind of how we think about the business. As you heard Tom say, we think we're very much on track with the longer-term outlook we put out at our Investor Day a year ago, which would imply on a cash basis per ton margins north of $8. And if you look and see what's happening at pricing, if you look and see what's happening in our operating leverage, if you look at our results so far to the recovery, we are at least on track with that long-term goal. And that's -- I want to draw your attention to that because that's really how we think about it. In the shorter term for '16, we continue to expect margins per ton to increase faster than the rate of pricing. So the year-over-year increase might be around 20% roughly, maybe slightly below that. And again, that ties back to a flow-through that is above the long-term 60% threshold but a little bit below last year. So we think it's a reasonable expectation, something we're confident our teams can deliver on."

Obviously, asphalt prices tend to be at the high end of the spectrum, base at the low, but I think it would -- it could possibly help prices, but I'd probably tell you, it will probably be pretty neutral."

Construction activity has a long way to recover. It's not even driven by new economic growth. And at the levels we're talking about, we'd still have multiple years before we get back to 45-year trends of normal consumption. Mid- to high single-digit shipment growth with mid- to high-single-digit revenue growth, if I can do the math correctly, is more than double-digit revenue growth. And as with this continuous steady rate of gradual recovery, is it going to be a perfect straight line, an absolute linear quarter-to-quarter? Of course not. History hasn't worked that way. But history would also show that we absolutely recover to normal and then in fact expand beyond that. So I think if you take a longer-term view, it's actually -- it's not -- in fact, it's, if anything, conservative relative to history."

But in the quarter, you saw that our total cost of sales per unit declined and that was a combination of, as you said, continued diesel benefit year-over-year roughly in the range of what you discussed. But unlike previous quarters, we did a better job of managing our per ton expenses of R&M and some other costs. And so, on balance, we had a decline in cost of sales for the quarter, and I think you saw that. For the year, we had a slight decline in total cost of sales, and that was really diesel benefits offsetting some rising per ton of cost that were -- we commented on throughout the year in terms of R&M, parts and supplies, associated labor with that, et cetera, as well as some overtime labors that ramped up production. We're really pleased with the execution we had in the fourth quarter. We're not taking for granted that all those issues are behind us. We're still ramping up production, and we're still well below what you would normally think of as the sweet spot of our production levels in many of our plants.

I think for the year, we executed better than we forecasted to be honest. So my comments on SAG, which is probably a number I'd like to be 0 as a CFO, but our comments on SAG would be that administrative headcount year-on-year remained essentially flat, so the core wage element of our SAG was well in control. The variances were driven by fringes, which is pension, payroll taxes, some deferred comp calculations, those kind of things, which we -- and frankly just didn't forecast as well as I would like to at the beginning of the year. Some of those were driven a little bit higher with our rising stock price. We also had higher outside services fees and professionals fees. Those were legal and tax, and a couple other items associated with some changes we're making and to some investments we're making in the sales side of our business. And then finally, our sales headcount was modestly higher in the year and our SAG associated with that as we continue to invest in growth for the future. So again, I think the execution was solid. We'd like to see that number grow at more like 3% than what we saw in the past year. We'll work to control it, and we'll certainly continue to leverage its sales."

I think what you'll also see is it will be 2 things. It will be -- part of it will be expansion in new projects, which we love because they're more aggregate-intensive, but you've got a lot of states like South Carolina that really are -- and a number of other states that really have a lot of maintenance issues that will flow through very quickly. They may not be large projects, but with that funding there, they'll go ahead, and these are overlays and things like that which will come faster than the large projects."

Is that because of new equipment that's coming in, some of the growth CapEx to help bring those numbers down? And then the second part to the question was around labor cost with lower overtime.

But it's really -- what we really focus on, while we do that and do that appropriately -- what we really focus on is doing proper preventative maintenance and timing and fixing things the right way the first time so you're not throwing good money after bad. When it comes to whether it's labor or uses of diesel or cost in general, I think it's that continuous focus on operating efficiencies. You heard us talk about we struggled with labor. We defy our folks to find it. And then actually in the back third of the year, it wasn't just the last quarter, it was September 4, they made significant improvements on their efficiencies of labor and their planning. And again -- so you're correct about shifts, where you're bringing things up and you're running multiple crews between even more plants. Labor can be a challenge without appropriate planning. I am very pleased with our operating people that they're never being satisfied, they're campaigning for continuous improvement and they focus and work on it every day, and I give them credit. They're never satisfied, and they work tirelessly on it. But all of this is about compounding that continuous improvement to give us the margin expansion that we've enjoyed over the last 10 quarters. And that speaks to that never being satisfied and that continuous campaign to improve and improve those operating efficiencies."

These are described in detail in the company's SEC reports, including our earnings release and our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
In addition, during this call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You will find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other related information in our earnings release and at the end of this presentation.

I hope you've had time to review our earnings release and the supplemental information posted earlier today on our website. As you saw reflected in our financi",1095,"Thank you, Mark, and thanks to all of you for joining us for our first quarter earnings call. I hope you've had time to review our earnings release and the supplemental information posted earlier today on our website. 
As you saw reflected in our financial results, our teams really hit on all cylinders during the first quarter, particularly in our core Aggregates segment. 
We've met our customers' need for higher volumes of material. We continue to migrate prices upward with an eye towards longer-term returns on capital. We've leveraged fixed costs and lowered our unit cost of goods sold even after excluding the impact of lower diesel cost. And obviously, our margins and total profits for the quarter grew rapidly as a result. 
On a 21% gain in total freight-adjusted revenues for the company, our teams delivered 112% gain in total gross profit. It is certainly true that you can't extrapolate the full picture from a single core results, but when you look at our results in the context of the last several quarters, you see very solid and improving fundamentals. 
Several themes about this quarter really stand out in my mind, and I'd like to spend a little time discussing them with you. 
As a starting point, I want to emphasize that we continue to believe that the recovery in our market still has a long way to go. Our business is in the midst of a long gradual recovery and demand. It's not unusual in such recovery to experience periods of relatively faster and slower growth. And certainly, our first quarter saw a number of positive things come together all at once. But we are still in the early stages of recovery for the construction economy. 
For example, to underscore a point, we entered 2016 in terms of per capita aggregate demand relative to long-term averages, pretty close to where we were at the time of the 1982 recession. 
Having said that, clearly, the fundamentals of our business and our core aggregate focus strategy are very strong. This is to our way of thinking a recovery with real staying power. Of course, we will take 70% shipment growth whenever we can get it, but what impresses me about the quarter and really the last 12-plus month is the solid additional evidence of a sustained and sustainable recovery. It's supported by growth in all of our end-use market, with public demand just beginning to strengthen. It is taking hold in more of our key market and is leading to volume gains in more of our key facilities, and it is supported by longer-term fundamentals, including sustained gains in construction employment, state and local revenue help, and early signs of rising wages and income. We will see some ebbs and flows in the rate of demand recovery and our shipment growth, but that's to be expected particularly quarter-to-quarter. 
The first quarter reinforces an important point. This recovery is real, it's broad-based and our geographic breadth and positioning will serve as well as the recovery moves forward. 
The first quarter provide a clear snapshot of this fact. Our overall shipments grew more than 15% even though our Texas and California businesses were flat to down. This is another indicator of a recovery with real staying power. 
Our second point is that our local teams throughout the company are not only executing well, they're also adapting well to changing market conditions. They've performed well and have maintained operating discipline and focus while challenged by rapidly increasing volumes. They're focused on the ability to adapt, their expertise in balancing product mix, pricing and greater efficiencies day-to-day and week-to-week bode well for our future. 
It can be easy to lose our focus when adjusting and adapting to rising customer demands, quantity and quality of product, all the while hiring new staff and adjusting shift structures. And finally, you have some profitability tailwinds at your back such as lower diesel cost and higher product pricing. There could be a tendency to lose some operating discipline, but this hasn't happened. When demand has risen, our plant level teams have adjusted just as quickly to meet customer needs. They're highly focused on the operating details critical to our long-term success and are acting with discipline to ensure peak operating efficiencies. 
Our sales teams have also responded effectively to ensure we're serving each market segment well and our sales and operating teams has stayed coordinated in balancing production and demand for driving earnings while helping our customers growth. 
We're going to face some operating challenges as the recovery continues and as we grow. That's just the nature of operating more than 340 facilities across many states. But I take an extra measure of confidence from how well our teams have responded over the last 2 quarters. 
Finally, a third point that strikes me as I reflect on the quarter and trends in our business. That's the pay off from our aggregates focus and from our commitment to continuous compounding improvement in all aspects of our business. 
We brought our division presidents, our senior line leaders from around the country together recently and one of the things we discussed was the importance of keeping our energy, which is electric. I can tell you right now that our people remain driven, hungry for growth and improved performance. 
Our people, many of whom have 15, 20, even 30-plus years in the business know that we are a long way for normal demand and the corresponding profitability on our business. We live this every day with many plans still running part-time and many crews still without full-time work. Our people are balancing immediate customer needs with the maintenance and investment required to serve the growth that is coming. So our job is to keep tapping into that pride that since the ownership and competitive spirit in order to keep getting better day in and day out. And certainly, our shareholders benefit for this emphasis of continuous compounding improvement. 
As you've seen, we continue to expand our margins faster than pricing alone and that improvement drives better returns on capital and allows for financially sound reinvestment. This recovery began in the second half of 2013, our gross profit per ton in our Aggregates segment has improved $2 or 78% on a trailing 12-month basis. 
The drivers of this improvement are many and to some may seem dull, but the impact on our lasting franchise value is anything but dull. 
Having shared these observations, and I'll hand it over to John for some brief commentary regarding our outlook. John?"

I'll start with the headline, which was also noted in our release. Our full year 2016 guidance for adjusted EBITDA remains unchanged at $1 billion to $1.1 billion. That said, we entered the second quarter trackin",1017,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with the headline, which was also noted in our release. 
Our full year 2016 guidance for adjusted EBITDA remains unchanged at $1 billion to $1.1 billion. That said, we entered the second quarter tracking toward the high end of that range. 
Now looking at our first quarter results and that our momentum over the last few quarters as well as listening to the comments Tom just shared, some of you may ask, why are we not raising guidance at this time. Well, we'd like to be clear one more time that if not because we lack confidence in the business's long-term fundamentals. If anything, the confidence has risen, and that confidence and the recovery with multiple end-use segments and geographic drivers and a constructive pricing climate allowing for more fair and adequate returns on capital as we move forward and our ability to execute and to adapt to changing market conditions. Nor do we see any imminent threats that we're just failing to mention. 
Simply put, it's early, and we need to take some care not to over interpret any single quarter's results. We caution against it. 
As we've said frequently before, we encourage investors to also focus on longer-term trend. We believe that helps separate the signal from the noise, if you will. 
And for this reason, you see us incorporate training 12-month figures and other longer-term trend information into our release and supporting materials. 
With those caution shared, let me offer a few more comments regarding our current outlook for the balance of the year. We currently expect same-store aggregate shipments to be up 8% to 9% for fiscal year '16 over fiscal year '15. This compares to our early February expectation of up 7%. 
Certainly, our first quarter shipments evidenced underlying strength and demand even after adjusting for weather and other favorable factors. 
Publicly-funded construction activity has shown some year-over-year strength. Although the effects of the federal FAST Act and recent state and local funding initiatives have, for the most part, yet to flow to the system. 
And some of our end customers appear to be adding some capacity, albeit prudently and gradually. 
Our updated same-store shipment growth expectation is roughly in line with the rate seen over the trailing 12 months. Again, we expect the growth rates will fluctuate month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter as the recovery moves forward. That has been the pattern of this recovery and the past recoveries. But we're also seeing a recovery although it has a good ways to go that continues to see more geographic markets and more end-use segments participate fully. 
With respect to Aggregates pricing, we continue to project year-over-year growth and freight-adjusted average selling prices of approximately 7%. 
First quarter price showed approximately 2% sequential improvement over fourth quarter pricing. Price increases that took effect in January and as of April 1 were generally well accepted by the marketplace and in line with our beginning of the year expectations. 
Aggregate unit margins should continue to expand faster than pricing, although the pace of that growth may very quarter-to-quarter. As you saw in the first quarter, we're beginning to see some very good operating leverage as we leverage fixed cost to sales. 
And our overall cost performance of late has benefited from lower diesel prices. Of course, those costs may rise as the year moves forward with some lag in corresponding product pricing. 
We continue to expect year-on-year gross profit growth in our Asphalt, Concrete and Calcium segments of approximately 20% collectively. Our local leaders continue to manage material margins in those businesses very well, although they may see some downward pressure from currently strong levels as the year moves forward. 
SAG cost were elevated in the first quarter, primarily due to incentive compensation related to accruals, tied to our financial and stock price performance. We currently expect full year SAG cost to remain roughly in line with our February guidance, and we will continue to leverage SAG expenses to revenues. 
Absent the FX of performance-based compensation and certain investments in our sales capabilities, overhead expenses have grown in approximately 3% rate since 2013. 
Our target for core capital expenditure investments remains at $275 million for the year. Although we may elect to pull forward some future spending if justified by compelling sourcing opportunities, for example, lower heavy equipment costs resulting from pressures across the global mining sector. 
You'll see $108 million of PP&E investment reflected in our Q1 financials. A couple of comments. We typically work to front-load our spending on heavy mobile equipment, in part so that we can see the benefits of associated operating efficiencies during the heavy construction season. 
In the PP&E spending figures in the financials also includes certain internal growth capital investments. For example, shifts to serve our Yucatán operation, development of new quarry site and development of new distribution facilities such as the rail yard we just opened in Savannah, Georgia. 
Including these internal growth adjustments, our total cash outlay for the year could be approximately $400 million. 
Vulcan's financial strength and flexibility allow for a balance of smart reinvestment, pursuit of acquisition leg growth opportunities and the ongoing return of capital to shareholders.  Our overall capital structure and capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. 
During the first quarter, both S&P and Fitch raised our credit ratings to investment-grade status. 
During Q1, we returned approximately $50 million to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. We repurchased 257,000 shares during the quarter at an average purchase price of approximately $103. 
I'll conclude my remarks by noting that our Q1 results represented another solid step toward our longer-term goals to the company's profitability when market demand recovers to long-term, normalized levels. Inside of Vulcan, we have very much keep our eye on those longer-term goals. We have a lot of growth and a lot of work ahead of us, but the continues compounding improvement that Tom referred to have us well on track and well prepared for the opportunities and challenges that will inevitably arise over the years to come. 
Tom, back over to you."

And just an attempt to give you some more color as best we can. Again first I would highlight that as we look at a trailing 12-month basis, even excluding the positive effects of diesel, our overall unit cost of sales is essentially flat. So what's really behind that if you take, again, a trailing 12-month view is that our teams are doing a great job and they've been able to get some real operating leverage, volumes have increased, and that's offset some of the cost pressures that come from higher R&M that we've been talking about. So all in all, they've done a great job. We've really seen that the last 2 quarters, we hope to keep seeing it going forward, we'll keep an eye on it. But we're certainly very pleased to see that, that cost performance.  In the quarter, our average diesel prices probably about $1.30, probably $5 million, $6 million of benefit from that in total. But again, what we'd underscore -- and then on R&M, in the quarter, as we said is still to give you a rough quarter of magnitude the way we look at is probably $0.08 up per ton. So that's an issue we managed tightly, we keep an eye on it. But in the context of overall margin structure, it's not a defining characteristic. So again, we continue to manage it well. Our team is doing a great job. We're beginning to see some real operating leverage and importantly, even excluding the benefits of diesel, we've been able to keep cost relatively flat."

While it's been on gradual recovery, the volumes are -- recovery still early. I think what -- as John said, what I'm pleased to see is that over the last 12-plus months or 5 quarters, we're seeing a trend of the other cost and operating efficiencies start to improve, which tells me that we're leveraging the volume, not all in the fixed cost but also in some of the variable cost and then operating efficiency. So to John's point, I think our folks are doing are real good job, adjusting and adapting to rapidly changing volumes. We have a long way to go and I think that as this will continue to mature and the recovery will continue -- that fixed cost and variable cost volume leverage."

Rather than walk through each slide, Tom and John will summarize the highlights of our quarterly results and outlook. We believe this approach will assist your analysis and will allow more time to respond to your questions. 
With that said, please be reminded that comments regarding the company's results and projections may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, including general economic and business conditions, the timing and amount of federal, state and local funding for infrastructure; the highly competitive nature of construction materials industry; and other risks and uncertainties. These are described in detail in the company's SEC reports, including our earnings release and our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
In addition, during this call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You will find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other related information in our earnings release and at the end of this presentation.

I hope you've had time to review our earnings release and the supplemental information posted earlier today on our website. As you saw reflected in our financial",1093,"Thank you, Mark, and thanks all of you for joining us for our first quarter earnings call. I hope you've had time to review our earnings release and the supplemental information posted earlier today on our website. 
As you saw reflected in our financial results, our teams really hit on all cylinders during the first quarter, particularly in our core Aggregates segment. We met our customers' needs for higher volumes of material. We continue to migrate prices upward with an eye towards longer-term returns on capital. We leveraged fixed costs and lowered our unit cost of goods sold even after excluding the impact of lower diesel cost. And obviously, our margins and total profits for the quarter grew rapidly as a result. 
On a 21% gain in total freight-adjusted revenues for the company, our teams delivered 112% gain in total gross profit. It is certainly true that you can't extrapolate the full picture from a single quarter's results, but when you look at our results in the context of the last several quarters, you see very solid and improving fundamentals. Several themes about this quarter really stand out in my mind, and I'd like to spend a little time discussing them with you. 
As a starting point, I want to emphasize that we continue to believe that the recovery in our market still has a long way to go. Our business is in the midst of a long gradual recovery in demand. It's not unusual in such recovery to experience periods of relatively faster and slower growth. And certainly, our first quarter saw a number of positive things come together all at once. But we are still in early stages of recovery for the construction economy. 
For example, to underscore the point, we entered 2016 in terms of per capita aggregate demand relative to long-term averages, pretty close to where we were at the time of the 1982 recession. Having said that, clearly, the fundamentals of our business and our core aggregate-focus strategy are very strong. This is, to our way of thinking, a recovery with real staying power. Of course, we will take 17% shipment growth whenever we can get it, but what impresses me about the quarter and really the last 12-plus months is the solid additional evidence of a sustained and sustainable recovery. It's supported by growth in all of our end-use market, with public demand just beginning to strengthen. It is taking hold in more of our key market and is leading to volume gains in more of our key facilities, and it is supported by longer-term fundamentals, including sustained gains in construction employment, state and local revenue help, and early signs of rising wages and income. We will see some ebbs and flows in the rate of demand recovery in our shipment growth, but that's to be expected particularly quarter-to-quarter. 
The first quarter reinforces an important point: This recovery is real. It's broad-based and our geographic breadth and positioning will serve us well as the recovery moves forward. The first quarter provided a clear snapshot of this fact. Our overall shipments grew more than 15% even though our Texas and California businesses were flat to down. This is another indicator of a recovery with real staying power. 
Our second point is that our local teams throughout the company are not only executing well, they are also adapting well to changing market conditions. They have performed well and have maintained operating discipline and focus while challenged by rapidly increasing volumes. Their focus and ability to adapt, their expertise in balancing product mix, pricing and greater efficiencies day-to-day and week-to-week bode well for our future. It can be easy to lose our focus when adjusting and adapting to rising customer demands to quantity and quality of product, all the while hiring new staff and adjusting shift structures. 
And finally, you have some profitability tailwinds at your back such as lower diesel cost and higher product pricing. There could be a tendency to lose some operating discipline, but this hasn't happened. When demand has risen, our plant-level teams have adjusted just as quickly to meet customer needs. They're highly focused on the operating details critical to our long-term success and are acting with discipline to ensure peak operating efficiencies. 
Our sales teams have also responded effectively to ensure we're serving each market segment well. And our sales and operating teams has stayed coordinated in balancing production and demand. We're driving earnings while helping our customers grow. 
We're going to face some operating challenges as the recovery continues and as we grow. That's just the nature of operating more than 340 facilities across many states. But I take an extra measure of confidence from how well our teams have responded over the last 2 quarters. 
Finally, a third point that strikes me as I reflect on the quarter and trends in our business. That's the payoff from our aggregates focus and from our commitment to continuous compounding improvement in all aspects of our business. 
We brought our division presidents, our senior line leaders from around the country together recently and one of the things we discussed was the importance of keeping our energy, which is electric. I can tell you right now that our people remain driven, hungry for growth and improved performance. 
Our people, many of whom have 15, 20, even 30-plus years in the business, know that we are a long way from normal demand and the corresponding profitability in our business. We live this every day with many plants still running part time and many crews still without full-time work. Our people are balancing immediate customer needs with the maintenance and investment required to serve the growth that is coming. So our job is to keep tapping into that pride, that sense of ownership and competitive spirit in order to keep getting better day in and day out. And certainly, our shareholders benefit for this emphasis on continuous compounding improvement. 
As you've seen, we continued to expand our margins faster than pricing alone and that improvement drives better returns on capital and allows for financially sound reinvestment. This recovery began in the second half of 2013, our gross profit per ton in our Aggregates segment has improved $2 or 78% on a trailing 12-month basis. The drivers of this improvement are many and to some, may seem dull, but the impact on our lasting franchise value is anything but dull. 
Having shared these observations, I'll now hand it over to John for some brief commentary regarding our outlook. John?"

I'll start with the headline, which was also noted in our release. Our full year 2016 guidance for adjusted EBITDA remains unchanged at $1 billion to $1.1 billion. That said, we entered the second quarter tracking",1019,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with the headline, which was also noted in our release. Our full year 2016 guidance for adjusted EBITDA remains unchanged at $1 billion to $1.1 billion. That said, we entered the second quarter tracking toward the high end of that range. 
Now looking at our first quarter results and at our momentum over the last few quarters as well as listening to the comments Tom just shared, some of you may ask, why are we not raising guidance at this time? Well, we'd like to be clear one more time that it's not because we lack confidence in the business's long-term fundamentals. If anything, that confidence has risen, and that's confidence in the recovery with multiple end-use segments and geographic drivers and a constructive pricing climate allowing for more fair and adequate returns on capital as we move forward and in our internal ability to execute and to adapt to changing market conditions. Nor do we see any imminent threats that we're just failing to mention. 
Simply put, it's early, and we need to take some care not to over interpret any single quarter's results. We caution against it. 
As we have said frequently before, we encourage investors to also focus on longer-term trends. We believe that helps separate the signal from the noise, if you will. And for this reason, you see us incorporate trailing-12-month figures and other longer-term trend information into our release and supporting materials. 
With those caution shared, let me offer a few more comments regarding our current outlook for the balance of the year. We currently expect same-store aggregate shipments to be up 8% to 9% for fiscal year '16 over fiscal year '15. This compares to our early February expectation of up 7%. Certainly, our first quarter shipments evidenced underlying strength in demand even after adjusting for weather and other favorable factors. 
Publicly funded construction activity has shown some year-over-year strength. Although the effects of the federal FAST Act and recent state and local funding initiatives have, for the most part, yet to flow to the system. And some of our end customers appear to be adding some capacity, albeit prudently and gradually. 
Our updated same-store shipment growth expectation is roughly in line with the rate seen over the trailing 12 months. Again, we expect the growth rates will fluctuate month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter as the recovery moves forward. That has been the pattern of this recovery and of past recoveries. But we're also seeing a recovery, although it has a good ways to go, that continues to see more geographic markets and more end-use segments participate fully. 
With respect to Aggregates pricing, we continue to project year-over-year growth in freight-adjusted average selling prices of approximately 7%. First quarter prices showed approximately 2% sequential improvement over fourth quarter pricing. Price increases that took effect in January and as of April 1 were generally well accepted by the marketplace and in line with our ""beginning of the year"" expectations. 
Aggregate unit margins should continue to expand faster than pricing, although the pace of that growth may vary quarter-to-quarter. As you saw in the first quarter, we're beginning to see some very good operating leverage as we leverage fixed cost to sales. And our overall cost performance of late has benefited from lower diesel prices. Of course, those costs may rise as the year moves forward with some lag in corresponding product pricing. 
We continue to expect year-on-year gross profit growth in our Asphalt, Concrete and Calcium segments of approximately 20% collectively. Our local leaders continue to manage material margins in those businesses very well, although they may see some downward pressure from currently strong levels as the year moves forward. 
SAG costs were elevated in the first quarter, primarily due to incentive compensation related to accruals, tied to our financial and stock price performance. We currently expect full year SAG costs to remain roughly in line with our February guidance, and we will continue to leverage SAG expenses to revenues. Absent the effects of performance-based compensation and certain investments in our sales capabilities, overhead expenses have grown in approximately 3% rate since 2013. 
Our target for core capital expenditure investments remains at $275 million for the year. Although we may elect to pull forward some future spending if justified by compelling sourcing opportunities, for example, lower heavy equipment costs resulting from pressures across the global mining sector. 
You'll see $108 million of PP&E investment reflected in our Q1 financials. A couple of comments. We typically work to front load our spending on heavy mobile equipment, in part so that we can see the benefits of associated operating efficiencies during the heavy construction season. And the PP&E spending figures in the financials also includes certain internal growth capital investments. For example, ships to serve our Yucatán operation, development of new quarry site and development of new distribution facilities, such as the rail yard we just opened in Savannah, Georgia. Including these internal growth adjustments, our total cash outlay for the year could be approximately $400 million. 
Vulcan's financial strength and flexibility allow for a balance of smart reinvestment, pursuit of acquisition-led growth opportunities and the ongoing return of capital to shareholders. Our overall capital structure and capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. 
During the first quarter, both S&P and Fitch raised our credit ratings to investment-grade status. During Q1, we returned approximately $50 million to shareholders via dividend and share repurchases. We repurchased 257,000 shares during the quarter at an average purchase price of approximately $103. 
I'll conclude my remarks by noting that our Q1 results represent another solid step toward our longer-term goals to the company's profitability when market demand recovers to long-term, normalized levels. Inside of Vulcan, we very much keep our eye on those longer-term goals. We have a lot of growth and a lot of work ahead of us, but the continuous compounding improvement that Tom referred to have us well on track and well prepared for the opportunities and challenges that will inevitably arise over the years to come. 
Tom, back over to you."

It was difficult to say if we had a little bit of pull forward or a little bit of, I'm going to call it, overflow from 2015 where, for example, in North Carolina and South Carolina, some fourth quarter shipments were delayed by the bad weather they had. But as best we can tell, however you adjust for it, we are seeing some strengthening in demand across more geographies, across more end-use segments.

Again, first thing we'd highlight that as -- if you look on a trailing 12-month basis, even excluding the positive effects of diesel, our overall unit cost of sales is essentially flat. So what's really behind that, if you take, again, a trailing 12-month view is that our teams are doing a great job, and they've been able to get some real operating leverages. Volumes have increased, and that's offset some of the cost pressures that come from higher R&M that we've been talking about. So all in all, they've doing a great job. We've really seen that the last 2 quarters, we hope to keep seeing it going forward, we'll keep an eye on it. But we're certainly very pleased to see that cost performance. In the quarter, our average diesel price is probably about $1.30, probably $5 million, $6 million of benefit from that in total. But again, what we'd underscore -- and then on R&M, in the quarter, as we said, it was still elevated. To give you a rough order of magnitude, the way we look at it, it's probably $0.08 up per ton. So that's an issue we manage tightly. We keep an eye on it. But in the context of our overall margin structure, it's not a defining characteristic. So again, we're continuing to manage it well.

I think what -- as John said, what I'm pleased to see is that over the last 12-plus months or 5 quarters, we're seeing a trend of the other cost and the operating efficiencies start to improve, which tells me that we're leveraging the volume, not only in the fixed cost, but also in some of the variable costs and the operating efficiency. So to John's point, I think our folks are doing a real good job adjusting and adapting to rapidly changing volumes. We have a long way to go and I think that as this would -- continues to mature and the recovery will continue, we'll continue to see that fixed cost and variable cost volume leverage."

Rather than walk through each slide, Tom and John will summarize the highlights of our quarterly results and outlook. We believe this approach will assist your analysis and will allow more time to respond to your questions.

These are described in detail in the company's SEC reports, including our earnings release and our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
In addition, during this call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You will find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other related information in our earnings release and at the end of this presentation.

As you saw reflected in our financial",1095,"Thank you, Mark, and thanks all of you for joining us for our first quarter earnings call. I hope you've had time to review our earnings release and the supplemental information posted earlier today on our website. 
As you saw reflected in our financial results, our teams really hit on all cylinders during the first quarter, particularly in our core Aggregates segment. We met our customers' needs for higher volumes of material. We continue to migrate prices upward with an eye towards longer-term returns on capital. We leveraged fixed costs and lowered our unit cost of goods sold even after excluding the impact of lower diesel cost. And obviously, our margins and total profits for the quarter grew rapidly as a result. 
On a 21% gain in total freight-adjusted revenues for the company, our teams delivered 112% gain in total gross profit. It is certainly true that you can't extrapolate the full picture from a single quarter's results, but when you look at our results in the context of the last several quarters, you see very solid and improving fundamentals. Several themes about this quarter really stand out in my mind, and I'd like to spend a little time discussing them with you. 
As a starting point, I want to emphasize that we continue to believe that the recovery in our market still has a long way to go. Our business is in the midst of a long gradual recovery in demand. It's not unusual in such recovery to experience periods of relatively faster and slower growth. And certainly, our first quarter saw a number of positive things come together all at once. But we are still in early stages of recovery for the construction economy. 
For example, to underscore the point, we entered 2016 in terms of per capita aggregate demand relative to long-term averages, pretty close to where we were at the time of the 1982 recession. Having said that, clearly, the fundamentals of our business and our core aggregate-focus strategy are very strong. This is, to our way of thinking, a recovery with real staying power. Of course, we will take 17% shipment growth whenever we can get it, but what impresses me about the quarter and really the last 12-plus months is the solid additional evidence of a sustained and sustainable recovery. It's supported by growth in all of our end-use market, with public demand just beginning to strengthen. It is taking hold in more of our key markets and is leading to volume gains in more of our key facilities, and it is supported by longer-term fundamentals, including sustained gains in construction employment, state and local revenue help, and early signs of rising wages and income. We will see some ebbs and flows in the rate of demand recovery in our shipment growth, but that's to be expected particularly quarter-to-quarter. 
The first quarter reinforces an important point: This recovery is real. It's broad-based and our geographic breadth and positioning will serve us well as the recovery moves forward. The first quarter provided a clear snapshot of this fact. Our overall shipments grew more than 15% even though our Texas and California businesses were flat to down. This is another indicator of a recovery with real staying power. 
Our second point is that our local teams throughout the company are not only executing well, they are also adapting well to changing market conditions. They have performed well and have maintained operating discipline and focus while challenged by rapidly increasing volumes. Their focus and ability to adapt, their expertise in balancing product mix, pricing and greater efficiencies day-to-day and week-to-week bode well for our future. It can be easy to lose our focus when adjusting and adapting to rising customer demands to quantity and quality of product, all the while hiring new staff and adjusting shift structures. 
And finally, you have some profitability tailwinds at your back such as lower diesel cost and higher product pricing. There could be a tendency to lose some operating discipline, but this hasn't happened. When demand has risen, our plant-level teams have adjusted just as quickly to meet customer needs. They're highly focused on the operating details critical to our long-term success and are acting with discipline to ensure peak operating efficiencies. 
Our sales teams have also responded effectively to ensure we're serving each market segment well. And our sales and operating teams has stayed coordinated in balancing production and demand. We're driving earnings while helping our customers grow. 
We're going to face some operating challenges as the recovery continues and as we grow. That's just the nature of our operating more than 340 facilities across many states. But I take an extra measure of confidence from how well our teams have responded over the last 2 quarters. 
Finally, a third point that strikes me as I reflect on the quarter and trends in our business. That's the payoff from our aggregates focus and from our commitment to continuous compounding improvement in all aspects of our business. 
We brought our division presidents, our senior line leaders from around the country together recently and one of the things we discussed was the importance of keeping our energy, which is electric. I can tell you right now that our people remain driven, hungry for growth and improved performance. 
Our people, many of whom have 15, 20, even 30-plus years in the business, know that we are a long way from more normal demand and the corresponding profitability in our business. We live this every day with many plants still running part time and many crews still without full-time work. Our people are balancing immediate customer needs with the maintenance and investment required to serve the growth that is coming. So our job is to keep tapping into that pride, that sense of ownership and competitive spirit in order to keep getting better day in and day out. And certainly, our shareholders benefit for this emphasis on continuous compounding improvement. 
As you've seen, we continued to expand our margins faster than pricing alone and that improvement drives better returns on capital and allows for financially sound reinvestment. This recovery began in the second half of 2013, our gross profit per ton in our Aggregates segment has improved $2 or 78% on a trailing 12-month basis. The drivers of this improvement are many and to some, may seem dull, but the impact on our lasting franchise value is anything but dull. 
Having shared these observations, I'll now hand it over to John for some brief commentary regarding our outlook. John?"

I'll start with the headline, which was also noted in our release. Our full year 2016 guidance for adjusted EBITDA remains unchanged at $1 billion to $1.1 billion. That said, we entered the second quarter tracking",1018,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with the headline, which was also noted in our release. Our full year 2016 guidance for adjusted EBITDA remains unchanged at $1 billion to $1.1 billion. That said, we entered the second quarter tracking toward the high end of that range. 
Now looking at our first quarter results and at our momentum over the last few quarters as well as listening to the comments Tom just shared, some of you may ask, why are we not raising guidance at this time? Well, we'd like to be clear one more time that it's not because we lack confidence in the business's long-term fundamentals. If anything, that confidence has risen, and that's confidence in the recovery with multiple end-use segments and geographic drivers and a constructive pricing climate allowing for more fair and adequate returns on capital as we move forward and in our internal ability to execute and to adapt to changing market conditions. Nor do we see any imminent threats that we're just failing to mention. 
Simply put, it's early, and we need to take some care not to over interpret any single quarter's results. We caution against it. 
As we have said frequently before, we encourage investors to also focus on longer-term trends. We believe that helps separate the signal from the noise, if you will. And for this reason, you see us incorporate trailing-12-month figures and other longer-term trend information into our release and supporting materials. 
With those cautions shared, let me offer a few more comments regarding our current outlook for the balance of the year. We currently expect same-store aggregate shipments to be up 8% to 9% for fiscal year '16 over fiscal year '15. This compares to our early February expectation of up 7%. Certainly, our first quarter shipments evidenced underlying strength in demand even after adjusting for weather and other favorable factors. 
Publicly funded construction activity has shown some year-over-year strength. Although the effects of the federal FAST Act and recent state and local funding initiatives have, for the most part, yet to flow to the system. And some of our end customers appear to be adding some capacity, albeit prudently and gradually. 
Our updated same-store shipment growth expectation is roughly in line with the rate seen over the trailing 12 months. Again, we expect the growth rates will fluctuate month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter as the recovery moves forward. That has been the pattern of this recovery and of past recoveries. But we're also seeing a recovery, although it has a good ways to go, that continues to see more geographic markets and more end-use segments participate fully. 
With respect to Aggregates pricing, we continue to project year-over-year growth in freight-adjusted average selling prices of approximately 7%. First quarter prices showed approximately 2% sequential improvement over fourth quarter pricing. Price increases that took effect in January and as of April 1 were generally well accepted by the marketplace and in line with our beginning-of-the - year expectations. 
Aggregate unit margins should continue to expand faster than pricing, although the pace of that growth may vary quarter-to-quarter. As you saw in the first quarter, we're beginning to see some very good operating leverage as we leverage fixed cost to sales. And our overall cost performance of late has benefited from lower diesel prices. Of course, those costs may rise as the year moves forward with some lag in corresponding product pricing. 
We continue to expect year-on-year gross profit growth in our Asphalt, Concrete and Calcium segments of approximately 20% collectively. Our local leaders continue to manage material margins in those businesses very well, although they may see some downward pressure from currently strong levels as the year moves forward. 
SAG costs were elevated in the first quarter, primarily due to incentive compensation related to accruals, tied to our financial and stock price performance. We currently expect full year SAG costs to remain roughly in line with our February guidance, and we will continue to leverage SAG expenses to revenues. Absent the effects of performance-based compensation and certain investments in our sales capabilities, overhead expenses have grown in approximately 3% rate since 2013. 
Our target for core capital expenditure investments remains at $275 million for the year. Although we may elect to pull forward some future spending if justified by compelling sourcing opportunities, for example, lower heavy equipment costs resulting from pressures across the global mining sector. 
You'll see $108 million of PP&E investment reflected in our Q1 financials. A couple of comments. We typically work to front load our spending on heavy mobile equipment, in part so that we can see the benefits of associated operating efficiencies during the heavy construction season. And the PP&E spending figures in the financials also includes certain internal growth capital investments. For example, ships to serve our Yucatán operation, development of new quarry sites and development of new distribution facilities, such as the rail yard we just opened in Savannah, Georgia. Including these internal growth adjustments, our total cash outlay for the year could be approximately $400 million. 
Vulcan's financial strength and flexibility allow for a balance of smart reinvestment, pursuit of acquisition-led growth opportunities and the ongoing return of capital to shareholders. Our overall capital structure and capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. 
During the first quarter, both S&P and Fitch raised our credit ratings to investment-grade status. During Q1, we returned approximately $50 million to shareholders via dividend and share repurchases. We repurchased 257,000 shares during the quarter at an average purchase price of approximately $103. 
I'll conclude my remarks by noting that our Q1 results represent another solid step toward our longer-term goals to the company's profitability when market demand recovers to long-term, normalized levels. Inside of Vulcan, we very much keep our eye on those longer-term goals. We have a lot of growth and a lot of work ahead of us, but the continuous compounding improvement that Tom referred to have us well on track and well prepared for the opportunities and challenges that will inevitably arise over the years to come. 
Tom, back over to you."

It was difficult to say if we had a little bit of pull forward or a little bit of, I'm going to call it, overflow from 2015 where, for example, in North Carolina and South Carolina, some fourth quarter shipments were delayed by the bad weather they had. But as best we can tell, however you adjust for it, we are seeing some strengthening in demand across more geographies, across more end-use segments. And as a result, you've seen us move our expectation for the year from 7% growth to 8% to 9% growth, in line roughly with what we've experienced over the last 12 months. We're seeing a recovery that still has a ways to go, but has more and more engines driving it if you will."

Again, first thing we'd highlight that as -- if you look on a trailing 12-month basis, even excluding the positive effects of diesel, our overall unit cost of sales is essentially flat. So what's really behind that, if you take, again, a trailing 12-month view is that our teams are doing a great job, and they've been able to get some real operating leverages. Volumes have increased, and that's offset some of the cost pressures that come from higher R&M that we've been talking about. So all in all, they've doing a great job. We've really seen that the last 2 quarters, we hope to keep seeing it going forward, we'll keep an eye on it. But we're certainly very pleased to see that cost performance. In the quarter, our average diesel price is probably about $1.30, probably $5 million, $6 million of benefit from that in total. But again, what we'd underscore -- and then on R&M, in the quarter, as we said, it was still elevated. To give you a rough order of magnitude, the way we look at it, it's probably $0.08 up per ton. So that's an issue we manage tightly. We keep an eye on it. But in the context of our overall margin structure, it's not a defining characteristic. So again, we're continuing to manage it well. Our team is doing a great job. We're beginning to see some real operating leverage. And importantly, even excluding the benefits of diesel, we've been able to keep costs relatively flat."

I think what -- as John said, what I'm pleased to see is that over the last 12-plus months or 5 quarters, we're seeing a trend of the other cost and the operating efficiencies start to improve, which tells me that we're leveraging the volume, not only in the fixed cost, but also in some of the variable costs and the operating efficiency. So to John's point, I think our folks are doing a real good job adjusting and adapting to rapidly changing volumes. We have a long way to go and I think that as this would -- continues to mature and the recovery will continue, we'll continue to see that fixed cost and variable cost volume leverage."

Rather than walk through each slide, Tom and John will summarize the highlights of our quarterly results and outlook. We believe this approach will assist your analysis and will allow more time to respond to your questions. 
With that said, please be reminded that comments regarding the company's results and projections may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, including general economic and business conditions, the timing and amount of federal, state and local funding for infrastructure; the highly competitive nature of construction materials industry; and other risks and uncertainties. These are described in detail in the company's SEC reports, including our earnings release and our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
In addition, during this call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You will find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other related information in our earnings release and at the end of this presentation.

I hope you've had time to review our earnings release and the supplemental information posted earlier today on our website. As you saw reflected in our financial",1095,"Thank you, Mark, and thanks all of you for joining us for our first quarter earnings call. I hope you've had time to review our earnings release and the supplemental information posted earlier today on our website. 
As you saw reflected in our financial results, our teams really hit on all cylinders during the first quarter, particularly in our core Aggregates segment. We met our customers' needs for higher volumes of material. We continue to migrate prices upward with an eye towards longer-term returns on capital. We leveraged fixed costs and lowered our unit cost of goods sold even after excluding the impact of lower diesel cost. And obviously, our margins and total profits for the quarter grew rapidly as a result. 
On a 21% gain in total freight-adjusted revenues for the company, our teams delivered 112% gain in total gross profit. It is certainly true that you can't extrapolate the full picture from a single quarter's results, but when you look at our results in the context of the last several quarters, you see very solid and improving fundamentals. Several themes about this quarter really stand out in my mind, and I'd like to spend a little time discussing them with you. 
As a starting point, I want to emphasize that we continue to believe that the recovery in our market still has a long way to go. Our business is in the midst of a long gradual recovery in demand. It's not unusual in such recovery to experience periods of relatively faster and slower growth. And certainly, our first quarter saw a number of positive things come together all at once. But we are still in early stages of recovery for the construction economy. 
For example, to underscore the point, we entered 2016 in terms of per capita aggregate demand relative to long-term averages, pretty close to where we were at the time of the 1982 recession. Having said that, clearly, the fundamentals of our business and our core aggregate-focus strategy are very strong. This is, to our way of thinking, a recovery with real staying power. Of course, we will take 17% shipment growth whenever we can get it, but what impresses me about the quarter and really the last 12-plus months is the solid additional evidence of a sustained and sustainable recovery. It's supported by growth in all of our end-use market, with public demand just beginning to strengthen. It is taking hold in more of our key markets and is leading to volume gains in more of our key facilities, and it is supported by longer-term fundamentals, including sustained gains in construction employment, state and local revenue help, and early signs of rising wages and income. We will see some ebbs and flows in the rate of demand recovery in our shipment growth, but that's to be expected particularly quarter-to-quarter. 
The first quarter reinforces an important point: This recovery is real. It's broad-based and our geographic breadth and positioning will serve us well as the recovery moves forward. The first quarter provided a clear snapshot of this fact. Our overall shipments grew more than 15% even though our Texas and California businesses were flat to down. This is another indicator of a recovery with real staying power. 
Our second point is that our local teams throughout the company are not only executing well, they are also adapting well to changing market conditions. They have performed well and have maintained operating discipline and focus while challenged by rapidly increasing volumes. Their focus and ability to adapt, their expertise in balancing product mix, pricing and greater efficiencies day-to-day and week-to-week bode well for our future. It can be easy to lose our focus when adjusting and adapting to rising customer demands to quantity and quality of product, all the while hiring new staff and adjusting shift structures. 
And finally, you have some profitability tailwinds at your back such as lower diesel cost and higher product pricing. There could be a tendency to lose some operating discipline, but this hasn't happened. When demand has risen, our plant-level teams have adjusted just as quickly to meet customer needs. They're highly focused on the operating details critical to our long-term success and are acting with discipline to ensure peak operating efficiencies. 
Our sales teams have also responded effectively to ensure we're serving each market segment well. And our sales and operating teams has stayed coordinated in balancing production and demand. We're driving earnings while helping our customers grow. 
We're going to face some operating challenges as the recovery continues and as we grow. That's just the nature of our operating more than 340 facilities across many states. But I take an extra measure of confidence from how well our teams have responded over the last 2 quarters. 
Finally, a third point that strikes me as I reflect on the quarter and trends in our business. That's the payoff from our aggregates focus and from our commitment to continuous compounding improvement in all aspects of our business. 
We brought our division presidents, our senior line leaders from around the country together recently and one of the things we discussed was the importance of keeping our energy, which is electric. I can tell you right now that our people remain driven, hungry for growth and improved performance. 
Our people, many of whom have 15, 20, even 30-plus years in the business, know that we are a long way from more normal demand and the corresponding profitability in our business. We live this every day with many plants still running part time and many crews still without full-time work. Our people are balancing immediate customer needs with the maintenance and investment required to serve the growth that is coming. So our job is to keep tapping into that pride, that sense of ownership and competitive spirit in order to keep getting better day in and day out. And certainly, our shareholders benefit for this emphasis on continuous compounding improvement. 
As you've seen, we continued to expand our margins faster than pricing alone and that improvement drives better returns on capital and allows for financially sound reinvestment. This recovery began in the second half of 2013, our gross profit per ton in our Aggregates segment has improved $2 or 78% on a trailing 12-month basis. The drivers of this improvement are many and to some, may seem dull, but the impact on our lasting franchise value is anything but dull. 
Having shared these observations, I'll now hand it over to John for some brief commentary regarding our outlook. John?"

I'll start with the headline, which was also noted in our release. Our full year 2016 guidance for adjusted EBITDA remains unchanged at $1 billion to $1.1 billion. That said, we entered the second quarter tracking",1018,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with the headline, which was also noted in our release. Our full year 2016 guidance for adjusted EBITDA remains unchanged at $1 billion to $1.1 billion. That said, we entered the second quarter tracking toward the high end of that range. 
Now looking at our first quarter results and at our momentum over the last few quarters as well as listening to the comments Tom just shared, some of you may ask, why are we not raising guidance at this time? Well, we'd like to be clear one more time that it's not because we lack confidence in the business's long-term fundamentals. If anything, that confidence has risen, and that's confidence in the recovery with multiple end-use segments and geographic drivers and a constructive pricing climate allowing for more fair and adequate returns on capital as we move forward and in our internal ability to execute and to adapt to changing market conditions. Nor do we see any imminent threats that we're just failing to mention. 
Simply put, it's early, and we need to take some care not to over interpret any single quarter's results. We caution against it. 
As we have said frequently before, we encourage investors to also focus on longer-term trends. We believe that helps separate the signal from the noise, if you will. And for this reason, you see us incorporate trailing-12-month figures and other longer-term trend information into our release and supporting materials. 
With those cautions shared, let me offer a few more comments regarding our current outlook for the balance of the year. We currently expect same-store aggregate shipments to be up 8% to 9% for fiscal year '16 over fiscal year '15. This compares to our early February expectation of up 7%. Certainly, our first quarter shipments evidenced underlying strength in demand even after adjusting for weather and other favorable factors. 
Publicly funded construction activity has shown some year-over-year strength. Although the effects of the federal FAST Act and recent state and local funding initiatives have, for the most part, yet to flow to the system. And some of our end customers appear to be adding some capacity, albeit prudently and gradually. 
Our updated same-store shipment growth expectation is roughly in line with the rate seen over the trailing 12 months. Again, we expect the growth rates will fluctuate month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter as the recovery moves forward. That has been the pattern of this recovery and of past recoveries. But we're also seeing a recovery, although it has a good ways to go, that continues to see more geographic markets and more end-use segments participate fully. 
With respect to Aggregates pricing, we continue to project year-over-year growth in freight-adjusted average selling prices of approximately 7%. First quarter prices showed approximately 2% sequential improvement over fourth quarter pricing. Price increases that took effect in January and as of April 1 were generally well accepted by the marketplace and in line with our beginning-of-the - year expectations. 
Aggregate unit margins should continue to expand faster than pricing, although the pace of that growth may vary quarter-to-quarter. As you saw in the first quarter, we're beginning to see some very good operating leverage as we leverage fixed cost to sales. And our overall cost performance of late has benefited from lower diesel prices. Of course, those costs may rise as the year moves forward with some lag in corresponding product pricing. 
We continue to expect year-on-year gross profit growth in our Asphalt, Concrete and Calcium segments of approximately 20% collectively. Our local leaders continue to manage material margins in those businesses very well, although they may see some downward pressure from currently strong levels as the year moves forward. 
SAG costs were elevated in the first quarter, primarily due to incentive compensation related to accruals, tied to our financial and stock price performance. We currently expect full year SAG costs to remain roughly in line with our February guidance, and we will continue to leverage SAG expenses to revenues. Absent the effects of performance-based compensation and certain investments in our sales capabilities, overhead expenses have grown in approximately 3% rate since 2013. 
Our target for core capital expenditure investments remains at $275 million for the year. Although we may elect to pull forward some future spending if justified by compelling sourcing opportunities, for example, lower heavy equipment costs resulting from pressures across the global mining sector. 
You'll see $108 million of PP&E investment reflected in our Q1 financials. A couple of comments. We typically work to front load our spending on heavy mobile equipment, in part so that we can see the benefits of associated operating efficiencies during the heavy construction season. And the PP&E spending figures in the financials also includes certain internal growth capital investments. For example, ships to serve our Yucatán operation, development of new quarry sites and development of new distribution facilities, such as the rail yard we just opened in Savannah, Georgia. Including these internal growth adjustments, our total cash outlay for the year could be approximately $400 million. 
Vulcan's financial strength and flexibility allow for a balance of smart reinvestment, pursuit of acquisition-led growth opportunities and the ongoing return of capital to shareholders. Our overall capital structure and capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. 
During the first quarter, both S&P and Fitch raised our credit ratings to investment-grade status. During Q1, we returned approximately $50 million to shareholders via dividend and share repurchases. We repurchased 257,000 shares during the quarter at an average purchase price of approximately $103. 
I'll conclude my remarks by noting that our Q1 results represent another solid step toward our longer-term goals to the company's profitability when market demand recovers to long-term, normalized levels. Inside of Vulcan, we very much keep our eye on those longer-term goals. We have a lot of growth and a lot of work ahead of us, but the continuous compounding improvement that Tom referred to have us well on track and well prepared for the opportunities and challenges that will inevitably arise over the years to come. 
Tom, back over to you."

But as best we can tell, however you adjust for it, we are seeing some strengthening in demand across more geographies, across more end-use segments.

Again, first thing we'd highlight that as -- if you look on a trailing 12-month basis, even excluding the positive effects of diesel, our overall unit cost of sales is essentially flat. So what's really behind that, if you take, again, a trailing 12-month view is that our teams are doing a great job, and they've been able to get some real operating leverages. Volumes have increased, and that's offset some of the cost pressures that come from higher R&M that we've been talking about. So all in all, they've doing a great job. We've really seen that the last 2 quarters, we hope to keep seeing it going forward, we'll keep an eye on it. But we're certainly very pleased to see that cost performance. In the quarter, our average diesel price is probably about $1.30, probably $5 million, $6 million of benefit from that in total. But again, what we'd underscore -- and then on R&M, in the quarter, as we said, it was still elevated. To give you a rough order of magnitude, the way we look at it, it's probably $0.08 up per ton. So that's an issue we manage tightly. We keep an eye on it. But in the context of our overall margin structure, it's not a defining characteristic. So again, we're continuing to manage it well. Our team is doing a great job. We're beginning to see some real operating leverage. And importantly, even excluding the benefits of diesel, we've been able to keep costs relatively flat."

I think what -- as John said, what I'm pleased to see is that over the last 12-plus months or 5 quarters, we're seeing a trend of the other cost and the operating efficiencies start to improve, which tells me that we're leveraging the volume, not only in the fixed cost, but also in some of the variable costs and the operating efficiency. So to John's point, I think our folks are doing a real good job adjusting and adapting to rapidly changing volumes. We have a long way to go and I think that as this would -- continues to mature and the recovery will continue, we'll continue to see that fixed cost and variable cost volume leverage."

312769,376363542,1020299,"Vulcan Materials Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2016",2016-08-01,"Earnings Calls","Vulcan Materials Company","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and I thank all of you for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. Our business continues to perform very well, even with a slower rate of shipment growth in the second quarter, our margins continue to improve considerably. We",1507,"Thank you, Mark, and I thank all of you for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. 
Our business continues to perform very well, even with a slower rate of shipment growth in the second quarter, our margins continue to improve considerably. We remain on track consistent with our guidance to deliver full year adjusted EBITDA of between $1 billion and $1.1 billion. 
The fundamental of the business continue to strengthen. I'll mention 3 areas, in particular: One, the factors underpinning the continued gradual recovery in demand remains intact, notably with higher levels of public funding supporting further growth in 2017 and beyond; two, our internal execution remains very solid, we're meeting our customers rising needs, and we're balancing volumes, pricing and product mix. Our teams are continuing to do an outstanding job converting incremental revenue into profits; and three, the core profitability of the business continues to improve. Trailing 12-month gross profit per ton in our Aggregates segment increased by 31% to $4.77 per ton and adjusted EBIT on a trailing 12-month basis increased 62% to $682 million. 
So the foundation for multi-year growth continues to strengthen in demand outlook, in execution and in our core profitability. 
Now regarding second quarter shipments. I want to reiterate a point made in last quarter's earnings call. A single quarter's results doesn't always give a good picture of the underlying volume trends in the business. Now obviously, the 3% growth rate for aggregates shipments in the quarter contrast sharply with the first quarter rate of 17%. Prolonged bad weather in certain markets, large project timing, sales mix and other factors can cause our business results to vary substantially week-to-week and month-to-month. Certainly, we see that variability over the last 2 quarters, but the underlying drivers and the basic trends remain unchanged. 
For example, if we pulled back to look at just the first half of the year as opposed to looking at 2 quarters individually, we see that our core aggregates business has posted shipment growth of 9% of the first half 2016 and pricing growth of 8%. Those results are in line with recent trends and with our plans for the year. 
I'll comment in more detail on individual geographies during Q&A. But taken as a whole, the bottom line is that we still see our core demand drivers and longer-term project pipelines strengthening across our footprint. 
In fact, we anticipate sustained growth in all end-use segments even though we've yet to see much benefit in terms of shipments from rising public funding. 
We'll see continued recovery in private construction. Public funding will start to pick up in an important way by 2017 and beyond as states commit to large long term projects on the strength of the FAST Act, and we see a healthy number of large projects that we will serve in the queue for 2017 and '18. 
Now moving back to the second quarter. Just as a number of factors combine to boost the way shipment growth in the first quarter, several factors combine to affect shipments in the second quarter. We saw extremely wet weather in several key markets. 
At the same time, certain markets experienced a low and large project starts, both public and private. This was despite a healthy pipeline of projects and in retrospect, it's likely that some work was pulled forward into the first quarter. 
As you know, we tipped the sea a fairly high degree of variance in shipment patterns across our individual markets, particularly month-to-month. But I think it's fair to say that the second quarter brought with it a higher-than-normal degree events. The second quarter could be seen as a story of the haves and have-nots. Virginia, Texas, California, Illinois combined saw aggregate shipments decline by 2% versus the prior year, while the remainder of our states combined, grew shipment by 14%. 
We continue to see strong shipment growth across most of the southeast where the recovery has really begun to take hold over recent quarters and certain of these states, for example, Georgia, have put in place higher levels of public funding that will support higher materials demand in 2017 and beyond even though we haven't seen much of that impact yet. 
For California, Texas, Virginia and Illinois, we've seen a mix of weather and large project timing impacting year-over-year shipment rates. Although the specifics vary by state and market, I note that California, Texas and Virginia each have healthy, longer-term growth prospects. And what we're experiencing now is more transitional or timing-related issues. In contrast, we don't currently see a similar path to longer-term demand growth in Illinois due to that state's well-known fiscal challenges, although our team there has done a nice job of growing its profits and cash flows. 
I mentioned the significant fluctuations in shipment rates month-to-month throughout the quarter. As you saw in our press release during May, this resulted in daily shipments declining by about 5% from the prior year. 
On the other hand, daily shipments rates in April and June were up approximately 8% and 6%, respectively. 
These kind of fluctuations are not uncommon. All the more reason to avoid extrapolating from short-term volume trends in a business such as ours. 
Even though these swings in shipments activity at the local level can create some operational challenges, our teams have done a superb job adapting to changing market conditions and consistently meeting our customers' needs. 
So ultimately, I don't find the recent spikes and lulls in demand to be a great concern. It's just the nature of business. 
Regarding our local team's ability to adapt to changing market conditions, I'm pleased with the way our people are delivering continued profitability gains despite modest overall shipment growth and shifting delivery and production schedules. 
Regarding pricing. Our average price freight-adjusted ceiling prices for aggregates in the quarter were up 7% over the prior year despite some headwinds from geographic and product mix. Meanwhile, our unit cost of sales were flat and unit cash gross profit per ton increased $0.86 or 15% from last year's quarter. Our incremental flow-through rate exceeded 80% for the quarter and 75% on a trailing 12-month basis. 
We also enjoyed healthy margin expansion in our Asphalt and our Concrete segments despite low rates of volume growth. 
On a total company basis and excluding the impact of freight and delivery revenues, gross profit as a percent of revenue increased 500 basis points over the last year second quarter. Those are strong results, and they're not one-offs. They represent a next step on a long-term path of continuous compounding improvement. We provided additional information regarding our longer-term profit improvements in our release and the supplemental slides, so I won't repeat that here other than to highlight the on a trailing 12 basis, our gross profit per ton in our core Aggregates segment has increased by 87% or $2.22 per ton since the recovery began in 2013. 
Now before I hand it off to John, I'd like to share a few thoughts regarding our expected results for the balance of the year. As I've already noted, we are reaffirming our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. We finished the first quarter trending towards the higher end of that range, although we gave some of that back during the second quarter. We continue to expect full year aggregates shipments to exceed 190 million tons. But our ultimate results will depend in large part on 3 things just as was the case in the second half of 2015. One, on the ability of our customers to catch up on weather-delayed work; two, on the start and completion timing of larger projects; and three, on the number of shipping days allowed by weather conditions, particularly in the fourth quarter. 
The demand fundamentals are there and strengthening. The pricing and unit profitability is there, it's on track and it's growing. So then it's really a matter of timing. How we finish will largely depend on how much the work that is clearly there to be completed by the end of the year before we move into 2017 where demand will only grow. 
Let me sum it up. We saw a strong first half with 9% shipments growth and 8% pricing growth in our core Aggregates segment. Longer-term demand fundamentals are in place pointing towards a strong scenario developing for 2017. 
In the near term, we've seen rapid growth across the southeast but low and large project activity in parts of California, Texas and Illinois. We are benefiting from excellent, continued improvements to our core profitability even during a quarter with slower volume growth.  The pricing climate remains positive and as was the case last year, we need to make up for some weather-delayed volumes in the second half. I'll come back in a moment with some final remarks. But for now, let me hand it off to John from a few brief comments regarding our overall cost controls, our balance sheet strength and our capital allocation priorities. John?"
312769,376363542,1020299,"Vulcan Materials Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2016",2016-08-01,"Earnings Calls","Vulcan Materials Company","Executives","Thanks, Tom. I'd like to start with one more complement t our local teams and their operational performance and cost control discipline throughout the earlier stage of the cycle.

I'd like to start with one more complement t our local teams and their operational performance and cost control discipline throughout the earlier stage of the cycle. Although we've had and we likely continue to have ups and downs from quarter-to-quarter, the overall cost trend has been impressive. 
For example, in our core Aggregates segment, our unit cost of sales per ton as measured on a trailing 12-month basis has declined consistently with each reporting period since the recovery began in the second half of 2013. So over a 3-year period, when our average selling price per ton of aggregates increased by about $1.64, again, measured on a trailing 12-month basis, our average unit cost of sales declined by about $0.57. 
Lower diesel prices have aided these results, but strong daily operating disciplines affected coordination among local production and sales teams and the commitment to continuous improvement have also played a central role. 
We often talk about how seemingly small improvements compound and add up to a sizable impact on our business. And in this case, our ongoing local operating disciplines have contributed meaningfully to the strong conversion of incremental revenue into incremental profit that we've reported throughout the recovery so far. 
Unfortunately, we cannot make entirely similar observations regarding our SAG costs despite the fact that we've held administrative headcount basically flat since the recovery began. As you've seen, second quarter SAG was $13.5 million higher than the prior year. A bit more than half of this increase results from the amount and timing of accruals for performance-based incentives and deferred compensation plans. 
Approximately another quarter of the rise in second quarter SAG resulted from higher salaries and relocation expenses, primarily related to investments in our sales and business development talent and the strategic rotation of sales leadership across geographies. 
We will continue to make strategic investments in our sales talent and capabilities. Those costs and higher incentive accruals will cause run rate SAG costs to be elevated in the near term with our full year projection now at $310 million. 
Although we're not fully satisfied with our recent results and trend, we will continue to leverage SAG to sales throughout the recovery and beyond. The investments we're making are sound and ultimately support the higher volume growth at higher margins. 
I'll touch now briefly on our balance sheet strength as the facts have continued to improve, but the fundamental story remains unchanged. 
Our stated goal, as you know, is to maintain an investment-grade credit position throughout the cycle. We have achieved such a position and of course, our cash flow profile continues to improve. In short, we have the financial strength and flexibility needed to pursue a balanced mix of capital reinvestment, growth investments, including M&A and return of capital to shareholders. 
Finally, I'll note that our weighted average cost of capital has declined significantly since the recovery began in part due to our improving financial performance and credit position and in part due to our focus in aggregates and the divestiture of our cement and concrete assets from our portfolio. 
Turning now to capital allocation. Our summary messages that our recent and planned activities remain consistent with the priorities you've heard us articulate several times. We do remain active in terms of business development and the pursuit of acquisition opportunities that fit us strategically. And I think it is fair to say that we are aggressive but disciplined. We're looking at the number of opportunities at various stages of development and again, we have the financial capacity to grow without overly straining our credit position. 
And we have continued to return additional capital to shareholders via share repurchases. As you know, we have not committed to a specific repurchase target. Instead, we'll remain opportunistic and seek to balance return of capital and reinvestment over time. 
And now, I'll turn the call back over to Tom."

Before taking your questions, I'd like to say a few words about my confidence in our company. I've been with this company for over 26 years, and I believe our business is stronger and more resilient than it's ever been. We're in the midst of a sustained multi-year recovery. We're enjoying an ongoing recovery in private construction. And on top of that, we are just beginning to see a new wave of increased public spending. We'll highlight these demand trends for 2017 and beyond during our Aggregates Day event on September 29. 
We have an amazing aggregates focused asset-based that positions us extremely well to serve the demand growth that is coming. Our core profitability and cash flows are very strong and just keep improving. Our balance sheet is strong. Our financial condition gives us a lot of flexibility to do smart M&A, to reinvest in our operations and to return capital to our shareholders. And our culture at this company is great. Our people are helping each other get better every day, and they are upbeat, and they are on their game. Our position is frankly, an enviable one, especially when viewed against the backdrop of uncertain times. 
And I really like our position looking out over the next several years. At some point, our country must address the major infrastructure challenges that we still face as a nation. Look, it's good to have a 5-year federal highway bill, but we still have a degraded highly system. Major U.S. infrastructure investment must and will occur eventually, whether as a matter of smart, proactive economic policy, reactive fiscal stimulus, dire necessity or some combination of these. We don't assume such a scenario in our longer-term outlook, but we will be well positioned to meet that need when it arises. In the meantime, we remain very confident in our business and are focused on making a strong franchise even stronger. 
Let me conclude by thanking our outstanding employees for their performance during the quarter and for the work they continue to do every day to deliver another year of very strong results.

Both the private side, residential is very healthy, non-res saw a little bit of softening in the second quarter, but the leading indicators in the pipeline very healthy. The public side will only get better, we'll see a little bit below in California, while we address funding. But overall, we don't see acceleration in either one of these states. I think, picking them one at a time, California very positive. Our strength there is large commercial and highway projects. We saw roll that a recent commercial side some of our customers maybe to pick up as much work of late as we were [indiscernible]. In Canada, we can do very good job on that. And the highway side, we'll see a little bit of a decrease, short-term decrease in funding because of gas price, lower gas prices but that's got to rectify itself. California has the -- is right of the worst roads in the U.S. There's a number of bills in the state government for funding from roughly 3.5 -- increase of 3.5 up to $7 billion and then there's I think there's around more than 10 measures that are on the ballot for November for local and county work that will total roughly an increase -- annual increase of about $2 billion. So overall, California is going to be fine. Virginia, as you said, we saw extreme weather, also have a little bit timing with projects. We had 2 big project last year, the Midtown Tunnel and the large wind farm that we're were going. We had one pushback this year, the Fairfield Marine tunnel, but just give you a little flavor around that. If you took 3 large jobs, so they are coming I66 in Northern Virginia, the Chesapeake Bay Bridge job and the Fairfield Marine, which I just mentioned, that would be -- to put those jobs together, you'll be around 7 million tons.

My, comments weren't reflected on the nature of the dialogue around future infrastructure spending, which we actually as Tom said quite positive at the federal level, state level and local level across many geographies. It's more just a negative tone and some degree of uncertainty that would seem to affect private investment levels. And you'll know more about this, but you made have seen some of that in second quarter GDP data. And will probably have some customers who on balance just given negative tone out there, particularly on the private side, a little more reluctant than they would be in a different time to add their own traditional capacity to make their own the capital investments, whether that's a new equipment or land for development or larger staffs. So I wouldn't want to make it too big a deal. It was interesting to us is just disconnect wheel between the tone you kind of hear in the middle election cycle, which is really negative and what we see in our own business, which frankly, is pretty positive. But nothing -- longer term, the dialogue around higher levels of public infrastructure spending, particularly on road infrastructure and other infrastructure we're pretty excited about."

I think that as I said earlier, I think our folks are really doing a good job of concentrating on our own operating efficiencies that we can control. Volume is coming to have that, so I feel pretty good about our cost and our ability to take incremental revenue so the bottom line. As far as capital projects, they're all over the place. Some is a simple as replacement of mobile equipment, screens and pressures you see when you do plant capital is a combination of both replacement and process improvement to get more throughput or reduce downtime, which helps on your cost, obviously, other than like-for-like replacement.

North Carolina has improved their funding, as has Florida, as has South Carolina, as has Virginia. Their bills being discussed in Alabama and probably won't be addressed until 2017. I tell you a similar story in Tennessee, where it needs to be addressed. They have not -- won't happen in '16, hopefully it'll happen in '17.

Our business continues to perform very well even with a slower rate of shipment growth in the second quarter. Our margins continued to improve considerably. We remain on track consistent with our guidance to deliver full year adjusted EBITDA of between $1 billion and $1.1 billion. 
The fundamentals of the business continue to strengthen. I'll mention 3 areas, in particular. One, the factors underpinning the continued gradual recovery in demand remains intact, notably with higher levels of public funding supporting further growth in 2017 and beyond. Two, our internal execution remains very solid. We're meeting our customers rising needs, and we're balancing volumes, pricing and product mix. Our teams are continuing to do an outstanding job converting incremental revenue into profits. And three, the core profitability of the business continues to improve. Trailing 12-month gross profit per ton in our Aggregates segment increased by 31% to $4.77 per ton and adjusted EBIT on a trailing 12-month basis increased 62% to $682 million. So the foundation for multiyear growth continues to strengthen in demand outlook, in execution and in our core profitability. 
Now regarding second quarter shipments. I want to reiterate a point made in last quarter's earnings call. A single quarter's result doesn't always give a good picture of the underlying volume trends in the business. Now obviously, the 3% growth rate for aggregate shipments in the quarter contrast sharply with the first quarter rate of 17%. Prolonged bad weather in certain markets, large project timing, sales mix and other factors can cause our business results to vary substantially week-to-week and month-to-month. Certainly, we see that variability over the last 2 quarters, but the underlying drivers and the basic trends remain unchanged. 
For example, if we pull back to look at just the first half of the year as opposed to looking at 2 quarters individually, we see that our core Aggregates business has posted shipment growth of 9% of the first half 2016 and pricing growth of 8%. Those results are in line with recent trends and with our plans for the year. 
I'll comment in more detail on individual geographies during Q&A. But taken as a whole, the bottom line is that we still see our core demand drivers and longer-term project pipelines strengthening across our footprint. In fact, we anticipate sustained growth in all end-use segments even though we've yet to see much benefit in terms of shipments from rising public funding. 
We'll see continued recovery in private construction. Public funding will start to pick up in an important way by 2017 and beyond as states commit to large long-term projects on the strength of the FAST Act, and then we see a healthy number of large projects that we will serve in the queue for 2017 and '18. 
Now moving back to the second quarter. Just as a number of factors combine to boost the way the shipment grow in the first quarter, several factors combine to affect shipments in the second quarter. We saw extremely wet weather in several key markets. 
At the same time, certain markets experienced a low and large project starts, both public and private. This was despite a healthy pipeline of projects and in retrospect, it's likely that some work was pulled forward into the first quarter. 
As you know, we tipped the sea a fairly high degree of variance in shipment patterns across our individual markets, particularly month-to-month. But I think it's fair to say that the second quarter brought with it a higher-than-normal degree of variance. The second quarter could be seen as a story of the haves and have-nots. Virginia, Texas, California, Illinois combined saw aggregate shipments decline by 2% versus the prior year, while the remainder of our states combined grew shipments by 14%. 
We continue to see strong shipment growth across most of the southeast where the recovery has really begun to take hold over recent quarters and certain of these states, for example, Georgia, have put in place higher levels of public funding that will support higher materials demand in 2017 and beyond even though we haven't seen much of that impact yet. 
For California, Texas, Virginia and Illinois, we've seen a mix of weather and large project timing impacting year-over-year shipment rates. Although the specifics vary by state and market, I'd note that California, Texas and Virginia each have healthy, longer-term growth prospects. And what we're experiencing now is more transitional or timing-related issues. In contrast, we don't currently see a similar path to longer-term demand growth in Illinois due to that state's well-known fiscal challenges, although our team there has done a nice job of growing its profits and cash flows. 
I mentioned the significant fluctuations in shipment rates month-to-month throughout the quarter. As you saw in our press release during May, this resulted in daily shipments declining by about 5% from the prior year. On the other hand, daily shipments rates in April and June were up approximately 8% and 6%, respectively. This kind of fluctuations are not uncommon. All the more reason to avoid extrapolating from short-term volume trends in a business such as ours. Even though these swings in shipments activity at the local level can create some operational challenges, our teams have done a superb job adapting to changing market conditions and consistently meeting our customers' needs. 
So ultimately, I don't find the recent spikes and lulls in demand to be a great concern. It's just the nature of the business. 
Regarding our local team's ability to adapt to changing market condition, I'm pleased with the way our people are delivering continued profitability gains despite modest overall shipment growth and shifting delivery and production schedules. 
Regarding pricing. Our average price freight-adjusted selling prices for aggregates in the quarter were up 7% over the prior year despite some headwinds from geographic and product mix. Meanwhile, our unit cost of sales were flat and unit cash gross profit per ton increased $0.86 or 15% from last year's quarter. Our incremental flow-through rate exceeded 80% for the quarter and 75% on a trailing 12-month basis. 
We also enjoyed healthy margin expansion in our Asphalt and our Concrete segments despite low rates of volume growth. 
On a total company basis and excluding the impact of freight and delivery revenues, gross profit as a percent of revenue increased 500 basis points over the last year's second quarter. Those are strong results, and they're not one-offs. They represent a next step on a long-term path of continuous compounding improvement. We provided additional information regarding our longer-term profit improvements in our release and the supplemental slides, so I won't repeat that here other than to highlight that on a trailing 12-month basis, our gross profit per ton in our core Aggregates segment has increased by 87% or $2.22 per ton since the recovery began in 2013. 
Now before I hand it off to John, I'd like to share a few thoughts regarding our expected results for the balance of the year. As I've already noted, we are reaffirming our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. We finished the first quarter trending towards the higher end of that range, although we gave some of that back during the second quarter. We continue to expect full year aggregate shipments to exceed 190 million tons. But our ultimate results will depend in large part on 3 things just as was the case in the second half of 2015. One, on the ability of our customers to catch up on weather-delayed work; two, on the start and completion timing of larger projects; and three, on the number of shipping days allowed by weather conditions, particularly in the fourth quarter. 
The demand fundamentals are there and strengthening. The pricing and unit profitability is there, it's on track and it's growing. So then it's really a matter of timing. How we finish will largely depend on how much the work that is clearly there to be completed by the end of the year before we move into 2017 where demand will only grow. 
Let me sum it up. We saw a strong first half with 9% shipments growth and 8% pricing growth in our core Aggregates segment. Longer-term demand fundamentals are in place pointing towards a strong scenario developing for 2017. 
In the near term, we've seen rapid growth across the southeast, but a low and large project activity in parts of California, Texas and Illinois. We are benefiting from excellent continued improvements to our core profitability even during a quarter with slower volume growth. The pricing climate remains positive. And as was the case last year, we need to make up for some weather-delayed volumes in the second half. 
I'll come back in a moment with some final remarks. But for now, let me hand it off to John for a few brief comments regarding our overall cost controls, our balance sheet strength and our capital allocation priorities. John?"
312769,376363542,1020470,"Vulcan Materials Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2016",2016-08-01,"Earnings Calls","Vulcan Materials Company","Executives","Thanks, Tom.

I'd like to start with one more complement to our local teams and their operational performance and cost control discipline throughout the earlier stage of the cycle. Although we've had and we likely continue to have ups and downs from quarter-to-quarter, the overall cost trend has been impressive. 
For example, in our core Aggregates segment, our unit cost of sales per ton, as measured on a trailing 12-month basis, has declined consistently with each reporting period since the recovery began in the second half of 2013. So over a 3-year period, when our average selling price per ton of aggregates increased by about $1.64, again, measured on a trailing 12-month basis, our average unit cost of sales declined by about $0.57. 
Lower diesel prices have aided these results, but strong daily operating disciplines affected coordination among local production and sales teams and the commitment to continuous improvement have also played a central role. 
We often talk about how seemingly small improvements compound and add up to a sizable impact on our business. And in this case, our ongoing local operating disciplines have contributed meaningfully to the strong conversion of incremental revenue into incremental profit that we've reported throughout the recovery so far. 
Unfortunately, we cannot make entirely similar observations regarding our SAG costs despite the fact that we've held administrative headcount basically flat since the recovery began. As you've seen, second quarter SAG was $13.5 million higher than the prior year. A bit more than half of this increase results from the amount and timing of accruals for performance-based incentives and deferred compensation plans. Approximately another quarter of the rise in second quarter SAG resulted from higher salaries and relocation expenses, primarily related to investments in our sales and business development talent and the strategic rotation of sales leadership across geographies. 
We will continue to make strategic investments in our sales talent and capabilities. Those costs and higher incentive accruals will cause run rate SAG costs to be elevated in the near term with our full year projection now at $310 million. 
Although we're not fully satisfied with our recent results and trend, we will continue to leverage SAG to sales throughout the recovery and beyond. The investments we're making are sound and ultimately support higher volume growth at higher margins. 
I'll touch now briefly on our balance sheet strength as the facts have continued to improve, but the fundamental story remains unchanged. Our stated goal, as you know, is to maintain an investment-grade credit position throughout the cycle. We have achieved such a position and of course, our cash flow profile continues to improve. In short, we have the financial strength and flexibility needed to pursue a balanced mix of capital reinvestment, growth investments, including M&A and return of capital to shareholders. 
Finally, I'll note that our weighted average cost of capital has declined significantly since the recovery began in part due to our improving financial performance and credit position and in part due to our focus in aggregates and the divestiture of our cement and concrete assets from our portfolio. 
Turning now to capital allocation. Our summary message is that our recent and planned activities remain consistent with the priorities you've heard us articulate several times. We do remain active in terms of business development and the pursuit of acquisition opportunities that fit us strategically. And I think it is fair to say that we are aggressive, but disciplined. We're looking at the number of opportunities at various stages of development and again, we have the financial capacity to grow without overly straining our credit position. And we have continued to return additional capital to shareholders via share repurchases. As you know, we have not committed to a specific repurchase target. Instead, we'll remain opportunistic and seek to balance return of capital and reinvestment over time. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Tom."

Before taking your questions, I'd like to say a few words about my confidence in our company. I've been with this company for over 26 years, and I believe our business is stronger and more resilient than it's ever been. We're in the midst of a sustained multiyear recovery. We're enjoying an ongoing recovery in private construction. And on top of that, we are just beginning to see a new wave of increased public spending. We'll highlight these demand trends for 2017 and beyond during our Aggregates Day event on September 29. 
We have an amazing aggregates focused asset-based that positions us extremely well to serve the demand growth that is coming. Our core profitability and cash flows are very strong and just keep improving. Our balance sheet is strong. Our financial condition gives us a lot of flexibility to do smart M&A, to reinvest in our operations and to return capital to our shareholders. And our culture at this company is great. Our people are helping each other get better every day, and they are upbeat, and they are on their game. Our position is, frankly, an enviable one, especially when viewed against the backdrop of uncertain times. 
And I really like our position looking out over the next several years. At some point, our country must address the major infrastructure challenges that we still face as a nation. Look, it's good to have a 5-year federal highway bill, but we still have a degraded highway system. Major U.S. infrastructure investment must and will occur eventually, whether as a matter of smart, proactive economic policy, reactive fiscal stimulus, dire necessity or some combination of these. We don't assume such a scenario in our longer-term outlook, but we will be well positioned to meet that need when it arises. In the meantime, we remain very confident in our business and are focused on making a strong franchise even stronger. 
Let me conclude by thanking our outstanding employees for their performance during the quarter and for the work they continue to do every day to deliver another year of very strong results. And thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials.

Both the private side, residential is very healthy, non-res saw a little bit of softening in the second quarter, but the leading indicators in the pipeline, very healthy. The public side will only get better. We'll see a little bit below in California, while they address funding. But overall, we don't see acceleration in either one of these states. I think that picking them one at a time, California, very positive. Our strength there is large commercial. And highway projects, we saw low in that, of recent, the commercial side. Some of our customers maybe didn't pick up as much work of late as we were [indiscernible]. In Canada, we can do a very good job on that. On the highway side, we'll see a little bit of a decrease, short-term decrease in funding because of gas price, lower gas prices, but that's got to rectify itself. California has the -- is right at the worst roads in the U.S. There's a number of bills in the state government for funding from roughly $3.5 billion -- increase of $3.5 billion up to $7 billion, and then there's, I think, around more than 10 measures that are on the ballot for November for local and county work that would total roughly an increase -- annual increase of about $2 billion. So overall, California is going to be fine. Virginia, as you said, we saw extreme weather, also have a little bit timing with projects. We had 2 big projects last year, the Midtown Tunnel and the large wind farm that were going. We have one pushback this year, the Fairfield Marine Terminal. But just to give you a little flavor around that, if you took 3 large jobs, they are coming Highway 66 in Northern Virginia, the Chesapeake Bay Bridge job and the Fairfield Marine, which I just mentioned. That would be -- put those jobs together, you're going to be around 7 million tons. So the main in Virginia will continue to grow."

We'll probably get 700,000, 600,000 tons in '16. So it will be all over the place. And again, as John said earlier, it's going to be a matter of timing. The good news is the contractors and our customers want to get the work done.

It was interesting to us, it's just the disconnect wheel between the tone you kind of hear in the middle election cycle, which is really negative and what we see in our own business, which, frankly, is pretty positive. But nothing -- longer term, the dialogue around higher levels of public infrastructure spending, particularly on road infrastructure and other infrastructure we're pretty excited about."

I think that, as I said earlier, I think our folks are doing a really good job of concentrating on our own operating efficiencies that we can control. Volume is coming backing to help that. So I feel pretty good about our cost and our ability to take incremental revenues to the bottom line. As far as capital projects, they're all over the place. Some is a simple as replacement of mobile equipment, screens and crushers. You'll see when you do plant capital is a combination of both replacement and process improvement to get more throughput or reduce downtime, which helps on your cost, obviously, other than just like-for-like replacement. On the gross side, we've got a number of facilities that we're working on our distribution network, both rail and blue water that were different -- all of our different stages of completion.

So as Tom said, we're pretty proud of what our teams did. And particularly, as an example in the quarter without much volume growth, there's still and with very uneven production schedules due to weather challenges, to control your cost in the quarter like the one we just finished, is a good sign with the right disciplines.

We saw 30 in our markets in Texas in the just highway legs alone. In the '16, we'll see an improvement of over 30%. State as a whole, improvement of over 20%. And a lot of that will really actually go in '17 and then you'll have improved funding, again, in both '17 and '18. That will go up about 15% to 20% in '17, and then there's another 2 -- over $2 billion that comes on in Texas in '18. Georgia, basically doubled their highway funding. That past a year ago, and we'll see a little bit of that in '16. As I said earlier, majority will come in '17 and '18. North Carolina has improved their funding, as has Florida, as has South Carolina, as has Virginia. Their bill's being discussed in Alabama, and probably be -- won't be addressed until 2017. I tell you a similar story in Tennessee, where it needs to be addressed. They have not -- won't happen in '16. Hopefully, it'll happen in '17. So as I said, a lot of our states have marked improvement in funding. The vast majority of that, except for Texas, will flow through in '17 and '18.

Even with a slower rate of shipment growth in the second quarter, our margins continued to improve considerably. We remain on track consistent with our guidance to deliver full year adjusted EBITDA of between $1 billion and $1.1 billion. 
The fundamentals of the business continue to strengthen. I'll mention 3 areas, in particular. One, the factors underpinning the continued gradual recovery in demand remains intact, notably with higher levels of public funding supporting further growth in 2017 and beyond. Two, our internal execution remains very solid. We're meeting our customers' rising needs, and we're balancing volumes, pricing and product mix. Our teams are continuing to do an outstanding job converting incremental revenue into profits. And three, the core profitability of the business continues to improve. Trailing 12-month gross profit per ton in our Aggregates segment increased by 31% to $4.77 per ton and adjusted EBIT on a trailing 12-month basis increased 62% to $682 million. So the foundation for multiyear growth continues to strengthen in demand outlook, in execution and in our core profitability. 
Now regarding second quarter shipments. I want to reiterate a point made in last quarter's earnings call. A single quarter's result doesn't always give a good picture of the underlying volume trends in the business. Now obviously, the 3% growth rate for aggregate shipments in the quarter contrast sharply with the first quarter rate of 17%. Prolonged bad weather in certain markets, large project timing, sales mix and other factors can cause our business results to vary substantially week-to-week and month-to-month. Certainly, we've see that variability over the last 2 quarters, but the underlying drivers and the basic trends remain unchanged. 
For example, if we pull back to look at just the first half of the year as opposed to looking at 2 quarters individually, we see that our core Aggregates business has posted shipment growth of 9% for the first half 2016 and pricing growth of 8%. Those results are in line with recent trends and with our plans for the year. 
I'll comment in more detail on individual geographies during Q&A. But taken as a whole, the bottom line is that we still see our core demand drivers and longer-term project pipelines strengthening across our footprint. In fact, we anticipate sustained growth in all end-use segments even though we've yet to see much benefit in terms of shipments from rising public funding. 
We'll see continued recovery in private construction. Public funding will start to pick up in an important way by 2017 and beyond as states commit to large long-term projects on the strength of the FAST Act, and then we see a healthy number of large projects that we will serve in the queue for 2017 and '18. 
Now moving back to the second quarter. Just as a number of factors combine to boost the way the shipment grow in the first quarter, several factors combine to affect shipments in the second quarter. We saw extremely wet weather in several key markets. 
At the same time, certain markets experienced a lull in large project starts, both public and private. This was despite a healthy pipeline of projects and in retrospect, it's likely that some work was pulled forward into the first quarter. 
As you know, we typically a fairly high degree of variance in shipment patterns across our individual markets, particularly month-to-month. But I think it's fair to say that the second quarter brought with it a higher-than-normal degree of variance. The second quarter could be seen as a story of the haves and have-nots. Virginia, Texas, California and Illinois combined saw aggregate shipments decline by 10% [ph] versus the prior year, while the remainder of our states combined grew shipments by 14%. 
We continue to see strong shipment growth across most of the southeast where the recovery has really begun to take hold over recent quarters and certain of these states, for example, Georgia, have put in place higher levels of public funding that will support higher materials demand in 2017 and beyond even though we haven't seen much of that impact yet. 
For California, Texas, Virginia and Illinois, we've seen a mix of weather and large project timing impacting year-over-year shipment rates. Although the specifics vary by state and market, I'd note that California, Texas and Virginia each have healthy, longer-term growth prospects. And what we're experiencing now is more transitional or timing-related issues. In contrast, we don't currently see a similar path to longer-term demand growth in Illinois due to that state's well-known fiscal challenges, although our team there has done a nice job of growing its profits and cash flows. 
I mentioned the significant fluctuations in shipment rates month-to-month throughout the quarter. As you saw in our press release during May, this resulted in daily shipments declining by about 5% from the prior year. On the other hand, daily shipments rates in April and June were up approximately 8% and 6%, respectively. These kind of fluctuations are not uncommon. All the more reason to avoid extrapolating from short-term volume trends in a business such as ours. Even though these swings in shipments activity at the local level can create some operational challenges, our teams have done a superb job adapting to changing market conditions and consistently meeting our customers' needs. 
So ultimately, I don't find the recent spikes and lulls in demand to be a great concern. It's just the nature of the business. 
Regarding our local team's ability to adapt to changing market condition, I'm pleased with the way our people are delivering continued profitability gains despite modest overall shipment growth and shifting delivery and production schedules. 
Regarding pricing. Our average price -- freight-adjusted selling prices for aggregates in the quarter were up 7% over the prior year despite some headwinds from geographic and product mix. Meanwhile, our unit cost of sales were flat and unit cash gross profit per ton increased $0.86 or 15% from last year's quarter. Our incremental flow-through rate exceeded 80% for the quarter and 75% on a trailing 12-month basis. 
We also enjoyed healthy margin expansion in our Asphalt and our Concrete segments despite low rates of volume growth. 
On a total company basis and excluding the impact of freight and delivery revenues, gross profit as a percent of revenue increased 500 basis points over the last year's second quarter. Those are strong results, and they're not one-offs. They represent a next step on a long-term path of continuous compounding improvement. We provided additional information regarding our longer-term profit improvements in our release and the supplemental slides, so I won't repeat that here other than to highlight that on a trailing 12-month basis, our gross profit per ton in our core Aggregates segment has increased by 87% or $2.22 per ton since the recovery began in 2013. 
Now before I hand it off to John, I'd like to share a few thoughts regarding our expected results for the balance of the year. As I've already noted, we are reaffirming our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. We finished the first quarter trending towards the higher end of that range, although we gave some of that back during the second quarter. We continue to expect full year aggregate shipments to exceed 190 million tons. But our ultimate results will depend in large part on 3 things just as was the case in the second half of 2015. One, on the ability of our customers to catch up on weather-delayed work; two, on the start and completion timing of larger projects; and three, on the number of shipping days allowed by weather conditions, particularly in the fourth quarter. 
The demand fundamentals are there and strengthening. The pricing and unit profitability is there, it's on track and it's growing. So then it's really a matter of timing. How we finish will largely depend on how much the work that is clearly there to be completed by the end of the year before we move into 2017 where demand will only grow. 
Let me sum it up. We saw a strong first half with 9% shipments growth and 8% pricing growth in our core Aggregates segment. Longer-term demand fundamentals are in place pointing towards a strong scenario developing for 2017. 
In the near term, we've seen rapid growth across the southeast, but a lull and large project activity in parts of California, Texas and Illinois. We are benefiting from excellent continued improvements to our core profitability even during a quarter with slower volume growth. The pricing climate remains positive. And as was the case last year, we need to make up for some weather-delayed volumes in the second half. 
I'll come back in a moment with some final remarks. But for now, let me hand it off to John for a few brief comments regarding our overall cost controls, our balance sheet strength and our capital allocation priorities. John?"
312769,376363542,1020709,"Vulcan Materials Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2016",2016-08-01,"Earnings Calls","Vulcan Materials Company","Executives","Thanks, Tom.

I'd like to start with one more compliment to our local teams and their operational performance and cost control discipline throughout the earlier stage of the cycle. Although we've had and we likely continue to have ups and downs from quarter-to-quarter, the overall cost trend has been impressive. 
For example, in our core Aggregates segment, our unit cost of sales per ton, as measured on a trailing 12-month basis, has declined consistently with each reporting period since the recovery began in the second half of 2013. So over a 3-year period, when our average selling price for a ton of aggregates increased by about $1.64, again, measured on a trailing 12-month basis, our average unit cost of sales declined by about $0.57. 
Lower diesel prices have aided these results, but strong daily operating disciplines affected coordination among local production and sales teams and the commitment to continuous improvement have also played a central role. 
We often talk about how seemingly small improvements compound and add up to a sizable impact on our business. And in this case, our ongoing local operating disciplines have contributed meaningfully to the strong conversion of incremental revenue into incremental profit that we've reported throughout the recovery so far. 
Unfortunately, we cannot make entirely similar observations regarding our SAG costs despite the fact that we've held administrative headcount basically flat since the recovery began. As you've seen, second quarter SAG was $13.5 million higher than the prior year. A bit more than 1/2 of this increase results from the amount and timing of accruals for performance-based incentives and deferred compensation plans. Approximately another 1/4 of the rise in second quarter SAG resulted from higher salaries and relocation expenses, primarily related to investments in our sales and business development talent and the strategic rotation of sales leadership across geographies. 
We will continue to make strategic investments in our sales talent and capabilities. Those costs and higher incentive accruals will cause run rate SAG costs to be elevated in the near term with our full year projection now at $310 million. 
Although we're not fully satisfied with our recent results and trend, we will continue to leverage SAG to sales throughout the recovery and beyond. The investments we're making are sound and ultimately support higher volume growth at higher margins. 
I'll touch now briefly on our balance sheet strength as the facts have continued to improve, but the fundamental story remains unchanged. Our stated goal, as you know, is to maintain an investment-grade credit position throughout the cycle. We have achieved such a position and of course, our cash flow profile continues to improve. In short, we have the financial strength and flexibility needed to pursue a balanced mix of capital reinvestment, growth investments, including M&A and return of capital to shareholders. 
Finally, I'll note that our weighted average cost of capital has declined significantly since the recovery began in part due to our improving financial performance and credit position and in part due to our focus on aggregates and the divestiture of our cement and concrete assets from our portfolio. 
Turning now to capital allocation. Our summary message is that our recent and planned activities remain consistent with the priorities you've heard us articulate several times. We do remain active in terms of business development and the pursuit of acquisition opportunities that fit us strategically. And I think it is fair to say that we are aggressive, but disciplined. We're looking at the number of opportunities at various stages of development and again, we have the financial capacity to grow without overly straining our credit position. And we have continued to return additional capital to shareholders via share repurchases. As you know, we have not committed to a specific repurchase target. Instead, we'll remain opportunistic and seek to balance return of capital and reinvestment over time. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Tom."

Before taking your questions, I'd like to say a few words about my confidence in our company. I've been with this company for over 26 years, and I believe our business is stronger and more resilient than it's ever been. We're in the midst of a sustained multiyear recovery. We're enjoying an ongoing recovery in private construction. And on top of that, we are just beginning to see a new wave of increased public spending. We'll highlight these demand trends for 2017 and beyond during our Aggregates Day event on September 29. 
We have an amazing aggregates focused asset-based that positions us extremely well to serve the demand growth that is coming. Our core profitability and cash flows are very strong and just keep improving. Our balance sheet is strong. Our financial condition gives us a lot of flexibility to do smart M&A, to reinvest in our operations and to return capital to our shareholders. And our culture at this company is great. Our people are helping each other get better every day, and they are upbeat, and they are on their game. Our position is, frankly, an enviable one, especially when viewed against the backdrop of uncertain times. 
And I really like our position looking out over the next several years. At some point, our country must address the major infrastructure challenges that we still face as a nation. Look, it's good to have a 5-year federal highway bill, but we still have a degraded highway system. Major U.S. infrastructure investment must and will occur eventually, whether as a matter of smart, proactive economic policy, reactive fiscal stimulus, dire necessity or some combination of these. We don't assume such a scenario in our longer-term outlook, but we will be well positioned to meet that need when it arises. In the meantime, we remain very confident in our business and are focused on making a strong franchise even stronger. 
Let me conclude by thanking our outstanding employees for their performance during the quarter and for the work they continue to do every day to deliver another year of very strong results. And thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials.

Both the private side, residential is very healthy, non-res saw a little bit of softening in the second quarter, but the leading indicators in the pipeline, very healthy. The public side will only get better. We'll see a little bit of a lull in California, while they address funding. But overall, we don't see acceleration in either one of these states. I think that picking them one at a time, California, very positive. Our strength there is large commercial and highway projects, we saw a lull in that, of recent, the commercial side. Some of our customers maybe didn't pick up as much work of late as we would have liked. Okay, but [ph] we can do a better job on that. On the highway side, we'll see a little bit of a decrease, short-term decrease in funding because of gas price, lower gas prices, but that's got to rectify itself. California has the -- is rated the worst roads in the U.S. There's a number of bills that are in the state government for funding from roughly $3.5 billion -- increase of $3.5 billion up to $7 billion, and then there's, I think, around more than 10 measures that are on the ballot for November for local and county work that would total roughly an increase -- annual increase of about $2 billion. So overall, California is going to be fine. Virginia, as you said, we saw extreme weather, also have a little bit timing with projects. We had 2 big projects last year, the Midtown Tunnel and the large wind farm that were going. We have one push backed this year, the Fairfield Marine Terminal. But just to give you a little flavor around that, if you took 3 large jobs, they are coming I-66 in Northern Virginia, the Chesapeake Bay Bridge job and the Fairfield Marine, which I just mentioned. That would be -- put those jobs together, you're going to be around 7 million tons. So demand in Virginia will continue to grow."

So it's really a question of timing in our view, but it's one area that, so far in '16, we haven't seen the kind of growth we would have expected."

And Southern Virginia is over 800,000 tons, but it's gotten -- you'll see some of that in the '16, but a lot of that has gotten, too, pushed into '17. In North Carolina, the I-85 widening, it's probably 1.2 million tons, and it's -- we'll see a little bit of that in '16, but the majority of it in '17. The Northwest Corridor in Atlanta is 1.5 million. That's the widening of I-75, and that's 1.5 million tons and will -- now that, we'll probably do a little more. We'll probably get 700,000, 600,000 tons in '16. So it will be all over the place. And again, as John said earlier, it's going to be a matter of timing. The good news is the contractors and our customers will want to get the work done. They're going to press to get it done because they have visibility and know what's coming in '17, and so they got to get this off their books so they can free their crews up and go onto other projects.

And we probably have some customers who, on balance, just given negative tone out there, particularly on the private side, are a little more reluctant than they would be in a different time to add their own additional capacity to make their own big capital investments, whether that's a new equipment or land for development or larger staffs. So I wouldn't want to make it too big a deal. It was interesting to us, it's just the disconnect, if you will between the tone you kind of hear in the middle election cycle, which is really negative and what we see in our own business, which, frankly, is pretty positive. But nothing -- longer term, the dialogue around the higher levels of public infrastructure spending, particularly on road infrastructure and other infrastructure we're pretty excited about."

I think that, as I said earlier, I think our folks are doing a really good job of concentrating on our own operating efficiencies that we can control. Volumes coming back help that. So I feel pretty good about our cost and our ability to take incremental revenues to the bottom line. As far as capital projects, they're all over the place. Some is a simple as replacement of mobile equipment, screens and crushers. Usually when you do plant capital, it's a combination of both replacement and process improvement to get more throughput or reduce downtime, which helps on your cost, obviously, other than just like-for-like replacement. On the growth [ph] side, we've got a number of facilities that we're working on our distribution network, both rail and blue water that were different -- all of our different stages of completion.

That passed a year ago, and we'll see a little bit of that in '16. As I said earlier, majority will come in '17 and '18. North Carolina has improved their funding, as has Florida, as has South Carolina, as has Virginia. Their bill's being discussed in Alabama, and probably be -- won't be addressed until 2017. I tell you a similar story in Tennessee, where it needs to be addressed. They have not -- won't happen in '16. Hopefully, it'll happen in '17.

Trailing 12-month gross profit per ton in our Aggregates segment increased by 31% to $4.77 per ton and adjusted EBIT on a trailing 12-month basis increased 62% to $682 million. So the foundation for multiyear growth continues to strengthen in demand outlook, in execution and in our core profitability. 
Now regarding second quarter shipments. I want to reiterate a point made in last quarter's earnings call. A single quarter's result doesn't always give a good picture of the underlying volume trends in the business. Now obviously, the 3% growth rate for aggregate shipments in the quarter contrast sharply with the first quarter rate of 17%. Prolonged bad weather in certain markets, large project timing, sales mix and other factors can cause our business results to vary substantially week-to-week and month-to-month. Certainly, we've see that variability over the last 2 quarters, but the underlying drivers and the basic trends remain unchanged. 
For example, if we pull back to look at just the first half of the year as opposed to looking at 2 quarters individually, we see that our core Aggregates business has posted shipment growth of 9% for the first half 2016 and pricing growth of 8%. Those results are in line with recent trends and with our plans for the year. 
I'll comment in more detail on individual geographies during Q&A. But taken as a whole, the bottom line is that we still see our core demand drivers and longer-term project pipelines strengthening across our footprint. In fact, we anticipate sustained growth in all end-use segments even though we've yet to see much benefit in terms of shipments from rising public funding. 
We'll see continued recovery in private construction. Public funding will start to pick up in an important way by 2017 and beyond as states commit to large long-term projects on the strength of the FAST Act, and then we see a healthy number of large projects that we will serve in the queue for 2017 and '18. 
Now moving back to the second quarter. Just as a number of factors combine to boost the way the shipment grow in the first quarter, several factors combine to affect shipments in the second quarter. We saw extremely wet weather in several key markets. 
At the same time, certain markets experienced a lull in large project starts, both public and private. This was despite a healthy pipeline of projects and in retrospect, it's likely that some work was pulled forward into the first quarter. 
As you know, we typically a fairly high degree of variance in shipment patterns across our individual markets, particularly month-to-month. But I think it's fair to say that the second quarter brought with it a higher-than-normal degree of variance. The second quarter could be seen as a story of the haves and have-nots. Virginia, Texas, California and Illinois combined saw aggregate shipments decline by 10% [ph] versus the prior year, while the remainder of our states combined grew shipments by 14%. 
We continue to see strong shipment growth across most of the southeast where the recovery has really begun to take hold over recent quarters and certain of these states, for example, Georgia, have put in place higher levels of public funding that will support higher materials demand in 2017 and beyond even though we haven't seen much of that impact yet. 
For California, Texas, Virginia and Illinois, we've seen a mix of weather and large project timing impacting year-over-year shipment rates. Although the specifics vary by state and market, I'd note that California, Texas and Virginia each have healthy, longer-term growth prospects. And what we're experiencing now is more transitional or timing-related issues. In contrast, we don't currently see a similar path to longer-term demand growth in Illinois due to that state's well-known fiscal challenges, although our team there has done a nice job of growing its profits and cash flows. 
I mentioned the significant fluctuations in shipment rates month-to-month throughout the quarter. As you saw in our press release during May, this resulted in daily shipments declining by about 5% from the prior year. On the other hand, daily shipments rates in April and June were up approximately 8% and 6%, respectively. These kind of fluctuations are not uncommon. All the more reason to avoid extrapolating from short-term volume trends in a business such as ours. Even though these swings in shipments activity at the local level can create some operational challenges, our teams have done a superb job adapting to changing market conditions and consistently meeting our customers' needs. 
So ultimately, I don't find the recent spikes and lulls in demand to be a great concern. It's just the nature of the business. 
Regarding our local team's ability to adapt to changing market condition, I'm pleased with the way our people are delivering continued profitability gains despite modest overall shipment growth and shifting delivery and production schedules. 
Regarding pricing. Our average price -- freight-adjusted selling prices for aggregates in the quarter were up 7% over the prior year despite some headwinds from geographic and product mix. Meanwhile, our unit cost of sales were flat and unit cash gross profit per ton increased $0.86 or 15% from last year's quarter. Our incremental flow-through rate exceeded 80% for the quarter and 75% on a trailing 12-month basis. 
We also enjoyed healthy margin expansion in our Asphalt and our Concrete segments despite low rates of volume growth. 
On a total company basis and excluding the impact of freight and delivery revenues, gross profit as a percent of revenue increased 500 basis points over the last year's second quarter. Those are strong results, and they're not one-offs. They represent a next step on a long-term path of continuous compounding improvement. We provided additional information regarding our longer-term profit improvements in our release and the supplemental slides, so I won't repeat that here other than to highlight that on a trailing 12-month basis, our gross profit per ton in our core Aggregates segment has increased by 87% or $2.22 per ton since the recovery began in 2013. 
Now before I hand it off to John, I'd like to share a few thoughts regarding our expected results for the balance of the year. As I've already noted, we are reaffirming our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. We finished the first quarter trending towards the higher end of that range, although we gave some of that back during the second quarter. We continue to expect full year aggregate shipments to exceed 190 million tons. But our ultimate results will depend in large part on 3 things just as was the case in the second half of 2015. One, on the ability of our customers to catch up on weather-delayed work; two, on the start and completion timing of larger projects; and three, on the number of shipping days allowed by weather conditions, particularly in the fourth quarter. 
The demand fundamentals are there and strengthening. The pricing and unit profitability is there, it's on track and it's growing. So then it's really a matter of timing. How we finish will largely depend on how much the work that is clearly there to be completed by the end of the year before we move into 2017 where demand will only grow. 
Let me sum it up. We saw a strong first half with 9% shipments growth and 8% pricing growth in our core Aggregates segment. Longer-term demand fundamentals are in place pointing towards a strong scenario developing for 2017. 
In the near term, we've seen rapid growth across the southeast, but a lull and large project activity in parts of California, Texas and Illinois. We are benefiting from excellent continued improvements to our core profitability even during a quarter with slower volume growth. The pricing climate remains positive. And as was the case last year, we need to make up for some weather-delayed volumes in the second half. 
I'll come back in a moment with some final remarks. But for now, let me hand it off to John for a few brief comments regarding our overall cost controls, our balance sheet strength and our capital allocation priorities. John?"
312769,376363542,1020720,"Vulcan Materials Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2016",2016-08-01,"Earnings Calls","Vulcan Materials Company","Executives","Thanks, Tom.

I'd like to start with one more compliment to our local teams and their operational performance and cost control discipline throughout the earlier stage of the cycle. Although we've had and we likely continue to have ups and downs from quarter-to-quarter, the overall cost trend has been impressive. 
For example, in our core Aggregates segment, our unit cost of sales per ton, as measured on a trailing 12-month basis, has declined consistently with each reporting period since the recovery began in the second half of 2013. So over a 3-year period, when our average selling price for a ton of aggregates increased by about $1.64, again, measured on a trailing 12-month basis, our average unit cost of sales declined by about $0.57. 
Lower diesel prices have aided these results, but strong daily operating disciplines affected coordination among local production and sales teams and the commitment to continuous improvement have also played a central role. 
We often talk about how seemingly small improvements compound and add up to a sizable impact on our business. And in this case, our ongoing local operating disciplines have contributed meaningfully to the strong conversion of incremental revenue into incremental profit that we've reported throughout the recovery so far. 
Unfortunately, we cannot make entirely similar observations regarding our SAG costs despite the fact that we've held administrative headcount basically flat since the recovery began. As you've seen, second quarter SAG was $13.5 million higher than the prior year. A bit more than 1/2 of this increase results from the amount and timing of accruals for performance-based incentives and deferred compensation plans. Approximately another 1/4 of the rise in second quarter SAG resulted from higher salaries and relocation expenses, primarily related to investments in our sales and business development talent and the strategic rotation of sales leadership across geographies. 
We will continue to make strategic investments in our sales talent and capabilities. Those costs and higher incentive accruals will cause run rate SAG costs to be elevated in the near term with our full year projection now at $310 million. 
Although we're not fully satisfied with our recent results and trend, we will continue to leverage SAG to sales throughout the recovery and beyond. The investments we're making are sound and ultimately support higher volume growth at higher margins. 
I'll touch now briefly on our balance sheet strength as the facts have continued to improve, but the fundamental story remains unchanged. Our stated goal, as you know, is to maintain an investment-grade credit position throughout the cycle. We have achieved such a position and of course, our cash flow profile continues to improve. In short, we have the financial strength and flexibility needed to pursue a balanced mix of capital reinvestment, growth investments, including M&A and return of capital to shareholders. 
Finally, I'll note that our weighted average cost of capital has declined significantly since the recovery began in part due to our improving financial performance and credit position and in part due to our focus on aggregates and the divestiture of our cement and concrete assets from our portfolio. 
Turning now to capital allocation. Our summary message is that our recent and planned activities remain consistent with the priorities you've heard us articulate several times. We do remain active in terms of business development and the pursuit of acquisition opportunities that fit us strategically. And I think it is fair to say that we are aggressive, but disciplined. We're looking at the number of opportunities at various stages of development and again, we have the financial capacity to grow without overly straining our credit position. And we have continued to return additional capital to shareholders via share repurchases. As you know, we have not committed to a specific repurchase target. Instead, we'll remain opportunistic and seek to balance return of capital and reinvestment over time. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Tom."

Before taking your questions, I'd like to say a few words about my confidence in our company. I've been with this company for over 26 years, and I believe our business is stronger and more resilient than it's ever been. We're in the midst of a sustained multiyear recovery. We're enjoying an ongoing recovery in private construction. And on top of that, we are just beginning to see a new wave of increased public spending. We'll highlight these demand trends for 2017 and beyond during our Aggregates Day event on September 29. 
We have an amazing aggregates focused asset-based that positions us extremely well to serve the demand growth that is coming. Our core profitability and cash flows are very strong and just keep improving. Our balance sheet is strong. Our financial condition gives us a lot of flexibility to do smart M&A, to reinvest in our operations and to return capital to our shareholders. And our culture at this company is great. Our people are helping each other get better every day, and they are upbeat, and they are on their game. Our position is, frankly, an enviable one, especially when viewed against the backdrop of uncertain times. 
And I really like our position looking out over the next several years. At some point, our country must address the major infrastructure challenges that we still face as a nation. Look, it's good to have a 5-year federal highway bill, but we still have a degraded highway system. Major U.S. infrastructure investment must and will occur eventually, whether as a matter of smart, proactive economic policy, reactive fiscal stimulus, dire necessity or some combination of these. We don't assume such a scenario in our longer-term outlook, but we will be well positioned to meet that need when it arises. In the meantime, we remain very confident in our business and are focused on making a strong franchise even stronger. 
Let me conclude by thanking our outstanding employees for their performance during the quarter and for the work they continue to do every day to deliver another year of very strong results. And thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials.

Both the private side, residential is very healthy, non-res saw a little bit of softening in the second quarter, but the leading indicators in the pipeline, very healthy. The public side will only get better. We'll see a little bit of a lull in California, while they address funding. But overall, we don't see acceleration in either one of these states. I think that picking them one at a time, California, very positive. Our strength there is large commercial and highway projects, we saw a lull in that, of recent, the commercial side. Some of our customers maybe didn't pick up as much work of late as we would have liked. Okay, but [ph] we can do a better job on that. On the highway side, we'll see a little bit of a decrease, short-term decrease in funding because of gas price, lower gas prices, but that's got to rectify itself. California has the -- is rated the worst roads in the U.S. There's a number of bills that are in the state government for funding from roughly $3.5 billion -- increase of $3.5 billion up to $7 billion, and then there's, I think, around more than 10 measures that are on the ballot for November for local and county work that would total roughly an increase -- annual increase of about $2 billion. So overall, California is going to be fine. Virginia, as you said, we saw extreme weather, also have a little bit timing with projects. We had 2 big projects last year, the Midtown Tunnel and the large wind farm that were going. We have one push backed this year, the Fairfield Marine Terminal. But just to give you a little flavor around that, if you took 3 large jobs, they are coming I-66 in Northern Virginia, the Chesapeake Bay Bridge job and the Fairfield Marine, which I just mentioned. That would be -- put those jobs together, you're going to be around 7 million tons. So demand in Virginia will continue to grow."

But again, as Tom said, some of the spending on things like sewers and water infrastructure is not even really discretionary. If you're going to build as much new residential as we're building, you're going to have to build new water. So it's really a question of timing in our view, but it's one area that, so far in '16, we haven't seen the kind of growth we would have expected."

In North Carolina, the I-85 widening, it's probably 1.2 million tons, and it's -- we'll see a little bit of that in '16, but the majority of it in '17. The Northwest Corridor in Atlanta is 1.5 million. That's the widening of I-75, and that's 1.5 million tons and will -- now that, we'll probably do a little more. We'll probably get 700,000, 600,000 tons in '16. So it will be all over the place. And again, as John said earlier, it's going to be a matter of timing. The good news is the contractors and our customers will want to get the work done. They're going to press to get it done because they have visibility and know what's coming in '17, and so they got to get this off their books so they can free their crews up and go onto other projects.

I may have comments just to add to that, and my comments weren't reflective on the nature of the dialogue around future infrastructure spending, which we actually, as Tom said, see quite positive at a federal level, state level and local level across many of our geographies. It's more just a negative tone at some degree of uncertainty that would seem to affect private investment levels. And you'll know more about this from us, but you may have seen some of that in second quarter GDP data. And we probably have some customers who, on balance, just given negative tone out there, particularly on the private side, are a little more reluctant than they would be in a different time to add their own additional capacity to make their own big capital investments, whether that's a new equipment or land for development or larger staffs. So I wouldn't want to make it too big a deal. It was interesting to us, it's just the disconnect, if you will between the tone you kind of hear in the middle election cycle, which is really negative and what we see in our own business, which, frankly, is pretty positive. But nothing -- longer term, the dialogue around the higher levels of public infrastructure spending, particularly on road infrastructure and other infrastructure we're pretty excited about."

I think that, as I said earlier, I think our folks are doing a really good job of concentrating on our own operating efficiencies that we can control. Volumes coming back help that. So I feel pretty good about our cost and our ability to take incremental revenues to the bottom line. As far as capital projects, they're all over the place. Some is a simple as replacement of mobile equipment, screens and crushers. Usually when you do plant capital, it's a combination of both replacement and process improvement to get more throughput or reduce downtime, which helps on your cost, obviously, other than just like-for-like replacement. On the growth [ph] side, we've got a number of facilities that we're working on our distribution network, both rail and blue water that were different -- all of our different stages of completion.

That passed a year ago, and we'll see a little bit of that in '16. As I said earlier, majority will come in '17 and '18. North Carolina has improved their funding, as has Florida, as has South Carolina, as has Virginia. Their bill's being discussed in Alabama, and probably be -- won't be addressed until 2017. I tell you a similar story in Tennessee, where it needs to be addressed. They have not -- won't happen in '16. Hopefully, it'll happen in '17.

We rem",1511,"Thank you, Mark, and thank all of you for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. Our business continues to perform very well. Even with a slower rate of shipment growth in the second quarter, our margins continued to improve considerably. We remain on track consistent with our guidance to deliver full year adjusted EBITDA of between $1 billion and $1.1 billion. 
The fundamentals of the business continue to strengthen. I'll mention 3 areas, in particular. One, the factors underpinning the continued gradual recovery in demand remains intact, notably with higher levels of public funding supporting further growth in 2017 and beyond. Two, our internal execution remains very solid. We're meeting our customers' rising needs, and we're balancing volumes, pricing and product mix. Our teams are continuing to do an outstanding job converting incremental revenue into profits. And three, the core profitability of the business continues to improve. Trailing 12-month gross profit per ton in our Aggregates segment increased by 31% to $4.77 per ton and adjusted EBIT on a trailing 12-month basis increased 62% to $682 million. So the foundation for multiyear growth continues to strengthen in demand outlook, in execution and in our core profitability. 
Now regarding second quarter shipments. I want to reiterate a point made in last quarter's earnings call. A single quarter's result doesn't always give a good picture of the underlying volume trends in the business. Now obviously, the 3% growth rate for aggregate shipments in the quarter contrast sharply with the first quarter rate of 17%. Prolonged bad weather in certain markets, large project timing, sales mix and other factors can cause our business results to vary substantially week-to-week and month-to-month. Certainly, we've see that variability over the last 2 quarters, but the underlying drivers and the basic trends remain unchanged. 
For example, if we pull back to look at just the first half of the year as opposed to looking at 2 quarters individually, we see that our core Aggregates business has posted shipment growth of 9% for the first half 2016 and pricing growth of 8%. Those results are in line with recent trends and with our plans for the year. 
I'll comment in more detail on individual geographies during Q&A. But taken as a whole, the bottom line is that we still see our core demand drivers and longer-term project pipelines strengthening across our footprint. In fact, we anticipate sustained growth in all end-use segments even though we've yet to see much benefit in terms of shipments from rising public funding. 
We'll see continued recovery in private construction. Public funding will start to pick up in an important way by 2017 and beyond as states commit to large long-term projects on the strength of the FAST Act, and then we see a healthy number of large projects that we will serve in the queue for 2017 and '18. 
Now moving back to the second quarter. Just as a number of factors combine to boost the way the shipment grow in the first quarter, several factors combine to affect shipments in the second quarter. We saw extremely wet weather in several key markets. 
At the same time, certain markets experienced a lull in large project starts, both public and private. This was despite a healthy pipeline of projects and in retrospect, it's likely that some work was pulled forward into the first quarter. 
As you know, we typically a fairly high degree of variance in shipment patterns across our individual markets, particularly month-to-month. But I think it's fair to say that the second quarter brought with it a higher-than-normal degree of variance. The second quarter could be seen as a story of the haves and have-nots. Virginia, Texas, California and Illinois combined saw aggregate shipments decline by 10% [ph] versus the prior year, while the remainder of our states combined grew shipments by 14%. 
We continue to see strong shipment growth across most of the southeast where the recovery has really begun to take hold over recent quarters and certain of these states, for example, Georgia, have put in place higher levels of public funding that will support higher materials demand in 2017 and beyond even though we haven't seen much of that impact yet. 
For California, Texas, Virginia and Illinois, we've seen a mix of weather and large project timing impacting year-over-year shipment rates. Although the specifics vary by state and market, I'd note that California, Texas and Virginia each have healthy, longer-term growth prospects. And what we're experiencing now is more transitional or timing-related issues. In contrast, we don't currently see a similar path to longer-term demand growth in Illinois due to that state's well-known fiscal challenges, although our team there has done a nice job of growing its profits and cash flows. 
I mentioned the significant fluctuations in shipment rates month-to-month throughout the quarter. As you saw in our press release during May, this resulted in daily shipments declining by about 5% from the prior year. On the other hand, daily shipments rates in April and June were up approximately 8% and 6%, respectively. These kind of fluctuations are not uncommon. All the more reason to avoid extrapolating from short-term volume trends in a business such as ours. Even though these swings in shipments activity at the local level can create some operational challenges, our teams have done a superb job adapting to changing market conditions and consistently meeting our customers' needs. 
So ultimately, I don't find the recent spikes and lulls in demand to be a great concern. It's just the nature of the business. 
Regarding our local team's ability to adapt to changing market condition, I'm pleased with the way our people are delivering continued profitability gains despite modest overall shipment growth and shifting delivery and production schedules. 
Regarding pricing. Our average price -- freight-adjusted selling prices for aggregates in the quarter were up 7% over the prior year despite some headwinds from geographic and product mix. Meanwhile, our unit cost of sales were flat and unit cash gross profit per ton increased $0.86 or 15% from last year's quarter. Our incremental flow-through rate exceeded 80% for the quarter and 75% on a trailing 12-month basis. 
We also enjoyed healthy margin expansion in our Asphalt and our Concrete segments despite low rates of volume growth. 
On a total company basis and excluding the impact of freight and delivery revenues, gross profit as a percent of revenue increased 500 basis points over the last year's second quarter. Those are strong results, and they're not one-offs. They represent a next step on a long-term path of continuous compounding improvement. We provided additional information regarding our longer-term profit improvements in our release and the supplemental slides, so I won't repeat that here other than to highlight that on a trailing 12-month basis, our gross profit per ton in our core Aggregates segment has increased by 87% or $2.22 per ton since the recovery began in 2013. 
Now before I hand it off to John, I'd like to share a few thoughts regarding our expected results for the balance of the year. As I've already noted, we are reaffirming our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. We finished the first quarter trending towards the higher end of that range, although we gave some of that back during the second quarter. We continue to expect full year aggregate shipments to exceed 190 million tons. But our ultimate results will depend in large part on 3 things just as was the case in the second half of 2015. One, on the ability of our customers to catch up on weather-delayed work; two, on the start and completion timing of larger projects; and three, on the number of shipping days allowed by weather conditions, particularly in the fourth quarter. 
The demand fundamentals are there and strengthening. The pricing and unit profitability is there, it's on track and it's growing. So then it's really a matter of timing. How we finish will largely depend on how much the work that is clearly there to be completed by the end of the year before we move into 2017 where demand will only grow. 
Let me sum it up. We saw a strong first half with 9% shipments growth and 8% pricing growth in our core Aggregates segment. Longer-term demand fundamentals are in place pointing towards a strong scenario developing for 2017. 
In the near term, we've seen rapid growth across the southeast, but a lull in large project activity in parts of California, Texas and Illinois. We are benefiting from excellent continued improvements to our core profitability even during a quarter with slower volume growth. The pricing climate remains positive. And as was the case last year, we need to make up for some weather-delayed volumes in the second half. 
I'll come back in a moment with some final remarks. But for now, let me hand it off to John for a few brief comments regarding our overall cost controls, our balance sheet strength and our capital allocation priorities. John?"
312769,376363542,1020933,"Vulcan Materials Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2016",2016-08-01,"Earnings Calls","Vulcan Materials Company","Executives","Thanks, Tom.

I'd like to start with one more compliment to our local teams and their operational performance and cost control discipline throughout the earlier stage of the cycle. Although we've had and we likely continue to have ups and downs from quarter-to-quarter, the overall cost trend has been impressive. 
For example, in our core Aggregates segment, our unit cost of sales per ton, as measured on a trailing 12-month basis, has declined consistently with each reporting period since the recovery began in the second half of 2013. So over a 3-year period, when our average selling price for a ton of aggregates increased by about $1.64, again, measured on a trailing 12-month basis, our average unit cost of sales declined by about $0.57. 
Lower diesel prices have aided these results, but strong daily operating disciplines affected coordination among local production and sales teams and the commitment to continuous improvement have also played a central role. 
We often talk about how seemingly small improvements compound and add up to a sizable impact on our business. And in this case, our ongoing local operating disciplines have contributed meaningfully to the strong conversion of incremental revenue into incremental profit that we've reported throughout the recovery so far. 
Unfortunately, we cannot make entirely similar observations regarding our SAG costs despite the fact that we've held administrative headcount basically flat since the recovery began. As you've seen, second quarter SAG was $13.5 million higher than the prior year. A bit more than 1/2 of this increase results from the amount and timing of accruals for performance-based incentives and deferred compensation plans. Approximately another 1/4 of the rise in second quarter SAG resulted from higher salaries and relocation expenses, primarily related to investments in our sales and business development talent and the strategic rotation of sales leadership across geographies. 
We will continue to make strategic investments in our sales talent and capabilities. Those costs and higher incentive accruals will cause run rate SAG costs to be elevated in the near term with our full year projection now at $310 million. 
Although we're not fully satisfied with our recent results and trend, we will continue to leverage SAG to sales throughout the recovery and beyond. The investments we're making are sound and ultimately support higher volume growth at higher margins. 
I'll touch now briefly on our balance sheet strength as the facts have continued to improve, but the fundamental story remains unchanged. Our stated goal, as you know, is to maintain an investment-grade credit position throughout the cycle. We have achieved such a position and of course, our cash flow profile continues to improve. In short, we have the financial strength and flexibility needed to pursue a balanced mix of capital reinvestment, growth investments, including M&A and return of capital to shareholders. 
Finally, I'll note that our weighted average cost of capital has declined significantly since the recovery began in part due to our improving financial performance and credit position and in part due to our focus on aggregates and the divestiture of our cement and concrete assets from our portfolio. 
Turning now to capital allocation. Our summary message is that our recent and planned activities remain consistent with the priorities you've heard us articulate several times. We do remain active in terms of business development and the pursuit of acquisition opportunities that fit us strategically. And I think it is fair to say that we are aggressive, but disciplined. We're looking at the number of opportunities at various stages of development and again, we have the financial capacity to grow without overly straining our credit position. And we have continued to return additional capital to shareholders via share repurchases. As you know, we have not committed to a specific repurchase target. Instead, we'll remain opportunistic and seek to balance return of capital and reinvestment over time. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Tom."

Before taking your questions, I'd like to say a few words about my confidence in our company. I've been with this company for over 26 years, and I believe our business is stronger and more resilient than it's ever been. We're in the midst of a sustained multiyear recovery. We're enjoying an ongoing recovery in private construction. And on top of that, we are just beginning to see a new wave of increased public spending. We'll highlight these demand trends for 2017 and beyond during our Aggregates Day event on September 29. 
We have an amazing aggregates focused asset-based that positions us extremely well to serve the demand growth that is coming. Our core profitability and cash flows are very strong and just keep improving. Our balance sheet is strong. Our financial condition gives us a lot of flexibility to do smart M&A, to reinvest in our operations and to return capital to our shareholders. And our culture at this company is great. Our people are helping each other get better every day, and they are upbeat, and they are on their game. Our position is, frankly, an enviable one, especially when viewed against the backdrop of uncertain times. 
And I really like our position looking out over the next several years. At some point, our country must address the major infrastructure challenges that we still face as a nation. Look, it's good to have a 5-year federal highway bill, but we still have a degraded highway system. Major U.S. infrastructure investment must and will occur eventually, whether as a matter of smart, proactive economic policy, reactive fiscal stimulus, dire necessity or some combination of these. We don't assume such a scenario in our longer-term outlook, but we will be well positioned to meet that need when it arises. In the meantime, we remain very confident in our business and are focused on making a strong franchise even stronger. 
Let me conclude by thanking our outstanding employees for their performance during the quarter and for the work they continue to do every day to deliver another year of very strong results. And thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials.

Both the private side, residential is very healthy, non-res saw a little bit of softening in the second quarter, but the leading indicators in the pipeline, very healthy. The public side will only get better. We'll see a little bit of a lull in California, while they address funding. But overall, we don't see acceleration in either one of these states. I think that picking them one at a time, California, very positive. Our strength there is large commercial and highway projects, we saw a lull in that, of recent, the commercial side. Some of our customers maybe didn't pick up as much work of late as we would have liked. Okay, but [ph] we can do a better job on that. On the highway side, we'll see a little bit of a decrease, short-term decrease in funding because of gas price, lower gas prices, but that's got to rectify itself. California has the -- is rated the worst roads in the U.S. There's a number of bills that are in the state government for funding from roughly $3.5 billion -- increase of $3.5 billion up to $7 billion, and then there's, I think, around more than 10 measures that are on the ballot for November for local and county work that would total roughly an increase -- annual increase of about $2 billion. So overall, California is going to be fine. Virginia, as you said, we saw extreme weather, also have a little bit timing with projects. We had 2 big projects last year, the Midtown Tunnel and the large wind farm that were going. We have one push backed this year, the Fairfield Marine Terminal. But just to give you a little flavor around that, if you took 3 large jobs, they are coming I-66 in Northern Virginia, the Chesapeake Bay Bridge job and the Fairfield Marine, which I just mentioned. That would be -- put those jobs together, you're going to be around 7 million tons. So demand in Virginia will continue to grow."

So it's really a question of timing in our view, but it's one area that, so far in '16, we haven't seen the kind of growth we would have expected."

In North Carolina, the I-85 widening, it's probably 1.2 million tons, and it's -- we'll see a little bit of that in '16, but the majority of it in '17. The Northwest Corridor in Atlanta is 1.5 million. That's the widening of I-75, and that's 1.5 million tons and will -- now that, we'll probably do a little more. We'll probably get 700,000, 600,000 tons in '16. So it will be all over the place. And again, as John said earlier, it's going to be a matter of timing. The good news is the contractors and our customers will want to get the work done. They're going to press to get it done because they have visibility and know what's coming in '17, and so they got to get this off their books so they can free their crews up and go onto other projects.

So like I said, we have a 5-year bill, but we still have a degraded highway system and that bill is not going to improve that grade. So it is an issue. Now what's going to happen, we don't know any more than we know what's going to happen in the election, but it is an important issue and one that people are putting out there in front of everyone."

I may have comments just to add to that, and my comments weren't reflective on the nature of the dialogue around future infrastructure spending, which we actually, as Tom said, see quite positive at a federal level, state level and local level across many of our geographies. It's more just a negative tone at some degree of uncertainty that would seem to affect private investment levels. And you'll know more about this from us, but you may have seen some of that in second quarter GDP data. And we probably have some customers who, on balance, just given negative tone out there, particularly on the private side, are a little more reluctant than they would be in a different time to add their own additional capacity to make their own big capital investments, whether that's a new equipment or land for development or larger staffs. So I wouldn't want to make it too big a deal. It was interesting to us, it's just the disconnect, if you will between the tone you kind of hear in the middle election cycle, which is really negative and what we see in our own business, which, frankly, is pretty positive. But nothing -- longer term, the dialogue around the higher levels of public infrastructure spending, particularly on road infrastructure and other infrastructure we're pretty excited about."

I think that, as I said earlier, I think our folks are doing a really good job of concentrating on our own operating efficiencies that we can control. Volumes coming back help that. So I feel pretty good about our cost and our ability to take incremental revenues to the bottom line. As far as capital projects, they're all over the place. Some is a simple as replacement of mobile equipment, screens and crushers. Usually when you do plant capital, it's a combination of both replacement and process improvement to get more throughput or reduce downtime, which helps on your cost, obviously, other than just like-for-like replacement. On the growth [ph] side, we've got a number of facilities that we're working on our distribution network, both rail and blue water that were different -- all of our different stages of completion.

That passed a year ago, and we'll see a little bit of that in '16. As I said earlier, majority will come in '17 and '18. North Carolina has improved their funding, as has Florida, as has South Carolina, as has Virginia. Their bill's being discussed in Alabama, and probably be -- won't be addressed until 2017. I tell you a similar story in Tennessee, where it needs to be addressed. They have not -- won't happen in '16. Hopefully, it'll happen in '17.

I thank all of you for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. We'll keep our prepared remarks fairly brief today since we discussed many of the key business trends and our outlook just a few weeks ago during our Analyst Day event",1394,"Thank you, Mark. I thank all of you for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. We'll keep our prepared remarks fairly brief today since we discussed many of the key business trends and our outlook just a few weeks ago during our Analyst Day event at Atlanta. 
Looking at the third quarter and our recent performance, 4 main points stand out. First, we obviously saw shipments decline in the third quarter. However, to my second point, we see it as localized, not cyclical. Third, our profitability continues to grow. And fourth, our prospects for sustained growth remain very exciting. Let me address each in just a little more detail. 
First, we obviously have seen a drop in year-over-year shipments. This is due in part to a period of relative weakness in new construction starts across much of our footprint. It's also due to weather and other location-specific factors impacting our business in California, Texas, Virginia and Illinois. Third quarter year-over-year shipments in these 4 states were down 15% collectively. Now in stark contrast, our other markets experienced combined year-over-year shipment growth of 6%, and in fact, several markets saw strong double-digit growth to the order of 12% to 21%. 
Second, and importantly, we continue to view these volume headwinds as temporary or a transitional low in a multiyear recovery that is still intact and sound and actually with a long way to run. To this point, the variation in results across our footprint reveals volume challenges that are clearly localized rather than cyclical. Notably, our daily aggregate shipment rate increased from August to September and from September to October, with October exceeding the prior-year period by about 3%. In addition, according to Dodge reports, trailing 12 month construction starts showed sequential improvements in both August and September, picking up from a noticeable slowdown in March that lingered all the way through July. In short, the fundamental, foundational drivers of a multiyear recovery remain firmly in place. 
To point number three. Our core profit engine remains very powerful. We're on track to deliver $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA this year, and this is despite volumes that are below our original expectations. In our Aggregates segment, third quarter freight-adjusted selling prices were 7% ahead of third quarter 2015 and gross profit per ton rose 9%. With the 12 months ended in September, gross profit per ton has increased 25%. The flow-through of incremental freight-adjusted revenue into incremental gross profit has exceeded 80%. 
Also for the 12 months into September, the total business delivered net earnings of $371 million and $981 million of adjusted EBITDA, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of more than 27%. This is an improvement of 430 basis points over the prior year. 
Fourth, and finally, we remain excited about our long-range gross prospects. We are well on track to achieve our profitability goals, and near term, we like the volume, pricing and profitability momentum we see for 2017. We also like the very robust pipeline of projects that we see building for 2018 and 2019. And John will share a few thoughts regarding our current momentum and outlook in a minute, but first, I'll offer a bit more insight into how our business has been performing across our footprint. 
As we discussed during our Aggregates Day in Atlanta, the recent demand climate has made it a little hard to distinguish the signal from the noise. For example, there's been clear accelerating growth in the longer-term project pipeline. The impact of the Federal Highway bill, [ph] the FAST Act, and higher state level funding are beginning to show up in the mix. At the same time, there's been a softening in the rate at which this water behind the dam has been released in the form of construction starts. There was also a low in state highway spending during the first half of the year, and this was as states worked they way through the remainder of a fiscal year that did not include new FAST Act funds. Notably, this has now started to turn in a positive direction. The latest [ph] report on highway contract awards shows them increasing by 13% [ph] in September. And this is the second consecutive month of growth following weak contract award activity during the first half of the year. Looking closely, this isn't too surprising as many states have entered a new fiscal year with the FAST Act money flowing into their pipelines and a backlog of projects ready to go. 
During the slowdown period early this year, a number of markets saw adverse weather conditions, shortages in skilled labor and other factors that have constrained the rate at which existing construction projects could be completed. A number of our customers have found it difficult to catch up in the near term on work deferred due to bad weather earlier in the year. Generally speaking, our operations across the southeast and mid-Atlantic states continue to post solid gains in volumes despite these challenges. Florida, Georgia and North Carolina enjoyed robust double-digit volume growth to the tune of 12% to 21%. And this was accompanied by strong pricing and unit margin performance. Now, Virginia on the other hand, is an example of a market where we're seeing good pricing momentum although volume momentum hasn't picked up yet. 
Turning to Texas and California. Shipment levels in these states remain challenged in the third quarter. This was below the expectations we had at the beginning of the year. Shipments in Texas were down 21% in the quarter. This was driven in part by Coastal Texas [ph] shipments, which were down 27%. All of Texas was impacted by bad weather throughout the quarter, most notably in August. Business in North and South Texas fell off accordingly from what would otherwise have been a much stronger performance in those areas. Houston and the coast [ph] however, in addition to the well-known downturn in the oil and gas industry and extensive flooding, also experienced a delay in textile work. So when we talk about Texas and volume declines, it is in fact largely isolated to the coastal area of the state, separating out statewide weather impacts. But despite a transitory period of volume headwinds, there is ongoing pricing momentum in Texas and it simply highlights the underlying confidence and continued growth in the Lone Star State. [ph] At the same time, our core profitability, which has also been strong, keeps improving. The bottom line is that overall, we expect continued recovery in Texas markets. 
In California, shipments were down 17% from last year's quarter. We continue to see a slowdown in large project work in public and private sectors. This is work we are well-positioned to serve. Caltrans also continue to grapple with highway funding related to diminished excise taxes. This created a bigger slowdown in project work than anticipated. We have reason to believe that political leaders will ultimately reach agreement on new state funding measures for California -- for California roads, which are rated the worst in the U.S. Putting it all together, we expect to see a return in 2017 to a pattern of recovery and growth in California. Our sales force is aligned to take advantage of growing up of these growth opportunities. Large projects are getting back on track, the pipeline of major projects continues to get bigger and bigger, construction starts are back on the upswing and there will hopefully be improvements in state funding for roads, along with local highway improvement initiatives. In fact, we're already seeing early signs of improvement. Highway contract awards in California were up 98% in September as these new FAST Act funds are starting to flow into the system. 
Underlying these facts are fundamental strengths. In our California business as well as Texas, our core profitability continues to improve. And at California, as in Texas, despite the low in shipments, pricing has remained strong in the high single digits, underscoring the basic confidence and the trajectory of California markets. Across our company, our focus on core profit improvements and the little things that make us better every day is keeping us on track towards our longer-term goals, and you see it in our results. Now, I hand it over to John for some brief additional comments regarding our outlook for 2016 and the momentum we see heading into 2017."

I'd I like to touch quickly on a few points regarding our forward outlook, but let me first note that our views have not changed meaningfully from those that we communicated during our late September event in At",618,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning to everybody. I'd I like to touch quickly on a few points regarding our forward outlook, but let me first note that our views have not changed meaningfully from those that we communicated during our late September event in Atlanta. First, and as Tom noted, we continue to project $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA for fiscal year '16. And due to continued gains in unit profitability and the overall margins, we think we can reach the low end of our beginning of year guidance range despite shipments falling well below our original forecast. Now to put this outlook into some context, let's take a look at results and trends, particularly with respect to our improved profitability over the trailing 12 months. You heard Tom say and as you've seen in our release, during that period, we generated net earnings of $371 million and adjusted EBITDA of $981 million. But behind that it's important to note that that our average freight-adjusted selling prices in our Aggregates segment have increased 8% over that time. Our average gross profit per ton has increased 25% over that time and our overall gross profit as a percent of freight-adjusted revenue for the company has risen from 34% to 39%. 
As we consistently called out, fourth quarter results can be impacted significantly by weather and the effective length of the construction season. And our strong results from Q4 of 2015 present tough comparisons. But our improved core profitability should be sufficient to allow us to reach our stated goals for 2016 if recent shipment momentum holds up through the quarter. 
Now turning to 2017. I'll begin by reiterating that it remains too early for us to give specific or firm guidance. We're primarily focused on finishing the current year strong and we're just at the beginning of our internal planning cycle for next year. But from what we can see today, from the day that we see today, we expect continued volume recovery in 2017, along with further improvements in pricing and overall margins. In other words, continued progress on track with the longer-range goals we outlined previously. 
With respect to volumes, and again, we're not yet in a position to share specific numbers. We currently expect growth in each of our primary end use segments next year: residential, private non-res, highways and other public infrastructure. And we also expect to see broad-based growth across our geographic footprint and growth in substantially all of our key market areas. We noted that construction starts data points have recently turned back up after several months of softening. And highway contract awards in our key states have all also turned up recently. And on top of that, longer term project pipelines continue to strengthen from already strong levels. But the relative stark weakness we've experience earlier this year, combined with strong first quarter 2016 comparisons, suggest that 2017's volume growth on a year-over-year basis could be back half loaded. We expect the pricing climate to remain positive and constructive for 2017. The strength of longer-term project pipelines and significant increases in dedicated public transportation funding reinforce confidence in a sustained recovery. And materials producers and others in the construction supply chain remain focused on earning adequate returns on capital. Competition remains intense, but overall and generally speaking, we're battling over value and not just volume. Given these dynamics, we expect our free cash flow profile and overall financial condition to strengthen further next year. We should have the financial capacity and the flexibility needed to support reinvestment in our franchise, growth including but not limited to M&, A as well as additional returns of capital to shareholders. Tom, back over to you."

The drivers of recovery in shipments remain very much in place. Our core profitability continues to improve and our fundamental outlook for the future of the business remains unchanged. Given that positive outlook, I can assure you that we will invest in our business accordingly. We will keep investing internally. For example, we will plow about $125 million into internal growth projects this year. These projects will help us serve our customers better, increase efficiencies and add to the bottom line. They include 5 new rail yards; 3 in Texas, 1 in Charleston, South Carolina and another 1 in Savannah Georgia, along with 6 Greenfield sites, that's new quarries, that were developed in the growth markets across the country. At the same time, we will continue to aggressively pursue both owned acquisitions in key markets, as well as other strategic acquisitions, all of which will further strengthen our leading position in the industry. 
I want to conclude by thanking our employees for their commitment to improving everyday, to working safely, to finishing this year strong and to delivering another year of even strong results.

We see sustained strength in residential and kind of smaller private work. And the headwinds that we faced this year, should repeat next year. If you look at the pipeline that stark data and listen to our customers, we feel better about California even though we haven't seen shipments come back yet. And we feel good about the public funding situation in California. The elements are in place for this to come together for state funding. You got to remember that California still has the worst roads in the country even with a little bit of increase in the gas tax and shipment price. We'll start to see the FAST Act start kicking in. And then we saw a August distribution of federal funds at just under $0.25 billion to California. And then, you got -- as you know, you got the local initiatives that on about for next week, that if they all passed, will total about $2.5 billion annual. So for us in California, we say it's not if, it's really about pace and probably the pace of large projects. So I think we're feeling pretty good about '17 and the longer-term outlook is pretty bright for California."

I will tell you at this point, when we look at it, it's pretty generally accepted in the markets and the markets are healthy with that, and all of that's driven by that visibility and confidence in that pipeline that's going.

We'll keep our prepared remarks fairly brief today since we discussed many of the key business trends and our outlook just a few weeks ago during our Analyst Day event",1389,"Thank you, Mark. I thank all of you for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. We'll keep our prepared remarks fairly brief today since we discussed many of the key business trends and our outlook just a few weeks ago during our Analyst Day event at Atlanta. 
Looking at the third quarter and our recent performance, 4 main points stand out. First, we obviously saw shipments decline in the third quarter. However, to my second point, we see it as localized, not cyclical. Third, our profitability continues to grow. And fourth, our prospects for sustained growth remain very exciting. Let me address each in just a little more detail. 
First, we obviously have seen a drop in year-over-year shipments. This is due in part to a period of relative weakness in new construction starts across much of our footprint. It's also due to weather and other location-specific factors impacting our business in California, Texas, Virginia and Illinois. Third quarter year-over-year shipments in these 4 states were down 15% collectively. Now in stark contrast, our other markets experienced combined year-over-year shipment growth of 6%, and in fact, several markets saw strong double-digit growth to the order of 12% to 21%. 
Second, and importantly, we continue to view these volume headwinds as temporary or a transitional low in a multiyear recovery that is still intact and sound and actually with a long way to run. To this point, the variation in results across our footprint reveals volume challenges that are clearly localized rather than cyclical. Notably, our daily aggregate shipment rate increased from August to September and from September to October, with October exceeding the prior-year period by about 3%. In addition, according to Dodge reports, trailing 12 month construction starts showed sequential improvements in both August and September, picking up from a noticeable slowdown in March that lingered all the way through July. In short, the fundamental, foundational drivers of a multiyear recovery remain firmly in place. 
To point number three. Our core profit engine remains very powerful. We're on track to deliver $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA this year, and this is despite volumes that are below our original expectations. In our Aggregates segment, third quarter freight-adjusted selling prices were 7% ahead of third quarter 2015 and gross profit per ton rose 9%. With the 12 months ended in September, gross profit per ton has increased 25%. The flow-through of incremental freight-adjusted revenue into incremental gross profit has exceeded 80%. 
Also for the 12 months into September, the total business delivered net earnings of $371 million and $981 million of adjusted EBITDA, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of more than 27%. This is an improvement of 430 basis points over the prior year. 
Fourth, and finally, we remain excited about our long-range gross prospects. We are well on track to achieve our profitability goals, and near term, we like the volume, pricing and profitability momentum we see for 2017. We also like the very robust pipeline of projects that we see building for 2018 and 2019. And John will share a few thoughts regarding our current momentum and outlook in a minute, but first, I'll offer a bit more insight into how our business has been performing across our footprint. 
As we discussed during our Aggregates Day in Atlanta, the recent demand climate has made it a little hard to distinguish the signal from the noise. For example, there's been clear accelerating growth in the longer-term project pipeline. The impact of the Federal Highway bill, the FAST Act, and higher state level funding are beginning to show up in the mix. At the same time, there's been a softening in the rate at which this water behind the dam has been released in the form of construction starts. There was also a low in state highway spending during the first half of the year, and this was as states worked they way through the remainder of a fiscal year that did not include new FAST Act funds. Notably, this has now started to turn in a positive direction. The latest [indiscernible] report on highway contract awards shows them increasing by 30% in September. And this is the second consecutive month of growth following weak contract award activity during the first half of the year. Looking closely, this isn't too surprising as many states have entered a new fiscal year with the FAST Act money flowing into their pipelines and a backlog of projects ready to go. 
During the slowdown period early this year, a number of markets saw adverse weather conditions, shortages in skilled labor and other factors that have constrained the rate at which existing construction projects could be completed. A number of our customers have found it difficult to catch up in the near term on work deferred due to bad weather earlier in the year. Generally speaking, our operations across the southeast and mid-Atlantic states continue to post solid gains in volumes despite these challenges. Florida, Georgia and North Carolina enjoyed robust double-digit volume growth to the tune of 12% to 21%. And this was accompanied by strong pricing and unit margin performance. Now, Virginia on the other hand, is an example of a market where we're seeing good pricing momentum although volume momentum hasn't picked up yet. 
Turning to Texas and California. Shipment levels in these states remain challenged in the third quarter. This was below the expectations we had at the beginning of the year. Shipments in Texas were down 21% in the quarter. This was driven in part by Coastal Texas shipments, which were down 27%. All of Texas was impacted by bad weather throughout the quarter, most notably in August. Business in North and South Texas fell off accordingly from what would otherwise have been a much stronger performance in those areas. Houston and the coast however, in addition to the well-known downturn in the oil and gas industry and extensive flooding, also experienced a delay in textile work. So when we talk about Texas and volume declines, it is in fact largely isolated to the coastal area of the state, separating out statewide weather impacts. But despite a transitory period of volume headwinds, there is ongoing pricing momentum in Texas and it simply highlights the underlying confidence and continued growth in the Lone Star State. At the same time, our core profitability, which has also been strong, keeps improving. The bottom line is that overall, we expect continued recovery in Texas markets. 
In California, shipments were down 17% from last year's quarter. We continue to see a slowdown in large project work in public and private sectors. This is work we are well-positioned to serve. Caltrans also continue to grapple with highway funding related to diminished excise taxes. This created a bigger slowdown in project work than anticipated. We have reason to believe that political leaders will ultimately reach agreement on new state funding measures for California -- for California roads, which are rated the worst in the U.S. Putting it all together, we expect to see a return in 2017 to a pattern of recovery and growth in California. Our sales force is aligned to take advantage of growing up of these growth opportunities. Large projects are getting back on track, the pipeline of major projects continues to get bigger and bigger, construction starts are back on the upswing and there will hopefully be improvements in state funding for roads, along with local highway improvement initiatives. In fact, we're already seeing early signs of improvement. Highway contract awards in California were up 98% in September as these new FAST Act funds are starting to flow into the system. 
Underlying these facts are fundamental strengths. In our California business as well as Texas, our core profitability continues to improve. And at California, as in Texas, despite the low in shipments, pricing has remained strong in the high single digits, underscoring the basic confidence and the trajectory of California markets. Across our company, our focus on core profit improvements and the little things that make us better every day is keeping us on track towards our longer-term goals, and you see it in our results. Now, I hand it over to John for some brief additional comments regarding our outlook for 2016 and the momentum we see heading into 2017."

I'd I like to touch quickly on a few points regarding our forward outlook, but let me first note that our views have not changed meaningfully from those that we communicated during our late September event in At",617,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning to everybody. I'd I like to touch quickly on a few points regarding our forward outlook, but let me first note that our views have not changed meaningfully from those that we communicated during our late September event in Atlanta. First, and as Tom noted, we continue to project $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA for fiscal year '16. And due to continued gains in unit profitability and the overall margins, we think we can reach the low end of our beginning of year guidance range despite shipments falling well below our original forecast. Now to put this outlook into some context, let's take a look at results and trends, particularly with respect to our improved profitability over the trailing 12 months. As you heard Tom say and as you've seen in our release, during that period, we generated net earnings of $371 million and adjusted EBITDA of $981 million. But behind that, it's important to note that our average freight-adjusted selling prices in our Aggregates segment have increased 8% over that time, our average gross profit per ton has increased 25% over that time and our overall gross profit as a percent of freight-adjusted revenue for the company has risen from 34% to 39%. 
As we consistently call out, fourth quarter results can be impacted significantly by weather and the effective length of the construction season. And our strong results from Q4 of 2015 present tough comparisons. But our improved core profitability should be sufficient to allow us to reach our stated goals for 2016 if recent shipment momentum holds up through the quarter. 
Now turning to 2017. I'll begin by reiterating that it remains too early for us to give specific or firm guidance. We're primarily focused on finishing the current year strong and we're just at the beginning of our internal planning cycle for next year. But from what we can see today, from the day that we see today, we expect continued volume recovery in 2017, along with further improvements in pricing and overall margins. In other words, continued progress on track with the longer-range goals we've outlined previously. 
With respect to volumes, and again, we're not yet in a position to share specific numbers, we currently expect growth in each of our primary end use segments next year: Residential, private non-res, highways and other public infrastructure. And we also expect to see broad-based growth across our geographic footprint and growth in substantially all of our key market areas. We've noted that construction start data points have recently turned back up after several months of softening. And highway contract awards in our key states have all also turned up recently. And on top of that, longer term project pipelines continue to strengthen from already strong levels. But the relative start weakness we've experienced earlier this year, combined with strong first quarter 2016 comparisons, suggest that 2017's volume growth on a year-over-year basis could be back half-loaded. We expect the pricing climate to remain positive and constructive for 2017. The strength of longer-term project pipelines and significant increases in dedicated public transportation funding reinforce confidence in a sustained recovery. And materials producers and others in the construction supply chain remain focused on earning adequate returns on capital. Competition remains intense, but overall and generally speaking, we're battling over value and not just volume. 
Given these dynamics, we'd expect our free cash flow profile and overall financial condition to strengthen further next year. We should have the financial capacity and the flexibility needed to support reinvestment in our franchise, growth including, but not limited to M& A, as well as additional returns of capital to shareholders. Tom, back over to you."

The drivers of recovery in shipments remain very much in place. Our core profitability continues to improve and our fundamental outlook for the future of the business remains unchanged. Given that positive outlook, I can assure you that we will invest in our business accordingly. We will keep investing internally. For example, we will plow about $125 million into internal growth projects this year. These projects will help us serve our customers better, increase efficiencies and add to the bottom line. They include 5 new rail yards; 3 in Texas, 1 in Charleston, South Carolina and another 1 in Savannah Georgia, along with 6 greenfield sites that's new quarries that were developed in the growth markets across the country. At the same time, we will continue to aggressively pursue bolt-on acquisitions in key markets, as well as other strategic acquisitions, all of which will further strengthen our leading position in the industry. 
I want to conclude by thanking our employees for their commitment to improving everyday, to working safely, to finishing this year strong and to delivering another year of even stronger results.

If you look at the pipeline data, start data and listen to our customers, we feel better about California even though we haven't seen the shipments come back yet. And we feel good about the public funding situation in California. The elements are in place for this to come together for state funding. You got to remember that California still has the worst roads in the country, even with a little bit of increase in the gas taxes received from price. We'll start to see the FAST Act start kicking in. And then we saw a August distribution of federal funds at just under $0.25 billion to California. And then, you've got -- as you know, you've got the local initiatives that are on the ballot for next week, that if they all pass, would total about $2.5 billion annual. So for us in California is we say it's not if, it's really about pace, and probably the pace of large projects. So I think we're feeling pretty good about '17 and the longer-term outlook is pretty bright for California."

We'll keep our prepared remarks fairly brief today since we discussed many of the key business trends and our outlook just a few weeks ago during our Aggregates Day ev",1388,"Thank you, Mark. I thank all of you for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. We'll keep our prepared remarks fairly brief today since we discussed many of the key business trends and our outlook just a few weeks ago during our Aggregates Day event in Atlanta. 
Looking at the third quarter and our recent performance, 4 main points stand out. First, we obviously saw shipments decline in the third quarter. However, to my second point, we see it as localized, not cyclical. Third, our profitability continues to grow. And fourth, our prospects for sustained growth remain very exciting. Let me address each in just a little more detail. 
First, we obviously have seen a drop in year-over-year shipments. This is due in part to a period of relative weakness in new construction starts across much of our footprint. It's also due to weather and other location-specific factors impacting our business in California, Texas, Virginia and Illinois. Third quarter year-over-year shipments in these 4 states were down 15% collectively. Now in stark contrast, our other markets experienced combined year-over-year shipment growth of 6%, and in fact, several markets saw strong double-digit growth to the order of 12% to 21%. 
Second, and importantly, we continue to view these volume headwinds as temporary or a transitional low in a multiyear recovery that is still intact and sound and actually with a long way to run. To this point, the variation in results across our footprint reveals volume challenges that are clearly localized rather than cyclical. Notably, our daily aggregate shipment rate increased from August to September and from September to October, with October exceeding the prior year period by about 3%. In addition, according to Dodge reports, trailing 12-month construction starts showed sequential improvements in both August and September, picking up from a noticeable slowdown in March that lingered all the way through July. In short, the fundamental, foundational drivers of a multiyear recovery remain firmly in place. 
To point number three. Our core profit engine remains very powerful. We're on track to deliver $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA this year, and this is despite volumes that are below our original expectations. In our Aggregates segment, third quarter freight-adjusted selling prices were 7% ahead of third quarter 2015 and gross profit per ton rose 9%. With the 12 months ended in September, gross profit per ton has increased 25%. The flow-through of incremental freight-adjusted revenue into incremental gross profit has exceeded 80%. 
Also for the 12 months into September, the total business delivered net earnings of $371 million and $981 million of adjusted EBITDA, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of more than 27%. This is an improvement of 430 basis points over the prior year. 
Fourth, and finally, we remain excited about our long-range gross prospects. We are well on track to achieve our profitability goals, and near term, we like the volume, pricing and profitability momentum we see for 2017. We also like the very robust pipeline of projects that we see building for 2018 and 2019. And John will share a few thoughts regarding our current momentum and outlook in a minute. But first, I'll offer a bit more insight into how our business has been performing across our footprint. 
As we discussed during our Aggregates Day in Atlanta, the recent demand climate has made it a little hard to distinguish the signal from the noise. For example, there's been clear accelerating growth in the longer-term project pipeline. The impact of the Federal Highway bill, the FAST Act, and higher state level funding are beginning to show up in the mix. At the same time, there's been a softening in the rate at which this water behind the dam has been released in the form of construction starts. There was also a low in state highway spending during the first half of the year, and this was as states worked their way through the remainder of a fiscal year that did not include new FAST Act funds. Notably, this has now started to turn in a positive direction. The latest ARTBA report on highway contract award shows them increasing by 30% in September. And this is the second consecutive month of growth following weak contract award activity during the first half of the year. Looking closely, this isn't too surprising as many states have entered a new fiscal year with the FAST Act money flowing into their pipelines and a backlog of projects ready to go. 
During the slowdown period early this year, a number of markets saw adverse weather conditions, shortages in skilled labor and other factors that have constrained the rate at which existing construction projects could be completed. A number of our customers have found it difficult to catch up in the near term on work deferred due to bad weather earlier in the year. Generally speaking, our operations across the southeast and mid-Atlantic states continue to post solid gains in volumes despite these challenges. Florida, Georgia and North Carolina enjoyed robust double-digit volume growth to the tune of 12% to 21%. And this was accompanied by strong pricing and unit margin performance. Now, Virginia on the other hand, is an example of market where we're seeing good pricing momentum although volume momentum hasn't picked up yet. 
Turning to Texas and California. Shipment levels in these states remain challenged in the third quarter. This was below the expectations we had at the beginning of the year. Shipments in Texas were down 21% in the quarter. This was driven in part by Coastal Texas shipments, which were down 27%. All of Texas was impacted by bad weather throughout the quarter, most notably in August. Business in North and South Texas fell off accordingly from what would otherwise have been a much stronger performance in those areas. Houston in the coast however, in addition to the well-known downturn in the oil and gas industry and extensive flooding, also experienced a delay in textile work. So when we talk about Texas and volume declines, it is in fact largely isolated to the coastal area of the state, separating out statewide weather impacts. But despite a transitory period of volume headwinds, there is ongoing pricing momentum in Texas and it simply highlights the underlying confidence and continued growth in the Lone Star State. At the same time, our core profitability, which has also been strong, keeps improving. The bottom line is that overall, we expect continued recovery in Texas markets. 
In California, the shipments were down 17% from last year's quarter. We continue to see a slowdown in large project work in public and private sectors. This is work we are well-positioned to serve. Caltrans also continue to grapple with highway funding related to diminish excise taxes. This created a bigger slowdown in project work than anticipated. We have reason to believe that political leaders will ultimately reach agreement on new state funding measures for California -- for California roads, which are rated the worst in the U.S. Putting it all together, we expect to see a return in 2017 to a pattern of recovery and growth in California. Our sales force is aligned to take advantage of growing up of these growth opportunities. Large projects are getting back on track, the pipeline of major projects continues to get bigger and bigger, construction starts are back on the upswing and there will hopefully be improvements in state funding for roads, along with local highway improvement initiatives. In fact, we're already seeing early signs of improvement. Highway contract awards in California were up 98% in September as these new FAST Act funds are starting to flow into the system. 
Underlying these facts are fundamental strengths. In our California business as well as Texas, our core profitability continues to improve. And in California, as in Texas, despite the low in shipments, pricing has remained strong in the high single digits, underscoring the basic confidence and the trajectory of California markets. Across our company, our focus on core profit improvements, the little things that make us better every day is keeping us on track towards our longer-term goals, and you see it in our results. Now, I hand it over to John for some brief additional comments regarding our outlook for 2016 and the momentum we see heading into 2017."

I'd I like to touch quickly on a few points regarding our forward outlook, but let me first note that our views have not changed meaningfully from those that we communicated during our late September event in At",615,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning to everybody. I'd I like to touch quickly on a few points regarding our forward outlook, but let me first note that our views have not changed meaningfully from those that we communicated during our late September event in Atlanta. First, and as Tom noted, we continue to project $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA for fiscal year '16. And due to continued gains in unit profitability and overall margins, we think we can reach the low end of our beginning of year guidance range despite shipments falling well below our original forecast. Now, to put this outlook into some context, let's take a look at results and trends, particularly with respect to our improved profitability over the trailing 12 months. As you heard Tom say and as you've seen in our release, during that period, we generated net earnings of $371 million and adjusted EBITDA of $981 million. But behind that, it's important to note that our average freight-adjusted selling prices in our Aggregates segment have increased 8% over that time. Our average gross profit per ton has increased 25% over that time and our overall gross profit as a percent of freight-adjusted revenue for the company has risen from 34% to 39%. 
As we consistently call out, fourth quarter results can be impacted significantly by weather and the effective length of the construction season. And our strong results from Q4 of 2015 present tough comparisons. But our improved core profitability should be sufficient to allow us to reach our stated goals for 2016 if recent shipment momentum holds up through the quarter. 
Now turning to 2017. I'll begin by reiterating that it remains too early for us to give specific or firm guidance. We're primarily focused on finishing the current year strong and we're just at the beginning of our internal planning cycle for next year. But from what we can see today, from the day that we see today, we expect continued volume recovery in 2017, along with further improvements in pricing and overall margins. In other words, continued progress on track with the longer-range goals we've outlined previously. 
With respect to volumes, and again, we're not yet in a position to share specific numbers, we currently expect growth in each of our primary end-use segments next year: Residential, private nonres, highways and other public infrastructure. And we also expect to see broad-based growth across our geographic footprint and growth in substantially all of our key market areas. We've noted that construction start data points have recently turned back up after several months of softening. And highway contract awards in our key states have all also turned up recently. And on top of that, longer term project pipelines continue to strengthen from already strong levels. But the relative start weakness we've experienced earlier this year, combined with strong first quarter 2016 comparisons, suggest that 2017's volume growth on a year-over-year basis could be back half-loaded. We expect the pricing climate to remain positive and constructive for 2017. The strength of longer-term project pipelines and significant increases in dedicated public transportation funding reinforce confidence in a sustained recovery. And materials producers and others in the construction supply chain remain focused on earning adequate returns on capital. Competition remains intense, but overall and generally speaking, we're battling over value and not just volume. 
Given these dynamics, we'd expect our free cash flow profile and overall financial condition to strengthen further next year. We should have the financial capacity and the flexibility needed to support reinvestment in our franchise, growth including, but not limited to M& A, as well as additional returns of capital to shareholders. Tom, back over to you."

They include 5 new rail yards; 3 in Texas, 1 in Charleston, South Carolina and another 1 in Savannah Georgia, along with 6 greenfield sites that's new quarries that were developed in the growth markets across the country. At the same time, we will continue to aggressively pursue bolt-on acquisitions in key markets, as well as other strategic acquisitions, all of which will further strengthen our leading position in the industry. 
I want to conclude by thanking our employees for their commitment to improving everyday, to working safely, to finishing this year strong and to delivering another year of even stronger results. 
Thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials. And now, if the operator will give the required instructions, we'll be happy to respond to your questions."

We see sustained strength in residential and kind of smaller private work. And the headwinds that we faced this year shouldn't repeat next year. If you look at the pipeline data, start data and listen to our customers, we feel better about California even though we haven't seen the shipments come back yet. And we feel good about the public funding situation in California. The elements are in place for this to come together for state funding. You got to remember that California still has the worst roads in the country, even with a little bit of increase in the gas taxes received from price. We'll start to see the FAST Act start kicking in. And then we saw a August distribution of federal funds at just under $0.25 billion to California. And then, you've got -- as you know, you got the local initiatives that are on the ballot for next week, that if they all pass, would total about $2.5 billion annual. So for us in California is we say it's not if, it's really about pace, and probably the pace of large projects. So I think we're feeling pretty good about '17 and the longer-term outlook is pretty bright for California."

Illinois, for us, the business is doing quite well, as Tom said. There's actually some green shoots in their funding, some toll road funding, some other funding that's not as dependent on the overall public sources. As you probably know, there's some efforts to, if you will, protect transportation funding from other needs in the state. But Illinois is the one place we called that, where we just don't see the path to long-term growth that we see in the rest of our footprint. If we contrast that with California, which yes, is going through a little bit of a lull right now, particularly on some large public funding, even the outlook next year for California is quite bright, and we see growth in California in '17 and beyond. And so those are very different situations in our view. One, which is doing well and profitable but doesn't right now have the long-term growth visibility. California is quite different. Yes, as you know quite well, Caltrans is challenged in some of the funding this year. Yes, that impacts us disproportionately because of our large asphalt presence and the customers we really lined up to serve well. But we don't expect to see anything like the same headwinds next year that we've seen this year in California. And I'd also just remind you, just to give you a sense of that visibility and how it plays out in the marketplace, our pricing in California is up nearly double digits.

And they tie back to a strategy that's very focused on earning full and fair value for our product. And as such, we need to be providing full service to our customers. So for a lot of our customers a lot of the time, we are more than just a material supplier. And we want to make sure that as the markets recover, as things get busier, as they face their own constraints, that we're in a position to help them be successful. That's how we're successful."

We've had to work through some periods of higher, particularly maintenance cost, showed up first in mobile equipment, now shows up a little bit for us this quarter in our business and fixed plant or processing equipment just as you're running things harder and getting them ready for future growth. But to the question that was asked earlier, we should be very well set up to continue to deliver really good operating leverage in what's still largely a fixed cost business for quite a while to come. There will be moments in time where our local operators are wrestling with, and this is obviously a good problem to have, how to add a shift or add a crew and do that most efficiently and most safely, most economically.

We'll keep our prepared remarks fairly brief today since we discussed many of the key business trends and our outlook just a few weeks ago during our Aggregates Day ev",1388,"Thank you, Mark. I thank all of you for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. We'll keep our prepared remarks fairly brief today since we discussed many of the key business trends and our outlook just a few weeks ago during our Aggregates Day event in Atlanta. 
Looking at the third quarter and our recent performance, 4 main points stand out. First, we obviously saw shipments decline in the third quarter. However, to my second point, we see it as localized, not cyclical. Third, our profitability continues to grow. And fourth, our prospects for sustained growth remain very exciting. Let me address each in just a little more detail. 
First, we obviously have seen a drop in year-over-year shipments. This is due in part to a period of relative weakness in new construction starts across much of our footprint. It's also due to weather and other location-specific factors impacting our business in California, Texas, Virginia and Illinois. Third quarter year-over-year shipments in these 4 states were down 15% collectively. Now in stark contrast, our other markets experienced combined year-over-year shipment growth of 6%, and in fact, several markets saw strong double-digit growth to the order of 12% to 21%. 
Second, and importantly, we continue to view these volume headwinds as temporary or a transitional low in a multiyear recovery that is still intact and sound and actually with a long way to run. To this point, the variation in results across our footprint reveals volume challenges that are clearly localized rather than cyclical. Notably, our daily aggregate shipment rate increased from August to September and from September to October, with October exceeding the prior year period by about 3%. In addition, according to Dodge reports, trailing 12-month construction starts showed sequential improvements in both August and September, picking up from a noticeable slowdown in March that lingered all the way through July. In short, the fundamental, foundational drivers of a multiyear recovery remain firmly in place. 
To point number three. Our core profit engine remains very powerful. We're on track to deliver $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA this year, and this is despite volumes that are below our original expectations. In our Aggregates segment, third quarter freight-adjusted selling prices were 7% ahead of third quarter 2015 and gross profit per ton rose 9%. With the 12 months ended in September, gross profit per ton has increased 25%. The flow-through of incremental freight-adjusted revenue into incremental gross profit has exceeded 80%. 
Also for the 12 months into September, the total business delivered net earnings of $371 million and $981 million of adjusted EBITDA, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of more than 27%. This is an improvement of 430 basis points over the prior year. 
Fourth, and finally, we remain excited about our long-range gross prospects. We are well on track to achieve our profitability goals, and near term, we like the volume, pricing and profitability momentum we see for 2017. We also like the very robust pipeline of projects that we see building for 2018 and 2019. And John will share a few thoughts regarding our current momentum and outlook in a minute. But first, I'll offer a bit more insight into how our business has been performing across our footprint. 
As we discussed during our Aggregates Day in Atlanta, the recent demand climate has made it a little hard to distinguish the signal from the noise. For example, there's been clear accelerating growth in the longer-term project pipeline. The impact of the Federal Highway bill, the FAST Act, and higher state level funding are beginning to show up in the mix. At the same time, there's been a softening in the rate at which this water behind the dam has been released in the form of construction starts. There was also a low in state highway spending during the first half of the year, and this was as states worked their way through the remainder of a fiscal year that did not include new FAST Act funds. Notably, this has now started to turn in a positive direction. The latest ARTBA report on highway contract award shows them increasing by 30% in September. And this is the second consecutive month of growth following weak contract award activity during the first half of the year. Looking closely, this isn't too surprising as many states have entered a new fiscal year with the FAST Act money flowing into their pipelines and a backlog of projects ready to go. 
During the slowdown period early this year, a number of markets saw adverse weather conditions, shortages in skilled labor and other factors that have constrained the rate at which existing construction projects could be completed. A number of our customers have found it difficult to catch up in the near term on work deferred due to bad weather earlier in the year. Generally speaking, our operations across the southeast and mid-Atlantic states continue to post solid gains in volumes despite these challenges. Florida, Georgia and North Carolina enjoyed robust double-digit volume growth to the tune of 12% to 21%. And this was accompanied by strong pricing and unit margin performance. Now, Virginia on the other hand, is an example of market where we're seeing good pricing momentum although volume momentum hasn't picked up yet. 
Turning to Texas and California. Shipment levels in these states remain challenged in the third quarter. This was below the expectations we had at the beginning of the year. Shipments in Texas were down 21% in the quarter. This was driven in part by Coastal Texas shipments, which were down 27%. All of Texas was impacted by bad weather throughout the quarter, most notably in August. Business in North and South Texas fell off accordingly from what would otherwise have been a much stronger performance in those areas. Houston in the coast however, in addition to the well-known downturn in the oil and gas industry and extensive flooding, also experienced a delay in textile work. So when we talk about Texas and volume declines, it is in fact largely isolated to the coastal area of the state, separating out statewide weather impacts. But despite a transitory period of volume headwinds, there is ongoing pricing momentum in Texas and it simply highlights the underlying confidence and continued growth in the Lone Star State. At the same time, our core profitability, which has also been strong, keeps improving. The bottom line is that overall, we expect continued recovery in Texas markets. 
In California, the shipments were down 17% from last year's quarter. We continue to see a slowdown in large project work in public and private sectors. This is work we are well-positioned to serve. Caltrans also continue to grapple with highway funding related to diminish excise taxes. This created a bigger slowdown in project work than anticipated. We have reason to believe that political leaders will ultimately reach agreement on new state funding measures for California -- for California roads, which are rated the worst in the U.S. Putting it all together, we expect to see a return in 2017 to a pattern of recovery and growth in California. Our sales force is aligned to take advantage of growing up of these growth opportunities. Large projects are getting back on track, the pipeline of major projects continues to get bigger and bigger, construction starts are back on the upswing and there will hopefully be improvements in state funding for roads, along with local highway improvement initiatives. In fact, we're already seeing early signs of improvement. Highway contract awards in California were up 98% in September as these new FAST Act funds are starting to flow into the system. 
Underlying these facts are fundamental strengths. In our California business as well as Texas, our core profitability continues to improve. And in California, as in Texas, despite the low in shipments, pricing has remained strong in the high single digits, underscoring the basic confidence and the trajectory of California markets. Across our company, our focus on core profit improvements, the little things that make us better every day is keeping us on track towards our longer-term goals, and you see it in our results. Now, I hand it over to John for some brief additional comments regarding our outlook for 2016 and the momentum we see heading into 2017."
312769,405353668,1072743,"Vulcan Materials Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Vulcan Materials Company","Executives","Thanks, Tom, and good morning to everybody. I'd I like to touch quickly on a few points regarding our forward outlook, but let me first note that our views have not changed meaningfully from those that we communicated during our late September event in At",615,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning to everybody. I'd I like to touch quickly on a few points regarding our forward outlook, but let me first note that our views have not changed meaningfully from those that we communicated during our late September event in Atlanta. First, and as Tom noted, we continue to project $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA for fiscal year '16. And due to continued gains in unit profitability and overall margins, we think we can reach the low end of our beginning of year guidance range despite shipments falling well below our original forecast. Now, to put this outlook into some context, let's take a look at results and trends, particularly with respect to our improved profitability over the trailing 12 months. As you heard Tom say and as you've seen in our release, during that period, we generated net earnings of $371 million and adjusted EBITDA of $981 million. But behind that, it's important to note that our average freight-adjusted selling prices in our Aggregates segment have increased 8% over that time. Our average gross profit per ton has increased 25% over that time and our overall gross profit as a percent of freight-adjusted revenue for the company has risen from 34% to 39%. 
As we consistently call out, fourth quarter results can be impacted significantly by weather and the effective length of the construction season. And our strong results from Q4 of 2015 present tough comparisons. But our improved core profitability should be sufficient to allow us to reach our stated goals for 2016 if recent shipment momentum holds up through the quarter. 
Now turning to 2017. I'll begin by reiterating that it remains too early for us to give specific or firm guidance. We're primarily focused on finishing the current year strong and we're just at the beginning of our internal planning cycle for next year. But from what we can see today, from the day that we see today, we expect continued volume recovery in 2017, along with further improvements in pricing and overall margins. In other words, continued progress on track with the longer-range goals we've outlined previously. 
With respect to volumes, and again, we're not yet in a position to share specific numbers, we currently expect growth in each of our primary end-use segments next year: Residential, private nonres, highways and other public infrastructure. And we also expect to see broad-based growth across our geographic footprint and growth in substantially all of our key market areas. We've noted that construction start data points have recently turned back up after several months of softening. And highway contract awards in our key states have all also turned up recently. And on top of that, longer term project pipelines continue to strengthen from already strong levels. But the relative start weakness we've experienced earlier this year, combined with strong first quarter 2016 comparisons, suggest that 2017's volume growth on a year-over-year basis could be back half-loaded. We expect the pricing climate to remain positive and constructive for 2017. The strength of longer-term project pipelines and significant increases in dedicated public transportation funding reinforce confidence in a sustained recovery. And materials producers and others in the construction supply chain remain focused on earning adequate returns on capital. Competition remains intense, but overall and generally speaking, we're battling over value and not just volume. 
Given these dynamics, we'd expect our free cash flow profile and overall financial condition to strengthen further next year. We should have the financial capacity and the flexibility needed to support reinvestment in our franchise, growth including, but not limited to M& A, as well as additional returns of capital to shareholders. Tom, back over to you."

The drivers of recovery in shipments remain very much in place. Our core profitability continues to improve and our fundamental outlook for the future of the business remains unchanged. Given that positive outlook, I can assure you that we will invest in our business accordingly. We will keep investing internally. For example, we will plow about $125 million into internal growth projects this year. These projects will help us serve our customers better, increase efficiencies and add to the bottom line. They include 5 new rail yards; 3 in Texas, 1 in Charleston, South Carolina and another 1 in Savannah Georgia, along with 6 greenfield sites that's new quarries that were developed in the growth markets across the country. At the same time, we will continue to aggressively pursue bolt-on acquisitions in key markets, as well as other strategic acquisitions, all of which will further strengthen our leading position in the industry. 
I want to conclude by thanking our employees for their commitment to improving every day, to working safely, to finishing this year strong and to delivering another year of even stronger results.

If you look at the pipeline data, start data and listen to our customers, we feel better about California even though we haven't seen the shipments come back yet. And we feel good about the public funding situation in California. The elements are in place for this to come together for state funding. You got to remember that California still has the worst roads in the country, even with a little bit of increase in the gas taxes received from price. We'll start to see the FAST Act start kicking in. And then we saw a August distribution of federal funds at just under $0.25 billion to California. And then, you've got -- as you know, you got the local initiatives that are on the ballot for next week, that if they all pass, would total about $2.5 billion annual. So for us in California is we say it's not if, it's really about pace, and probably the pace of large projects. So I think we're feeling pretty good about '17 and the longer-term outlook is pretty bright for California."

There's actually some green shoots in their funding, some toll road funding, some other funding that's not as dependent on the overall public sources. As you probably know, there's some efforts to, if you will, protect transportation funding from other needs in the state. But Illinois is the one place we called that, where we just don't see the path to long-term growth that we see in the rest of our footprint. If we contrast that with California, which yes, is going through a little bit of a lull right now, particularly on some large public funding, even the outlook next year for California is quite bright, and we see growth in California in '17 and beyond. And so those are very different situations in our view. One, which is doing well and profitable but doesn't right now have the long-term growth visibility. California is quite different. Yes, as you know quite well, Caltrans is challenged in some of the funding this year. Yes, that impacts us disproportionately because of our large asphalt presence and the customers we really lined up to serve well. But we don't expect to see anything like the same headwinds next year that we've seen this year in California.

The majority of our markets have already announced price increases for fixed plan -- for our fixed plan work. Those will be effective anywhere from January 1 to April 1. And just -- if you just kind of look at the price, without putting the markets beside us, we've announced price increases, and I'm just looking at a list of $1, $1.50, $0.75, $1.50, $1.75, $1.25, $1, $1 or so. Healthy price increases. Timing will vary with that. I will tell you, at this point, when we look at it, it's pretty generally accepted in the markets, and the markets are healthy with that. And all of that's driven by that visibility and confidence in that pipeline that's growing. So that will give you some kind of idea of what we're seeing on pricing out there. When it comes to -- when it comes to cost, I think our folks are doing a really good job managing cost and the operating efficiencies that drive those cost, at the same time, keeping our people safe and volume will really help that."

But to the question that was asked earlier, we should be very well set up to continue to deliver really good operating leverage in what's still largely a fixed cost business for quite a while to come. There will be moments in time where our local operators are wrestling with, and this is obviously a good problem to have, how to add a shift or add a crew and do that most efficiently and most safely, most economically.

You already touched on the dividend, but it looks like you all also pretty aggressively bought back some stock in the quarter. I don't think that any of you all have really sold anything meaningfully. Maybe if you could just tie that to where you see the stock now and the outlook for the business through '17 and beyond?"

As we've said, and this is just consistent with the capital allocation priorities we discussed many times, we'll continue to look to return excess cash after a variety of other priorities to shareholders in the form of opportunistic share repurchases. We reserve the right to turn that on, turn that off. We'll report to you kind of after-the-fact. We're always judging that use of capital relative to M&A and growth investments. And as Tom mentioned, we think we will have some interesting M&A opportunities over time, although they're difficult to predict and we're still active in that marketplace. And we do think of it as both an investment and as a return of capital. So look, would we be doing it in those levels if we didn't think it was a good investment? No. If that's your question. We think it's a good use of capital. And again, we'll continue to report out on future actions after they occur."

In fact, we have a lot of confidence in the profit engine and where that's taking us. And a lot of the fundamentals regarding long-term demand recovery, if anything, are more in place now than they were when we had our Investor Day roughly 1.5 years, not quite 2 years ago. So if you believe those conditions, then in our view, putting some additional capital back into our stocks is a good investment. So it's not exclusive of other things we'll do with capital, but we think it's a good use of capital."
