In addition to ending 2015 with very strong results, our fourth quarter operating and financial performance provided",931,"I'm extremely pleased with PulteGroup's fourth quarter earnings, which showed significantly improved results across key business metrics. In addition to ending 2015 with very strong results, our fourth quarter operating and financial performance provided a foundation we can build on in 2016 as we capitalize on opportunities to accelerate the growth of our homebuilding business. 
Bob will go through a detailed review of our Q4 financials in a moment but there are a couple of numbers and points that I'd like to highlight. Order rates in the fourth quarter were up 13%, which is the biggest year-over-year percentage jump we have realized since 2012. As solid as this number is, what I view even more encouraging is the 9% gain and absorption pace that we realized in the quarter. We've always said that generating higher sales within our existing footprint is the most efficient way for us to grow volumes and ultimately, earnings. Pulte's disciplined approach to acquiring the right land positions over the past several years is having a positive impact on our results. 
Along with order rates, the average sales price we were able to realize for or comes continue to increase. In the fourth quarter, closing ASPs were up 6% to $353,000, while backlog ASPs gained 10% to $365,000. 
Between market opportunities, mixed shifts and ongoing implementation of our strategic pricing programs, we expect ASPs will continue to move higher in 2016 versus comparable quarters in 2015. Our recently closed purchase of assets from John Wieland Homes and Neighborhoods will further our pricing gains given their higher price points. 
I also want to highlight our gross margins, which at 23.5%, is up 40 basis points over last year and remains arguably among the highest in our industry. 
As we have discussed for the past several years, we've implemented a number of programs from product and purchasing zones and commonly managed plans to shoot [ph] cost and strategic pricing. As an example, almost 60% of our fourth quarter closes were from commonly managed plans that have the benefit of increased consumer feedback and more efficient floorplan design. 
The goal of all this work has been to improve sales paces and gross margins in support of delivering higher returns on invested capital. A lot of time and effort has been invested in implementing these initiatives and the gains are evident in our results. 
Given that the financial improvements we realized in the quarter were so broad-based, I could highlight a number of other metrics in my comments. I purposely picked order rates, ASPs and gross margin, because there is at least one common element, which I believe has been an important factor in all 3 metrics. That common element is land. 
In 2011, we launched a Value Creation strategy with is focused on delivering higher returns on invested capital over the housing cycle. By 2013, we had raised returns to the point where they exceeded our cost of capital. Since that time, we have purposely increased investment into the business because it makes economic sense to do so. While we have raised investment, we have done so while adhering to the guidelines and disciplines we put in place back in 2011. These disciplines include: Underwriting projects through a defined 13-point risk-weighting scorecard that helps ensure we select the highest-returning projects, focusing on land positions that are closer in to job centers and located in the better markets and submarkets, prudently using options, which now account for 31% of all lots and 34% of our more traditional Pulte and Centex land positions to help enhance returns and/or mitigate land risk. 
Even though we are heading to develop over 70% of lots of the use, we have systematically expanded the percentage of option lots we maintain. We continue to emphasize investing in shorter, faster-turning projects with an average investment cycle of 36 to 48 months from acquisition to completion. By focusing in on shorter-duration projects, we helped to minimize risk should a housing downturn emerge sooner than expected. 
As an example, we expect to recoup the capital we invested in the John Wieland assets in less than 4 years, and we expect fthe purchase to be accretive to company returns by year 2. 
By strategically investing in land over the past few years, we have assembled a robust land pipeline that should allow PulteGroup to grow at a rate consistent with, or ideally ahead of the overall housing market. 
Our just-completed Wieland transaction will certainly support this effort. The John Wieland Homes and Neighborhoods brand is highly regarded in the Southeast, particularly within the luxury buyer category. Beyond the opportunities we see to expand this position, we also see the potential to deploy our Pulte brand also certain Wieland positions as we work to increase volumes and accelerate the future absorption of the acquired lots. Again, by enhancing returns. 
By focusing as instantly all the quality, not just the quantity of the land assets we acquire, we put ourselves in the best position to maximize sales pace, pricing, margins and most importantly, returns on invested capital, while working to mitigate excess market risk. 
Through our Value Creation strategy, we have now put the company in a position to grow, while continuing to generate better financial performance and consistently returning funds to our shareholders. And we have done all this while taking a more conservative, lower-risk approach to our business. 
Growth, strong returns and properly managed risk, we think this is a great combination. 
Now, let me turn over the call to Bob for a more thorough review of the quarter. Bob?"

PulteGroup's Q4 financial results are a direct reflection of the meaningful improvements we continue to realize in our core homebuilding operations. As I will detail, these gains could be seen throughout our fourth qua",1712,"Thanks, Richard, and good morning. PulteGroup's Q4 financial results are a direct reflection of the meaningful improvements we continue to realize in our core homebuilding operations. 
As I will detail, these gains could be seen throughout our fourth quarter financial statements. 
Fourth quarter homebuilding revenues totaled $2 billion, which is up 12% from prior year revenues of $1.8 billion. The increase in Q4 revenue is driven by a 7% increase in closings to 5,662 homes, combined with a 6% increase in average sales price, $353,000. Although not a metric we manage against, the 5,662 homes closed in the fourth quarter equates to a backlog conversion rate of 65%. 
As we addressed on our most recent calls, we are working to close the year-over-year performance gap we've experienced with regard to getting homes delivered. We're pleased with the progress we've made in the fourth quarter. 
Having said that, the challenges we in the industry face with regard to labor resources and extended land development time lines are not likely to improve in the near term. We believe, however, that our decisions to prudently increase that production should help us to maintain a more consistent build cadence going forward.
In the quarter, closings by brand were as follows: 19% of homes were from Centex communities; 55% were from Pulte community; and 26% were from Del Webb. In the fourth quarter of last year, closings from Centex, Pulte and Del Webb were 24%, 46% and 30%, respectively. 
Given the profile of projects we're investing in, coupled with the projected impact of assets acquired in the Wieland transaction, we believe that describing our customers by buyer group rather than by brand, will better represent the makeup of our business. As a result, beginning in Q1, we will address buyer groups rather than brands. 
In the fourth quarter, closings by buyer group were as follows: 31% were first-time buyers; 40% were move-up buyers; and 29% were active-adult buyers. In 2014, closings by buyer group were 34% first time, 33%, move-up; and 33%, active-adult. The company recorded gross margins of 23.5% in the fourth quarter, which is up 40 basis points over the prior year. 
As has been an ongoing trend, fourth quarter margins were enhanced by higher option and lot premium revenues. In fact, option revenues in the quarter increased 10% or $4,976 per closing while lot premiums gained 16% or $1,868 per closing. 
Sales discounts remained modest at just 2.2% or $8,026 per home compared with 2.1% or $7,040 per home last year. Since implementing our strategic pricing programs since 2011 is part of our Value Creation strategy, option revenues per home have increased by $19,800 or 58%, while lot premiums per home has increased by approximately $7,100 or 107%. 
We believe our more strategic approach to pricing has been a key contributor to the high gross margins we continue to maintain. 
Reported fourth quarter SG&A expense of $139 million were 7% home sale revenues including the benefit of a $30 million reversal of content-related insurance reserves. 
Reported prior year SG&A expense of $146 million or 8.2% of home sale revenues reflected a $15 million reversal of construction-related insurance reserves. 
Looking at the full year, our reported SG&A of $590 million, which was 10.2% of homebuilding revenues, includes the benefit of $62 million or 110 basis points associated with certain legal settlements and reserve reversals. 
PulteGroup's financial services segment reported fourth quarter pretax income of $29 million, which includes the reversal of $12 million of mortgage repurchase reserves. The decision to reduce reserves is based on probaly settlements of various repurchase requests and current conditions. 
Mortgage capture rate in Q4 was 83%, up from 81% in the prior year. I'd like to take a moment to highlight the efforts of our financial services team including title, immediate challenges to the new regulatory environment under trade. Our teams did a tremendous job in closing Pulte mortgage loans [indiscernible] since supporting our customers under the new homes. Our President and CEO of financial services, and her team are recognized leaders in the industry and did a fantastic job implementing the changes needed to operate within the new trade guidelines. 
Looking at net income for the fourth quarter, reported $228 million or $0.64 per share, which includes $0.07 per share benefit from insurance and mortgage reserve reversals taken in the quarter. Our per share earnings were calculated using approximately 352 million shares outstanding for the quarter, which is down 6% from last year, largely as a result of our share repurchase activities. 
As part of our income statement review, we want to provide some thoughts about 2016. Given our backlog and anticipated land, labor and material cost, we expect 2016 homebuilding margins, inclusive of the dilutive effect of the Wieland transaction, to remain high within the range of 21.5% to 22%. This annual margin guide includes the negative impact for the Wieland transaction of approximately 100 basis points in the first quarter, 80 points in the second quarter and 50 basis points in each of the third and fourth quarters. 
Looking at our projected SG&A, we expect that our full year spend will be approximately 10% of homebuilding revenues. Consistent with prior years, this will be impacted on a quarterly basis by the size of our closings. Based on the margin and overhead guidance we just provided, the calculated operating margin we expect to generate in 2016 is between 11.5% and 12%. 
The operating margin we reported for 2015 was 13.2%, but this was enhanced by the 110-basis-point impact from the construction-related insurance reserve reversals we recorded during the year. When you consider that our 2016 operating margin guidance of 11.5% to 12% is being negatively impacted by roughly 70 basis points from the Wieland transaction and to factor in the 110-basis-point enhancement to 2015 operating margins, you could see that the operating margins will actually flat to slightly improve in 2016 compared to 2015. 
Given headwinds the industry is facing on land and labor cost, we're very proud to be able to maintain our strong operating margins. 
Putting all this together, the combination of expected higher closing volumes, higher ASPs and overhead leverage have us positioned for strong earnings growth in 2016. 
Moving past the income statement and reviewing our homebuilding operations, we ended the fourth quarter with a total of 6,494 homes under construction. That accounted for 30% of the homes under production, which is up from 26% this time last year. 
As discussed, we have purposely increased the amount of spec homes we have in the pipeline to help maintain a more even construction cadence. In the fourth quarter, we approved approximately 7,000 lots for purchase, excluding the Wieland assets as that deal closed in mid-January. We ended the year with 138,000 lots under control, of which approximately 42,000 lots or 31% were controlled via option. We continue to see [indiscernible] opportunities to increase our use of land options in an effort to enhance returns and to lower our overall risk profile. Of our controlled lots, approximately 23% are finished and 18% are currently under development. 
As Richard discussed, we continue to used to refine a disciplined approach to our land investments. Consistent with our land acquisition guidelines, we invested $485 million of land acquisition in Q4 and and additional $304 million for development of previously acquired lots. These investments brought our full year land-related spend to $2.3 billion. 
For the year, we invested approximately $1.2 billion to acquire new land. Looking ahead to 2016, including the money invested to acquire the Wieland assets, we have authorized $1.6 billion for land acquisition. As always, this level of investment is predicated on our continuing assessment of the market and on our ability to identifying suitable, high returning projects. 
Looking at our capital allocated to shareholders in the fourth quarter, we distributed $28 million in dividends and did not repurchase any of our stock. The net of share repurchase activities was due to the trading limitations resulting from work to close our previously disclosed term loan and to acquire the Wieland assets. We expect our share repurchase programs to become active again beginning in the first quarter of 2016. 
Based on our fourth quarter activity, we ended the year with $775 million of cash and a debt-to-capital ratio of 30%. As Richard noticed at the start of this call, we realized strong new order growth in the fourth quarter as orders were up 13% over last year to 3,659 homes. Higher orders for the period were driven by a 9% increase in absorption basis as all 3 buyer groups realized higher prices. 
It should be noted that we expect absorption paces in the first half of 2016 to be lower as we integrate the Wieland communities with their typical operating model of higher ASPs and slower absorption paces relative to Pulte averages. 
Breaking down orders by buyer group, on a year-over-year basis, our first time buyer business was flat, while move-up and active-adult orders increased 35%, 3% respectively. 
Adjusting per community count, our absorption paces were up 16% for first-time buyers, 11% for move-up buyers and 9% for active-adult buyers. On a dollar basis, orders for the fourth quarter came 24% to $1.4 billion, helping to raise the average sales price and backlog to $365,000. 
It's important to remember that normal business seasonality and its impacts on the mix of closings will typically result in lower delivered ASPs in the first quarter of each year. 
The company operated out of 620 communities during the fourth quarter, which is up 4% over the prior year. Looking ahead, we currently expect community count growth versus comparable prior year period to be in the range of 8% to 10% in the first 2 quarters of the year, increasing to 10% to 15% growth in the back half of the year. This will be our largest year-over-year increase in community count since the housing recovery began. Supported by our strong orders in the fourth quarter, we ended 2015 with a backlog of 6,731 homes valued at $2.5 billion. The growth in our year-end backlog of 15% in units and 26% in dollars compared to last year is as great momentum heading into '16. 
Now let me turn the call back to Richard."

As Bob detailed, the company's -- the company realized meaningful improvement in our operating and financial results for the quarter. Given the strength of our operating metrics and the expansion of our land pipeline, we are in excellent position to grow earnings in 2016 and beyond. 
As has been our practice, let me provide a few comments on the market conditions which drove our fourth quarter results. Consistent with our Q4 increases in orders and absorption pace, we experienced generally higher buyer traffic to our communities, a pattern we realized throughout 2015. Further, many of the trends we experienced earlier in 2015 continued through Q4 with stronger demand in the better-located and on average, closer-in communities. 
Specific to the fourth quarter, buyer demand remained positive, up and down the East Coast with notable strength in the Southeast from the Carolinas down to Florida. We've talked about positive demand trends in the Southeast for a number of years. it is this trend and our expectations for long-term growth in the Southeast markets, particularly the bigger markets of Atlanta, Charleston, Charlotte and Raleigh, which made the transaction with John Wieland so compelling. 
Looking to the center of the country, demand conditions remain favorable, although we continued to experience volatility in the performance of underlying markets. Demand in the Midwest showed some positive gains as we benefited from an expanded community count in several markets. Our Texas business in Q4 was slowed by having roughly 10% fewer open communities available-for-sale versus the prior year. In addition, our Texas numbers were impacted by ongoing demand softness in the higher-priced communities in Houston, resulting from the prolonged weakness in the energy markets. Given current conditions, we are being very thoughtful about deploying additional capital in the region and will continue to carefully monitor demand throughout the state. 
The Western third of the country continued to realize excellent demand from Washington through California and through our markets in Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico. Overall, we were pleased with how demand conditions developed in the fourth quarter. We have seen a continuation of good traffic and demand trends through the first few weeks of January so we have every reason to be optimistic heading into the spring selling season. 
Consistent with our long-held expectations for a gradual but sustained recovery, 2015 new home sales of approximately 500,000 units for the country were up 15% over last year. Given the favorable market dynamics of strong job growth, accelerating household formations, supported demographic trends and continued low interest rates, we expect in home sales will continue to slow and steady path higher for the next several years. That being said, we are well aware of the volatility in the world today. Our concerns about global economic conditions to the swoon in oil prices, the gyrations to the stock market, the day to day swings can be violent. The reality is, however, that we can't control any of these factors, but what we can do is focus on running our business consistent with the goals we have established and disciplines we have demonstrated. This means acquiring well located communities that we believe can deliver high returns on investment. 
It also means hedging our bets by using more land options where possible and focusing in on smaller, shorter-duration projects where we can get our capital back quickly. It also means not over leveraging the balance sheet and keeping one hand on the levered to slow investment yet housing demand begins to change. And finally, it means having the discipline to systematically give excess funds back to shareholders better than trying to force investments in the system. 
We ended 2015 with a strong fourth quarter performance. I'm confident that we can build on these results in 2016 and further capitalize on the excellent market position I believe PulteGroup maintains today. The market position that has been built by our exceptional group of employees who work hard everyday to build great homes and deliver an unmatched home buying experience to our customers.

I guess, my question generally would be, as you lay out your community count growth, as you think about how you're going to be utilizing the Wieland land with some of your products and just generally, as you position your business in 2016 and '17, how specifically or discreetly are you targeting a first time buyer who may be looking to sort of buy a product, which historically might have been considered a little bit more of a move-up -- a first time move-up kind of a product. How much are you actually positioning ourselves for the emergence of that kind of a buyer in marketplace and an increase in that demand?"

As an organization, I think we've talked about the millennial study that we completed in 2015, which showed what we believe to be significant opportunity for a buyer that is probably in their early to mid-30s and who hasn't owned a home before, so they're called a first time buyer but they're spending $300,000 to $400,000 on urban townhome products. So overall, our categorization that Bob described, we think, more accurately depicts how we're attending to serve the business as those buyers will be captured in that first category. And we are investing in several of our major cities in that buyer category and that's part of the contributing change in ASP that you see in our backlog and in our continued guidance going forward, that's part of the Pulte story here."

Is it going to be diluted by a lot of these new communities that are going to be coming on? Or do you think there's enough momentum that you might be able to sustain that?"

And we've been talking for several years how we believe we are doing an excellent job of positioning our communities, not just growing for growth's sake. Having said that, with regard to our 2016, two things.  Number one, we're going to have nice community count growth this year but it will be a little less in Q1 and 2 as Bob indicated and then more in Q3 and 4. Although strong, really, all 4 quarters. So that factor, we would expect absorption rates in Q1 to be impacted there. But probably more notably, as we work to integrate the Wieland business, that business is typically a higher price point, slower absorption model, and that, as we integrate it, will impact our results, particularly earlier in the year. So just trying to make sure that everyone's expectations factored that into their overall models.

And then if you look at it, the margin profile of the business, thinking about it from consumer groups, is -- as has been the case for years, the most --  the highest margin is going to be our active-adult. Interestingly, when you look at it, the first time business actually enjoys very high margins for 2 reasons. One, that millennial business that we talked about is a very strong margin business for us and for the historical Centex business, since we haven't been investing many of the lots that we're running through now are older so they enjoy strong margins. And then that move-up business, which is where we've done most of our investment over the last 3 or 4 years, still enjoying very good margins. But because of the higher land cost and labor costs that we're seeing, it's, today, of the 3, although still strong, the lower margin business. And so the mix shift towards that has implications to our deposit margins. So 70 basis points from Wieland, mix shift and labor cost, probably the biggest driver of margin. Otherwise, in 2016."

And as Bob mentioned, the ability to put some Pulte efficiency, if you will, into what we saw there. And a part of that, you might have noted in our script, we're intending to take some Wieland assets and Pulte product on it to help accelerate absorptions and drive returns. So we're feeling really great about that. Beyond that, this particular transaction had significant brand value in our mind. And for buyers in the southeast, the John Wieland name commands a premium. And when you factor that into the strategic pricing programs, the focus on option revenue and lot premium revenue gets a really nice fit into the way we've been driving margins in the business. And we feel like it's a real consistent approach toward driving high returns. So the brand value there is exciting. And candidly, even the value of the Wieland name from an entitlement standpoint, we feel pretty good about going forward. We want to grow our business in the Southeast and the Wieland repuation's exciting, allowing is to get into some of these core infill locations, millennial locations. So a very, very strong, recognized consumer brand in the southeast that gives us opportunity, along with the strong land positions.  And then potentially, lastly, I'll mention the southeast, Steve, we like. Vis-à-vis some other markets, we think the southeast is not overheated . We think the southeast has got a lot of runway in front of it. And complementary assets that are not cannibalizing anything else, we felt good about.

294550,320199253,922812,"PulteGroup, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","PulteGroup, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I'm extremely pleased with PulteGroup's fourth quarter earnings, which shows significantly improved results across key business metrics. In addition to ending 2015 with very strong results, our fourth quarter opera",938,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I'm extremely pleased with PulteGroup's fourth quarter earnings, which shows significantly improved results across key business metrics. In addition to ending 2015 with very strong results, our fourth quarter operating and financial performance provide a foundation we can build on in 2016 as we capitalize on opportunities to accelerate the growth of our homebuilding business. 
Bob will go through a detailed review of our Q4 financials in a moment, but there are a couple of numbers and points that I'd like to highlight. Order rates in the fourth quarter were up 13%, which is the biggest year-over-year percentage jump we have realized since 2012. As solid as this number is, what I view even more encouraging is the 9% gain and absorption pace that we realized in the quarter. We have always said that generating higher sales within our existing footprint is the most efficient way for us to grow volumes and, ultimately, earnings. Pulte's disciplined approach to acquiring the right land positions over the past several years is having a positive impact on our results. 
Along with order rates, the average sales price we were able to realize for our homes continue to increase. In the fourth quarter, closing ASPs were up 6% to $353,000, while backlog ASPs gained 10% to $365,000. 
Between market opportunities, mixed shifts and ongoing implementation of our strategic pricing programs, we expect ASPs will continue to move higher in 2016 versus comparable quarters in 2015. Our recently closed purchase of assets from John Wieland Homes and Neighborhoods will further our pricing gains given their higher price points. 
I also want to highlight our gross margins, which at 23.5% is up 40 basis points over last year, and remains arguably among the highest in our industry. 
As we have discussed for the past several years, we have implemented a number of programs from product and purchasing zones and commonly managed plans to should costing and strategic pricing. As an example, almost 60% of our fourth quarter closings were from commonly managed plans that have the benefit of increased consumer feedback and more efficient floor plan design. 
The goal of all this work has been to improve sales paces and gross margins in support of delivering higher returns on invested capital. A lot of time and effort has been invested in implementing these initiatives, and the gains are evident in our results. 
Given that the financial improvements we realized in the quarter were so broad-based, I could highlight a number of other metrics in my comments. I purposely picked order rates, ASPs and gross margin because there is at least one common element, which I believe has been an important factor in all 3 metrics. That common element is land. 
In 2011, we launched the Value Creation strategy with its focus on delivering higher returns on invested capital over the housing cycle. By 2013, we had raised returns to the point where they exceeded our cost of capital. Since that time, we have purposely increased investment into the business because it makes economic sense to do so. While we have raised investment, we have done so while adhering to the guidelines and disciplines we've put in place back in 2011. These disciplines include: underwriting projects through a defined 13-point, risk-weighting scorecard that helps ensure we select the highest-returning projects; focusing in on land positions that are closer in to job centers and located in the better markets and submarkets; prudently using options, which now account for 31% of all lots and 34% of our more traditional Pulte and Centex land positions to help enhance returns and/or mitigate land risk. 
Even though we are having to develop over 70% of the lots we use, we have systematically expanded the percentage of option lots we maintain. We continue to emphasize investing in shorter, faster-turning projects with an average investment cycle of 36 to 48 months from acquisition to completion. By focusing in on shorter-duration projects, we helped to minimize risk should a housing downturn emerge sooner than expected. 
As an example, we expect to recoup the capital we invested in the John Wieland assets in less than 4 years, and we expect the purchase to be accretive to company returns by year 2. 
By strategically investing in land over the past few years, we have assembled a robust land pipeline that should allow PulteGroup to grow at a rate consistent with or ideally ahead of the overall housing market. 
Our just-completed Wieland transaction will certainly support this effort. The John Wieland Homes and Neighborhoods brand is highly regarded in the Southeast, particularly within the luxury buyer category. Beyond the opportunities we see to expand this position, we also see the potential to deploy our Pulte brand onto certain Wieland land positions as we work to increase volumes and accelerate future absorption of the acquired lots, again, enhancing returns. 
By focusing as intently on the quality, not just the quantity of the land assets we acquire, we put ourselves in the best position to maximize sales pace, pricing, margins and, most importantly, returns on invested capital, while working to mitigate excess market risk. 
Through our Value Creation strategy, we have now put the company in a position to grow while continuing to generate better financial performance and consistently returning funds to our shareholders. And we have done all this while taking a more conservative, lower-risk approach to our business. 
Growth, strong returns and properly managed risk, we think this is a great combination. 
Now let me turn over the call to Bob for a more thorough review of the quarter. Bob?"
294550,320199253,922812,"PulteGroup, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","PulteGroup, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Richard, and good morning. The gains demonstrated in PulteGroup's Q4 financial results are a direct reflection of the meaningful improvements we've continued to realize in our core homebuilding operations. As I will detail, these gains can be se",1720,"Thanks, Richard, and good morning. The gains demonstrated in PulteGroup's Q4 financial results are a direct reflection of the meaningful improvements we've continued to realize in our core homebuilding operations. 
As I will detail, these gains can be seen throughout our fourth quarter financial statements. 
Fourth quarter homebuilding revenues totaled $2 billion, which is up 12% from prior-year revenues of $1.8 billion. The increase in Q4 revenue is driven by a 7% increase in closings to 5,662 homes, combined with a 6% increase in average sales price, $353,000. Although not a metric we manage against, the 5,662 homes closed in the fourth quarter equates to a backlog conversion rate of 65%. 
As we addressed on our most recent calls, we're working to close the year-over-year performance gap we've experienced with regard to getting homes delivered. We're pleased with the progress we've made in the fourth quarter. 
Having said that, the challenges we in the industry face with regard to labor resources and extended land development time lines are not likely to improve in the near term. We believe, however, that our decision to prudently increase that production should help us to maintain a more consistent build cadence going forward.
In the quarter, closings by brand were as follows: 19% of homes were from Centex communities; 55% were from Pulte communities; and 26% were from Del Webb. In the fourth quarter of last year, closings from Centex, Pulte and Del Webb were 24%, 46% and 30%, respectively. 
Given the profile of projects we're investing in, coupled with the projected impact of assets acquired in the Wieland transaction, we believe that describing our customers by buyer group rather than by brand will better represent the makeup of our business. As a result, beginning in Q1, we will address buyer groups rather than brands. 
In the fourth quarter, closings by buyer group were as follows: 31% were first-time buyers; 40% were move-up buyers; and 29% were active-adult buyers. In 2014, closings by buyer group were 34%, first-time; 33%, move-up; and 33%, active-adult. The company recorded gross margins of 23.5% in the fourth quarter, which is up 40 basis points over the prior year. 
As has been an ongoing trend, fourth quarter margins were enhanced by higher option and lot premium revenues. In fact, option revenues in the quarter increased 10% or $4,976 per closing, while lot premiums gained 16% or $1,868 per closing. 
Sales discounts remained modest at just 2.2% or $8,026 per home compared with 2.1% or $7,040 per home last year. Since implementing our strategic pricing programs in 2011 as part of our Value Creation strategy, option revenues per home have increased by $19,800 or 58%, while lot premiums per home has increased by approximately $7,100 or 107%. 
We believe our more strategic approach to pricing has been a key contributor to the high gross margins we continue to maintain. 
Reported fourth quarter SG&A expense of $139 million or 7% of home sale revenues included the benefit of a $30 million reversal of construction-related insurance reserves. 
Reported prior-year SG&A expense of $146 million or 8.2% of home sale revenues reflected a $15 million reversal of construction-related insurance reserves. 
Looking at the full year, our reported SG&A of $590 million, which was 10.2% of homebuilding revenues, includes the benefit of $62 million or 110 basis points associated with certain legal settlements and reserve reversals. 
PulteGroup's financial services segment reported fourth quarter pretax income of $29 million, which includes the reversal of $12 million of mortgage repurchase reserves. The decision to reduce reserves was based on probable settlements of various repurchase requests and current conditions. 
Mortgage capture rate in Q4 was 83%, up from 81% in the prior year. I'd like to take a moment to highlight the efforts of our financial services team including Pulte Mortgage and PGP Title in meeting the challenges in the new regulatory environment under TRID. Our teams did a tremendous job closing Pulte Mortgage loans without missing a beat and supporting our customers under the new rules. Deb Still, our President and CEO of Financial Services, and her team are recognized leaders in the industry and did a fantastic job implementing the changes needed to operate within the new TRID guidelines. 
Looking at net income for the fourth quarter, we reported $228 million or $0.64 per share, which includes $0.07 per share benefit from insurance and mortgage reserve reversals taken in the quarter. Our per share earnings were calculated using approximately 352 million shares outstanding for the quarter, which is down 6% from last year, largely as a result of our share repurchase activities. 
As part of our income statement review, we wanted to provide some thoughts about 2016. Given our backlog in anticipated land, labor and material costs, we expect 2016 homebuilding margins, inclusive of the dilutive effect of the Wieland transaction, to remain high and be in the range of 21.5% to 22%. This annual margin guide includes a negative impact for the Wieland transaction of approximately 100 basis points in the first quarter, 80 basis points in the second quarter and 50 basis points in each of the third and fourth quarters. 
Looking at our projected SG&A, we expect our full-year spend will be approximately 10% of homebuilding revenues. Consistent with prior years, this will be impacted on a quarterly basis by the seasonality of our closings. Based on the margin and overhead guidance we just provided, the calculated operating margin we expect to generate in 2016 is between 11.5% and 12%. 
The operating margin we reported for 2015 was 13.2%, but this was enhanced by the 110-basis-point impact from the construction-related insurance reserve reversals we recorded during the year. When you consider that our 2016 operating margin guidance of 11.5% to 12% is being negatively impacted by roughly 70 basis points from the Wieland transaction and factor in the 110-basis-point enhancement to 2015 operating margins, you could see that operating margins were actually flat to slightly improved in 2016 compared to 2015. 
Given headwinds the industry is facing on land and labor costs, we're very proud to be able to maintain our strong operating margin. 
Putting all this together, the combination of expected higher closing volumes, higher ASPs and overhead leverage have us positioned for strong earnings growth in 2016. 
Moving past the income statement and reviewing our homebuilding operations, we ended the fourth quarter with a total of 6,494 homes under construction. Spec units accounted for 30% of the homes under production, which is up from 26% this time last year. 
As discussed, we have purposely increased the amount of spec homes we have in the pipeline to help maintain a more even construction cadence. In the fourth quarter, we approved approximately 7,000 lots for purchase, excluding the Wieland assets, as that deal closed in mid-January. We ended the year with 138,000 lots under control, of which approximately 42,000 lots or 31% were controlled via option. We continue to see GAAP opportunities to increase our use of land options in an effort to enhance returns and to lower our overall risk profile. Of our controlled lots, approximately 23% are finished and 18% are currently under development. 
As Richard discussed, we continue to use a defined and disciplined approach to our land investments. Consistent with our land acquisition guidelines, we invested $485 million of land acquisition in Q4 and an additional $304 million for development of previously acquired lots. These investments brought our full year land-related spend to $2.3 billion. 
For the year, we invested approximately $1.2 billion to acquire new land. Looking ahead to 2016, including the money invested to acquire the Wieland assets, we have authorized $1.6 billion for land acquisition. As always, this level of investment is predicated on our continuing assessment of the market and on our ability to identifying suitable, high-returning projects. 
Looking at our capital allocated to shareholders in the fourth quarter, we've distributed $28 million in dividend and did not repurchase any of our stock. The lack of share repurchase activity was due to the trading limitations resulting from work to close our previously disclosed term loan and to acquire the Wieland assets. We expect our share repurchase program to become active again beginning in the first quarter of 2016. 
Based on our fourth quarter activity, we ended the year with $775 million of cash and a debt-to-capital ratio of 30%. As Richard noted at the start of this call, we realized strong, new order growth in the fourth quarter as orders were up 13% over last year to 3,659 homes. Higher orders for the period were driven by a 9% increase in absorption paces, as all 3 buyer groups realized higher prices. 
It should be noted that we expect absorption paces in the first half of 2016 to be lower as we integrate the Wieland communities with their typical operating model of higher ASPs and slower absorption paces relative to Pulte averages. 
Breaking down orders by buyer group, on a year-over-year basis, our first-time buyer business was flat, while move-up and active-adult orders increased 35%, 3%, respectively. 
Adjusting for community count, our absorption paces were up 16% for first-time buyers, 11% for move-up buyers and 9% for active-adult buyers. On a dollar basis, orders for the fourth quarter came 24% to $1.4 billion, helping to raise the average sales price and backlog to $365,000. 
It's important to remember that normal business seasonality and its impact on the mix of closings will typically result in lower-delivered ASPs in the first quarter of each year. 
The company operated out of 620 communities during the fourth quarter, which is up 4% over the prior year. Looking ahead, we currently expect community count growth versus comparable prior-year period to be in the range of 8% to 10% in the first 2 quarters of the year, increasing to 10% to 15% growth in the back half of the year. This would be our largest year-over-year increase in community count since the housing recovery began. Supported by our strong orders in the fourth quarter, we ended 2015 with a backlog of 6,731 homes valued at $2.5 billion. The growth in our year-end backlog of 15% in units and 26% in dollars compared to last year gives us great momentum heading into '16. 
Now let me turn the call back to Richard."

As Bob detailed, the company's -- the company realized meaningful improvement in our operating and financial results for the quarter. Given the strength of our operating metrics and the expansion of our land pipeline, we are in excellent position to grow earnings in 2016 and beyond. 
As has been our practice, let me provide a few comments on the market conditions, which drove our fourth quarter results. Consistent with our Q4 increases in orders and absorption pace, we experienced generally higher buyer traffic to our communities, a pattern we realized throughout 2015. Further, many of the trends we experienced earlier in 2015 continued through Q4, with stronger demand in the better-located and, on average, closer-in communities. 
Specific to the fourth quarter, buyer demand remain positive, up and down the East Coast, with notable strength in the Southeast from the Carolinas down to Florida. We have talked about positive demand trends in the Southeast for a number of years. It is this trend and our expectations for long-term growth in the Southeast markets, particularly the bigger markets of Atlanta, Charleston, Charlotte and Raleigh, which made the transaction with John Wieland so compelling. 
Looking to the center of the country, demand conditions remain favorable, although we continue to experience volatility in the performance of underlying markets. Demand in the Midwest showed some positive gains, as we benefited from an expanded community count in several markets. Our Texas business in Q4 was slowed by having roughly 10% fewer open communities available-for-sale versus the prior year. In addition, our Texas numbers were impacted by ongoing demand softness in the higher-priced communities in Houston, resulting from the prolonged weakness in the energy markets. Given current conditions, we are being very thoughtful about deploying additional capital in the region, and will continue to carefully monitor demand throughout the state. 
The Western third of the country continue to realize excellent demand from Washington through California and through our markets in Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico. Overall, we were pleased with how demand conditions developed in the fourth quarter. We have seen a continuation of good traffic and demand trends through the first few weeks of January, so we have every reason to be optimistic heading into the spring selling season. 
Consistent with our long-held expectations for a gradual, but sustained recovery, 2015 new home sales of approximately 500,000 units for the country were up 15% over last year. Given the favorable market dynamics of strong job growth, accelerating household formations, supported demographic trends and continued low interest rates, we expect new home sales will continue their slow and steady path higher for the next several years. All that being said, we are well aware of the volatility in the world today. From concerns about global economic conditions to the swoon in oil prices, to gyrations in the stock market, the day-to-day swings can be violent. The reality is, however, that we can't control any of these factors, but what we can do is focus on running our business consistent with the goals we have established and disciplines we have demonstrated. This means acquiring well-located communities that we believe can deliver high returns on investment. 
It also means hedging our bets by using more land options, where possible, and focusing in on smaller, shorter-duration projects, where we can get our capital back quickly. It also means not over-leveraging the balance sheet and keeping one hand on the lever to slow investment if housing demand begins to change. And finally, it means having the discipline to systematically give excess funds back to shareholders rather than trying to force investments in the system. 
We ended 2015 with a strong fourth quarter performance. I am confident that we can build on these results in 2016 and further capitalize on the excellent market position I believe PulteGroup maintains today, a market position that has been built by our exceptional group of employees, who work hard everyday to build great homes and deliver an unmatched home-buying experience to our customers.

I guess, my question generally would be, as you lay out your community count growth, as you think about how you're going to be utilizing the Wieland land with some of your product, and just generally as you position your business in 2016 and '17, how specifically or discreetly are you targeting a first-time buyer, who may be looking to sort of buy a product, which historically might have been considered a little bit more of a move-up -- a first-time move-up kind of a product?

And two, as Bob indicated, and then more in Q3 and 4, although strong really all 4 quarters. So that factor, we would expect absorption rates in Q1 to be impacted there.

And that, as we integrate it, will impact our results, particularly earlier in the year. So I'm just trying to make sure that everyone's expectations factored that into their overall models.

Interestingly, when you look at it, the first-time business actually enjoys very high margins for 2 reasons. One, that millennial business that we've talked about is a very strong margin business for us. And for the historical Centex business, since we haven't been investing many of the lots that we're running through now are older. So they enjoy strong margins. And then that move-up business, which is where we've done most of our investment over the last 3 or 4 years, still enjoying very good margins. But because of the higher land cost and labor costs that we're seeing is, today, of the 3, although still strong, the lower margin business.

So we think 10%. Obviously, the seasonality of the business with lower closings in the first half of the year, higher closings, you can and should expect to see that be a richer number being higher than 10% in the first couple of quarters and lower much like we did in the fourth quarter of this year. Certainly, there will be some integration cost associated with Wieland that we would expect over time to be able to narrow out of the business, but the 10% that we've projected for '16 is inclusive of that."

We're intending to take some Wieland assets and put Pulte product on it to help accelerate absorptions and drive returns. So we feel really great about that. Beyond that, this particular transaction had significant brand value in our mind. And for buyers in the Southeast, the John Wieland name commands a premium. And when you factor that into the strategic pricing programs, the focus on option revenue and lot premium revenue, it's a really nice fit into the way we've been driving margins in the business. And we feel like it's a real consistent approach toward driving high returns. So the brand value there is exciting.

I think we're getting a little bit better at managing through it by not being quite as tight with our spec inventory change, if you will. We give ourselves a few more targets to shoot at each quarter to account for any up and downs that may occur in the market. But labor continues to be tight. There's not a lot of new labor that's flowing into the space. So I do think the industry and us, particularly, are getting a little better at managing through it, but it's going to be with us for a while. But the ability to give that to labor markets, the cadence and a consistent view that says we've got the following work. You're going to keep our crews busy.

So we're very, very focused on mitigating risk from that perspective. So in terms of option percentage, I would hope that we can continue to drive that forward. The market will dictate that.

I'm extremely pleased with PulteGroup's fourth quarter earnings, which shows significantly improved results across key business metrics. In addition to ending 2015 with very strong results, our fourth quarter operating and financial performance provide a foundation we can build on in 2016 as we capitalize on opportunities to accelerate the growth of our homebuilding business. 
Bob will go through a detailed review of our Q4 financials in a moment, but there are a couple of numbers and points that I'd like to highlight. Order rates in the fourth quarter were up 13%, which is the biggest year-over-year percentage jump we have realized since 2012. As solid as this number is, what I view even more encouraging is the 9% gain and absorption pace that we realized in the quarter. We have always said that generating higher sales within our existing footprint is the most efficient way for us to grow volumes and, ultimately, earnings. Pulte's disciplined approach to acquiring the right land positions over the past several years is having a positive impact on our results. 
Along with order rates, the average sales price we were able to realize for our homes continue to increase. In the fourth quarter, closing ASPs were up 6% to $353,000, while backlog ASPs gained 10% to $365,000. 
Between market opportunities, mixed shifts and ongoing implementation of our strategic pricing programs, we expect ASPs will continue to move higher in 2016 versus comparable quarters in 2015. Our recently closed purchase of assets from John Wieland Homes and Neighborhoods will further our pricing gains given their higher price points. 
I also want to highlight our gross margins, which at 23.5% is up 40 basis points over last year, and remains arguably among the highest in our industry. 
As we have discussed for the past several years, we have implemented a number of programs from product and purchasing zones and commonly managed plans to should costing and strategic pricing. As an example, almost 60% of our fourth quarter closings were from commonly managed plans that have the benefit of increased consumer feedback and more efficient floor plan design. 
The goal of all this work has been to improve sales paces and gross margins in support of delivering higher returns on invested capital. A lot of time and effort has been invested in implementing these initiatives, and the gains are evident in our results. 
Given that the financial improvements we realized in the quarter were so broad-based, I could highlight a number of other metrics in my comments. I purposely picked order rates, ASPs and gross margin because there is at least one common element, which I believe has been an important factor in all 3 metrics. That common element is land. 
In 2011, we launched the Value Creation strategy with its focus on delivering higher returns on invested capital over the housing cycle. By 2013, we had raised returns to the point where they exceeded our cost of capital. Since that time, we have purposely increased investment into the business because it makes economic sense to do so. While we have raised investment, we have done so while adhering to the guidelines and disciplines we've put in place back in 2011. These disciplines include: underwriting projects through a defined 13-point, risk-weighting scorecard that helps ensure we select the highest-returning projects; focusing in on land positions that are closer in to job centers and located in the better markets and submarkets; prudently using options, which now account for 31% of all lots and 34% of our more traditional Pulte and Centex land positions to help enhance returns and/or mitigate land risk. 
Even though we are having to develop over 70% of the lots we use, we have systematically expanded the percentage of option lots we maintain. We continue to emphasize investing in shorter, faster-turning projects with an average investment cycle of 36 to 48 months from acquisition to completion. By focusing in on shorter-duration projects, we helped to minimize risk should a housing downturn emerge sooner than expected. 
As an example, we expect to recoup the capital we invested in the John Wieland assets in less than 4 years, and we expect the purchase to be accretive to company returns by year 2. 
By strategically investing in land over the past few years, we have assembled a robust land pipeline that should allow PulteGroup to grow at a rate consistent with or ideally ahead of the overall housing market. 
Our just-completed Wieland transaction will certainly support this effort. The John Wieland Homes and Neighborhoods brand is highly regarded in the Southeast, particularly within the luxury buyer category. Beyond the opportunities we see to expand this position, we also see the potential to deploy our Pulte brand onto certain Wieland land positions as we work to increase volumes and accelerate future absorption of the acquired lots, again, enhancing returns. 
By focusing as intently on the quality, not just the quantity of the land assets we acquire, we put ourselves in the best position to maximize sales pace, pricing, margins and, most importantly, returns on invested capital, while working to mitigate excess market risk. 
Through our Value Creation strategy, we have now put the company in a position to grow while continuing to generate better financial performance and consistently returning funds to our shareholders. And we have done all this while taking a more conservative, lower-risk approach to our business. 
Growth, strong returns and properly managed risk, we think this is a great combination. 
Now let me turn over the call to Bob for a more thorough review of the quarter. Bob?"

The gains demonstrated in PulteGroup's Q4 financial results are a direct reflection of the meaningful improvements we've continued to realize in our core homebuilding operations. As I will detail, these gains can be se",1720,"Thanks, Richard, and good morning. The gains demonstrated in PulteGroup's Q4 financial results are a direct reflection of the meaningful improvements we've continued to realize in our core homebuilding operations. 
As I will detail, these gains can be seen throughout our fourth quarter financial statements. 
Fourth quarter homebuilding revenues totaled $2 billion, which is up 12% from prior-year revenues of $1.8 billion. The increase in Q4 revenue is driven by a 7% increase in closings to 5,662 homes, combined with a 6% increase in average sales price, $353,000. Although not a metric we manage against, the 5,662 homes closed in the fourth quarter equates to a backlog conversion rate of 65%. 
As we addressed on our most recent calls, we're working to close the year-over-year performance gap we've experienced with regard to getting homes delivered. We're pleased with the progress we've made in the fourth quarter. 
Having said that, the challenges we in the industry face with regard to labor resources and extended land development time lines are not likely to improve in the near term. We believe, however, that our decision to prudently increase that production should help us to maintain a more consistent build cadence going forward.
In the quarter, closings by brand were as follows: 19% of homes were from Centex communities; 55% were from Pulte communities; and 26% were from Del Webb. In the fourth quarter of last year, closings from Centex, Pulte and Del Webb were 24%, 46% and 30%, respectively. 
Given the profile of projects we're investing in, coupled with the projected impact of assets acquired in the Wieland transaction, we believe that describing our customers by buyer group rather than by brand will better represent the makeup of our business. As a result, beginning in Q1, we will address buyer groups rather than brands. 
In the fourth quarter, closings by buyer group were as follows: 31% were first-time buyers; 40% were move-up buyers; and 29% were active-adult buyers. In 2014, closings by buyer group were 34%, first-time; 33%, move-up; and 33%, active-adult. The company recorded gross margins of 23.5% in the fourth quarter, which is up 40 basis points over the prior year. 
As has been an ongoing trend, fourth quarter margins were enhanced by higher option and lot premium revenues. In fact, option revenues in the quarter increased 10% or $4,976 per closing, while lot premiums gained 16% or $1,868 per closing. 
Sales discounts remained modest at just 2.2% or $8,026 per home compared with 2.1% or $7,040 per home last year. Since implementing our strategic pricing programs in 2011 as part of our Value Creation strategy, option revenues per home have increased by $19,800 or 58%, while lot premiums per home has increased by approximately $7,100 or 107%. 
We believe our more strategic approach to pricing has been a key contributor to the high gross margins we continue to maintain. 
Reported fourth quarter SG&A expense of $139 million or 7% of home sale revenues included the benefit of a $30 million reversal of construction-related insurance reserves. 
Reported prior-year SG&A expense of $146 million or 8.2% of home sale revenues reflected a $15 million reversal of construction-related insurance reserves. 
Looking at the full year, our reported SG&A of $590 million, which was 10.2% of homebuilding revenues, includes the benefit of $62 million or 110 basis points associated with certain legal settlements and reserve reversals. 
PulteGroup's financial services segment reported fourth quarter pretax income of $29 million, which includes the reversal of $12 million of mortgage repurchase reserves. The decision to reduce reserves was based on probable settlements of various repurchase requests and current conditions. 
Mortgage capture rate in Q4 was 83%, up from 81% in the prior year. I'd like to take a moment to highlight the efforts of our financial services team including Pulte Mortgage and PGP Title in meeting the challenges in the new regulatory environment under TRID. Our teams did a tremendous job closing Pulte Mortgage loans without missing a beat and supporting our customers under the new rules. Deb Still, our President and CEO of Financial Services, and her team are recognized leaders in the industry and did a fantastic job implementing the changes needed to operate within the new TRID guidelines. 
Looking at net income for the fourth quarter, we reported $228 million or $0.64 per share, which includes $0.07 per share benefit from insurance and mortgage reserve reversals taken in the quarter. Our per share earnings were calculated using approximately 352 million shares outstanding for the quarter, which is down 6% from last year, largely as a result of our share repurchase activities. 
As part of our income statement review, we wanted to provide some thoughts about 2016. Given our backlog in anticipated land, labor and material costs, we expect 2016 homebuilding margins, inclusive of the dilutive effect of the Wieland transaction, to remain high and be in the range of 21.5% to 22%. This annual margin guidance includes a negative impact for the Wieland transaction of approximately 100 basis points in the first quarter, 80 basis points in the second quarter and 50 basis points in each of the third and fourth quarters. 
Looking at our projected SG&A, we expect our full-year spend will be approximately 10% of homebuilding revenues. Consistent with prior years, this will be impacted on a quarterly basis by the seasonality of our closings. Based on the margin and overhead guidance we just provided, the calculated operating margin we expect to generate in 2016 is between 11.5% and 12%. 
The operating margin we reported for 2015 was 13.2%, but this was enhanced by the 110-basis-point impact from the construction-related insurance reserve reversals we recorded during the year. When you consider that our 2016 operating margin guidance of 11.5% to 12% is being negatively impacted by roughly 70 basis points from the Wieland transaction and factor in the 110-basis-point enhancement to 2015 operating margins, you could see that operating margins were actually flat to slightly improved in 2016 compared to 2015. 
Given headwinds the industry is facing on land and labor costs, we're very proud to be able to maintain our strong operating margin. 
Putting all this together, the combination of expected higher closing volumes, higher ASPs and overhead leverage have us positioned for strong earnings growth in 2016. 
Moving past the income statement and reviewing our homebuilding operations, we ended the fourth quarter with a total of 6,494 homes under construction. Spec units accounted for 30% of the homes under production, which is up from 26% this time last year. 
As discussed, we have purposely increased the amount of spec homes we have in the pipeline to help maintain a more even construction cadence. In the fourth quarter, we approved approximately 7,000 lots for purchase, excluding the Wieland assets, as that deal closed in mid-January. We ended the year with 138,000 lots under control, of which approximately 42,000 lots or 31% were controlled via option. We continue to see GAAP opportunities to increase our use of land options in an effort to enhance returns and to lower our overall risk profile. Of our controlled lots, approximately 23% are finished and 18% are currently under development. 
As Richard discussed, we continue to use a defined and disciplined approach to our land investments. Consistent with our land acquisition guidelines, we invested $485 million of land acquisition in Q4 and an additional $304 million for development of previously acquired lots. These investments brought our full year land-related spend to $2.3 billion. 
For the year, we invested approximately $1.2 billion to acquire new land. Looking ahead to 2016, including the money invested to acquire the Wieland assets, we have authorized $1.6 billion for land acquisition. As always, this level of investment is predicated on our continuing assessment of the market and on our ability to identifying suitable, high-returning projects. 
Looking at our capital allocated to shareholders in the fourth quarter, we've distributed $28 million in dividend and did not repurchase any of our stock. The lack of share repurchase activity was due to the trading limitations resulting from work to close our previously disclosed term loan and to acquire the Wieland assets. We expect our share repurchase program to become active again beginning in the first quarter of 2016. 
Based on our fourth quarter activity, we ended the year with $775 million of cash and a debt-to-capital ratio of 30%. As Richard noted at the start of this call, we realized strong, new order growth in the fourth quarter as orders were up 13% over last year to 3,659 homes. Higher orders for the period were driven by a 9% increase in absorption paces, as all 3 buyer groups realized higher prices. 
It should be noted that we expect absorption paces in the first half of 2016 to be lower as we integrate the Wieland communities with their typical operating model of higher ASPs and slower absorption paces relative to Pulte averages. 
Breaking down orders by buyer group, on a year-over-year basis, our first-time buyer business was flat, while move-up and active-adult orders increased 35%, 3%, respectively. 
Adjusting for community count, our absorption paces were up 16% for first-time buyers, 11% for move-up buyers and 9% for active-adult buyers. On a dollar basis, orders for the fourth quarter came 24% to $1.4 billion, helping to raise the average sales price in backlog to $365,000. 
It's important to remember that normal business seasonality and its impact on the mix of closings will typically result in lower-delivered ASPs in the first quarter of each year. 
The company operated out of 620 communities during the fourth quarter, which is up 4% over the prior year. Looking ahead, we currently expect community count growth versus comparable prior-year period to be in the range of 8% to 10% in the first 2 quarters of the year, increasing to 10% to 15% growth in the back half of the year. This would be our largest year-over-year increase in community count since the housing recovery began. Supported by our strong orders in the fourth quarter, we ended 2015 with a backlog of 6,731 homes valued at $2.5 billion. The growth in our year-end backlog of 15% in units and 26% in dollars compared to last year gives us great momentum heading into '16. 
Now let me turn the call back to Richard."

As Bob detailed, the company's -- the company realized meaningful improvement in our operating and financial results for the quarter. Given the strength of our operating metrics and the expansion of our land pipeline, we are in excellent position to grow earnings in 2016 and beyond. 
As has been our practice, let me provide a few comments on the market conditions, which drove our fourth quarter results. Consistent with our Q4 increases in orders and absorption pace, we experienced generally higher buyer traffic to our communities, a pattern we realized throughout 2015. Further, many of the trends we experienced earlier in 2015 continued through Q4, with stronger demand in the better-located and, on average, closer-in communities. 
Specific to the fourth quarter, buyer demand remain positive, up and down the East Coast, with notable strength in the Southeast from the Carolinas down to Florida. We have talked about positive demand trends in the Southeast for a number of years. It is this trend and our expectations for long-term growth in the Southeast markets, particularly the bigger markets of Atlanta, Charleston, Charlotte and Raleigh, which made the transaction with John Wieland so compelling. 
Looking to the center of the country, demand conditions remain favorable, although we continue to experience volatility in the performance of underlying markets. Demand in the Midwest showed some positive gains, as we benefited from an expanded community count in several markets. Our Texas business in Q4 was slowed by having roughly 10% fewer open communities available-for-sale versus the prior year. In addition, our Texas numbers were impacted by ongoing demand softness in the higher-priced communities in Houston, resulting from the prolonged weakness in the energy markets. Given current conditions, we are being very thoughtful about deploying additional capital in the region, and will continue to carefully monitor demand throughout the state. 
The Western third of the country continue to realize excellent demand from Washington through California and through our markets in Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico. Overall, we were pleased with how demand conditions developed in the fourth quarter. We have seen a continuation of good traffic and demand trends through the first few weeks of January, so we have every reason to be optimistic heading into the spring selling season. 
Consistent with our long-held expectations for a gradual, but sustained recovery, 2015 new home sales of approximately 500,000 units for the country were up 15% over last year. Given the favorable market dynamics of strong job growth, accelerating household formations, supported demographic trends and continued low interest rates, we expect new home sales will continue their slow and steady path higher for the next several years. All that being said, we are well aware of the volatility in the world today. From concerns about global economic conditions to the swoon in oil prices, to gyrations in the stock market, the day-to-day swings can be violent. The reality is, however, that we can't control any of these factors, but what we can do is focus on running our business consistent with the goals we have established and disciplines we have demonstrated. This means acquiring well-located communities that we believe can deliver high returns on investment. 
It also means hedging our bets by using more land options, where possible, and focusing in on smaller, shorter-duration projects, where we can get our capital back quickly. It also means not over-leveraging the balance sheet and keeping one hand on the lever to slow investment if housing demand begins to change. And finally, it means having the discipline to systematically give excess funds back to shareholders rather than trying to force investments in the system. 
We ended 2015 with a strong fourth quarter performance. I am confident that we can build on these results in 2016 and further capitalize on the excellent market position I believe PulteGroup maintains today, a market position that has been built by our exceptional group of employees, who work hard everyday to build great homes and deliver an unmatched home-buying experience to our customers.

But that would be consistent with an idea that the guy who, let's say, was a 26, 27-year-old 6 years ago is now older and probably in a market maybe buying a slightly different product than he would have 6 years ago. I guess, my question generally would be, as you lay out your community count growth, as you think about how you're going to be utilizing the Wieland land with some of your product, and just generally as you position your business in 2016 and '17, how specifically or discreetly are you targeting a first-time buyer, who may be looking to sort of buy a product, which historically might have been considered a little bit more of a move-up -- a first-time move-up kind of a product? Like how much are you actually positioning yourself for the emergence of that kind of a buyer into the marketplace and an increase in that demand?"

So they're called a first-time buyer, but they're spending $300,000 to $400,000 on urban townhome products. So overall, our categorization that Bob described, we think, more accurately depicts how we're attempting to serve the business because those buyers were being captured in that first-time category.

And we've been talking for several years how we believe we are doing an excellent job of positioning our communities, not just growing for growth's sake. Having said that, with regard to our 2016, 2 things.  Number one, we're going to have a nice community count growth this year, but it will be a little less in Q1. And two, as Bob indicated, and then more in Q3 and Q4, although strong really all 4 quarters. So that factor, we would expect absorption rates in Q1 to be impacted there. But probably more notably, as we work to integrate the Wieland business, that business is typically a higher price point, slower absorption model. And that, as we integrate it, will impact our results, particularly earlier in the year. So I'm just trying to make sure that everyone's expectations factored that into their overall models.

Interestingly, when you look at it, the first-time business actually enjoys very high margins for 2 reasons. One, that millennial business that we've talked about is a very strong margin business for us. And for the historical Centex business, since we haven't been investing many of the lots that we're running through now are older. So they enjoy strong margins. And then that move-up business, which is where we've done most of our investment over the last 3 or 4 years, still enjoying very good margins. But because of the higher land cost and labor costs that we're seeing is, today, of the 3, although still strong, the lower margin business. And so the mix shift towards that has implications to our composite margins. So 70 basis points from Wieland, mix shift and labor cost, probably the biggest driver of margin, otherwise, in 2016."

And as Bob mentioned, the ability to put some Pulte efficiency, if you will, into what we saw there, and a part of that you might have noted in our script. We're intending to take some Wieland assets and put Pulte product on it to help accelerate absorptions and drive returns. So we feel really great about that. Beyond that, this particular transaction had significant brand value in our mind. And for buyers in the Southeast, the John Wieland name commands a premium. And when you factor that into the strategic pricing programs, the focus on option revenue and lot premium revenue, it's a really nice fit into the way we've been driving margins in the business. And we feel like it's a real consistent approach toward driving high returns. So the brand value there is exciting. And candidly, even the value of the Wieland name from an entitlement standpoint, we feel very good about going forward. We want to grow our business in the Southeast. And the Wieland reputation's exciting and allowing us to get into some of these core infill locations, millennial locations. So a very, very strong, recognized consumer brand in the Southeast that gives us opportunity, along with the strong land positions. And then potentially, lastly, I'll mention the Southeast, Steve, we like. Vis-à-vis some other markets, we think the Southeast is not overheated. We think the Southeast has got a lot of runway in front of it. And complementary assets that are not cannibalizing anything else, we felt good about. And then just on your last point, we continue to stay actively looking at any transaction that come our way, but we've been very, very disciplined to make sure the economics work."

294550,320199253,923341,"PulteGroup, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","PulteGroup, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I'm extremely pleased with PulteGroup's fourth quarter earnings, which shows significantly improved results across key business metrics. In addition to ending 2015 with very strong results, our fourth quarter opera",938,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I'm extremely pleased with PulteGroup's fourth quarter earnings, which shows significantly improved results across key business metrics. In addition to ending 2015 with very strong results, our fourth quarter operating and financial performance provide a foundation we can build on in 2016 as we capitalize on opportunities to accelerate the growth of our homebuilding business. 
Bob will go through a detailed review of our Q4 financials in a moment, but there are a couple of numbers and points that I'd like to highlight. Order rates in the fourth quarter were up 13%, which is the biggest year-over-year percentage jump we have realized since 2012. As solid as this number is, what I view even more encouraging is the 9% gain and absorption pace that we realized in the quarter. We have always said that generating higher sales within our existing footprint is the most efficient way for us to grow volumes and, ultimately, earnings. Pulte's disciplined approach to acquiring the right land positions over the past several years is having a positive impact on our results. 
Along with order rates, the average sales price we were able to realize for our homes continue to increase. In the fourth quarter, closing ASPs were up 6% to $353,000, while backlog ASPs gained 10% to $365,000. 
Between market opportunities, mixed shifts and ongoing implementation of our strategic pricing programs, we expect ASPs will continue to move higher in 2016 versus comparable quarters in 2015. Our recently closed purchase of assets from John Wieland Homes and Neighborhoods will further our pricing gains given their higher price points. 
I also want to highlight our gross margins, which at 23.5% is up 40 basis points over last year, and remains arguably among the highest in our industry. 
As we have discussed for the past several years, we have implemented a number of programs from product and purchasing zones and commonly managed plans to should costing and strategic pricing. As an example, almost 60% of our fourth quarter closings were from commonly managed plans that have the benefit of increased consumer feedback and more efficient floor plan design. 
The goal of all this work has been to improve sales paces and gross margins in support of delivering higher returns on invested capital. A lot of time and effort has been invested in implementing these initiatives, and the gains are evident in our results. 
Given that the financial improvements we realized in the quarter were so broad-based, I could highlight a number of other metrics in my comments. I purposely picked order rates, ASPs and gross margin because there is at least one common element, which I believe has been an important factor in all 3 metrics. That common element is land. 
In 2011, we launched the Value Creation strategy with its focus on delivering higher returns on invested capital over the housing cycle. By 2013, we had raised returns to the point where they exceeded our cost of capital. Since that time, we have purposely increased investment into the business because it makes economic sense to do so. While we have raised investment, we have done so while adhering to the guidelines and disciplines we've put in place back in 2011. These disciplines include: underwriting projects through a defined 13-point, risk-weighting scorecard that helps ensure we select the highest-returning projects; focusing in on land positions that are closer in to job centers and located in the better markets and submarkets; prudently using options, which now account for 31% of all lots and 34% of our more traditional Pulte and Centex land positions to help enhance returns and/or mitigate land risk. 
Even though we are having to develop over 70% of the lots we use, we have systematically expanded the percentage of option lots we maintain. We continue to emphasize investing in shorter, faster-turning projects with an average investment cycle of 36 to 48 months from acquisition to completion. By focusing in on shorter-duration projects, we helped to minimize risk should a housing downturn emerge sooner than expected. 
As an example, we expect to recoup the capital we invested in the John Wieland assets in less than 4 years, and we expect the purchase to be accretive to company returns by year 2. 
By strategically investing in land over the past few years, we have assembled a robust land pipeline that should allow PulteGroup to grow at a rate consistent with or ideally ahead of the overall housing market. 
Our just-completed Wieland transaction will certainly support this effort. The John Wieland Homes and Neighborhoods brand is highly regarded in the Southeast, particularly within the luxury buyer category. Beyond the opportunities we see to expand this position, we also see the potential to deploy our Pulte brand onto certain Wieland land positions as we work to increase volumes and accelerate future absorption of the acquired lots, again, enhancing returns. 
By focusing as intently on the quality, not just the quantity of the land assets we acquire, we put ourselves in the best position to maximize sales pace, pricing, margins and, most importantly, returns on invested capital, while working to mitigate excess market risk. 
Through our Value Creation strategy, we have now put the company in a position to grow while continuing to generate better financial performance and consistently returning funds to our shareholders. And we have done all this while taking a more conservative, lower-risk approach to our business. 
Growth, strong returns and properly managed risk, we think this is a great combination. 
Now let me turn over the call to Bob for a more thorough review of the quarter. Bob?"
294550,320199253,923341,"PulteGroup, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","PulteGroup, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Richard, and good morning. The gains demonstrated in PulteGroup's Q4 financial results are a direct reflection of the meaningful improvements we've continued to realize in our core homebuilding operations. As I will detail, these gains can be se",1720,"Thanks, Richard, and good morning. The gains demonstrated in PulteGroup's Q4 financial results are a direct reflection of the meaningful improvements we've continued to realize in our core homebuilding operations. 
As I will detail, these gains can be seen throughout our fourth quarter financial statements. 
Fourth quarter homebuilding revenues totaled $2 billion, which is up 12% from prior-year revenues of $1.8 billion. The increase in Q4 revenue is driven by a 7% increase in closings to 5,662 homes, combined with a 6% increase in average sales price, $353,000. Although not a metric we manage against, the 5,662 homes closed in the fourth quarter equates to a backlog conversion rate of 65%. 
As we addressed on our most recent calls, we're working to close the year-over-year performance gap we've experienced with regard to getting homes delivered. We're pleased with the progress we've made in the fourth quarter. 
Having said that, the challenges we in the industry face with regard to labor resources and extended land development time lines are not likely to improve in the near term. We believe, however, that our decision to prudently increase that production should help us to maintain a more consistent build cadence going forward.
In the quarter, closings by brand were as follows: 19% of homes were from Centex communities; 55% were from Pulte communities; and 26% were from Del Webb. In the fourth quarter of last year, closings from Centex, Pulte and Del Webb were 24%, 46% and 30%, respectively. 
Given the profile of projects we're investing in, coupled with the projected impact of assets acquired in the Wieland transaction, we believe that describing our customers by buyer group rather than by brand will better represent the makeup of our business. As a result, beginning in Q1, we will address buyer groups rather than brands. 
In the fourth quarter, closings by buyer group were as follows: 31% were first-time buyers; 40% were move-up buyers; and 29% were active-adult buyers. In 2014, closings by buyer group were 34%, first-time; 33%, move-up; and 33%, active-adult. The company recorded gross margins of 23.5% in the fourth quarter, which is up 40 basis points over the prior year. 
As has been an ongoing trend, fourth quarter margins were enhanced by higher option and lot premium revenues. In fact, option revenues in the quarter increased 10% or $4,976 per closing, while lot premiums gained 16% or $1,868 per closing. 
Sales discounts remained modest at just 2.2% or $8,026 per home compared with 2.1% or $7,040 per home last year. Since implementing our strategic pricing programs in 2011 as part of our Value Creation strategy, option revenues per home have increased by $19,800 or 58%, while lot premiums per home has increased by approximately $7,100 or 107%. 
We believe our more strategic approach to pricing has been a key contributor to the high gross margins we continue to maintain. 
Reported fourth quarter SG&A expense of $139 million or 7% of home sale revenues included the benefit of a $30 million reversal of construction-related insurance reserves. 
Reported prior-year SG&A expense of $146 million or 8.2% of home sale revenues reflected a $15 million reversal of construction-related insurance reserves. 
Looking at the full year, our reported SG&A of $590 million, which was 10.2% of homebuilding revenues, includes the benefit of $62 million or 110 basis points associated with certain legal settlements and reserve reversals. 
PulteGroup's financial services segment reported fourth quarter pretax income of $29 million, which includes the reversal of $12 million of mortgage repurchase reserves. The decision to reduce reserves was based on probable settlements of various repurchase requests and current conditions. 
Mortgage capture rate in Q4 was 83%, up from 81% in the prior year. I'd like to take a moment to highlight the efforts of our financial services team including Pulte Mortgage and PGP Title in meeting the challenges in the new regulatory environment under TRID. Our teams did a tremendous job closing Pulte Mortgage loans without missing a beat and supporting our customers under the new rules. Deb Still, our President and CEO of Financial Services, and her team are recognized leaders in the industry and did a fantastic job implementing the changes needed to operate within the new TRID guidelines. 
Looking at net income for the fourth quarter, we reported $228 million or $0.64 per share, which includes $0.07 per share benefit from insurance and mortgage reserve reversals taken in the quarter. Our per share earnings were calculated using approximately 352 million shares outstanding for the quarter, which is down 6% from last year, largely as a result of our share repurchase activities. 
As part of our income statement review, we wanted to provide some thoughts about 2016. Given our backlog in anticipated land, labor and material costs, we expect 2016 homebuilding margins, inclusive of the dilutive effect of the Wieland transaction, to remain high and be in the range of 21.5% to 22%. This annual margin guidance includes a negative impact for the Wieland transaction of approximately 100 basis points in the first quarter, 80 basis points in the second quarter and 50 basis points in each of the third and fourth quarters. 
Looking at our projected SG&A, we expect our full-year spend will be approximately 10% of homebuilding revenues. Consistent with prior years, this will be impacted on a quarterly basis by the seasonality of our closings. Based on the margin and overhead guidance we just provided, the calculated operating margin we expect to generate in 2016 is between 11.5% and 12%. 
The operating margin we reported for 2015 was 13.2%, but this was enhanced by the 110-basis-point impact from the construction-related insurance reserve reversals we recorded during the year. When you consider that our 2016 operating margin guidance of 11.5% to 12% is being negatively impacted by roughly 70 basis points from the Wieland transaction and factor in the 110-basis-point enhancement to 2015 operating margins, you could see that operating margins were actually flat to slightly improved in 2016 compared to 2015. 
Given headwinds the industry is facing on land and labor costs, we're very proud to be able to maintain our strong operating margin. 
Putting all this together, the combination of expected higher closing volumes, higher ASPs and overhead leverage have us positioned for strong earnings growth in 2016. 
Moving past the income statement and reviewing our homebuilding operations, we ended the fourth quarter with a total of 6,494 homes under construction. Spec units accounted for 30% of the homes under production, which is up from 26% this time last year. 
As discussed, we have purposely increased the amount of spec homes we have in the pipeline to help maintain a more even construction cadence. In the fourth quarter, we approved approximately 7,000 lots for purchase, excluding the Wieland assets, as that deal closed in mid-January. We ended the year with 138,000 lots under control, of which approximately 42,000 lots or 31% were controlled via option. We continue to see GAAP opportunities to increase our use of land options in an effort to enhance returns and to lower our overall risk profile. Of our controlled lots, approximately 23% are finished and 18% are currently under development. 
As Richard discussed, we continue to use a defined and disciplined approach to our land investments. Consistent with our land acquisition guidelines, we invested $485 million of land acquisition in Q4 and an additional $304 million for development of previously acquired lots. These investments brought our full year land-related spend to $2.3 billion. 
For the year, we invested approximately $1.2 billion to acquire new land. Looking ahead to 2016, including the money invested to acquire the Wieland assets, we have authorized $1.6 billion for land acquisition. As always, this level of investment is predicated on our continuing assessment of the market and on our ability to identifying suitable, high-returning projects. 
Looking at our capital allocated to shareholders in the fourth quarter, we've distributed $28 million in dividend and did not repurchase any of our stock. The lack of share repurchase activity was due to the trading limitations resulting from work to close our previously disclosed term loan and to acquire the Wieland assets. We expect our share repurchase program to become active again beginning in the first quarter of 2016. 
Based on our fourth quarter activity, we ended the year with $775 million of cash and a debt-to-capital ratio of 30%. As Richard noted at the start of this call, we realized strong, new order growth in the fourth quarter as orders were up 13% over last year to 3,659 homes. Higher orders for the period were driven by a 9% increase in absorption paces, as all 3 buyer groups realized higher prices. 
It should be noted that we expect absorption paces in the first half of 2016 to be lower as we integrate the Wieland communities with their typical operating model of higher ASPs and slower absorption paces relative to Pulte averages. 
Breaking down orders by buyer group, on a year-over-year basis, our first-time buyer business was flat, while move-up and active-adult orders increased 35%, 3%, respectively. 
Adjusting for community count, our absorption paces were up 16% for first-time buyers, 11% for move-up buyers and 9% for active-adult buyers. On a dollar basis, orders for the fourth quarter came 24% to $1.4 billion, helping to raise the average sales price in backlog to $365,000. 
It's important to remember that normal business seasonality and its impact on the mix of closings will typically result in lower-delivered ASPs in the first quarter of each year. 
The company operated out of 620 communities during the fourth quarter, which is up 4% over the prior year. Looking ahead, we currently expect community count growth versus comparable prior-year period to be in the range of 8% to 10% in the first 2 quarters of the year, increasing to 10% to 15% growth in the back half of the year. This would be our largest year-over-year increase in community count since the housing recovery began. Supported by our strong orders in the fourth quarter, we ended 2015 with a backlog of 6,731 homes valued at $2.5 billion. The growth in our year-end backlog of 15% in units and 26% in dollars compared to last year gives us great momentum heading into '16. 
Now let me turn the call back to Richard."

As Bob detailed, the company's -- the company realized meaningful improvement in our operating and financial results for the quarter.

As Bob detailed, the company's -- the company realized meaningful improvement in our operating and financial results for the quarter. Given the strength of our operating metrics and the expansion of our land pipeline, we are in excellent position to grow earnings in 2016 and beyond. 
As has been our practice, let me provide a few comments on the market conditions, which drove our fourth quarter results. Consistent with our Q4 increases in orders and absorption pace, we experienced generally higher buyer traffic to our communities, a pattern we realized throughout 2015. Further, many of the trends we experienced earlier in 2015 continued through Q4, with stronger demand in the better-located and, on average, closer-in communities. 
Specific to the fourth quarter, buyer demand remain positive, up and down the East Coast, with notable strength in the Southeast from the Carolinas down to Florida. We have talked about positive demand trends in the Southeast for a number of years. It is this trend and our expectations for long-term growth in the Southeast markets, particularly the bigger markets of Atlanta, Charleston, Charlotte and Raleigh, which made the transaction with John Wieland so compelling. 
Looking to the center of the country, demand conditions remain favorable, although we continue to experience volatility in the performance of underlying markets. Demand in the Midwest showed some positive gains, as we benefited from an expanded community count in several markets. Our Texas business in Q4 was slowed by having roughly 10% fewer open communities available-for-sale versus the prior year. In addition, our Texas numbers were impacted by ongoing demand softness in the higher-priced communities in Houston, resulting from the prolonged weakness in the energy markets. Given current conditions, we are being very thoughtful about deploying additional capital in the region, and will continue to carefully monitor demand throughout the state. 
The Western third of the country continue to realize excellent demand from Washington through California and through our markets in Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico. Overall, we were pleased with how demand conditions developed in the fourth quarter. We have seen a continuation of good traffic and demand trends through the first few weeks of January, so we have every reason to be optimistic heading into the spring selling season. 
Consistent with our long-held expectations for a gradual, but sustained recovery, 2015 new home sales of approximately 500,000 units for the country were up 15% over last year. Given the favorable market dynamics of strong job growth, accelerating household formations, supported demographic trends and continued low interest rates, we expect new home sales will continue their slow and steady path higher for the next several years. All that being said, we are well aware of the volatility in the world today. From concerns about global economic conditions to the swoon in oil prices, to gyrations in the stock market, the day-to-day swings can be violent. The reality is, however, that we can't control any of these factors, but what we can do is focus on running our business consistent with the goals we have established and disciplines we have demonstrated. This means acquiring well-located communities that we believe can deliver high returns on investment. 
It also means hedging our bets by using more land options, where possible, and focusing in on smaller, shorter-duration projects, where we can get our capital back quickly. It also means not over-leveraging the balance sheet and keeping one hand on the lever to slow investment if housing demand begins to change. And finally, it means having the discipline to systematically give excess funds back to shareholders rather than trying to force investments in the system. 
We ended 2015 with a strong fourth quarter performance. I am confident that we can build on these results in 2016 and further capitalize on the excellent market position I believe PulteGroup maintains today, a market position that has been built by our exceptional group of employees, who work hard every day to build great homes and deliver an unmatched home-buying experience to our customers.

I guess, my question generally would be, as you lay out your community count growth, as you think about how you're going to be utilizing the Wieland land with some of your product, and just generally as you position your business in 2016 and '17, how specifically or discreetly are you targeting a first-time buyer, who may be looking to sort of buy a product, which historically might have been considered a little bit more of a move-up -- a first-time move-up kind of a product?

And two, as Bob indicated, and then more in Q3 and 4, although strong really all 4 quarters. So that factor, we would expect absorption rates in Q1 to be impacted there.

What were the key drivers of that? And it was also down sequentially. I just wanted to get your sense if labor was a big part, if there was a mix shift, if there was land cost, what were the kind of drivers? And also as we think about 2016, I know you highlighted the Wieland acquisition being about a 70-basis-point drag, but what would the other components of that -- of the year-over-year change be?"

There is about 70 basis points of detriment that we expect in '16 from the Wieland acquisition. And then if you look at it, the margin profile of the business, thinking about it from consumer groups, is -- as has been the case for years, the most --  the highest margin is going to be our active-adult. Interestingly, when you look at it, the first-time business actually enjoys very high margins for 2 reasons. One, that millennial business that we've talked about is a very strong margin business for us. And for the historical Centex business, since we haven't been investing many of the lots that we're running through now are older. So they enjoy strong margins. And then that move-up business, which is where we've done most of our investment over the last 3 or 4 years, still enjoying very good margins. But because of the higher land cost and labor costs that we're seeing is, today, of the 3, although still strong, the lower margin business. And so the mix shift towards that has implications to our composite margins. So 70 basis points from Wieland, mix shift and labor cost, probably the biggest driver of margin, otherwise, in 2016."

The newer Del Webbs that we bring on, though, typically are closer to the core center 500 to 1,000 lots, I would say, overall better locations, and we're really pleased with the results there. So the way I'd look at it, Buck, would be as active-adult communities cycle over time, for us to be concentrating on opportunities that are closer to city core vis-à-vis the larger kind of big cruise ship Del Webb operations of the past, those are probably not going to happen again. Having said that, we are pleased with the absorption rates we continue to see. You're right, they are typically lagging the others, but not by much. And we love the financial performance of those communities with strong margins and good returns."

Some of you may have seen the letter issued yesterday by Bill [indiscernible] where his grandson's performance on the CNBC yesterday. As there is nothing new in Bill's letter, we will not be responding to these attacks or otherwise be discussing the on this call. Other than to say though we stand by the completeness and accuracy of our previous disclosures. We run this company for the benefit of all shareholders and we'll continue to do so. I've had opportunity these past few weeks to speak with many of our largest holders, and that's encouraging to hear your support for our entire leadership team, our Board of Directors and our Value Creation strategy. I want to take this opportunity to ensure all that investors we are busy running this company and remains squarely focused on continuing to deliver value for you.
To that point, we are extremely pleased with the strength of our first quarter results. Consistent with our strategy and our efforts to enhance returns on invested capital, for the past few years, we have highlighted strategic pricing, construction productivity and balance sheet efficiency as drivers of our performance. Our financial results over the past few years reflect these drivers as we realized significant gains in pretax profitability despite only modest gains in production volumes.
Many of you have seen the graph in our presentation which we included in today's conference call slides, which shows are pretax income, improving $1.1 billion over the past 5 years on just a 12% increase in closings. We have communicated that 2016 would be an inflection year, with increasing volume being delivered to a much more efficient homebuilding operation. The combination of rising unit volumes, increasing average sales prices and the more efficient homebuilding machine can translate into significant earnings growth. Add in the benefit of consistently returning funds to shareholders, and you have a business that can produce high returns for its investors overtime.
As Bob will detail in a moment, the business has begun to turn in that direction, with signups increased by 10% to almost 5,700 homes. Closing volumes gaining 17% to almost 4,000 closings, average selling prices expanding by 9% to $353,000, and our backlog value climbing 31% to $3.4 billion. These metrics, obviously, resulted in a strong quarterly performance in the first quarter, but equally important, they position the company to deliver continued growth over the balance of 2016.
While our Q1 numbers and our expectations for 2016 point to increase in scale, we have not and will not lose our focus on our primary objective, to run a business that can deliver better returns over the housing cycle and do so with less risk. We believe that the onset of his housing recovery that it would be more gradual than the v-shape rebound typical of those housing cycles. Our thesis is unchanged as we expected and extended recovery will continue to unfold for the next several years supported by improving economy, favorable demographics, years of relative underbuilding and the supportive mortgage rate environment.
Given these dynamics, we have been increasing our investment in the business but have done so in a disciplined manner by emphasizing smaller projects while expanding our use of options when possible. This has served as extraordinary years of land supply helping to mitigate market risk. We have also focused our land investments on closer end locations where we think demand is more sustainable when the market ultimately takes a breather. We have excepted a trade-off of having up a certain positions on where we can be more confident in their future performance.
As evidence of our focus on driving returns and reducing risk relative to prior business practices, consider that our supply of owned lots has fallen from approximately 8.5 years in 2010 to roughly 5.5 years in 2015. Based on our land acquisition discipline, expected sales cases, as we work and to some alert longer in older communities, we look forward -- excuse me, we look for our own supply to continue trending lower in the future. Among the reasons for the decline is that improve land deals and over the past 5 years have averaged roughly 125 controlled lots for community, and this includes 31 new Del Webb projects over that timeframe that have averaged just over 500 controlled lots each.
Along with how we manage land, our more disciplined approach extends to the management of the company's entire balance sheet. Bob and his team have done an outstanding job reshaping our balance sheet and giving us the financial strength to run our day-to-day operations and the flexibility to seasonal opportunity to develop in the market. As I mentioned, earlier, we remain the king at this housing recovery in several more years of growth in private. And just north of 500,000 new home sales, unit volumes remained 30% below the historic average. And with millennials beginning to buy homes, the leading edge of that demographic is now impacting the market. These factors along with a growing economy, modest wage inflation and a favorable jobs keeps us optimistic about the near and long-term opportunities for PulteGroup.
Let me turn the call over to Bob for more details on our quarterly results. Bob?"

Consistent with Richard's comments regarding the positive market environment, our first quarter financial results shows significant gains in key operating metrics. In addition to delivering strong results for t",1835,"Thanks, Richard, and good morning, everyone. Consistent with Richard's comments regarding the positive market environment, our first quarter financial results shows significant gains in key operating metrics. In addition to delivering strong results for the quarter, our Q1 numbers have the company well positioned to deliver outstanding full year results as well.
Looking at the business we appear an excellent demand in the first quarter, with signups increasing 10% to 5,652 homes. The year-over-year increase in the dollar value of signups are even greater, climbing 24% to $2.1 billion.
Breaking down sales buyer group, unit signups increased 2% among first-time buyers and 37% among move-up buyers, while sales decreased 12% with our active adult communities. The decrease among active adult buyers is due in part to the close out of several selling efforts.
Looking at buyer groups, the absorption pace has increased 8% among first-time buyers and declined 4% and 5%, respectively, among new and active adult buyers. Excluding the impact of the [indiscernible] assets, which typically slower absorption basis and largely influenced our move-up buyer group, our overall absorption basis are flat.
During the quarter, home sale revenue has total $1.4 billion, which is up 28% over last year. The significant increase in homebuilding revenues is driven by a 17% increase in closing to 3,945 homes, combined with a 9% increase in average sales price to $353,000. The 17% increase in closings resulted from increased sales activity we've experienced over the last few quarters, coupled with a slight increase in our conversion rate.
Our Q1 conversion rate improved over last year, but it's still running below recent multiyear averages. We expect this pattern to continue in Q2 and throughout 2015 as we make gradual progress on conversion rate versus last year. However, along -- elongated construction cycle times will present us in the near term for reaching the levels we realized a few years ago.
Looking at the mix of our closings in the first quarter,, 29% for first-time buyers, 41% for move-up buyers and 30% were active adult buyers. In Q1 of last year, closing by buyers [indiscernible] for 33% first-time, 34% move-up and 33% active adult.
As I noted, our ASP increased 9% in the first quarter,, reflecting our continued mid-shift towards the move out business, coupled with increases from all consumer groups including an 8% increase to $252,000 for first-time buyers, a 7% increase to $425,000 for move-up buyers and a 5% increase to $353,000 for active adult buyers.
I would like to point out that in addition to the increase in selling prices we realized from our Q1 closings, we also realized notably higher sales prices from current sales that have resulted in the ASP and our backlog being at 14% over the prior year. These gains are primarily driven by the mixed shifts to move-up that I mentioned a moment ago, coupled with higher sales prices at midland communities.
Given our existing -- given our expectations for backlog conversion rates and the longer build time associated with the larger of wheel and products, the higher backlog ASPs will translated the higher closing prices on a gradual plus sustained basis over the remaining quarters of 2016 and into 2017.
In the first quarter, we reported gross margines of 21.9%, which includes approximately 80 basis points of decrease associated with our acquisition of the Wieland assets. Excluding the impact of the Wieland transaction, margins were consistent with last year. It's worth noting that in addition to the impact of the Wieland purchase, our Q1 margins reflected anticipated higher land, labor and material cost, offset by lower interest rates.
Offsetting some of the cost pressure has been our continuous success and systematically increasing the amount of option dollars and lot premioums, which provide better margins we realize in each home. In the first quarter, option revenues per closing inc erased 6% or slightly more than $3,000 over the prior year. While last premiums increased by 4% or just under $600 per home.
Sales discount in the quarter increased 40 basis points over last year to 2.6% per home, which is consistent with results we've seen over the past several quarters. I'd like to take a couple of minutes to address some questions we've got over the past few quarters related to our gross margins. Specifically, over time, we've been asked about the influence on our gross margins of longer-dated assets that has based these adjustments during the downturn in the market. In response to this, you may recall that we provided an analysis of our Del Webb assets and related margins, which was included on Slide 11 in our webcast deck, that provide a comparisons of our older much larger legacy Del Webb community to our smaller newer position. As you can see on that slide, we enjoy strong margins on that entire book of the business with a more recent investment also enjoying strong returns.
Based on continuing questions for investors aroudn our entire land position, we prepared for additional analysis which is included in Slide 12 of the deck. That slide provides details comparing the margins and income statement impact of our newer and never-impaired land, with that of our land that was easily impaired by us or adjusted to the fair value process [indiscernible] acquisition.
Looking at the slide, there are a few things I would like to highlight. First, if you look at the bottom row of the chart, you will see that the legacy lots are actually detrimental to our margins in 2011 through 2013. This is due to the fact that our impairments has fair value process due typically resulted and gross margins in the low teens. There is only after the benefit of several years of ASP growth that closings on those lots represent a slight benefit to our performance.
As with any legacy lot, the margin profile improves over time, assuming their home selling prices are increasing even modestly each year. Second, if you look at the second row of the chart, you will see, as the legacy lots are decreased as a percentage of our overall close. In fact, closings on legacy lots represents 72% of our total closings in 2011, but it falls to 38% in 2015 that will drop even further in 2016 and the years beyond.
And finally, I would highlight the margins on our unimpaired land versus remain almost inside our legacy position reflected the benefit that the invested discipline with 2 [Pulte Homes] as part of our value creation.
Given the margin profile of our total land portfolio and our ongoing Value Creation initiatives, we continue to target gross margins in the range of 21.5% to 22% for the full year.
Moving past gross margins, our SG&A in the first quarter was $191 million or 13.7% of home sale revenues compared with $161 million last year or 14.8% of home sale revenues. The increase in our total lend -- increase our total spend due primarily to the hiring of additional field resources to manage a 41% increase in the number of homes we have under production plus approximately $4 million of charges associated with the Weiland acquisition.
Given that Q1 is a seasonal low point for our deliveries, SG&A spend will certainly decrease as the percentage of revenues over the course of the year, but we also expect the dollar spend wil gradually trend lower in subsequent quarters. As such, we expect full year SG&A spend of approximately $730 million or approximately 10% of home sale revenues.
Turning to financial services. First quarter pretax reported income was $10 million, which compares of $5 million last year. The increase is due primarily to the higher closing volumes generated through our homebuilding operations. Our capture rate for the period was 81% compared to 82% last year.
Looking at our income taxes, our first quarter expense of $35 million, represents that effective tax rate is 29.5%, which is below our guidance of 38%. During the quarter the company realized approximately $10 million of net favorable adjustment relating to the settlement of certain state tax matters. Going forward, we expect our normalized rate to the remaining quarters in 2016 to be consistent with our previous guidance of 38%.
Closing up on the income statement, our Q1 net income was $83 million or $0.24 per share compared to the prior year net income of $55 million or $0.15 per share. $83 million is our highest recorded first quarter net income in a decade, providing further confirmation that we've got off with a very good start for the year.
Looking at our controlled lot position, we improved approximately 7,000 lots for purchase in the first quarter, which represents an average of roughly 160 lots per community approved. We continue to focus on smaller and faster turning communities. However, given that most of the land position we're putting under control are raw, we still estimate it will take 12 to 18 months before a community will typically com online. At quarter-end, we had approximately 146,000 lots under control, of which 30% were controlled via option.
During the quarter, we spent $262 million on land acquisition, which does not include our purchase of the Wieland asset. Based on our Q1 land acquisition spend, we're on track with our prior guidance of investing approximately $1.2 billion excluding Wieland for land acquisition in 2016. This estimate assumes we can continue to identify projects that could be in our disciplined underwriting guidelines and return thresholds.
Consistent with our Value Creation priorities, we continue to return funds to shareholders through dividend and share repurchases. After curtailing stock purchases in Q4 2015 because of activities surrounding the Wieland transaction, we reinstated our buyback programs that [indiscernible] be a consistent and systematic participant market for our shares. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.1 million shares for $50 million or $16.36 per share. We ended the quarter with $1 billion of cash, which includes funds raised through our February senior note offering. We plan to use approximately $465 million of our cash to reture bond, which will mature in May of this year. Our debt total capital ratio at quarter-end was 39% compared with 30% at the end of 2015. On a proforma basis, adjusting for the month, the May bond repayment, our debt-to-capital ratio cost to 35%.
For the quarter, we operated from 709 communities, which is up [ph] 15% in the same period last year. The increase is higher than our guidance range of 8% to 10%, but reflects the slower closeout rate for existing communities as opposed to an acceleration of new store openings. As such, we expect the year-over-year change in community count will come back in line with our previous guidance as we move through the year.
And finally, our quarter end backlog of 8,755 homes is valued at $3.4 billion, which represent an increases of 15% and 31%, respectively, over the prior year.
Now, let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall for some additional comments."

As both Richard and Bob has mentioned this morning, our financial results demonstrate the 2016 is shaping up to be an inflection point for the company. Reflective of actions we have taken over the past several years, we've transitioned the business to deliver more growth but without introducing excess risk. For the past 5-plus years, we've been methodically altering our risk profile by selling off unproductive land partials and moving through long lined assets that have been a drag on the balance sheet. Over the same period, we have reinvested in shorter duration, high-margin communities that have generated high returns and driven the financial gains in the past few years.
Having been in the field for over a decade, I'm now part of the senior leadership team for the past few years, I fully appreciate the change we've undergone in pursuing the Value Creation strategy and the benefits we've captured.
As we transition to responsible growth, my focus is on ensuring we capture additional operating efficiencies while continuing our disciplined investment process. This means delivering more volume and a profitable, responsible and risk-adjusted way, and avoiding the trap of chasing growth for growth's sake.
During my field visits, I have and will continue to drive on the point that we are running a business designed to deliver true cycle returns, and this demand is efficiently growing pretax income while intelligently investing in the business.
Now looking at our homebuilding operations, we've had 7,909 homes under construction at the end of the quarter, of which 27% were stuck. Consistent  with our previous guidance, we purposely increased production heading into the spring selling season and help manage and smooth our overall production cadence.
The speck sales tracking the plan and finish by continuing to average well below 1 per community, we are right where we wanted to be during this busy time of the Spring selling season. After several months of strong spec starts, and now having a large and growing backlog of sold homes, we have already started reducing the number of specs we put into production.
Looking at demand conditions for the quarter, we are very pleased with activity in a marketplace these past few months. As you might expect, with a 10% increase in signups in the period, we generally saw a positive traffic and demand conditions across the country during the quarter. And I would add that this trend has continued into the first few weeks of April.
In summary, the feedback I've received from our operators during my recent market visits is consistent with what we've seen in the data. The selling season has gotten off to a very good start. Taking this down to a regional level, on the East Coast, overall demand was solid in the quarter and got better as you move from North and South. Consistent with the trend over the last several quarters, we continue to see stronger demand in the Carolinas, Georgia and Florida. We are excited about the long-term opportunities we see in the South, particularly in the Southeast given the migration trends, higher preferences in land availability. It is one of the reasons why were interested in the Wieland assets.
Looking at the middle third [ph] of the country, we saw broad-based improvement in demand through the Midwest.
With sign climbing over 30% for the quarter, winter weather conditions were a little easier at the start of this year compared with 2015, but we are optimistic that the higher signups for the quarter reflect a more fundamental improvement in demand. Dropping down into Texas on a year-over-year basis, signups were essentially flat as exceptional strength in Dallas was offset by softer demand in Houston and San Antonio. Houston demand improved as we move through the quarter, and the market has performed better than, I think, many were expecting.
And finally, looking out to our west markets. We continue to experience good demand, particularly in some of our bigger markets including Northern California, Phoenix and Las Vegas. We have some new communities open in Las Vegas and it is great to see the market responding favorably to these new locations.
Given the differences on market dynamics that can exist in the local level, that can be tough to generalize. But we would say to demand continued to improve and the communities located closer to city center fair better in terms of sales, prices and pages.
The inventory of homes available for sale remains tight in most of our markets. And at least on the new home side, will likely remain that way for a while given the limited supply of finished lots available. I have already met some of you at conferences earlier this year, and I look forward to meeting more of you as the year progresses. Let me turn the call back over to Richard. Richard?"

I believe, you said that community account was better-than-expected due to lower closeout rates during the quarter, but you expect 2Q to get back to original guidance. I just want to make sure I'm thinking about that right, that the original was for first half community count to be up 8% to 10% versus for 4Q end. And also, from a absorption standpoint, roughly flat year-over-year and I believe you had expected suspected Wieland to maybe have a little bit of a negative impact and a slight overall decline in absorption. It seems flat versus that original slight decline was also related to the slower closeout of the older communities.

And what we're saying is we think we'll get back to that range of growth period-over-period as to absorption paces. We did say coming into the year that Wieland would likely had an impact on our absorption basis because it moves a little bit slower than our traditional poultry business. And in fact, that's what we saw. So we highlighted that you had an 8% increase in first time, and 4% to 5% decreases in move-up and active-adult.

Coming to the [indiscernible] we have said, Wieland would influence our margins by about 70 basis points for the year. We still think that's a pretty good number. We have given quarterly estimates on that and was 100 in the first quarter, 70 in the second, 50 in the third and fourth, and we were a little bit less impactful in the first quarter, it was like 80 basis points, but we think through the year that it's still about 70 basis points. So coming into it, we said, look, we've got higher land and labor construction cost, and that will be offset by interest increases. That's exactly what we signed a first quarter. I think you can expect to continue to see that with the balance of 2016. Again, within that annual range of 21.5% to 22%. Obviously, the financing we did here in the first quarter took our leverage up, took our interest spend up. So for the first time in a long time, our cash spend is a little bit higher than our interest expense. That won't influence 2016, we'll have some influence on '17 and beyond. But I guess the only thing I'd point out to that end is paying down the debt that we'll do in the second quarter, there's a net end of about $500 million year-over-year, that's roughly 5%, 5.5%.

Some of you may have seen the letter issued yesterday by Bill Pulte over his grandson's performance on CNBC yesterday.

Some of you may have seen the letter issued yesterday by Bill Pulte over his grandson's performance on CNBC yesterday. As there is nothing new in Bill's letter, we will not be responding to these attacks or otherwise be discussing the Pultes on this call, other than to say that we stand by the completeness and accuracy of our previous disclosures. We run this company for the benefit of all shareholders, and we'll continue to do so. I've had opportunity these past few weeks to speak with many of our largest holders, and it's encouraging to hear your support for our entire leadership team, our Board of Directors and our Value Creation strategy. I want to take this opportunity to ensure all investors we are busy running this company and remain squarely focused on continuing to deliver value for you.
To that point, we were extremely pleased with the strength of our first quarter results. Consistent with our strategy and our efforts to enhance returns on invested capital, for the past few years, we have highlighted strategic pricing, construction productivity and balance sheet efficiency as drivers of our performance. Our financial results over the past few years reflect these drivers as we realized significant gains in pretax profitability despite only modest gains in production volumes.
Many of you have seen the graph in our investor presentation, which we included in today's conference call slides, which shows our pretax income improving by $1.1 billion over the past 5 years on just a 12% increase in closings. We have communicated that 2016 would be an inflection year with increasing volume being delivered to [ph] a much more efficient homebuilding operation. The combination of rising unit volumes, increasing average sales prices and a more efficient homebuilding machine can translate into significant earnings growth. Add in the benefit of consistently returning funds to shareholders, and you have a business that can produce high returns for its investors over time.
As Bob will detail in a moment, the business is beginning to turn in that direction with signups increased by 10% to almost 5,700 homes, closing volumes gaining 17% to almost 4,000 closings, average selling prices expanding by 9% to $353,000 and our backlog value climbing 31% to $3.4 billion. These metrics, obviously, resulted in the strong quarterly performance in the first quarter. But equally important, they position the company to deliver continued growth over the balance of 2016.
While our Q1 numbers and our expectations for 2016 point to increasing scale, we have not and will not lose our focus on our primary objective: to run a business that can deliver better returns over the housing cycle and do so with less risk. We have believed since the outset of this housing recovery that it would be more gradual than the V-shaped rebound typical of most housing cycles. Our thesis is unchanged as we expect an extended recovery will continue to unfold for the next several years supported by an improving economy, favorable demographics, years of relative underbuilding and a supportive mortgage rate environment.
Given these dynamics, we have been increasing our investment in the business but have done so in a disciplined manner by emphasizing smaller projects while expanding our use of options when possible. This has served to shorten our years of land supply, helping to mitigate market risk. We have also focused our land investments on closer relocations where we think demand is more sustainable when the market ultimately takes a breather. We have excepted a trade-off of having to pay a little more for certain positions on where we can be more confident in their future performance.
As evidence of our focus on driving returns and reducing risk relative to prior business practices, consider that our supply of owned lots has fallen from approximately 8.5 years in 2010 to roughly 5.5 years in 2015. Based on our land acquisition discipline, expected sales paces, as we work through some of our longer and older communities, we look forward -- excuse me, we look for our own supply to continue trending lower in the future. Among the reasons for the decline is that approved land deals over the past 5 years have averaged roughly 125 controlled lots per community, and this includes 31 new Del Webb projects over that time frame that have averaged just over 500 controlled lots each.
Along with how we manage land, our more disciplined approach to the business extends to the management of the company's entire balance sheet. Bob and his team have done an outstanding job reshaping our balance sheet and giving us the financial strength to run our day-to-day operations and the flexibility to seize on opportunities that develop in the market. As I mentioned, earlier, we remain [indiscernible] that this housing recovery has several more years of growth in front of it. At just north of 500,000 new home sales, unit volumes remain 30% below the historic average. And with millennials beginning to buy homes, the leading edge of that demographic is now impacting the market. These factors, along with a growing economy, modest wage inflation and a favorable outlook for jobs, keeps us optimistic about the near- and long-term opportunities for PulteGroup.
Let me turn over the call to Bob for more details on our quarterly results. Bob?"

Consistent with Richard's comments regarding the positive market environment, our first quarter financial results show significant gains in key operating metrics. In addition to delivering strong results in the",1830,"Thanks, Richard, and good morning, everyone. Consistent with Richard's comments regarding the positive market environment, our first quarter financial results show significant gains in key operating metrics. In addition to delivering strong results in the quarter, our Q1 numbers have the company well positioned to deliver outstanding full year results as well.
Looking at the business, we experienced excellent demand in the first quarter with signups increasing 10% to 5,652 homes. The year-over-year increase in the dollar value of signups was even greater, climbing 24% to $2.1 billion.
Breaking down sales by buyer group, unit signups increased 2% among first-time buyers and 37% among move-up buyers, while sales decreased 12% with our active adult communities. The decrease among active adult buyers was due in part to the close-out of several selling efforts.
Looking at buyer groups, absorption pace has increased 8% among first-time buyers and declined 4% and 5%, respectively, among move-up and active adult buyers. Excluding the impact of the Wieland assets, which typically had slower absorption paces and largely influenced our move-up buyer group, our overall absorption paces were flat.
During the quarter, home sale revenues totaled $1.4 billion, which is up 28% over last year. The significant increase in homebuilding revenues was driven by a 17% increase in closing to 3,945 homes combined with a 9% increase in average sales price to $353,000. The 17% increase in closings resulted from the increased sales activity we've experienced over the last few quarters, coupled with a slight increase in our conversion rate. Our Q1 conversion rate improved over last year but is still running below recent multiyear averages. We expect this pattern to continue in Q2 and throughout 2015 as we make gradual progress on conversion rates versus last year. However, elongated construction cycle times will present (sic) [ prevent ] us in the near term from reaching the levels we realized a few years ago.
Looking at the mix of our closings in the first quarter. 29% were first-time buyers, 41% were move-up buyers and 30% were active adult buyers. In Q1 of last year, closings by buyer group were 33% first-time, 34% move-up and 33% active adult.
As I noted, our ASP increased 9% in the first quarter, reflecting our continuing mix shift towards the move-up business, coupled with increases from all consumer groups, including an 8% increase to $252,000 for first-time buyers, a 7% increase to $425,000 for move-up buyers and a 5% increase to $353,000 for active adult buyers.
I would like to point out that in addition to the  increased selling prices we realized from our Q1 closings, we also realized notably higher sales prices from current sales that resulted in the ASP and our backlog being at 14% over the prior year. These pricing gains are primarily driven by the mix shift to move-up that I mentioned a moment ago, coupled with higher sales prices at Wieland communities.
Given our existing -- given our expectations for backlog conversion rates and the longer build times associated with the larger Wieland product, the higher-backlog ASPs will translate into higher closing prices on a gradual but sustained basis over the remaining quarters of 2016 and into 2017.
In the first quarter, we reported gross margins of 21.9%, which includes approximately 80 basis points of decrease associated with our acquisition of the Wieland assets. Excluding the impact of the Wieland transaction, margins were consistent with last year. It's worth noting that in addition to the impact of the Wieland purchase, our Q1 margins reflected anticipated higher land, labor and material costs, offset by lower interest charges.
Offsetting some of the cost pressure has been our continued success in systematically increasing the amount of option dollars and lot premiums, which provide richer margins we realize on each home. In the first quarter, option revenues per closing increased 6% or slightly more than $3,000 over the prior year while lot premiums increased by 4% or just under $600 per home.
Sales discounts in the quarter increased 40 basis points over last year to 2.6% per home, which is consistent with the results we've seen over the past several quarters. 
I'd like to take a couple of minutes to address some questions we've gotten over the past few quarters related to our gross margins. Specifically, over time, we've been asked about the influence on our gross margins of longer-dated assets that had basis [ph] adjustments during the downturn in the market. In response to this, you may recall that we provided an analysis of our Del Webb assets and related margins, which was included on Slide 11 in our webcast deck, that provided comparisons of our older, much larger legacy Del Webb communities to our smaller, newer positions. As you can see on that slide, we enjoy strong margins on that entire book of business with the more recent investments also enjoying strong returns.
Based on continuing questions from investors around our entire land position, we prepared some additional analysis, which is included in Slide 12 of the deck. That slide provides details comparing the margins and income statement impacts of our newer and never-impaired land with that of our land that was either impaired by us or adjusted through the fair value process as part of the Centex  acquisition.
Looking at the slide, there are a few things I would like to highlight. First, if you look at the bottom row of the chart, you will see that the legacy lots were actually detrimental to our margins in 2011 through 2013. This was due to the fact that our impairments and fair value processes typically resulted in gross margins in the low teens. It was only after the benefit that took several years of ASP growth that closings on those lots represent a slight benefit to our performance.
As with any legacy lot, the margin profile improves over time, assuming that home selling prices are increasing even modestly each year. 
Second, if you look at the second row of the chart, you will see that the legacy lots are decreasing as a percentage of our overall closings. In fact, closings on legacy lots represented 72% of our total closings in 2011, but it falls to 38% in 2015 and will drop even further in 2016 and the years beyond.
And finally, I would highlight the margins on our unimpaired land purchases remain almost the size of our legacy positions, reflecting the benefits of the investment discipline we instituted as part of Value Creation.
Given the margin profile of our total land portfolio and our ongoing Value Creation initiatives, we continue to target gross margins in the range of 21.5% to 22% for the full year.
Moving past gross margins, our SG&A in the first quarter was $191 million or 13.7% of home sale revenues compared with $161 million last year or 14.8% of home sale revenues. The increase in our total land -- the increase in our total spend was due primarily to the hiring of additional field resources to manage a 41% increase in the number of homes we have under production, plus approximately $4 million of charges associated with the Wieland acquisition. Given that Q1 is the seasonal low point for our deliveries, SG&A spend will certainly decrease as a percentage of revenues over the course of the year, but we also expect the dollar spend will gradually trend lower in subsequent quarters. As such, we expect full year SG&A spend of approximately $730 million or approximately 10% of home sale revenues.
Turning to financial services. First quarter pretax reported income was $10 million, which compares with $5 million last year. The increase was due primarily to the higher closing volumes generated through our homebuilding operations. Our capture rate for the period was 81% compared with 82% last year.
Looking at our income taxes. Our first quarter expense of $35 million represents an effective tax rate of 29.5%, which was below our guidance of 38%. During the quarter the company realized approximately $10 million of net favorable adjustments relating to the settlement of certain state tax matters. Going forward, we expect our normalized rate for the remaining quarters in 2016 to be consistent with our previous guidance of 38%.
Finishing up on the income statement, our Q1 net income was $83 million or $0.24 per share compared with prior year net income of $55 million or $0.15 per share. $83 million is our highest reported first quarter net income in a decade, providing further confirmation that we've gotten off to a very good start for the year.
Looking at our controlled lot position. We approved approximately 7,000 lots for purchase in the first quarter, which represents an average of roughly 160 lots per community approved. We continue to focus on smaller, faster-turning communities. However, given that most of the land positions we're putting under control are raw, we still estimate it will take 12 to 18 months before a community will typically come online. At quarter-end, we had approximately 146,000 lots under control, of which 30% were controlled via option.
During the quarter, we spent $262 million on land acquisition, which does not include our purchase of the Wieland assets. Based on our Q1 land acquisition spend, we're on track with our prior guidance of investing approximately $1.2 billion, excluding Wieland, for land acquisition in 2016. This estimate assumes we can continue to identify projects that meet our disciplined underwriting guidelines and return thresholds.
Consistent with our Value Creation priorities, we continue to return funds to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. After curtailing stock repurchases in Q4 2015 because of activities surrounding the Wieland transaction, we reinstated our buyback programs and look to be a consistent and systematic participant in the market for our shares. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.1 million shares for $50 million or $16.36 per share. 
We ended the quarter with $1 billion of cash, which includes funds raised through our February senior note offering. We plan to use approximately $465 million of our cash to retire bonds, which will mature in May of this year. 
Our debt-to-total capital ratio at quarter-end was 39% compared with 30% at the end of 2015. On a proforma basis, adjusting for the month of May bond repayment, our debt-to-capital ratio drops to 35%.
For the quarter, we operated from 709 communities, which is up 16% from the same period last year. The increase is higher than our guidance range of 8% to 10% but reflects the slower close-out rate for existing communities as opposed to an acceleration of new store openings. As such, we expect the year-over-year change in community count will come back in line with our previous guidance as we move through the year.
And finally, our quarter-end backlog of 8,755 homes is valued at $3.4 billion, which represent increases of 15% and 31%, respectively, over the prior year.
Now let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall for some additional comments."

As both Richard and Bob have mentioned this morning, our financial results demonstrate that 2016 is shaping up to be an inflection point for the company. Reflective of actions we have taken over the past several years, we've transitioned the business to deliver more growth but without introducing excess risk. For the past 5-plus years, we've been methodically altering our risk profile by selling off unproductive land parcels and moving through long-lived assets that have been a drag on the balance sheet. Over the same period, we've reinvested in shorter duration, high-margin communities that have generated high returns and driven the financial gains of the past few years.
Having been in the field for over a decade and now part of the senior leadership team for the past few years, I fully appreciate the change we've undergone in pursuing the Value Creation strategy and the benefits we've captured. As we transition to responsible growth, my focus is on ensuring we capture additional operating efficiencies while continuing our disciplined investment process. This means delivering more volume in a profitable, responsible and risk-adjusted way and avoiding the trap of chasing growth for growth's sake.
During my field visits, I have and will continue to drive home the point that we are running a business designed to deliver through-cycle returns, and this demands efficiently growing pretax income while intelligently investing in the business.
Now looking at our homebuilding operations, we had 7,909 homes under construction at the end of the quarter, of which 27% were spec. Consistent with our previous guidance, we purposely increased spec production heading into the spring selling season to help manage and smooth our overall production cadence. With spec sales tracking to plan and finished specs continuing to average well below 1 per community, we are right where we wanted to be during this busy time of the spring selling season. After several months of strong spec starts, and now having a large and growing backlog of sold homes, we have already started reducing the number of specs we've put into production.
Looking at demand conditions for the quarter, we are very pleased with activity in the marketplace these past few months. As you might expect, with a 10% increase in signups for the period, we generally saw positive traffic and demand conditions across the country during the quarter, and I would add that this trend has continued into the first few weeks of April.
In summary, the feedback I've received from our operators during my recent market visits is consistent with what we see in the data. The selling season has gotten off to a very good start. 
Taking us down to a regional level, on the East Coast, overall demand was solid in the quarter and got better as you move from North to South. Consistent with the trend over the last several quarters, we continue to see stronger demand in the Carolinas, Georgia and Florida. We are excited about the long-term opportunities we see in the South, particularly in the Southeast given the migration trends, buyer preferences and land availability. It is one of the reasons why we were interested in the Wieland assets.
Looking at the middle third of the country, we saw broad-based improvement in demand through the Midwest with signups  climbing over 30% for the quarter. Winter weather conditions were a little easier at the start of this year compared with 2015, but we are optimistic that the higher signups for the quarter reflect a more fundamental improvement in demand. 
Dropping down into Texas on a year-over-year basis, signups were essentially flat as exceptional strength in Dallas was offset by softer demand in Houston and San Antonio. Houston demand improved as we moved through the quarter, and the market has performed better than I think many were expecting.
And finally, looking out to our Western markets, we continue to experience good demand, particularly in some of our bigger markets including Northern California, Phoenix and Las Vegas. We had some new communities open in Las Vegas, and it was great to see the market responding favorably to these new locations.
Given the differences in market dynamics that can exist at the local level, it can be tough to generalize, but we would say that demand continues to improve and the communities located closer to city center fare better in terms of sales, prices and paces. The inventory of homes available for sale remains tight in most of our markets and, at least on the new home side, will likely remain that way for a while given the limited supply of finished lots available. 
I have already met some of you at conferences earlier this year, and I look forward to meeting more of you as the year progresses.

I believe you said that community count was better than expected due to lower close-out rates during the quarter, but you expect 2Q to get back to original guidance. I just want to make sure I'm thinking about that right, that the original was for the first half community count to be up 8% to 10% versus for 4Q-end and also from a absorption standpoint roughly flat year-over-year. And I believe you had expected Wieland to maybe have a little bit of a negative impact and a slight overall decline in absorption. If being flat versus that original slight decline was also related to the slower close-out of the older communities, then could we expect that original expectation to reassert itself in the second quarter as well?"

As to absorption paces, we did say coming into the year that Wieland would likely have an impact on our absorption paces because it moves a little bit slower than our traditional Pulte business. And in fact, that's what we saw. So we highlighted that you had an 8% increase in first-time and 4% and 5% decreases in move-up and active adult. And if you take Wieland out, then that's a net 5% down, 8.4% to 8.0% in terms of absorption paces. If you take Wieland out, we go up to 8.4%. So essentially, we're flat ex the Wieland business."

Coming into the year, we had said Wieland would influence our margins by about 70 basis points for the year. We still think that's a pretty good number. We had given quarterly estimates on that and it was 100 in the first quarter, 70 in the second, 50 in the third and fourth. And we were a little bit less impactful in the first quarter. It was only 80 basis points. But we think through the year that it's still about 70 basis points. So coming into it, we said, look, we've got higher land and labor construction costs, and that will be offset by interest increases. That's exactly what we saw in the first quarter. I think you can expect to continue to see that through the balance of 2016, again within that annual range of 21.5% to 22%. Obviously, the financing we did here in the first quarter took our leverage up, took our interest spend up. So for the first time in a long time, our cash spend is a little bit higher than our interest expense. That won't influence 2016. We'll have some influence on '17 and beyond. I guess the only thing I'd point out to that end is paying down the debt that we'll do in the second quarter, there's a net add of about $500 million year-over-year at roughly 5%, 5.5%.

Some of you may have seen the letter issued yesterday by Bill Pulte or his grandson's performance on CNBC yesterday. As there is nothing new in Bill's letter, we will not be responding to these attacks or otherwise be discussing the Pultes on this call, other than to say that we stand by the completeness and accuracy of our previous disclosures. We run this company for the benefit of all shareholders, and will continue to do so. I've had opportunity these past few weeks to speak with many of our largest holders, and it's encouraging to hear your support for our entire leadership team, our Board of Directors and our Value Creation strategy. I want to take this opportunity to ensure all investors that we are busy running this company and remain squarely focused on continuing to deliver value for you.
To that point, we are extremely pleased with the strength of our first quarter results. Consistent with our strategy and our efforts to enhance returns on invested capital, for the past few years, we have highlighted strategic pricing, construction productivity and balance sheet efficiency as drivers of our performance. Our financial results over the past few years reflect these drivers as we realized significant gains in pretax profitability despite only modest gains in production volumes.
Many of you have seen the graph in our investor presentation, which we included in today's conference call slides, which shows our pretax income improving by $1.1 billion over the past 5 years on just a 12% increase in closings. We have communicated that 2016 would be an inflection year with increasing volume being delivered to a much more efficient homebuilding operation. The combination of rising unit volumes, increasing average sales prices and a more efficient homebuilding machine can translate into significant earnings growth. Add in the benefit of consistently returning funds to shareholders, and you have a business that can produce high returns for its investors over time.
As Bob will detail in a moment, the business is beginning to turn in that direction with signups increased by 10% to almost 5,700 homes, closing volumes gaining 17% to almost 4,000 closings, average selling prices expanding by 9% to $353,000 and our backlog value climbing 31% to $3.4 billion. These metrics, obviously, resulted in the strong quarterly performance in the first quarter. But equally important, they position the company to deliver continued growth over the balance of 2016.
While our Q1 numbers and our expectations for 2016 point to increasing scale, we have not and will not lose our focus on our primary objective: to run a business that can deliver better returns over the housing cycle and do so with less risk. We have believed since the outset of this housing recovery that it would be more gradual than the V-shaped rebound typical of most housing cycles. Our thesis is unchanged as we expect an extended recovery will continue to unfold for the next several years supported by an improving economy, favorable demographics, years of relative underbuilding and a supportive mortgage rate environment.
Given these dynamics, we have been increasing our investment in the business but have done so in a disciplined manner by emphasizing smaller projects while expanding our use of options when possible. This has served to shorten our years of land supply, helping to mitigate market risk. We have also focused our land investments on closer-in locations where we think demand is more sustainable when the market ultimately takes a breather. We have accepted the trade-off of having to pay a little more for certain positions for where we can be more confident in their future performance.
As evidence of our focus on driving returns and reducing risk relative to prior business practices, consider that our supply of owned lots has fallen from approximately 8.5 years in 2010 to roughly 5.5 years in 2015. Based on our land acquisition discipline, expected sales paces, as we work through some of our longer and older communities, we look forward -- excuse me, we look for our own supply to continue trending lower in the future. Among the reasons for the decline is that approved land deals over the past 5 years have averaged roughly 125 controlled lots per community, and this includes 31 new Del Webb projects over that time frame that have averaged just over 500 controlled lots each.
Along with how we manage land, our more disciplined approach to the business extends to the management of the company's entire balance sheet. Bob and his team have done an outstanding job reshaping our balance sheet and giving us the financial strength to run our day-to-day operations and the flexibility to seize on opportunities that develop in the market. As I mentioned earlier, we remain in the camp that this housing recovery has several more years of growth in front of it. At just north of 500,000 new home sales, unit volumes remained 30% below the historic average. And with millennials beginning to buy homes, the leading edge of that demographic is now impacting the market. These factors, along with a growing economy, modest wage inflation and a favorable outlook for jobs, keeps us optimistic about the near- and long-term opportunities for PulteGroup.
Let me turn over the call to Bob for more details on our quarterly results. Bob?"

Consistent with Richard's comments regarding the positive market environment, our first quarter financial results show significant gains in key operating metrics. In addition to delivering strong results in the",1832,"Thanks, Richard, and good morning, everyone. Consistent with Richard's comments regarding the positive market environment, our first quarter financial results show significant gains in key operating metrics. In addition to delivering strong results in the quarter, our Q1 numbers have the company well positioned to deliver outstanding full year results as well.
Looking at the business, we experienced excellent demand in the first quarter with signups increasing 10% to 5,652 homes. The year-over-year increase in the dollar value of signups was even greater, climbing 24% to $2.1 billion.
Breaking down sales by buyer group, unit signups increased 2% among first-time buyers and 37% among move-up buyers, while sales decreased 12% with our active adult communities. The decrease among active adult buyers was due in part to the close-out of several selling efforts.
Looking at buyer groups, the absorption pace has increased 8% among first-time buyers and declined 4% and 5%, respectively, among move-up and active adult buyers. Excluding the impact of the Wieland assets, which typically had slower absorption paces and largely influenced our move-up buyer group, our overall absorption paces were flat.
During the quarter, home sale revenues totaled $1.4 billion, which is up 28% over last year. The significant increase in homebuilding revenues was driven by a 17% increase in closing to 3,945 homes combined with a 9% increase in average sales price to $353,000. The 17% increase in closings resulted from the increased sales activity we've experienced over the last few quarters, coupled with a slight increase in our conversion rate. Our Q1 conversion rate improved over last year but is still running below recent multiyear averages. We expect this pattern to continue in Q2 and throughout 2016 as we make gradual progress on conversion rates versus last year. However, elongated construction cycle times will present (sic) [ prevent ] us in the near term from reaching the levels we realized a few years ago.
Looking at the mix of our closings in the first quarter. 29% were first-time buyers, 41% were move-up buyers and 30% were active adult buyers. In Q1 of last year, closings by buyer group were 33% first-time, 34% move-up and 33% active adult.
As I noted, our ASP increased 9% in the first quarter, reflecting our continuing mix shift towards the move-up business, coupled with increases from all consumer groups, including an 8% increase to $252,000 for first-time buyers, a 7% increase to $425,000 for move-up buyers and a 5% increase to $353,000 for active adult buyers.
I would like to point out that in addition to the  increased selling prices we realized from our Q1 closings, we also realized notably higher sales prices from current sales that resulted in the ASP in our backlog being up 14% over the prior year. These pricing gains are primarily driven by the mix shift to move-up that I mentioned a moment ago, coupled with higher sales prices at Wieland communities.
Given our existing -- given our expectations for backlog conversion rates and the longer build times associated with the larger Wieland product, the higher-backlog ASPs will translate into higher closing prices on a gradual but sustained basis over the remaining quarters of 2016 and into 2017.
In the first quarter, we reported gross margins of 21.9%, which includes approximately 80 basis points of decrease associated with our acquisition of the Wieland assets. Excluding the impact of the Wieland transaction, margins were consistent with last year. It's worth noting that in addition to the impact of the Wieland purchase, our Q1 margins reflected anticipated higher land, labor and material costs, offset by lower interest charges.
Offsetting some of the cost pressure has been our continued success in systematically increasing the amount of option dollars and lot premiums, which provide richer margins we realize on each home. In the first quarter, option revenues per closing increased 6% or slightly more than $3,000 over the prior year while lot premiums increased by 4% or just under $600 per home.
Sales discounts in the quarter increased 40 basis points over last year to 2.6% per home, which is consistent with the results we've seen over the past several quarters. 
I'd like to take a couple of minutes to address some questions we've gotten over the past few quarters related to our gross margins. Specifically, over time, we've been asked about the influence on our gross margins of longer-dated assets that had basis adjustments during the downturn in the market. In response to this, you may recall that we provided an analysis of our Del Webb assets and related margins, which was included on Slide 11 in our webcast deck, that provided comparisons of our older, much larger legacy Del Webb communities to our smaller, newer positions. As you can see on that slide, we enjoy strong margins on that entire book of business with the more recent investments also enjoying strong returns.
Based on continuing questions from investors around our entire land position, we prepared some additional analysis, which is included in Slide 12 of the deck. That slide provides details comparing the margins and income statement impacts of our newer and never-impaired land with that of our land that was either impaired by us or adjusted through the fair value process as part of the Centex  acquisition.
Looking at the slide, there are a few things I would like to highlight. First, if you look at the bottom row of the chart, you will see that the legacy lots were actually detrimental to our margins in 2011 through 2013. This was due to the fact that our impairment and fair value processes typically resulted in gross margins in the low teens. It was only after the benefit of several years of ASP growth that closings on those lots represent a slight benefit to our performance.
As with any legacy lot, the margin profile improves over time, assuming new [ph] home selling prices are increasing even modestly each year. 
Second, if you look at the second row of the chart, you will see that the legacy lots are decreasing as a percentage of our overall closings. In fact, closings on legacy lots represented 72% of our total closings in 2011, but it falls to 38% in 2015 and will drop even further in 2016 and the years beyond.
And finally, I would highlight the margins on our unimpaired land purchases remain almost as high as our legacy positions, reflecting the benefits of the investment discipline we instituted as part of Value Creation.
Given the margin profile of our total land portfolio and our ongoing Value Creation initiatives, we continue to target gross margins in the range of 21.5% to 22% for the full year.
Moving past gross margins, our SG&A in the first quarter was $191 million or 13.7% of home sale revenues compared with $161 million last year or 14.8% of home sale revenues. The increase in our total land -- the increase in our total spend was due primarily to the hiring of additional field resources to manage a 41% increase in the number of homes we have under production, plus approximately $4 million of charges associated with the Wieland acquisition. Given that Q1 is the seasonal low point for our deliveries, SG&A spend will certainly decrease as a percentage of revenues over the course of the year, but we also expect the dollar spend will gradually trend lower in subsequent quarters. As such, we expect full year SG&A spend of approximately $730 million or approximately 10% of home sale revenues.
Turning to financial services. First quarter pretax reported income was $10 million, which compares with $5 million last year. The increase was due primarily to the higher closing volumes generated through our homebuilding operations. Our capture rate for the period was 81% compared with 82% last year.
Looking at our income taxes. Our first quarter expense of $35 million represents an effective tax rate of 29.5%, which was below our guidance of 38%. During the quarter the company realized approximately $10 million of net favorable adjustments relating to the settlement of certain state tax matters. Going forward, we expect our normalized rate for the remaining quarters in 2016 to be consistent with our previous guidance of 38%.
Finishing up on the income statement, our Q1 net income was $83 million or $0.24 per share compared with the prior year net income of $55 million or $0.15 per share. $83 million is our highest reported first quarter net income in a decade, providing further confirmation that we've gotten off to a very good start for the year.
Looking at our controlled lot position. We approved approximately 7,000 lots for purchase in the first quarter, which represents an average of roughly 160 lots per community approved. We continue to focus on smaller, faster-turning communities. However, given that most of the land positions we're putting under control are raw, we still estimate it will take 12 to 18 months before a community will typically come online. At quarter-end, we had approximately 146,000 lots under control, of which 30% were controlled via option.
During the quarter, we spent $262 million on land acquisition, which does not include our purchase of the Wieland assets. Based on our Q1 land acquisition spend, we're on track with our prior guidance of investing approximately $1.2 billion, excluding Wieland, for land acquisition in 2016. This estimate assumes we can continue to identify projects that meet our disciplined underwriting guidelines and return thresholds.
Consistent with our Value Creation priorities, we continue to return funds to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. After curtailing stock repurchases in Q4 2015 because of activities surrounding the Wieland transaction, we reinstated our buyback programs and look to be a consistent and systematic participant in the market for our shares. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.1 million shares for $50 million or $16.36 per share. 
We ended the quarter with $1 billion of cash, which includes funds raised through our February senior note offering. We plan to use approximately $465 million of our cash to retire bonds, which will mature in May of this year. 
Our debt-to-total capital ratio at quarter-end was 39% compared with 30% at the end of 2015. On a proforma basis, adjusting for the month -- the May bond repayment, our debt-to-capital ratio drops to 35%.
For the quarter, we operated from 709 communities, which is up 16% from the same period last year. The increase is higher than our guidance range of 8% to 10% but reflects the slower close-out rate for existing communities as opposed to an acceleration of new store openings. As such, we expect the year-over-year change in community count will come back in line with our previous guidance as we move through the year.
And finally, our quarter-end backlog of 8,755 homes is valued at $3.4 billion, which represent increases of 15% and 31%, respectively, over the prior year.
Now let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall for some additional comments."

As both Richard and Bob have mentioned this morning, our financial results demonstrate that 2016 is shaping up to be an inflection point for the company. Reflective of actions we have taken over the past several years, we've transitioned the business to deliver more growth but without introducing excess risk. For the past 5-plus years, we've been methodically altering our risk profile by selling off unproductive land parcels and moving through long-lived assets that have been a drag on the balance sheet. Over the same period, we've reinvested in shorter duration, high-margin communities that have generated high returns and driven the financial gains of the past few years.
Having been in the field for over a decade and now part of the senior leadership team for the past few years, I fully appreciate the change we've undergone in pursuing the Value Creation strategy and the benefits we've captured. As we transition to responsible growth, my focus is on ensuring we capture additional operating efficiencies while continuing our disciplined investment process. This means delivering more volume in a profitable, responsible and risk-adjusted way and avoiding the trap of chasing growth for growth's sake.
During my field visits, I have and will continue to drive home the point that we are running a business designed to deliver through-cycle returns, and this demands efficiently growing pretax income while intelligently investing in the business.
Now looking at our homebuilding operations, we had 7,909 homes under construction at the end of the quarter, of which 27% were spec. Consistent with our previous guidance, we purposely increased spec production heading into the spring selling season to help manage and smooth our overall production cadence. With spec sales tracking to plan and finished specs continuing to average well below 1 per community, we are right where we wanted to be during this busy time of the spring selling season. After several months of strong spec starts, and now having a large and growing backlog of sold homes, we have already started reducing the number of specs we've put into production.
Looking at demand conditions for the quarter, we are very pleased with activity in the marketplace these past few months. As you might expect, with a 10% increase in signups for the period, we generally saw positive traffic and demand conditions across the country during the quarter, and I would add that this trend has continued into the first few weeks of April.
In summary, the feedback I've received from our operators during my recent market visits is consistent with what we see in the data. The selling season has gotten off to a very good start. 
Taking us down to a regional level, on the East Coast, overall demand was solid in the quarter and got better as you move from North to South. Consistent with the trend over the last several quarters, we continue to see stronger demand in the Carolinas, Georgia and Florida. We are excited about the long-term opportunities we see in the South, particularly in the Southeast given the migration trends, buyer preferences and land availability. It is one of the reasons why we were interested in the Wieland assets.
Looking at the middle third of the country, we saw broad-based improvement in demand through the Midwest with signups climbing over 30% for the quarter. Winter weather conditions were a little easier at the start of this year compared with 2015, but we are optimistic that the higher signups for the quarter reflect a more fundamental improvement in demand. 
Dropping down into Texas on a year-over-year basis, signups were essentially flat as exceptional strength in Dallas was offset by softer demand in Houston and San Antonio. Houston demand improved as we moved through the quarter, and the market has performed better than I think many were expecting.
And finally, looking out to our Western markets, we continue to experience good demand, particularly in some of our bigger markets including Northern California, Phoenix and Las Vegas. We had some new communities open in Las Vegas, and it was great to see the market responding favorably to these new locations.
Given the differences in market dynamics that can exist at the local level, it can be tough to generalize, but we would say that demand continues to improve and the communities located closer to city center fare better in terms of sales, prices and paces. The inventory of homes available for sale remains tight in most of our markets and, at least on the new home side, will likely remain that way for a while given the limited supply of finished lots available. 
I have already met some of you at conferences earlier this year, and I look forward to meeting more of you as the year progresses.

I believe you said that community count was better than expected due to lower close-out rates during the quarter, but you expect 2Q to get back to original guidance. I just want to make sure I'm thinking about that right, that the original was for the first half community count to be up 8% to 10% versus for 4Q-end and also from a absorption standpoint roughly flat year-over-year. And I believe you had expected Wieland to maybe have a little bit of a negative impact and a slight overall decline in absorption. If being flat versus that original slight decline was also related to the slower close-out of the older communities, then could we expect that original expectation to reassert itself in the second quarter as well?"

As to absorption paces, we did say coming into the year that Wieland would likely have an impact on our absorption paces because it moves a little bit slower than our traditional Pulte business. And in fact, that's what we saw. So we highlighted that you had an 8% increase in first-time and 4% and 5% decreases in move-up and active adult. And if you take Wieland out, and that's a net 5% down, 8.4% to 8.0% in terms of absorption paces. If you take Wieland out, we go up to 8.4%. So essentially, we're flat ex the Wieland business."

We had given quarterly estimates on that and it was 100 in the first quarter, 70 in the second, 50 in the third and fourth. And we were a little bit less impactful in the first quarter. It was only 80 basis points. But we think through the year that it's still about 70 basis points. So coming into it, we said, look, we've got higher land and labor construction costs, and that will be offset by interest increases. That's exactly what we saw in the first quarter. I think you can expect to continue to see that through the balance of 2016, again within that annual range of 21.5% to 22%. Obviously, the financing we did here in the first quarter took our leverage up, took our interest spend up. So for the first time in a long time, our cash spend is a little bit higher than our interest expense. That won't influence 2016. We'll have some influence on '17 and beyond. I guess the only thing I'd point out to that end is paying down the debt that we'll do in the second quarter, there's a net add of about $500 million year-over-year at roughly 5%, 5.5%.

Some of you may have seen the letter issued yesterday by Bill Pulte over his grandson's performance on CNBC yesterday. As there is nothing new in Bill's letter, we will not be responding to these attacks or otherwi",893,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Some of you may have seen the letter issued yesterday by Bill Pulte over his grandson's performance on CNBC yesterday. As there is nothing new in Bill's letter, we will not be responding to these attacks or otherwise be discussing the Pultes on this call, other than to say that we stand by the completeness and accuracy of our previous disclosures. We run this company for the benefit of all shareholders, and will continue to do so. I've had opportunity these past few weeks to speak with many of our largest holders, and it's encouraging to hear your support for our entire leadership team, our Board of Directors and our Value Creation strategy. I want to take this opportunity to ensure all investors that we are busy running this company and remain squarely focused on continuing to deliver value for you.
To that point, we are extremely pleased with the strength of our first quarter results. Consistent with our strategy and our efforts to enhance returns on invested capital, for the past few years, we have highlighted strategic pricing, construction productivity and balance sheet efficiency as drivers of our performance. Our financial results over the past few years reflect these drivers as we realized significant gains in pretax profitability despite only modest gains in production volumes.
Many of you have seen the graph in our investor presentation, which we included in today's conference call slides, which shows our pretax income improving by $1.1 billion over the past 5 years on just a 12% increase in closings. We have communicated that 2016 would be an inflection year with increasing volume being delivered to a much more efficient homebuilding operation. The combination of rising unit volumes, increasing average sales prices and a more efficient homebuilding machine can translate into significant earnings growth. Add in the benefit of consistently returning funds to shareholders, and you have a business that can produce high returns for its investors over time.
As Bob will detail in a moment, the business is beginning to turn in that direction with signups increased by 10% to almost 5,700 homes, closing volumes gaining 17% to almost 4,000 closings, average selling prices expanding by 9% to $353,000 and our backlog value climbing 31% to $3.4 billion. These metrics, obviously, resulted in the strong quarterly performance in the first quarter. But equally important, they position the company to deliver continued growth over the balance of 2016.
While our Q1 numbers and our expectations for 2016 point to increasing scale, we have not and will not lose our focus on our primary objective: to run a business that can deliver better returns over the housing cycle and do so with less risk. We have believed since the outset of this housing recovery that it would be more gradual than the V-shaped rebound typical of most housing cycles. Our thesis is unchanged as we expect an extended recovery will continue to unfold for the next several years supported by an improving economy, favorable demographics, years of relative underbuilding and a supportive mortgage rate environment.
Given these dynamics, we have been increasing our investment in the business but have done so in a disciplined manner by emphasizing smaller projects while expanding our use of options when possible. This has served to shorten our years of land supply, helping to mitigate market risk. We have also focused our land investments on closer-in locations where we think demand is more sustainable when the market ultimately takes a breather. We have accepted the trade-off of having to pay a little more for certain positions for where we can be more confident in their future performance.
As evidence of our focus on driving returns and reducing risk relative to prior business practices, consider that our supply of owned lots has fallen from approximately 8.5 years in 2010 to roughly 5.5 years in 2015. Based on our land acquisition discipline, expected sales paces, as we work through some of our longer and older communities, we look forward -- excuse me, we look for our own supply to continue trending lower in the future. Among the reasons for the decline is that approved land deals over the past 5 years have averaged roughly 125 controlled lots per community, and this includes 31 new Del Webb projects over that time frame that have averaged just over 500 controlled lots each.
Along with how we manage land, our more disciplined approach to the business extends to the management of the company's entire balance sheet. Bob and his team have done an outstanding job reshaping our balance sheet and giving us the financial strength to run our day-to-day operations and the flexibility to seize on opportunities that develop in the market. As I mentioned earlier, we remain in the camp that this housing recovery has several more years of growth in front of it. At just north of 500,000 new home sales, unit volumes remained 30% below the historic average. And with millennials beginning to buy homes, the leading edge of that demographic is now impacting the market. These factors, along with a growing economy, modest wage inflation and a favorable outlook for jobs, keeps us optimistic about the near- and long-term opportunities for PulteGroup.

Consistent with Richard's comments regarding the positive market environment, our first quarter financial results show significant gains in key operating metrics. In addition to delivering strong results in the",1833,"Thanks, Richard, and good morning, everyone. Consistent with Richard's comments regarding the positive market environment, our first quarter financial results show significant gains in key operating metrics. In addition to delivering strong results in the quarter, our Q1 numbers have the company well positioned to deliver outstanding full year results as well.
Looking at the business, we experienced excellent demand in the first quarter with signups increasing 10% to 5,652 homes. The year-over-year increase in the dollar value of signups was even greater, climbing 24% to $2.1 billion.
Breaking down sales by buyer group, unit signups increased 2% among first-time buyers and 37% among move-up buyers, while sales decreased 12% with our active adult communities. The decrease among active adult buyers was due in part to the close-out of several selling efforts.
Looking at buyer groups, the absorption pace has increased 8% among first-time buyers and declined 4% and 5%, respectively, among move-up and active adult buyers. Excluding the impact of the Wieland assets, which typically had slower absorption paces and largely influenced our move-up buyer group, our overall absorption paces were flat.
During the quarter, home sale revenues totaled $1.4 billion, which is up 28% over last year. The significant increase in homebuilding revenues was driven by a 17% increase in closing to 3,945 homes combined with a 9% increase in average sales price to $353,000. The 17% increase in closings resulted from the increased sales activity we've experienced over the last few quarters, coupled with a slight increase in our conversion rate. Our Q1 conversion rate improved over last year but is still running below recent multiyear averages. We expect this pattern to continue in Q2 and throughout 2016 as we make gradual progress on conversion rates versus last year. However, elongated construction cycle times will present (sic) [ prevent ] us in the near term from reaching the levels we realized a few years ago.
Looking at the mix of our closings in the first quarter. 29% were first-time buyers, 41% were move-up buyers and 30% were active adult buyers. In Q1 of last year, closings by buyer group were 33% first-time, 34% move-up and 33% active adult.
As I noted, our ASP increased 9% in the first quarter, reflecting our continuing mix shift towards the move-up business, coupled with increases from all consumer groups, including an 8% increase to $252,000 for first-time buyers, a 7% increase to $425,000 for move-up buyers and a 5% increase to $353,000 for active adult buyers.
I would like to point out that in addition to the increased selling prices we realized from our Q1 closings, we also realized notably higher sales prices from current sales that resulted in the ASP in our backlog being up 14% over the prior year. These pricing gains are primarily driven by the mix shift to move-up that I mentioned a moment ago, coupled with higher sales prices at Wieland communities.
Given our existing -- given our expectations for backlog conversion rates and the longer build times associated with the larger Wieland product, the higher-backlog ASPs will translate into higher closing prices on a gradual but sustained basis over the remaining quarters of 2016 and into 2017.
In the first quarter, we reported gross margins of 21.9%, which includes approximately 80 basis points of decrease associated with our acquisition of the Wieland assets. Excluding the impact of the Wieland transaction, margins were consistent with last year. It's worth noting that in addition to the impact of the Wieland purchase, our Q1 margins reflected anticipated higher land, labor and material costs, offset by lower interest charges.
Offsetting some of the cost pressure has been our continued success in systematically increasing the amount of option dollars and lot premiums, which provide richer margins we realize on each home. In the first quarter, option revenues per closing increased 6% or slightly more than $3,000 over the prior year while lot premiums increased by 4% or just under $600 per home.
Sales discounts in the quarter increased 40 basis points over last year to 2.6% per home, which is consistent with the results we've seen over the past several quarters. 
I'd like to take a couple of minutes to address some questions we've gotten over the past few quarters related to our gross margins. Specifically, over time, we've been asked about the influence on our gross margins of longer-dated assets that had basis adjustments during the downturn in the market. In response to this, you may recall that we provided an analysis of our Del Webb assets and related margins, which was included on Slide 11 in our webcast deck, that provided comparisons of our older, much larger legacy Del Webb communities to our smaller, newer positions. As you can see on that slide, we enjoy strong margins on that entire book of business with the more recent investments also enjoying strong returns.
Based on continuing questions from investors around our entire land position, we prepared some additional analysis, which is included in Slide 12 of the deck. That slide provides details comparing the margins and income statement impacts of our newer and never-impaired land with that of our land that was either impaired by us or adjusted through the fair value process as part of the Centex acquisition.
Looking at the slide, there are a few things I would like to highlight. First, if you look at the bottom row of the chart, you will see that the legacy lots were actually detrimental to our margins in 2011 through 2013. This was due to the fact that our impairment and fair value processes typically resulted in gross margins in the low teens. It was only after the benefit of several years of ASP growth that closings on those lots represent a slight benefit to our performance.
As with any legacy lot, the margin profile improves over time, assuming new [ph] home selling prices are increasing even modestly each year. 
Second, if you look at the second row of the chart, you will see that the legacy lots are decreasing as a percentage of our overall closings. In fact, closings on legacy lots represented 72% of our total closings in 2011, but it falls to 38% in 2015 and will drop even further in 2016 and the years beyond.
And finally, I would highlight the margins on our unimpaired land purchases remain almost as high as our legacy positions, reflecting the benefits of the investment discipline we instituted as part of Value Creation.
Given the margin profile of our total land portfolio and our ongoing Value Creation initiatives, we continue to target gross margins in the range of 21.5% to 22% for the full year.
Moving past gross margins, our SG&A in the first quarter was $191 million or 13.7% of home sale revenues compared with $161 million last year or 14.8% of home sale revenues. The increase in our total land -- the increase in our total spend was due primarily to the hiring of additional field resources to manage a 41% increase in the number of homes we have under production, plus approximately $4 million of charges associated with the Wieland acquisition. Given that Q1 is the seasonal low point for our deliveries, SG&A spend will certainly decrease as a percentage of revenues over the course of the year, but we also expect the dollar spend will gradually trend lower in subsequent quarters. As such, we expect full year SG&A spend of approximately $730 million or approximately 10% of home sale revenues.
Turning to financial services. First quarter pretax reported income was $10 million, which compares with $5 million last year. The increase was due primarily to the higher closing volumes generated through our homebuilding operations. Our capture rate for the period was 81% compared with 82% last year.
Looking at our income taxes. Our first quarter expense of $35 million represents an effective tax rate of 29.5%, which was below our guidance of 38%. During the quarter the company realized approximately $10 million of net favorable adjustments relating to the settlement of certain state tax matters. Going forward, we expect our normalized rate for the remaining quarters in 2016 to be consistent with our previous guidance of 38%.
Finishing up on the income statement, our Q1 net income was $83 million or $0.24 per share compared with the prior year net income of $55 million or $0.15 per share. $83 million is our highest reported first quarter net income in a decade, providing further confirmation that we've gotten off to a very good start for the year.
Looking at our controlled lot position. We approved approximately 7,000 lots for purchase in the first quarter, which represents an average of roughly 160 lots per community approved. We continue to focus on smaller, faster-turning communities. However, given that most of the land positions we're putting under control are raw, we still estimate it will take 12 to 18 months before a community will typically come online. At quarter-end, we had approximately 146,000 lots under control, of which 30% were controlled via option.
During the quarter, we spent $262 million on land acquisition, which does not include our purchase of the Wieland assets. Based on our Q1 land acquisition spend, we're on track with our prior guidance of investing approximately $1.2 billion, excluding Wieland, for land acquisition in 2016. This estimate assumes we can continue to identify projects that meet our disciplined underwriting guidelines and return thresholds.
Consistent with our Value Creation priorities, we continue to return funds to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. After curtailing stock repurchases in Q4 2015 because of activities surrounding the Wieland transaction, we reinstated our buyback programs and look to be a consistent and systematic participant in the market for our shares. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.1 million shares for $50 million or $16.36 per share. 
We ended the quarter with $1 billion of cash, which includes funds raised through our February senior note offering. We plan to use approximately $465 million of our cash to retire bonds, which will mature in May of this year. 
Our debt-to-total capital ratio at quarter-end was 39% compared with 30% at the end of 2015. On a pro forma basis, adjusting for the month -- the May bond repayment, our debt-to-capital ratio drops to 35%.
For the quarter, we operated from 709 communities, which is up 16% from the same period last year. The increase is higher than our guidance range of 8% to 10% but reflects the slower close-out rate for existing communities as opposed to an acceleration of new store openings. As such, we expect the year-over-year change in community count will come back in line with our previous guidance as we move through the year.
And finally, our quarter-end backlog of 8,755 homes is valued at $3.4 billion, which represent increases of 15% and 31%, respectively, over the prior year.
Now let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall for some additional comments."

As both Richard and Bob have mentioned this morning, our financial results demonstrate that 2016 is shaping up to be an inflection point for the company. Reflective of actions we have taken over the past several years, we've transitioned the business to deliver more growth but without introducing excess risk. For the past 5-plus years, we've been methodically altering our risk profile by selling off unproductive land parcels and moving through long-lived assets that have been a drag on the balance sheet. Over the same period, we've reinvested in shorter duration, high-margin communities that have generated high returns and driven the financial gains of the past few years.
Having been in the field for over a decade and now part of the senior leadership team for the past few years, I fully appreciate the change we've undergone in pursuing the Value Creation strategy and the benefits we've captured. As we transition to responsible growth, my focus is on ensuring we capture additional operating efficiencies while continuing our disciplined investment process. This means delivering more volume in a profitable, responsible and risk-adjusted way and avoiding the trap of chasing growth for growth's sake.
During my field visits, I have and will continue to drive home the point that we are running a business designed to deliver through-cycle returns, and this demands efficiently growing pretax income while intelligently investing in the business.
Now looking at our homebuilding operations, we had 7,909 homes under construction at the end of the quarter, of which 27% were spec. Consistent with our previous guidance, we purposely increased spec production heading into the spring selling season to help manage and smooth our overall production cadence. With spec sales tracking to plan and finished specs continuing to average well below 1 per community, we are right where we wanted to be during this busy time of the spring selling season. After several months of strong spec starts, and now having a large and growing backlog of sold homes, we have already started reducing the number of specs we've put into production.
Looking at demand conditions for the quarter, we are very pleased with activity in the marketplace these past few months. As you might expect, with a 10% increase in signups for the period, we generally saw positive traffic and demand conditions across the country during the quarter, and I would add that this trend has continued into the first few weeks of April.
In summary, the feedback I've received from our operators during my recent market visits is consistent with what we see in the data. The selling season has gotten off to a very good start. 
Taking us down to a regional level, on the East Coast, overall demand was solid in the quarter and got better as you move from North to South. Consistent with the trend over the last several quarters, we continue to see stronger demand in the Carolinas, Georgia and Florida. We are excited about the long-term opportunities we see in the South, particularly in the Southeast given the migration trends, buyer preferences and land availability. It is one of the reasons why we were interested in the Wieland assets.
Looking at the middle third of the country, we saw broad-based improvement in demand through the Midwest with signups climbing over 30% for the quarter. Winter weather conditions were a little easier at the start of this year compared with 2015, but we are optimistic that the higher signups for the quarter reflect a more fundamental improvement in demand. 
Dropping down into Texas on a year-over-year basis, signups were essentially flat as exceptional strength in Dallas was offset by softer demand in Houston and San Antonio. Houston demand improved as we moved through the quarter, and the market has performed better than I think many were expecting.
And finally, looking out to our Western markets, we continue to experience good demand, particularly in some of our bigger markets including Northern California, Phoenix and Las Vegas. We had some new communities open in Las Vegas, and it was great to see the market responding favorably to these new locations.
Given the differences in market dynamics that can exist at the local level, it can be tough to generalize, but we would say that demand continues to improve and the communities located closer to city center fare better in terms of sales, prices and paces. The inventory of homes available for sale remains tight in most of our markets and, at least on the new home side, will likely remain that way for a while given the limited supply of finished lots available. 
I have already met some of you at conferences earlier this year, and I look forward to meeting more of you as the year progresses.

As to absorption paces, we did say coming into the year that Wieland would likely have an impact on our absorption paces because it moves a little bit slower than our traditional Pulte business. And in fact, that's what we saw. So we highlighted that you had an 8% increase in first-time and 4% and 5% decreases in move-up and active adult. And if you take Wieland out, and that's a net 5% down, 8.4% to 8.0% in terms of absorption paces. If you take Wieland out, we go up to 8.4%. So essentially, we're flat ex the Wieland business."

So coming into it, we said, look, we've got higher land and labor construction costs, and that will be offset by interest increases. That's exactly what we saw in the first quarter. I think you can expect to continue to see that through the balance of 2016, again within that annual range of 21.5% to 22%. Obviously, the financing we did here in the first quarter took our leverage up, took our interest spend up. So for the first time in a long time, our cash spend is a little bit higher than our interest expense. That won't influence 2016. We'll have some influence on '17 and beyond. I guess the only thing I'd point out to that end is paying down the debt that we'll do in the second quarter, there's a net add of about $500 million year-over-year at roughly 5%, 5.5%.

We've got a lot of infill opportunities and infill communities that we've invested in, and we're seeing excellent demand that is being driven by what's been a strong labor market as well as a very tight supply. So we're obviously watching some of the things that are going on in the technology sector, but we've stayed away from some of the outer locations.

Over the 5-plus years, we've been operating on our Value Creation strategy, the company has moved to several different stages as our operating financial results progress. When we started back in 2011, our initial",812,"Thank you Jim, and good morning, everyone. Over the 5-plus years, we've been operating on our Value Creation strategy, the company has moved to several different stages as our operating financial results progress. When we started back in 2011, our initial focus is on fixing our fundamental business performance, along with strengthening our balance sheet and enhancing overall returns on in the invested capital. Having made significant progress towards achieving these initial operating and financial objectives, in 2013, we are in a position to begin materially increasing investment in the business.
Our land acquisition spend on an annual basis, the last few years doubled from $600 million or 11% of revenue in 2013 to $1.2 billion or 21% of revenue in 2015. While the dollars grew, our underlying discipline has not wavered. We have continued to invest in higher returning, shorter duration projects that are closer to city centers, allowing the company to maintain higher margins and returns through this timeframe.
As we have talked about on recent calls, 2016 is the year this increased investment begins to pay off, as we have now reached an inflection point toward higher growth in the business.
The earnings release we issued this morning demonstrates this point as our second quarter results show another quarter of strong year-over-year growth across a variety of important business metrics, including sign-ups, which increased 11% in units and 21% in value; closings which increased by 21%; revenues which increased 41% to $1.8 billion; earnings per share, which gained 21% on a reported basis and was significantly higher when you adjust for the charges and benefits in their respective reporting periods; and with our backlog value of 21% to $3.7 billion, our highest since 2007, we are in an excellent position to realize further growth over the remainder of 2016.
It is clear that after 3 years of increased investment in the business, we are driving meaningful growth across the operations. While our increased land investments should bring growth for several years to come, we have not forgotten that home building is a cyclical business, which is why we are already planning for the future.
Value Creation was designed over 5 years ago to help maximize shareholder value through an entire housing cycle. With this in mind, in addition to announcing our strong second quarter financial results, this morning's earnings release highlighted additional actions we are now taking as we move through the housing cycle.
After 4 years during which our investment in new land grew significantly, we plan to slow the rate of growth in our new investment in 2017 and beyond. With 143,000 lots currently under control, we maintain a very strong land pipeline in which to operate over the next few years.
Our stated capital allocation priorities of first investing in high returning land and then returning excess funds to shareholders have not changed. As such, given a moderated level of land spend in future years, we expect to have sufficient liquidity to allow us to increase our share repurchase activities. 
As stated in the release, our board has approved an incremental $1 billion share repurchase authorization, bringing our total authorization to $1.5 billion.
As also stated, we expect to utilize that authority over the next 18 months through repurchases of $250 million in each of the third and fourth quarters of 2016 and an additional $1 billion in 2017.
Along with looking to create value through our allocation of capital over time, we are also taking action to create value through maximizing efficiencies within our operations. Over the past several years, we have worked extremely hard to raise our operating margin from the bottom quartile of the homebuilding peers to among the industry leaders.
We want to maintain and as possible, enhance, our relative position. To help realize this objective, we plan to lower our SG&A spend from an estimated 10% of revenues in 2016 to 9% of revenues or lower in 2017.
While we expect to realize a portion of this leverage benefit from increased revenues, we are also working to take unnecessary overhead out of the business. The fact is that after 5 years, many of our core homebuilding disciplines put in place at the outset of Value Creation are now part of the company standard operating practices and are embedded in our muscle memory.
As such, there are opportunities to remove some of these costs.
As I wrap up my initial comments, let me say that I'm very proud of the excellent second quarter results and pleased with how well we are positioned for the future. Furthermore, I believe the additional actions we are not announcing today with regard to future capital allocation and overheads will help ensure we continue building value for shareholders going forward. 
Now let me turn over the call to Bob for a detailed review of the quarter. Bob?"
294550,369102378,1009141,"PulteGroup, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","PulteGroup, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Richard, and good morning. Building on our strong Q1 results, PulteGroup second quarter financials are highlighted by significant growth and performance gains in the business.Looking at the second quarter's homebuilding operations, home sale rev",1548,"Thanks, Richard, and good morning. Building on our strong Q1 results, PulteGroup second quarter financials are highlighted by significant growth and performance gains in the business.
Looking at the second quarter's homebuilding operations, home sale revenues were at $1.8 billion, which represents an increase of 41% over last year. The significant increase in revenues is driven by a 27% increase in closings, the 4,772 homes, combined with an 11% or $35,000 increase in average selling price to $367,000.
The 27% increase in closings was due to the strong orders we have reported in recent quarters, coupled with our previously discussed actions to put additional homes into production at the end of last year and the beginning of this year. As a result, our conversion rate for the quarter was 55%, which is up roughly 600 basis points over last year.
I'd like to point out that although our conversion rate improved on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter, tight labor resources, elongated build cycles and development and permitting delays remain meaningful challenges across many markets. As such, we continue to target conversion rate improvement versus last year, but don't expect we will return to the rates several years ago in the short-term.
As a result, we currently project the conversion rate of between 51% and 54% in the third quarter this year.  This compares to the 48% conversion rate in Q3 of last year.
The 11% increase in average selling price for the quarter reflect the ongoing shift in the midst of our business product towards our move up product.
In addition to the shift in our mix, we also realized higher prices in each buyer group, including a 5% increase among first-time buyers to $270,000 and 11% increase of the price up move-up homes to $438,000 and a 4% increase in the average price of homes among our active adult buyers, $357,000.
During the quarter, closing percentage by buyer group were as follows: 29% first-time; 44% move-up; and 27% active adult. In Q2 of last year, closings by buyer group were 34% first-time; 35%, move-up; and 31% active adult.
Given that our backlog ASP of $387,000 is up 13% over last year, and up 5% from Q2 deliveries, we expect ASPs will continually to move gradually higher over the coming quarters.
Our second quarter gross margin of 21.5%, which includes approximately 70 basis points of drag associated with our first quarter acquisition of the Wieland assets, was in line with previous guidance.
Adjusting for the impact of the Wieland closings, gross margins were down approximately 110 basis points from last year, primarily as a result of mix, buyer land and labor costs.
The company remains on track to deliver full year margins of approximately 21.5%, and we expect margins over the remaining 2 quarters to be in the range of 21.2% to 21.7%, which is down slightly from prior guidance of 21.5% to 22%.
Based on our current backlog, we see higher labor and material cost continuing to put slight pressure on margins.
Offsetting some of the margin pressure, we continue to have success with our strategic pricing programs. In Q2, our total option revenues and lot premiums increased 5% over last year to approximately $67,000 per closing.
In addition, sales discounts totaled 2.7%, which is up about 50 basis points from last year, but consistent with our first quarter of this year's results.
Second quarter SG&A was $192 million or 11% of home sale revenues. Prior year SG&A spend of $130 million or 10.5% of revenues, included a $27 million benefit, where approximately 210 basis points resulting from a legal settlement.
Increased SG&A spend in the quarter reflects ongoing growth in support of the company's 26% increase in units underproduction, combined with cost associated with higher health care insurance and professional fees incurred in the period.
Although the asset dollar spend is higher than forecasted, we still expect full year SG&A will be approximately 10% of revenues, allowing PulteGroup to maintaining its operating margin among the industry leaders.
At 10% of revenue, SG&A expenses are certainly within historical ranges, but as Richard discussed, we believe there are opportunities to drive greater overhead leverage. Based on our current targets, we expect to drive SG&A spend lower by at least 100 [ph] basis points in 2017 to 9% or lower of home sale revenues.
Continuing down the income statement, we reported other expenses net of $13 million. This includes approximately $7 million of deposits and other pre-acquisition charges associated with the termination of several pending land transactions as well as the final $7 million of costs associated with the relocation of our corporate office.
Turning to financial services, we reported pretax income of $17 million, which is up from $10 million last year. These results benefited from the higher closing volumes in our homebuilding operations as well as the favorable interest rate environment given the declining rates experienced during the quarter.
Our mortgage capture rate for the period was 81%, down from 83% in the second quarter of 2015.
Consistent with guidance, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 38%, building [ph] Q2 net income of $118 million or $0.34 per share. EPS for the quarter was calculated on approximately 348 million shares, which is down 4% from last year, resulting largely from share repurchase activities.
Moving to income statement homebuilding operations, we had 8,687 homes under construction at the end of the second quarter, of which 23% were SPEC [ph] . Consistent with our Q1 comments, after increasing the SPEC home production at the back half of '15 and into the first quarter of 2016, that helped ensure more consistent construction work cadence, we have slowed somewhat as we build the backlog from the selling season.
With an average of less than 1 finished spec [ph] per community, we remain in a very favorable inventory position.
In the second quarter, we approved approximately 5,800 lots for purchase shares and ended the period with 143,000 lots under control.
Consistent with recent quarters, about total that position is controlled through options as we work to manage our land risk and drive higher returns on invested capital.  On our controlled lots, approximately 25% are developed. 
During the quarter, we spent $370 million -- $379 [ph] million on land acquisition and generally remain on track with 2016 plans to invest approximately $1.6  billion, including the purchase of the Wieland assets in new land positions. Consistent with Richards comments and after several years of significant growth, we expect the rate of our growth of our land acquisition spend to slow as we head into 2017.
Recognizing that the current housing cycle is maturing, we are decreasing our land investment as a percentage of revenues and could ultimately reduce to asset dollars was spent debating assessment of economic condition and their potential impact on the housing industry here in the U.S.
Looking at share repurchase activities during the quarter, we repurchased 2.6 million shares for $48 million or $18.51 per share.  This brings our total repurchase activity for the first half of the year to $98 million.
Expanding on Richard's earlier comments about capital allocation, we've invested significantly in land-related development over the last few years, and we expect those investments of dry volume growth and strong cash flows for the next few years.
We've also indicated that the growth in our investment is expected to moderate going forward. As a result, we feel we are well-positioned to increase the return of funds per shareholders, consistent with our stated capital allocation priorities expenditure buyback program which are outlined.
We expect to take on a certain amount of incremental debt and connection with the outlined share repurchase activity, but we expect to be able to maintaining a responsible and certainly very manageable debt to cap level throughout this process. As a reminder, our target debt to cap range remains unchanged at 30% to 40%. While we may have leverage rates outside this range at points in time but we continue to believe our targeted range is appropriate and we'll strive to operate in that range over the long-term.
I'll just provide a couple more data points before turning over the call. 
Sign ups [ph] for the second quarter were 5,697, which represents an increase of 11% over the prior year. On a dollar basis, sign ups increased to even greater 21%, $2.1 billion.
Sign ups by buyer group breakdown as follows: first time increased 12%; move-up increased 21%; and active adult declined 3%. Adjusted for changes in community counts, absorption phases increased to 23% and 5% for first-time and active adult buyers, respectively, but were lower by 8% among move-up buyers. As we've talked about on our prior call, given the higher price points among Wieland Communities, absorption paces are slower than traditional communities, which impacted the move up buyer results.
During the second quarter, we operated for 700 communities, which is up 11% over last year. The 11% increase is in line with prior company guidance for year-over-year growth in community count of 8% to 10% in the first half of the year, expanding to 10% to 15% in the second half of 2016.
Now let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall for some comments on marketing conditions. Ryan?"

While there's been a lot of volatility in the global economic and financial markets, U.S. housing continues to move along the slow recovery path it has been following for the past 5 years.Government data as of May, showing new home sales of",567,"Thanks, Bob. While there's been a lot of volatility in the global economic and financial markets, U.S. housing continues to move along the slow recovery path it has been following for the past 5 years.
Government data as of May, showing new home sales of 550,000, puts U.S. housing on track to deliver another year of roughly 10% growth. The trend is certainly positive, but after 5 years of recovery, we still remain well below the 50-year average, which is why we believe the recovery has a few years left. And while there's a lot of noise in the surrounding environment, there are certainly positives to be seen in the underlying economy job market, consumer confidence and the low mortgage rate conditions that are important drivers of ongoing demand.
The demand conditions we realized in Q2 are consistent with those suggested by some of the broader housing stats which point to a sustained recovery, but with pockets of stronger and weaker demand depending on geography and buyer segment. 
On a regional basis, demand conditions in the quarter were as follows: consistent with comments made on many of our prior calls, demand on the East Coast generally gets stronger as you move from north to south. Florida, Georgia and parts of the Carolinas continue to experience solid buyer demand as we benefited from strong local economies.
Getting to home sold in some of our mid-Atlantic and Northeast markets is a little more challenging as demand appears to be softer than start of the year.
The middle third of the country covering our Midwest and Texas operations continue to experience strong demand conditions. All of our Midwest markets have been performing well, would notable gains in our of Ohio and Kentucky operations as we continue to build on the dominion positions we acquired in 2014.
Our Texas markets are generally performing well. Dallas continues to experience exceptional strength, although maintaining that needed pace of land development in the market is challenging. Houston is still showing great resilience as demand continues to exceed expectations. Excessive rains earlier in the year has meant development for Houston and Austin, but our teams are working hard to catch up on some of the delays.
And finally, looking out west, demand remains solid throughout the area with good traffic and sign up paces in Arizona, Nevada and California.
Although it is among our smaller markets, Seattle has realized a nice jump in buyer demand as we  get new communities open and new product on the ground.
Overall, we are certainly pleased with the selling season for PulteGroup, as we realized good absorption paces and built a sizable backlog of sold homes. Our Q2 backlog is the highest in almost a decade, which sets us up well for the remainder of 2016. Having a large backlog allows us to provide a consistent flow of production, which just helpful with it comes to working with the trade base, so that we expect we'll be stretched for the foreseeable future.
In closing, I want to recognize the entire PulteGroup organization, with special thanks to the sales and construction teams which are doing an outstanding job capitalizing on the market opportunities and managing the challenges that develop. Thanks to your effort, we had tremendous momentum heading into the second half of the year.

Before we open the call to questions, I want to take just a couple of minutes to comment on the other press release we issued this morning regarding the addition of 3 very talented executives to serve as independent directors on PulteGroup's board. 
For those of you who have followed home building over the years, you will likely know the name John Peskin. John spent much of his 30-year home building career with Taylor Woodrow, including serving as the company CEO for 6 years. John has also served on the boards of Standard Pacific and WCI Communities. 
I'm also pleased to welcome Josh Gotbaum to the PulteGroup board. After spending more than a decade in investment banking at Lazard [ph], Josh held senior-level positions in the U.S. government and has recently served as acting Chief Operating Officer of the Pension Benefit Guarantee [ph] Corporation.  Josh's extensive Wall Street and government experience will be a great add to the collective experience of our board. 
Also joining our board will be Scott Powers, a financial services executive with over 30 years of experience. Scott, who is most recently President and CEO of State Street Global Advisors, has a long track record of success with some of the industry's premier asset managers including Home Mutual, Mellon [ph] Financial and Boston Company. 
We look forward to having the experiences of 3 such proven executives added to our board. I would also note that in addition to joining the board, John and Josh have both been added to the search committee, which was recently established to identify PulteGroup's next CEO. The committee's work is well underway as they evaluate internal and external candidates. John and Josh will go to work immediately to get actively engaged in the process.
And finally, I want to confirm that over the past several weeks, we have had conversations about broad business strategies and practices with Elliott Management, one of the company's shareholders. We certainly appreciate their perspectives about PulteGroup and ideas for creating long-term value for shareholders. 
I would also tell you that from our very first conversation, we were in agreement with many of their thoughts because we had already been evaluating the same opportunities to enhance the business and potential returns for our shareholders. 
As an example, PulteGroup's efforts to supplement its board with direct homebuilding and additional Wall Street experience were already underway. The final candidate selection was the result of a fruitful collaboration and discussion with Elliott. In short, all our discussions with Elliott were constructive and productive.
Beyond just speaking with Elliott, we had extensive conversations with many other large shareholders over the past several weeks and months. The feedback has been very consistent in terms of investor support for our Value Creation Strategy and the tactics we have been implementing. We view the planned actions we announced today on capital allocation, land spend, SG&A and corporate governance as appropriate next steps in our value creation work as we work hard to drive greater shareholder value from here.

Thanks for clarifying that. Can you walk me through and maybe the ball goes to Bob's court, you're slowing the pace of land, it's partially calling the cycle, it's partially an effort to get better financial performance through the balance sheet, but what's the logic behind levering up to buy back stock, given the fact that the stock is now trading at close to 2x book, and obviously, that's a positive thing, which shows the Value Creation plan has worked. So from my standpoint, I'm trying to understand if the cycle is further along than we have anticipated, does it make sense to run to 40% to 50%? Why do you want to reinvest back on a systematic buyback program, given the fact that the underlying land in your existing balance sheets already appreciated in the market recognizes the good work?"

Over the 5-plus years, we have been operating under our Value Creation strategy. The company has moved through several different stages as our operating and financial results progressed. When we started back in",810,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Over the 5-plus years, we have been operating under our Value Creation strategy. The company has moved through several different stages as our operating and financial results progressed. When we started back in 2011, our initial focus was on fixing our fundamental business performance, along with strengthening our balance sheet and enhancing overall returns on invested capital.
Having made significant progress towards achieving these initial operating and financial objectives, in 2013, we were in a position to begin materially increasing investment in the business.
Our land acquisition spend on an annual basis, the last few years doubled from $600 million or 11% of revenue in 2013 to $1.2 billion or 21% of revenue in 2015. While the dollars grew, our underlying discipline has not wavered. We have continued to invest in higher returning, shorter duration projects that are closer to city centers, allowing the company to maintain high margins and returns through this time frame.
As we have talked about on recent calls, 2016 is the year this increased investment begins to pay off, as we have now reached an inflection point toward higher growth in the business.
The earnings release we issued this morning demonstrates this point as our second quarter results show another quarter of strong year-over-year growth across a variety of important business metrics, including sign-ups which increased 11% in units and 21% in value; closings which increased by 27%; revenues which increased 41% to $1.8 billion; earnings per share which gained 21% on a reported basis and was significantly higher when you adjust for the charges and benefits in the respective reporting periods; and with our backlog value of 21% to $3.7 billion, our highest since 2007, we are in an excellent position to realize further growth over the remainder of 2016.
It is clear that after 3 years of increased investment in the business, we are driving meaningful growth across the operations. While our increased land investments should bring growth for several years to come, we have not forgotten that homebuilding is a cyclical business, which is why we are already planning for the future.
Value Creation was designed over 5 years ago to help maximize shareholder value through an entire housing cycle. With this in mind, in addition to announcing our strong second quarter financial results, this morning's earnings release highlighted additional actions we are now taking as we move through the housing cycle.
After 4 years during which our investment in new land grew significantly, we plan to slow the rate of growth in our new investment in 2017 and beyond. With 143,000 lots currently under control, we maintain a very strong land pipeline on which to operate over the next few years.
Our stated capital allocation priorities of first investing in high-returning land and then returning excess funds to shareholders have not changed. As such, given a moderated level of land spend in future years, we expect to have sufficient liquidity to allow us to increase our share repurchase activities.
As stated in the release, our board has approved an incremental $1 billion share repurchase authorization, bringing our total authorization to $1.5 billion.
As also stated, we expect to utilize that authority over the next 18 months through repurchases of $250 million in each of the third and fourth quarters of 2016 and an additional $1 billion in 2017.
Along with looking to create value through our allocation of capital over time, we are also taking action to create value through maximizing efficiencies within our operations. Over the past several years, we have worked extremely hard to raise our operating margin from the bottom quartile of the homebuilding peers to among the industry leaders.
We want to maintain and as possible enhance our relative position. To help realize this objective, we plan to lower our SG&A spend from an estimated 10% of revenues in 2016 to 9% of revenues or lower in 2017.
While we expect to realize a portion of this leverage benefit from increased revenues, we are also working to take unnecessary overhead out of the business. The fact is that after 5 years, many of the core homebuilding disciplines put in place at the outset of Value Creation are now part of the company's standard operating practices and are embedded in our muscle memory. As such, there are opportunities to remove some of these costs.
As I wrap up my initial comments, let me say that I'm very proud of the excellent second quarter results and pleased with how well we are positioned for the future. Furthermore, I believe the additional actions we are announcing today, with regard to future capital allocation and overheads, will help ensure we continue building value for shareholders going forward.
Now let me turn over the call to Bob for a detailed review of the quarter. Bob?"
294550,369102378,1009521,"PulteGroup, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","PulteGroup, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Richard, and good morning. Building on our strong Q1 results, PulteGroup's second quarter financials are highlighted by significant growth and performance gains in the business.Looking at the second quarter's homebuilding operations, home sale r",1543,"Thanks, Richard, and good morning. Building on our strong Q1 results, PulteGroup's second quarter financials are highlighted by significant growth and performance gains in the business.
Looking at the second quarter's homebuilding operations, home sale revenues were at $1.8 billion, which represents an increase of 41% over last year. The significant increase in revenue was driven by a 27% increase in closings, the 4,772 homes, combined with an 11% or $35,000 increase in average selling price to $367,000.
The 27% increase in closings was due to the strong orders we reported in recent quarters, coupled with our previously discussed actions to put additional homes into production at the end of last year and the beginning of this year. As a result, our conversion rate for the quarter was 55%, which is up roughly 600 basis points over last year.
I'd like to point out that although our conversion rate improved on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter, tight labor resources, elongated build cycles and development and permitting delays remain meaningful challenges across many markets. As such, we continue to target conversion rate improvement versus last year, but don't expect we will return to the rates several years ago in the short-term.
As a result, we currently project the conversion rate of between 51% and 54% in the third quarter this year. This compares to the 48% conversion rate in Q3 of last year.
The 11% increase in average selling price for the quarter reflects the ongoing shift in the mix of our business toward move-up product.
In addition to the shift in our mix, we also realized higher prices in each buyer group, including a 5% increase among first-time buyers to $270,000, an 11% increase in the price of move-up homes to $438,000 and a 4% increase in the average price of homes, among our active adult buyers, $357,000.
During the quarter, closing percentages by buyer group were as follows: 29% first-time, 44% move-up and 27% active adults. In Q2 of last year, closings by buyer group were: 34% first-time, 35% move-up and 31% active adult.
Given that our backlog ASP of $387,000 is up 13% over last year and up 5% from Q2 deliveries, we expect ASPs will continually to gradually move higher over the coming quarters.
Our second quarter gross margin of 21.5%, which includes approximately 70 basis points of drag associated with our first quarter acquisition of the Wieland assets, was in line with previous guidance. Adjusting for the impact of the Wieland closings, gross margins were down approximately 110 basis points from last year, primarily as a result of mix, higher land and labor costs.
The company remains on track to deliver full year margins of approximately 21.5%, and we expect margins over the remaining 2 quarters to be in the range of 21.2% to 21.7%, which is down slightly from prior guidance of 21.5% to 22%. Based on our current backlog, we see higher labor and material cost continuing to put slight pressure on margins.
Offsetting some of the margin pressure, we continue to have success with our strategic pricing programs. In Q2, our total option revenues and lot premiums increased 5% over last year to approximately $67,000 per closing. In addition, sales discounts totaled 2.7%, which is up about 50 basis points from last year, but consistent with our first quarter of this year's results.
Second quarter SG&A was $192 million or 11% of home sale revenues. Prior year SG&A spend of $130 million or 10.5% of revenues, included a $27 million benefit or approximately 210 basis points resulting from a legal settlement.
Increased SG&A spend in the quarter reflects ongoing growth in support of the company's 26% increase in units underproduction, combined with cost associated with higher health care insurance and professional fees incurred in the period.
Although the asset to dollar spend is higher than forecast, we still expect full year SG&A will be approximately 10% of revenues, allowing PulteGroup to maintain its operating margins among the industry leaders.
At 10% of revenue, SG&A expenses are certainly within historical ranges. But as Richard discussed, we believe there are opportunities to drive greater overhead leverage. Based on our current targets, we expect to drive SG&A spend lower by at least 100 basis points in 2017 to 9% or lower of home sale revenues.
Continuing down the income statement, we reported other expenses net of $13 million. This includes approximately $7 million of deposits and other pre-acquisition charges associated with the termination of several pending land transactions as well as the final $7 million of costs associated with the relocation of our corporate office.
Turning to financial services, we reported pretax income of $17 million, which is up from $10 million last year. These results benefited from the higher closing volumes in our homebuilding operations as well as the favorable interest rate environment given the decline in rates experienced during the quarter. Our mortgage capture rate for the period was 81%, down from 83% in the second quarter of 2015.
Consistent with company guidance, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 38%, yielding Q2 net income of $118 million or $0.34 per share. EPS for the quarter was calculated on approximately 348 million shares, which is down 4% from last year, resulting largely from share repurchase activities.
Moving past on income statement and looking at our homebuilding operations, we had 8,687 homes under construction at the end of the second quarter, of which 23% were spec. Consistent with our Q1 comments, after increasing the spec home production in the back half of '15 and into the first quarter of 2016, to help ensure more consistent construction cadence, we have slowed spec starts somewhat as we build the backlog from the selling season. With an average of less than 1 finished spec per community, we remain in a very favorable inventory position.
In the second quarter, we approved approximately 5,800 lots for purchase and ended the period with 143,000 lots under control.
Consistent with recent quarters, about 29% of our lot position is controlled through options as we work to manage our land risk and drive higher returns on invested capital. Of our controlled lots, approximately 25% are developed.
During the quarter, we spent $370 million -- $379 million on land acquisition and generally remain on track with 2016 plans to invest approximately $1.6 billion, including the purchase of the Wieland assets in new land positions. Consistent with Richard's comments and after several years of significant growth, we expect the rate of growth of our land acquisition spend to slow as we head into 2017.
Recognizing that the current housing cycle is maturing, we are decreasing our land investment as a percentage of revenues and could ultimately reduce the absolute dollars we spend depending upon our assessment of economic conditions and their potential impact on the housing industry here in the U.S.
Looking at share repurchase activity during the quarter, we repurchased 2.6 million shares for $48 million or $18.51 per share. This brings our total repurchase activity for the first half of the year to $98 million.
Expanding on Richard's earlier comments about capital allocation, we've invested significantly in land-related development over the last few years, and we expect those investments to drive volume growth and strong cash flows for the next few years.
We have also indicated that the growth in our investment is expected to moderate going forward. As a result, we feel we are well positioned to increase the return of funds to shareholders, consistent with our stated capital allocation priorities through the expanded share buyback program, Richard outlined.
We expect to take on a certain amount of incremental debt in connection with the outlined share repurchase activities, but we expect to be able to maintain a responsible and certainly very manageable debt-to-cap level throughout this process. As a reminder, our target debt-to-cap range remains unchanged at 30% to 40%. While we may have leverage rates outside this range at points in time, we continue to believe our targeted range is appropriate and we'll strive to operate in that range over the long-term.
I'll just provide a couple more data points before turning over the call. Signups for the second quarter were 5,697, which represents an increase of 11% over the prior year. On a dollar basis, signups increased to even greater 21%, $2.1 billion.
Signups by buyer group breakdown as follows: first-time increased 12%, move-up increased 21% and active adult declined 3%. Adjusting for changes in community counts, absorption paces increased to 23% and 5% for first-time and active adult buyers, respectively, but were lower by 8% among move-up buyers. As we talked about on our prior call, given the higher price points among Wieland communities, absorption paces are slower than traditional Pulte communities, which impacted the move-up buyer results.
During the second quarter, we operated from 700 communities, which is up 11% over last year. The 11% increase is in line with prior company guidance for year-over-year growth in community count of 8% to 10% in the first half of the year, expanding to 10% to 15% in the second half of 2016.
Now let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall for some comments on market conditions. Ryan?"

While there's been a lot of volatility in the global economic and financial markets, U.S. housing continues to move along the slow recovery path it has been following for the past 5 years.Government data as of May, showing new home sales of",571,"Thanks, Bob. While there's been a lot of volatility in the global economic and financial markets, U.S. housing continues to move along the slow recovery path it has been following for the past 5 years.
Government data as of May, showing new home sales of 550,000, puts U.S. housing on track to deliver another year of roughly 10% growth. The trend is certainly positive, but after 5 years of recovery, we still remain well below the 50-year average, which is why we believe the recovery has a few years left. And while there's a lot of noise in the surrounding environment, there are certainly positives to be seen in the underlying economy, the job market, consumer confidence and the low mortgage rate conditions that are important drivers of ongoing demand.
The demand conditions we realized in Q2 are consistent with those suggested by some of the broader housing stats, which point to a sustained recovery, but with pockets of stronger and weaker demand depending on geography and buyer segment.
On a regional basis, demand conditions in the quarter were as follows: consistent with comments made on many of our prior calls, demand on the East Coast generally gets stronger as you move from north to south. Florida, Georgia and parts of the Carolinas continue to experience solid buyer demand as we benefited from strong local economies.
Getting to home sold in some of our mid-Atlantic and Northeast markets, however, is a little more challenging as demand appears to be softer than at the start of the year.
The middle third of the country covering our Midwest and Texas operations continue to experience strong demand conditions. All of our Midwest markets have been performing well, with notable gains in our Ohio and Kentucky operations as we continue to build on the Dominion positions we acquired in 2014.
Our Texas markets are generally performing well. Dallas continues to experience exceptional strength, although maintaining the needed pace of land development in the market is challenging. Houston is still showing great resilience as demand continues to exceed expectations. Excessive rains earlier in the year, have us behind on land development for Houston and Austin, but our teams are working hard to catch up on some of the delays.
And finally, looking out west, demand remained solid throughout the area with good traffic and signup paces in Arizona, Nevada and California.
Although it is among our smaller markets, Seattle has realized a nice jump in buyer demand as we get new communities open and new product on the ground.
Overall, we are certainly pleased with the selling season for PulteGroup, as we realized good absorption paces and built a sizable backlog of sold homes. Our Q2 backlog is the highest in almost a decade, which sets us up well for the remainder of 2016. Having a large backlog, allows us to provide a consistent flow of production. We're just hopeful when it comes to working with the trade base that we expect it'll be stretched for the foreseeable future.
In closing, I want to recognize the entire PulteGroup organization, with special thanks to the sales and construction teams which are doing an outstanding job capitalizing on the market opportunities and managing the challenges that develop. Thanks to your efforts, we had tremendous momentum heading into the second half of the year.
Let me now turn the call back to Richard for a few final comments. Richard?"

Before we open the call to questions, I want to take just a couple of minutes to comment on the other press release we issued this morning regarding the addition of 3 very talented executives to serve as independent directors on PulteGroup's board. 
For those of you, who have followed homebuilding over the years, you will likely know the name John Peshkin. John spent much of his 30-year homebuilding career with Taylor Woodrow, including serving as the company's CEO for 6 years. John has also served on the boards of Standard Pacific and WCI Communities.
I am also pleased to welcome Josh Gotbaum to the PulteGroup board. After spending more than a decade in investment banking at Lazard, Josh held senior level positions in the U.S. government and has recently served as acting Chief Operating Officer of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Josh's extensive Wall Street and government experience will be a great add to the collective experiences of our board.
Also joining our board will be Scott Powers, a financial services executive with over 30 years of experience. Scott, who was most recently President and CEO of State Street Global Advisors, has a long track record of success with some of the industry's premier asset managers including Old Mutual, Mellon Financial and Boston Company.
We look forward to having the experiences of 3 such proven executives added to our board. I would also note that in addition to joining the board, John and Josh have both been added to the search committee, which was recently established to identify PulteGroup's next CEO. The committee's work is well underway, as they evaluate internal and external candidates. John and Josh will go to work immediately to get actively engaged in the process.
And finally, I want to confirm that over the past several weeks, we have had conversations about broad business strategies and practices with Elliott Management, one of the company's shareholders. We certainly appreciate their perspectives about PulteGroup and ideas for creating long-term value for shareholders.
I would also tell you that from our very first conversation, we were in agreement with many of their thoughts, because we had already been evaluating the same opportunities to enhance the business and potential returns for our shareholders.
As an example, PulteGroup's efforts to supplement its board with direct homebuilding and additional Wall Street experience were already underway. The final candidate selection was the result of a fruitful collaboration and discussion with Elliott. In short, all our discussions with Elliott were constructive and productive.
Beyond just speaking with Elliott, we have had extensive conversations with many other large shareholders over the past several weeks and months. The feedback has been very consistent in terms of investor support for our Value Creation strategy and the tactics we have been implementing. We view the planned actions we announced today on capital allocation, land spend, SG&A and corporate governance as appropriate next steps in our Value Creation work as we work hard to drive even greater shareholder value from here.

Can you walk me through and maybe the ball goes to Bob's court, you're slowing the pace in land, it's partially calling the cycle, it's partially an effort to get better financial performance through the balance sheet. But what's the logic behind levering up to buy back stock, given the fact that the stock is now trading at close to 2x book, and obviously, that's a positive thing, which shows the Value Creation plan has worked. So from my standpoint, I'm trying to understand, if the cycle is further along than we had anticipated, does it make sense to run to 40% to 50%? Why do you want to reinvest back on a systematic buyback program, given the fact that the underlying land in your existing balance sheets already appreciated in the market recognizes the good work?"

We want to invest in high-growth or high-return opportunities and when that -- as we've talked about as moderated, not stopping to Richard's point, but moderating the growth of it. So we'll still be investing a fair amount of money, using that excess cash flow to return to shareholders. And the important thing -- and you've asked the question is around that it hinges on debt-to-cap between 30% and 40%. Today, we're at 35%. We're talking about incremental leverage over that next 18 months, that isn't really terribly significant. Again, we highlight that we might go a little bit above 40%, but not a lot. And again, what we've indicated is that we would see to get back down under 40% as time goes by, because that's what we've outlined in terms of our priorities. So we've not tried to make a determination of market. So when we've been buying back equity over the last 2 or 3 years, we have been -- we have a view about market values, but typically, we're buying on a relatively consistent basis, with the cash we have available.

Or how much leverage is occurring due to variables you're not commenting on, I guess? How would you describe that?"

Over the 5-plus years, we have been operating under our Value Creation strategy. The company has moved through several different stages as our operating and financial results progressed. When we started back in",810,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Over the 5-plus years, we have been operating under our Value Creation strategy. The company has moved through several different stages as our operating and financial results progressed. When we started back in 2011, our initial focus was on fixing our fundamental business performance, along with strengthening our balance sheet and enhancing overall returns on invested capital.
Having made significant progress towards achieving these initial operating and financial objectives, in 2013, we were in a position to begin materially increasing investment in the business.
Our land acquisition spend on an annual basis, the last few years doubled from $600 million or 11% of revenue in 2013 to $1.2 billion or 21% of revenue in 2015. While the dollars grew, our underlying discipline has not wavered. We have continued to invest in higher returning, shorter duration projects that are closer to city centers, allowing the company to maintain high margins and returns through this time frame.
As we have talked about on recent calls, 2016 is the year this increased investment begins to pay off, as we have now reached an inflection point toward higher growth in the business.
The earnings release we issued this morning demonstrates this point as our second quarter results show another quarter of strong year-over-year growth across a variety of important business metrics, including sign-ups which increased 11% in units and 21% in value; closings, which increased by 27%; revenues, which increased 41% to $1.8 billion; earnings per share, which gained 21% on a reported basis and was significantly higher when you adjust for the charges and benefits in the respective reporting periods; and with our backlog value up 21% to $3.7 billion, our highest since 2007, we are in an excellent position to realize further growth over the remainder of 2016.
It is clear that after 3 years of increased investment in the business, we are driving meaningful growth across the operations. While our increased land investments should bring growth for several years to come, we have not forgotten that homebuilding is a cyclical business, which is why we are already planning for the future.
Value Creation was designed over 5 years ago to help maximize shareholder value through an entire housing cycle. With this in mind, in addition to announcing our strong second quarter financial results, this morning's earnings release highlighted additional actions we are now taking as we move through the housing cycle.
After 4 years during which our investment in new land grew significantly, we plan to slow the rate of growth in our new investment in 2017 and beyond. With 143,000 lots currently under control, we maintain a very strong land pipeline on which to operate over the next few years.
Our stated capital allocation priorities of first investing in high-returning land and then returning excess funds to shareholders have not changed. As such, given a moderated level of land spend in future years, we expect to have sufficient liquidity to allow us to increase our share repurchase activities.
As stated in the release, our board has approved an incremental $1 billion share repurchase authorization, bringing our total authorization to $1.5 billion.
As also stated, we expect to utilize that authority over the next 18 months through repurchases of $250 million in each of the third and fourth quarters of 2016 and an additional $1 billion in 2017.
Along with looking to create value through our allocation of capital over time, we are also taking action to create value through maximizing efficiencies within our operations. Over the past several years, we have worked extremely hard to raise our operating margin from the bottom quartile of the homebuilding peers to among the industry leaders.
We want to maintain and, as possible, enhance our relative position. To help realize this objective, we plan to lower our SG&A spend from an estimated 10% of revenues in 2016 to 9% of revenues or lower in 2017.
While we expect to realize a portion of this leverage benefit from increased revenues, we are also working to take unnecessary overhead out of the business. The fact is that after 5 years, many of the core homebuilding disciplines put in place at the outset of Value Creation are now part of the company's standard operating practices and are embedded in our muscle memory. As such, there are opportunities to remove some of these costs.
As I wrap up my initial comments, let me say that I'm very proud of the excellent second quarter results and pleased with how well we are positioned for the future. Furthermore, I believe the additional actions we are announcing today, with regard to future capital allocation and overheads, will help ensure we continue building value for shareholders going forward.
Now let me turn over the call to Bob for a detailed review of the quarter. Bob?"
294550,369102378,1009789,"PulteGroup, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","PulteGroup, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Richard, and good morning. Building on our strong Q1 results, PulteGroup's second quarter financials are highlighted by significant growth and performance gains in the business.Looking at the second quarter's homebuilding operations, home sale r",1546,"Thanks, Richard, and good morning. Building on our strong Q1 results, PulteGroup's second quarter financials are highlighted by significant growth and performance gains in the business.
Looking at the second quarter's homebuilding operations, home sale revenues were at $1.8 billion, which represents an increase of 41% over last year. The significant increase in revenue was driven by a 27% increase in closings to 4,772 homes, combined with an 11% or $35,000 increase in average selling price to $367,000.
The 27% increase in closings was due to the strong orders we reported in recent quarters, coupled with our previously discussed actions to put additional homes into production at the end of last year and the beginning of this year. As a result, our conversion rate for the quarter was 55%, which is up roughly 600 basis points over last year.
I'd like to point out that although our conversion rate improved on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter, tight labor resources, elongated build cycles and development and permitting delays remain meaningful challenges across many markets. As such, we continue to target conversion rate improvement versus last year, but don't expect we will return to the rates of several years ago in the short-term.
As a result, we currently project the conversion rate of between 51% and 54% in the third quarter this year. This compares to the 48% conversion rate in Q3 of last year.
The 11% increase in average selling price for the quarter reflects the ongoing shift in the mix of our business toward move-up product.
In addition to the shift in our mix, we also realized higher prices in each buyer group, including a 5% increase among first-time buyers to $270,000, an 11% increase in the price of move-up homes to $438,000 and a 4% increase in the average price of homes, among our active adult buyers, $357,000.
During the quarter, closing percentages by buyer group were as follows: 29% first-time, 44% move-up and 27% active adults. In Q2 of last year, closings by buyer group were: 34% first-time, 35% move-up and 31% active adult.
Given that our backlog ASP of $387,000 is up 13% over last year and up 5% from Q2 deliveries, we expect ASPs will continually to gradually move higher over the coming quarters.
Our second quarter gross margin of 21.5%, which includes approximately 70 basis points of drag associated with our first quarter acquisition of the Wieland assets, was in line with previous guidance. Adjusting for the impact of the Wieland closings, gross margins were down approximately 110 basis points from last year, primarily as a result of mix, higher land and labor costs.
The company remains on track to deliver full year margins of approximately 21.5%, and we expect margins over the remaining 2 quarters to be in the range of 21.2% to 21.7%, which is down slightly from prior guidance of 21.5% to 22%. Based on our current backlog, we see higher labor and material cost continuing to put slight pressure on margins.
Offsetting some of the margin pressure, we continue to have success with our strategic pricing programs. In Q2, our total option revenues and lot premiums increased 5% over last year to approximately $67,000 per closing. In addition, sales discounts totaled 2.7%, which is up about 50 basis points from last year, but consistent with our first quarter of this year's results.
Second quarter SG&A was $192 million or 11% of home sale revenues. Prior year SG&A spend of $130 million or 10.5% of revenues, included a $27 million benefit or approximately 210 basis points resulting from a legal settlement.
Increased SG&A spend in the quarter reflects ongoing growth in support of the company's 26% increase in units under production, combined with cost associated with higher health care insurance and professional fees incurred in the period.
Although the absolute dollar spend is higher than forecast, we still expect full year SG&A will be approximately 10% of revenues, allowing PulteGroup to maintain its operating margins among the industry leaders.
At 10% of revenue, SG&A expenses are certainly within historical ranges. But as Richard discussed, we believe there are opportunities to drive greater overhead leverage. Based on our current targets, we expect to drive SG&A spend lower by at least 100 basis points in 2017 to 9% or lower of home sale revenues.
Continuing down the income statement, we reported other expenses net of $13 million. This includes approximately $7 million of deposits and other pre-acquisition charges associated with the termination of several pending land transactions as well as the final $7 million of costs associated with the relocation of our corporate office.
Turning to financial services, we reported pretax income of $17 million, which is up from $10 million last year. These results benefited from the higher closing volumes in our homebuilding operations as well as the favorable interest rate environment given the decline in rates experienced during the quarter. Our mortgage capture rate for the period was 81%, down from 83% in the second quarter of 2015.
Consistent with company guidance, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 38%, yielding Q2 net income of $118 million or $0.34 per share. EPS for the quarter was calculated on approximately 348 million shares, which is down 4% from last year, resulting largely from share repurchase activities.
Moving past our income statement and looking at our homebuilding operations, we had 8,687 homes under construction at the end of the second quarter, of which 23% were spec. Consistent with our Q1 comments, after increasing the spec home production in the back half of '15 and into the first quarter of 2016, to help ensure a more consistent construction cadence, we have slowed spec starts somewhat as we build the backlog from the selling season. With an average of less than 1 finished spec per community, we remain in a very favorable inventory position.
In the second quarter, we approved approximately 5,800 lots for purchase and ended the period with 143,000 lots under control.
Consistent with recent quarters, about 29% of our lot position is controlled through options as we work to manage our land risk and drive higher returns on invested capital. Of our controlled lots, approximately 25% are developed.
During the quarter, we spent $370 million -- $379 million on land acquisition and generally remain on track with 2016 plans to invest approximately $1.6 billion, including the purchase of the Wieland assets in new land positions. Consistent with Richard's comments and after several years of significant growth, we expect the rate of growth of our land acquisition spend to slow as we head into 2017.
Recognizing that the current housing cycle is maturing, we are decreasing our land investment as a percentage of revenues and could ultimately reduce the absolute dollars we spend depending upon our assessment of economic conditions and their potential impact on the housing industry here in the U.S.
Looking at share repurchase activity during the quarter, we repurchased 2.6 million shares for $48 million or $18.51 per share. This brings our total repurchase activity for the first half of the year to $98 million.
Expanding on Richard's earlier comments about capital allocation, we've invested significantly in land-related development over the last few years, and we expect those investments to drive volume growth and strong cash flows for the next few years.
We have also indicated that the growth in our investment is expected to moderate going forward. As a result, we feel we are well positioned to increase the return of funds to shareholders, consistent with our stated capital allocation priorities through the expanded share buyback program Richard outlined.
We expect to take on a certain amount of incremental debt in connection with the outlined share repurchase activities, but we expect to be able to maintain a responsible and certainly very manageable debt-to-cap level throughout this process. As a reminder, our target debt-to-cap range remains unchanged at 30% to 40%. While we may have leverage rates outside this range at points in time, we continue to believe our targeted range is appropriate and we'll strive to operate in that range over the long-term.
I'll just provide a couple more data points before turning over the call. Signups for the second quarter were 5,697, which represents an increase of 11% over the prior year. On a dollar basis, signups increased an even greater 21%, $2.1 billion.
Signups by buyer group break down as follows: first-time increased 12%, move-up increased 21% and active adult declined 3%. Adjusting for changes in community counts, absorption paces increased to 23% and 5% for first-time and active adult buyers, respectively, but were lower by 8% among move-up buyers. As we talked about on our prior call, given the higher price points among Wieland communities, absorption paces are slower than traditional Pulte communities, which impacted the move-up buyer results.
During the second quarter, we operated from 700 communities, which is up 11% over last year. The 11% increase is in line with prior company guidance for year-over-year growth in community count of 8% to 10% in the first half of the year, expanding to 10% to 15% in the second half of 2016.
Now let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall for some comments on market conditions. Ryan?"

While there's been a lot of volatility in the global economic and financial markets, U.S. housing continues to move along the slow recovery path it has been following for the past 5 years.Government data as of May, showing new home sales of",570,"Thanks, Bob. While there's been a lot of volatility in the global economic and financial markets, U.S. housing continues to move along the slow recovery path it has been following for the past 5 years.
Government data as of May, showing new home sales of 550,000, puts U.S. housing on track to deliver another year of roughly 10% growth. The trend is certainly positive, but after 5 years of recovery, we still remain well below the 50-year average, which is why we believe the recovery has a few years left. And while there's a lot of noise in the surrounding environment, there are certainly positives to be seen in the underlying economy, the job market, consumer confidence and the low mortgage rate conditions that are important drivers of ongoing demand.
The demand conditions we realized in Q2 are consistent with those suggested by some of the broader housing stats, which point to a sustained recovery, but with pockets of stronger and weaker demand depending on geography and buyer segment.
On a regional basis, demand conditions in the quarter were as follows: consistent with comments made on many of our prior calls, demand on the East Coast generally gets stronger as you move from north to south. Florida, Georgia and parts of the Carolinas continue to experience solid buyer demand as we benefited from strong local economies.
Getting homes sold in some of our mid-Atlantic and Northeast markets, however, is a little more challenging as demand appears to be softer than at the start of the year.
The middle third of the country covering our Midwest and Texas operations continue to experience strong demand conditions. All of our Midwest markets have been performing well, with notable gains in our Ohio and Kentucky operations as we continue to build on the Dominion positions we acquired in 2014.
Our Texas markets are generally performing well. Dallas continues to experience exceptional strength, although maintaining the needed pace of land development in the market is challenging. Houston is still showing great resilience as demand continues to exceed expectations. Excessive rains earlier in the year have us behind on land development for Houston and Austin, but our teams are working hard to catch up on some of the delays.
And finally, looking out west, demand remained solid throughout the area with good traffic and signup paces in Arizona, Nevada and California.
Although it is among our smaller markets, Seattle has realized a nice jump in buyer demand as we get new communities open and new product on the ground.
Overall, we are certainly pleased with the selling season for PulteGroup, as we realized good absorption paces and built a sizable backlog of sold homes. Our Q2 backlog is the highest in almost a decade, which sets us up well for the remainder of 2016. Having a large backlog, allows us to provide a consistent flow of production, which is helpful when it comes to working with the trade base that we expect will be stretched for the foreseeable future.
In closing, I want to recognize the entire PulteGroup organization, with special thanks to the sales and construction teams, which are doing an outstanding job capitalizing on the market opportunities and managing the challenges that develop. Thanks to your efforts, we had tremendous momentum heading into the second half of the year.
Let me now turn the call back to Richard for a few final comments. Richard?"

Before we open the call to questions, I want to take just a couple of minutes to comment on the other press release we issued this morning regarding the addition of 3 very talented executives to serve as independent directors on PulteGroup's board. 
For those of you, who have followed homebuilding over the years, you will likely know the name John Peshkin. John spent much of his 30-year homebuilding career with Taylor Woodrow, including serving as the company's CEO for 6 years. John has also served on the boards of Standard Pacific and WCI Communities.
I am also pleased to welcome Josh Gotbaum to the PulteGroup board. After spending more than a decade in investment banking at Lazard, Josh held senior level positions in the U.S. government and has recently served as acting Chief Operating Officer of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Josh's extensive Wall Street and government experience will be a great add to the collective experiences of our board.
Also joining our board will be Scott Powers, a financial services executive with over 30 years of experience. Scott, who was most recently President and CEO of State Street Global Advisors, has a long track record of success with some of the industry's premier asset managers including Old Mutual, Mellon Financial and Boston Company.
We look forward to having the experiences of 3 such proven executives added to our board. I would also note that in addition to joining the board, John and Josh have both been added to the search committee, which was recently established to identify PulteGroup's next CEO. The committee's work is well underway, as they evaluate internal and external candidates. John and Josh will go to work immediately to get actively engaged in the process.
And finally, I want to confirm that over the past several weeks, we have had conversations about broad business strategies and practices with Elliott Management, one of the company's shareholders. We certainly appreciate their perspectives about PulteGroup and ideas for creating long-term value for shareholders.
I would also tell you that from our very first conversation, we were in agreement with many of their thoughts, because we had already been evaluating the same opportunities to enhance the business and potential returns for our shareholders.
As an example, PulteGroup's efforts to supplement its board with direct homebuilding and additional Wall Street experience were already underway. The final candidate selection was the result of a fruitful collaboration and discussion with Elliott. In short, all our discussions with Elliott were constructive and productive.
Beyond just speaking with Elliott, we have had extensive conversations with many other large shareholders over the past several weeks and months. The feedback has been very consistent in terms of investor support for our Value Creation strategy and the tactics we have been implementing. We view the planned actions we announced today on capital allocation, land spend, SG&A and corporate governance as appropriate next steps in our Value Creation work as we work hard to drive even greater shareholder value from here.

Can you walk me through and maybe the ball goes to Bob's court, you're slowing the pace in land, it's partially calling the cycle, it's partially an effort to get better financial performance through the balance sheet. But what's the logic behind levering up to buy back stock, given the fact that the stock is now trading at close to 2x book? And obviously, that's a positive thing, which shows the Value Creation plan has worked. So from my standpoint, I'm trying to understand, if the cycle is further along than we had anticipated, does it make sense to run to 40% to 50%? Why do you want to reinvest back on a systematic buyback program, given the fact that the underlying land in your existing balance sheets already appreciated and the market recognizes the good work?"

So we'll still be investing a fair amount of money, using that excess cash flow to return to shareholders. And the important thing -- and you've asked the question is around that it hinges on debt-to-cap between 30% and 40%. Today, we're at 35%. We're talking about incremental leverage over that next 18 months, that isn't really terribly significant. Again, we highlight that we might go a little bit above 40%, but not a lot. And again, what we've indicated is that we would seek to get back down under 40% as time goes by, because that's what we've outlined in terms of our priorities. So we've not tried to make a determination of market.

Over the 5-plus years, we have been operating under our Value Creation strategy. The company has moved through several different stages as our operating and financial results progressed. When we started back in",810,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Over the 5-plus years, we have been operating under our Value Creation strategy. The company has moved through several different stages as our operating and financial results progressed. When we started back in 2011, our initial focus was on fixing our fundamental business performance, along with strengthening our balance sheet and enhancing overall returns on invested capital.
Having made significant progress towards achieving these initial operating and financial objectives, in 2013, we were in a position to begin materially increasing investment in the business.
Our land acquisition spend on an annual basis, the last few years doubled from $600 million or 11% of revenue in 2013 to $1.2 billion or 21% of revenue in 2015. While the dollars grew, our underlying discipline has not wavered. We have continued to invest in higher returning, shorter duration projects that are closer to city centers, allowing the company to maintain high margins and returns through this time frame.
As we have talked about on recent calls, 2016 is the year this increased investment begins to pay off, as we have now reached an inflection point toward higher growth in the business.
The earnings release we issued this morning demonstrates this point as our second quarter results show another quarter of strong year-over-year growth across a variety of important business metrics, including sign-ups which increased 11% in units and 21% in value; closings, which increased by 27%; revenues, which increased 41% to $1.8 billion; earnings per share, which gained 21% on a reported basis and was significantly higher when you adjust for the charges and benefits in the respective reporting periods; and with our backlog value up 21% to $3.7 billion, our highest since 2007, we are in an excellent position to realize further growth over the remainder of 2016.
It is clear that after 3 years of increased investment in the business, we are driving meaningful growth across the operations. While our increased land investments should bring growth for several years to come, we have not forgotten that homebuilding is a cyclical business, which is why we are already planning for the future.
Value Creation was designed over 5 years ago to help maximize shareholder value through an entire housing cycle. With this in mind, in addition to announcing our strong second quarter financial results, this morning's earnings release highlighted additional actions we are now taking as we move through the housing cycle.
After 4 years during which our investment in new land grew significantly, we plan to slow the rate of growth in our new investment in 2017 and beyond. With 143,000 lots currently under control, we maintain a very strong land pipeline on which to operate over the next few years.
Our stated capital allocation priorities of first investing in high-returning land and then returning excess funds to shareholders have not changed. As such, given a moderated level of land spend in future years, we expect to have sufficient liquidity to allow us to increase our share repurchase activities.
As stated in the release, our board has approved an incremental $1 billion share repurchase authorization, bringing our total authorization to $1.5 billion.
As also stated, we expect to utilize that authority over the next 18 months through repurchases of $250 million in each of the third and fourth quarters of 2016 and an additional $1 billion in 2017.
Along with looking to create value through our allocation of capital over time, we are also taking action to create value through maximizing efficiencies within our operations. Over the past several years, we have worked extremely hard to raise our operating margin from the bottom quartile of the homebuilding peers to among the industry leaders.
We want to maintain and, as possible, enhance our relative position. To help realize this objective, we plan to lower our SG&A spend from an estimated 10% of revenues in 2016 to 9% of revenues or lower in 2017.
While we expect to realize a portion of this leverage benefit from increased revenues, we are also working to take unnecessary overhead out of the business. The fact is that after 5 years, many of the core homebuilding disciplines put in place at the outset of Value Creation are now part of the company's standard operating practices and are embedded in our muscle memory. As such, there are opportunities to remove some of these costs.
As I wrap up my initial comments, let me say that I'm very proud of the excellent second quarter results and pleased with how well we are positioned for the future. Furthermore, I believe the additional actions we are announcing today, with regard to future capital allocation and overheads, will help ensure we continue building value for shareholders going forward.
Now let me turn over the call to Bob for a detailed review of the quarter. Bob?"
294550,369102378,1010241,"PulteGroup, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","PulteGroup, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Richard, and good morning. Building on our strong Q1 results, PulteGroup's second quarter financials are highlighted by significant growth and performance gains in the business.Looking at the second quarter's homebuilding operations, home sale r",1546,"Thanks, Richard, and good morning. Building on our strong Q1 results, PulteGroup's second quarter financials are highlighted by significant growth and performance gains in the business.
Looking at the second quarter's homebuilding operations, home sale revenues were at $1.8 billion, which represents an increase of 41% over last year. The significant increase in revenue was driven by a 27% increase in closings to 4,772 homes, combined with an 11% or $35,000 increase in average selling price to $367,000.
The 27% increase in closings was due to the strong orders we reported in recent quarters, coupled with our previously discussed actions to put additional homes into production at the end of last year and the beginning of this year. As a result, our conversion rate for the quarter was 55%, which is up roughly 600 basis points over last year.
I'd like to point out that although our conversion rate improved on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter, tight labor resources, elongated build cycles and development and permitting delays remain meaningful challenges across many markets. As such, we continue to target conversion rate improvement versus last year, but don't expect we will return to the rates of several years ago in the short-term.
As a result, we currently project the conversion rate of between 51% and 54% in the third quarter this year. This compares to the 48% conversion rate in Q3 of last year.
The 11% increase in average selling price for the quarter reflects the ongoing shift in the mix of our business toward move-up product.
In addition to the shift in our mix, we also realized higher prices in each buyer group, including a 5% increase among first-time buyers to $270,000, an 11% increase in the price of move-up homes to $438,000 and a 4% increase in the average price of homes, among our active adult buyers, $357,000.
During the quarter, closing percentages by buyer group were as follows: 29% first-time, 44% move-up and 27% active adults. In Q2 of last year, closings by buyer group were: 34% first-time, 35% move-up and 31% active adult.
Given that our backlog ASP of $387,000 is up 13% over last year and up 5% from Q2 deliveries, we expect ASPs will continually to gradually move higher over the coming quarters.
Our second quarter gross margin of 21.5%, which includes approximately 70 basis points of drag associated with our first quarter acquisition of the Wieland assets, was in line with previous guidance. Adjusting for the impact of the Wieland closings, gross margins were down approximately 110 basis points from last year, primarily as a result of mix, higher land and labor costs.
The company remains on track to deliver full year margins of approximately 21.5%, and we expect margins over the remaining 2 quarters to be in the range of 21.2% to 21.7%, which is down slightly from prior guidance of 21.5% to 22%. Based on our current backlog, we see higher labor and material cost continuing to put slight pressure on margins.
Offsetting some of the margin pressure, we continue to have success with our strategic pricing programs. In Q2, our total option revenues and lot premiums increased 5% over last year to approximately $67,000 per closing. In addition, sales discounts totaled 2.7%, which is up about 50 basis points from last year, but consistent with our first quarter of this year's results.
Second quarter SG&A was $192 million or 11% of home sale revenues. Prior year SG&A spend of $130 million or 10.5% of revenues, included a $27 million benefit or approximately 210 basis points resulting from a legal settlement.
Increased SG&A spend in the quarter reflects ongoing growth in support of the company's 26% increase in units under production, combined with cost associated with higher health care insurance and professional fees incurred in the period.
Although the absolute dollar spend is higher than forecast, we still expect full year SG&A will be approximately 10% of revenues, allowing PulteGroup to maintain its operating margins among the industry leaders.
At 10% of revenue, SG&A expenses are certainly within historical ranges. But as Richard discussed, we believe there are opportunities to drive greater overhead leverage. Based on our current targets, we expect to drive SG&A spend lower by at least 100 basis points in 2017 to 9% or lower of home sale revenues.
Continuing down the income statement, we reported other expenses net of $13 million. This includes approximately $7 million of deposits and other pre-acquisition charges associated with the termination of several pending land transactions as well as the final $7 million of costs associated with the relocation of our corporate office.
Turning to financial services, we reported pretax income of $17 million, which is up from $10 million last year. These results benefited from the higher closing volumes in our homebuilding operations as well as the favorable interest rate environment given the decline in rates experienced during the quarter. Our mortgage capture rate for the period was 81%, down from 83% in the second quarter of 2015.
Consistent with company guidance, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 38%, yielding Q2 net income of $118 million or $0.34 per share. EPS for the quarter was calculated on approximately 348 million shares, which is down 4% from last year, resulting largely from share repurchase activities.
Moving past our income statement and looking at our homebuilding operations, we had 8,687 homes under construction at the end of the second quarter, of which 23% were spec. Consistent with our Q1 comments, after increasing the spec home production in the back half of '15 and into the first quarter of 2016, to help ensure a more consistent construction cadence, we have slowed spec starts somewhat as we build the backlog from the selling season. With an average of less than 1 finished spec per community, we remain in a very favorable inventory position.
In the second quarter, we approved approximately 5,800 lots for purchase and ended the period with 143,000 lots under control.
Consistent with recent quarters, about 29% of our lot position is controlled through options as we work to manage our land risk and drive higher returns on invested capital. Of our controlled lots, approximately 25% are developed.
During the quarter, we spent $370 million -- $379 million on land acquisition and generally remain on track with 2016 plans to invest approximately $1.6 billion, including the purchase of the Wieland assets in new land positions. Consistent with Richard's comments and after several years of significant growth, we expect the rate of growth of our land acquisition spend to slow as we head into 2017.
Recognizing that the current housing cycle is maturing, we are decreasing our land investment as a percentage of revenues and could ultimately reduce the absolute dollars we spend depending upon our assessment of economic conditions and their potential impact on the housing industry here in the U.S.
Looking at share repurchase activity during the quarter, we repurchased 2.6 million shares for $48 million or $18.51 per share. This brings our total repurchase activity for the first half of the year to $98 million.
Expanding on Richard's earlier comments about capital allocation, we've invested significantly in land-related development over the last few years, and we expect those investments to drive volume growth and strong cash flows for the next few years.
We have also indicated that the growth in our investment is expected to moderate going forward. As a result, we feel we are well positioned to increase the return of funds to shareholders, consistent with our stated capital allocation priorities through the expanded share buyback program Richard outlined.
We expect to take on a certain amount of incremental debt in connection with the outlined share repurchase activities, but we expect to be able to maintain a responsible and certainly very manageable debt-to-cap level throughout this process. As a reminder, our target debt-to-cap range remains unchanged at 30% to 40%. While we may have leverage rates outside this range at points in time, we continue to believe our targeted range is appropriate and we'll strive to operate in that range over the long-term.
I'll just provide a couple more data points before turning over the call. Signups for the second quarter were 5,697, which represents an increase of 11% over the prior year. On a dollar basis, signups increased an even greater 21%, $2.1 billion.
Signups by buyer group break down as follows: first-time increased 12%, move-up increased 21% and active adult declined 3%. Adjusting for changes in community counts, absorption paces increased to 23% and 5% for first-time and active adult buyers, respectively, but were lower by 8% among move-up buyers. As we talked about on our prior call, given the higher price points among Wieland communities, absorption paces are slower than traditional Pulte communities, which impacted the move-up buyer results.
During the second quarter, we operated from 700 communities, which is up 11% over last year. The 11% increase is in line with prior company guidance for year-over-year growth in community count of 8% to 10% in the first half of the year, expanding to 10% to 15% in the second half of 2016.
Now let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall for some comments on market conditions. Ryan?"
294550,369102378,1010241,"PulteGroup, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","PulteGroup, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bob. While there's been a lot of volatility in the global economic and financial markets, U.S. housing continues to move along the slow recovery path it has been following for the past 5 years.Government data as of May, showing new home sales of",570,"Thanks, Bob. While there's been a lot of volatility in the global economic and financial markets, U.S. housing continues to move along the slow recovery path it has been following for the past 5 years.
Government data as of May, showing new home sales of 550,000, puts U.S. housing on track to deliver another year of roughly 10% growth. The trend is certainly positive, but after 5 years of recovery, we still remain well below the 50-year average, which is why we believe the recovery has a few years left. And while there's a lot of noise in the surrounding environment, there are certainly positives to be seen in the underlying economy, the job market, consumer confidence and the low mortgage rate conditions that are important drivers of ongoing demand.
The demand conditions we realized in Q2 are consistent with those suggested by some of the broader housing stats, which point to a sustained recovery, but with pockets of stronger and weaker demand depending on geography and buyer segment.
On a regional basis, demand conditions in the quarter were as follows: consistent with comments made on many of our prior calls, demand on the East Coast generally gets stronger as you move from north to south. Florida, Georgia and parts of the Carolinas continue to experience solid buyer demand as we benefited from strong local economies.
Getting homes sold in some of our mid-Atlantic and Northeast markets, however, is a little more challenging as demand appears to be softer than at the start of the year.
The middle third of the country covering our Midwest and Texas operations continue to experience strong demand conditions. All of our Midwest markets have been performing well, with notable gains in our Ohio and Kentucky operations as we continue to build on the Dominion positions we acquired in 2014.
Our Texas markets are generally performing well. Dallas continues to experience exceptional strength, although maintaining the needed pace of land development in the market is challenging. Houston is still showing great resilience as demand continues to exceed expectations. Excessive rains earlier in the year have us behind on land development for Houston and Austin, but our teams are working hard to catch up on some of the delays.
And finally, looking out west, demand remained solid throughout the area with good traffic and signup paces in Arizona, Nevada and California.
Although it is among our smaller markets, Seattle has realized a nice jump in buyer demand as we get new communities open and new product on the ground.
Overall, we are certainly pleased with the selling season for PulteGroup, as we realized good absorption paces and built a sizable backlog of sold homes. Our Q2 backlog is the highest in almost a decade, which sets us up well for the remainder of 2016. Having a large backlog, allows us to provide a consistent flow of production, which is helpful when it comes to working with the trade base that we expect will be stretched for the foreseeable future.
In closing, I want to recognize the entire PulteGroup organization, with special thanks to the sales and construction teams, which are doing an outstanding job capitalizing on the market opportunities and managing the challenges that develop. Thanks to your efforts, we had tremendous momentum heading into the second half of the year.

Before we open the call to questions, I want to take just a couple of minutes to comment on the other press release we issued this morning regarding the addition of 3 very talented executives to serve as independent directors on PulteGroup's board. 
For those of you, who have followed homebuilding over the years, you will likely know the name John Peshkin. John spent much of his 30-year homebuilding career with Taylor Woodrow, including serving as the company's CEO for 6 years. John has also served on the boards of Standard Pacific and WCI Communities.
I am also pleased to welcome Josh Gotbaum to the PulteGroup board. After spending more than a decade in investment banking at Lazard, Josh held senior level positions in the U.S. government and has recently served as acting Chief Operating Officer of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Josh's extensive Wall Street and government experience will be a great add to the collective experiences of our board.
Also joining our board will be Scott Powers, a financial services executive with over 30 years of experience. Scott, who was most recently President and CEO of State Street Global Advisors, has a long track record of success with some of the industry's premier asset managers including Old Mutual, Mellon Financial and Boston Company.
We look forward to having the experiences of 3 such proven executives added to our board. I would also note that in addition to joining the board, John and Josh have both been added to the search committee, which was recently established to identify PulteGroup's next CEO. The committee's work is well underway, as they evaluate internal and external candidates. John and Josh will go to work immediately to get actively engaged in the process.
And finally, I want to confirm that over the past several weeks, we have had conversations about broad business strategies and practices with Elliott Management, one of the company's shareholders. We certainly appreciate their perspectives about PulteGroup and ideas for creating long-term value for shareholders.
I would also tell you that from our very first conversation, we were in agreement with many of their thoughts, because we had already been evaluating the same opportunities to enhance the business and potential returns for our shareholders.
As an example, PulteGroup's efforts to supplement its board with direct homebuilding and additional Wall Street experience were already underway. The final candidate selection was the result of a fruitful collaboration and discussion with Elliott. In short, all our discussions with Elliott were constructive and productive.
Beyond just speaking with Elliott, we have had extensive conversations with many other large shareholders over the past several weeks and months. The feedback has been very consistent in terms of investor support for our Value Creation strategy and the tactics we have been implementing. We view the planned actions we announced today on capital allocation, land spend, SG&A and corporate governance as appropriate next steps in our Value Creation work as we work hard to drive even greater shareholder value from here.

Can you walk me through and maybe the ball goes to Bob's court, you're slowing the pace in land, it's partially calling the cycle, it's partially an effort to get better financial performance through the balance sheet. But what's the logic behind levering up to buy back stock, given the fact that the stock is now trading at close to 2x book? And obviously, that's a positive thing, which shows the Value Creation plan has worked. So from my standpoint, I'm trying to understand, if the cycle is further along than we had anticipated, does it make sense to run to 40% to 50%? Why do you want to reinvest back on a systematic buyback program, given the fact that the underlying land in your existing balance sheets already appreciated and the market recognizes the good work?"

So we'll still be investing a fair amount of money, using that excess cash flow to return to shareholders. And the important thing -- and you've asked the question is around that it hinges on debt-to-cap between 30% and 40%. Today, we're at 35%. We're talking about incremental leverage over that next 18 months, that isn't really terribly significant. Again, we highlight that we might go a little bit above 40%, but not a lot. And again, what we've indicated is that we would seek to get back down under 40% as time goes by, because that's what we've outlined in terms of our priorities.

As this morning press release detailed, our Q3 results showed the company delivered another quarter of double-digit growth on both the top and bottom lines. And consistent with positive demand trends in U.S. housing, we realized one of our largest increases in sign-ups in recent years, up 17% in units and 25% in dollar value, as our business continues to benefit from the increased land investments we made in recent years.
Particularly encouraging is that we realized higher sales across all buyer groups, which is a great sign on the overall health of the market. Along with showing strong demand on the front end, we realized a 16% increase in deliveries for the quarter, which drove a 29% gain in top line revenues to $1.9 billion. The top line growth in business carried through to the bottom line as the company generated a significant expansion in earnings for the third quarter.
Overall, I am very pleased with the company's very strong third quarter. Before I turn over the call, however, there are a few other thoughts I'd like to offer before we get into discussing our operating results.
Since being named CEO in September, I've had the opportunity to speak with a number of shareholders, including meeting more than 60 investors during my attendance at one of the industry's larger home building conferences several weeks ago.
These conversations gave me the chance to exchange questions and comments with investors about PulteGroup, our strategy, about management and board changes, and most importantly, about the fundamentals of the housing market.
The conversations were wide-ranging. There were, however, a handful of questions which routinely came up regarding how we plan to run the business and what, if any changes, we plan to make. Given the consistent level of investor interest, I thought it appropriate to share a few of my answers with this larger group.
First, I've been with the PulteGroup for more than 15 years. Most of that time was spent in our operations, running some of our largest businesses, and more recently, as a senior officer, managing many of our corporate staff functions. In other words, I've been deeply involved in and worked closely with Richard on the development and implementation of the company's Value Creation strategy.
I've seen firsthand the significant operating and financial benefits we've realized from direct Value Creation since its launch over 5 years ago. I certainly remain an advocate of Value Creation and plan to continue operating against this strategy going forward.
That being said, I think it's appropriate to state that my background and my career experiences are unique and different from Richard's. So over time, you could see us emphasize certain things more strongly than we have in the past.
For example, having spent most of my career in the operations, I can tell you that operations is an area of particular focus, even passion for me. I am and will continue investing a lot of my time with my staff and our field leaders on finding opportunities to drive greater construction efficiencies and squeeze additional costs from our building processes. Programs such as Common Plan Management, value engineering and strategic pricing have been very successful, and we'll be working hard to build on these programs going forward.
Over the last 5 years, we have raised PulteGroup's gross margins to be arguably the best in the industry, and we certainly want to keep it that way.
Beyond the operations, we've also made progress adjusting our land portfolio to match our Value Creation goals of generating higher returns while managing our risk. I believe, however, there is more for us to accomplish.
For example, based on our trailing 12 months of deliveries, we own approximately 5.2 years of lots, which is down from 7.7 years in 2011. Over time, I would like to see this number continue to move lower, and ultimately get below 4 years, even approaching 3 years of ownership.
While this will take years to accomplish, there are actions we have implemented, which should allow our own land position to decline gradually over time. First, we are focusing our investments on shorter, faster-turning communities. Second, we are working through our larger legacy web positions, which will allow us to reduce to 7.4 years of active adult lots we own today. And third, we are well-positioned to continue to grow our unit volume, which effectively reduces our years of owned supply.
By focusing on shortening the duration of our land assets, we can accelerate inventory turns, improve returns on invested capital and reduce some of the risks inherent in the business. This will take time to accomplish, but I wanted you to understand the long-term direction for the company. 
And finally, also relating to our investment practices, I think the potential exists for us to be a little more balanced in our market position. We've clearly capitalized on the strong demand within the move-up category, but I see opportunities for us to realize a better balance across the buyer groups we serve. Today, approximately 45% of our deliveries are to move-up buyers, but at the division level, this percentage can be higher. 
Going forward, I believe we can diversify and expand our business among first-time buyers, where market demand appears to be accelerating. We will seek to replicate the success certain PulteGroup markets have achieved by building our first-time business in more markets across the country. 
On this front, I would note that approximately 40% of our land approvals in the third quarter were for first-time buyer communities, which is higher than recent quarters. 
Obviously, these are very high-level thoughts, but I wanted to provide some insights into how I view the business.
Now let me turn the call over to Bob for a review of the quarter."
294550,402855969,1057399,"PulteGroup, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2016",2016-10-20,"Earnings Calls","PulteGroup, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ryan, and good morning, everybody. As we've discussed on recent calls, 2016 reflects the growth we've expected, given our increasing land spend over the last several years. Q3 clearly continues that trend as home sale revenues grew by 29% to $1.",1767,"Thanks, Ryan, and good morning, everybody. As we've discussed on recent calls, 2016 reflects the growth we've expected, given our increasing land spend over the last several years. 
Q3 clearly continues that trend as home sale revenues grew by 29% to $1.9 billion, driven by a 16% increase in closings to 5,037 homes, combined with an 11% or $37,000 increase in average selling price to $374,000.
Consistent with our prior guidance, our deliveries of 5,037 homes represented a conversion rate of 52% in the quarter, which represents a roughly 400 basis point improvement over the third quarter of  last year. Our conversion rates have improved, but labor resources in many markets remained stressed and will likely continue to be so during this housing recovery.
Based on feedback from our division presidents, it's clear that labor availability has gotten even tighter relative to last year and continues to impact production timelines. Our decision last year to put a few more spec homes into production has turned out to be the right one, given these market dynamic. 
Looking at the fourth quarter, we currently project our conversion rate to be in the range between 62% and 64%. This represents the meaningful increase over the third quarter and is comparable with the fourth quarter of last year.We're pleased with the improvements we've made to our production cadence, especially in light of the challenging trade environment.
One item to note, however, is the potential impact of Hurricane Matthew on our operations. we fortunate that none of our employees were injured, and our communities weathered the storm extremely well, so our recovery time should be quick. This is likely not true for the local power companies, which had a lot of work in front of them restoring power and rebuilding infrastructure.
As that activity will take priority over installing meters or even bringing power to our new subdivisions, it's possible that we may face production and delivery delays in affected areas.
Looking at our closings by buyer group during the quarter, 29% were first-time; 44% were move-up; and 27% were active adult. In the comparable prior year period, the breakdown was 33% first-time; 35% move-up; and 32% active adult. The 11% gain in average sales prices for the quarter reflects the higher percentage of move-up closings as well as higher prices realized in each buyer group. In fact, our average sales price has increased 8% to $283,000 among our first-time buyers; 11% to $441,000 among our move-up buyers; and 4% to $358,000 among our active adult buyers.
With our backlog ASP showing an increase of 11% to $393,000 compared to last year, which is also up 5% from our Q3 deliveries, we expect our average selling prices to continue moving gradually higher in the coming quarters.
The company's recorded gross margin for Q3 was 21.1%, which was 10 basis points below our guidance range. Beyond [ph] margin pressure from higher absolute land cost is recycled through our land pipeline. We continued to experience labor rate inflation as it relates to both land development and house construction costs.
We had anticipated house costs to rise 1.5% to 2% this year, but labor costs are running outside of that band in many of our markets.
While we expected cost to rise at this stage of the housing cycle, market dynamics are not allowing these costs to be passed through to [indiscernible] buyers at the same rates we experienced over the past 2 years.
Assuming these conditions continue in Q4 and into 2017, we now expect Q4 margins to be in the range of 20.5% to 21%. Further, we expect this range will likely carry through to the full year 2017. As is our practice, we'll update you as the year progresses.
While our margin trends has been lower, I think it's important to highlight that we're still generating the highest margins among the big builders. As a reminder, our convention is to include sales commissions and cost of sales, while most of the industry reports commissions and SG&A. As a result, on a comparative basis, our reported gross margin present lower than our peers. On average, our commissions are approximately 350 basis points of revenue, so on a comparable basis, our reported Q3 gross margin of 21.1% would equate to 24.6%.
We believe part of the reason for our strong relative margins is our strategy to maximize the amount of lot premiums [indiscernible] our amount highest margin revenue streams.
In the third quarter, our total option revenues and lot premiums increased 9% over last year to approximately $71,000 per closing.
Sales discounts in the third quarter were 2.7% of sales, which is flat with Q2 this year and up about 70 basis points from last year,  where the roughly $10,000 per home certainly remained modest.
SG&A expenses in the third quarter was $183 million or 9.7% of home sale revenues.  Included in this total are $8 million of severance cost associated with actions taken in the quarter to reduce overhead expenses.
Among the actions we took was a reduction in our work force of approximately 350 people. The majority of those reductions took place in our corporate or area structures. Many of those roles has been established at the outset of our Value Creation efforts, but could be cut back us related initiatives are now part of standard operating procedures. In implementing these actions, we were obviously very careful to ensure we didn't hinder the ability of our field operations to manage what we expect to be a growing volume business in 2017 and beyond.
Also included in this quarter's SG&A were approximately $4 million of costs with shareholders activities. Having successfully reached agreements to 2 of our larger shareholders, we expect these costs to drop materially going forward.
As a reminder, on our last call, we discussed plans to cut SG&A cost from the expected 10% of revenues in 2016 to a target of 9% in 2017. All significant activity related to the actions to achieve our targeted spend level in 2017 were completed during the quarter.
Last year's third quarter SG&A spend of $159 million or 10.9% of revenues included a $6 million benefit associated with the reserve adjustment taken in the period.
In the third quarter of this year, we also reported $20 million of charges within other expenses net. This includes a $15 million charge due to the settlement of a dispute over a land transaction that we terminated a decade ago with the collapse of the housing market, in addition to $5 million of reset [ph] and related costs taken in connection with our SG&A reduction efforts.
Financial services, during the quarter, generated pretax income of $21 million, up from $14 million last year as it benefited primarily from higher construction volumes in our homebuilding operations.
Mortgage capture rate for the quarter was 81% compared to 83% last year. Our tax rate in the quarter was 39.5%, which compares to our prior guidance of 38%. The increase related to adjustments to our deferred tax assets resulting from changes in certain state tax rates, which impacted our reported earnings by $0.01 per share.
Reported net income for the quarter was $128 million or $0.37 per share, which includes $31 million of pretax charges I detailed. That reduced our reported earnings per share by $0.06 per share.
Earnings per share for the quarter was calculated using approximately 342 million shares outstanding, which is down 3% from last year, resulting largely from share repurchase activities.
Looking at our homebuilding operations, we had 9,235 homes under construction at the end of the third quarter, which is up 18% over last year. Consistent with our strategy to increase specs but at a controlled rate, specs were 24% of Q3 homes under construction, which is up from 17% in Q3 of last year but effectively flat on a sequential basis from the second quarter of this year. We ended the quarter with 600 finished specs or less than 1 per community, which is up only slightly from the second quarter of this year.
We recorded 4,775 sign-ups during the third quarter, which represents an increase of 17% over the prior year. On a dollar basis, sign-ups increased an even greater 25% to $1.8 billion.
Looking at our sign-ups by buyer group. First time increased 8%, move-up increased 30% and active adult increased 9%. Adjusting for changes in community count, our absorption pace has increased 4% for the first-time buyers and 14% among active adult buyers, but were lower by 4% among move-up buyers. Beyond the impact from our Wieland communities, which has low absorption paces given their higher prices, some divisions have noted move-up buyers are taking longer to sign contracts. 
During the third quarter, we operated from 709 committees, which is up 16% over last year. The year-over-year increase is consistent with prior guidance for community count growth over the prior year in the range of 10% to 15%.
We remain active in the land acquisition arena. During the third quarter, we approved approximately 3,100 lots for purchase. At the end of the September, we owned approximately 102,000 lots and controlled an additional 43,000 lots via option. In total, we spent $266 million on land acquisition during the quarter, which brings our 9-month spend to approximately $910 million, excluding our purchase of the Wieland assets.
During the quarter, we also repurchased 12 million of our shares, representing just over 3% of our outstanding float for $250 million or $20.77 per share. This brings our total repurchase activity during 2016 to approximately 18 million shares for $350 million.
As we discussed on our Q2 call, we plan to continue to return excess funds to shareholders, subject to market conditions, through the repurchase of an additional $250 million of shares in Q4 and $1 billion in 2017.
In July, we raised $1 billion of 5- and 10-year debt at very attractive rates. Proceeds from the transaction were used to repay approximately $500 million of outstanding debt as well as to help fund our operations and our share repurchase activities. 
We ended the quarter with a debt to cap ratio of 40%, which is within the 30% to 40% range we seek to operate in. Depending upon the timing of future share repurchases, we may move above 40%, but expected future earnings should work to quickly delever our overall capital structure.
We ended the quarter with $461 million of cash, which resulted in a net debt to cap ratio of 36%.
Now let me turn the call over to Ryan for some comments on market conditions. Ryan?"

While there can be conflicting signals from period-to-period across the variety of metrics people track, I think most feel that economic conditions are improving, albeit at a slower pace than most would like.
Recent moves higher by 10-year treasury rates further suggest that the economy continues to get stronger. Certainly, the sizable gains seen in recent U.S. new home sales data supports the position that housing remains on a sustained path of recovery. As has been the case for the past several years, demand is being aided by low unemployment, job formations, a low interest rate environment and generally favorable supply dynamics.
With a 17% increase in units and a 25% increase in dollars, PulteGroup's third quarter sign-up data tracks to move higher in the broader housing market, and the anecdotal comments from our field reinforced the view that while there can be volatility from point-to-point, the overall trend is for modestly higher volume. 
For example, looking at the demand conditions in the quarter on a regional basis, we saw the following: strong demand in Florida and much of the Southeast, although Charlotte and Raleigh were a little bit choppy during the quarter at some of the higher price points. We didn't see much change in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast markets, where we're having to compete for each new sign-up. We have our eyes opened for any possible acceleration in D.C. once we get through the election cycle. Our Midwest and Texas operations continue to see strong demand conditions across the markets and throughout the quarter. As we said before, Houston has held up much better than expected, and given the recent rise in oil prices, it could be that the worst has already passed. Finally, in the Western 1/3 of the country, demand was solid throughout the quarter as we continued to experience good sign-up paces in our major markets of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Northern and Southern California.
Through the first few weeks of October, demand appears to be on its normal seasonal track. 
Overall, we are very pleased with Q3, and more broadly, the first 9 months of the year as we were able to get new communities opened, and they were met with strong buyer interest. With over 9,400 homes in backlog, we are well-positioned to complete a very strong 2016.
Let me close by saying it's a positive to have reached a resolution with 2 of our major shareholders and to have removed any uncertainties related to company leadership as we've successfully completed our announced CEO transition. Now we can focus conversations on talking about the business. As you read this morning and you heard in our comments, there are a lot of positives to discuss. 
And finally, I want to say thank you to the employees of PulteGroup. You've done an amazing job staying focused on serving our customers and delivering great quality homes.

As this morning press release detailed, our Q3 results showed the company delivered another quarter of double-digit growth on both the top and bottom lines. And consistent with positive demand trends in U.S. housing, we realized one of our largest increases in sign-ups in recent years, up 17% in units and 25% in dollar value, as our business continues to benefit from the increased land investments we made in recent years.
Particularly encouraging is that we realized higher sales across all buyer groups, which is a great sign on the overall health of the market. Along with showing strong demand on the front end, we realized a 16% increase in deliveries for the quarter, which drove a 29% gain in top line revenues to $1.9 billion. The top line growth in business carried through to the bottom line as the company generated a significant expansion in earnings for the third quarter.
Overall, I am very pleased with the company's very strong third quarter. Before I turn over the call, however, there are a few other thoughts I'd like to offer before we get into discussing our operating results.
Since being named CEO in September, I've had the opportunity to speak with a number of shareholders, including meeting more than 60 investors during my attendance at one of the industry's larger home building conferences several weeks ago.
These conversations gave me the chance to exchange questions and comments with investors about PulteGroup, our strategy, about management and board changes, and most importantly, about the fundamentals of the housing market.
The conversations were wide-ranging. There were, however, a handful of questions which routinely came up regarding how we plan to run the business and what, if any changes, we plan to make. Given the consistent level of investor interest, I thought it appropriate to share a few of my answers with this larger group.
First, I've been with the PulteGroup for more than 15 years. Most of that time was spent in our operations, running some of our largest businesses, and more recently, as a senior officer, managing many of our corporate staff functions. In other words, I've been deeply involved in and worked closely with Richard on the development and implementation of the company's Value Creation strategy.
I've seen firsthand the significant operating and financial benefits we've realized from direct Value Creation since its launch over 5 years ago. I certainly remain an advocate of Value Creation and plan to continue operating against this strategy going forward.
That being said, I think it's appropriate to state that my background and my career experiences are unique and different from Richard's. So over time, you could see us emphasize certain things more strongly than we have in the past.
For example, having spent most of my career in the operations, I can tell you that operations is an area of particular focus, even passion for me. I am and will continue investing a lot of my time with my staff and our field leaders on finding opportunities to drive greater construction efficiencies and squeeze additional costs from our building processes. Programs such as Common Plan Management, value engineering and strategic pricing have been very successful, and we'll be working hard to build on these programs going forward.
Over the last 5 years, we have raised PulteGroup's gross margins to be arguably the best in the industry, and we certainly want to keep it that way.
Beyond the operations, we've also made progress adjusting our land portfolio to match our Value Creation goals of generating higher returns while managing our risk. I believe, however, there is more for us to accomplish.
For example, based on our trailing 12 months of deliveries, we own approximately 5.2 years of lots, which is down from 7.7 years in 2011. Over time, I would like to see this number continue to move lower, and ultimately get below 4 years, even approaching 3 years of ownership.
While this will take years to accomplish, there are actions we have implemented, which should allow our own land position to decline gradually over time. First, we are focusing our investments on shorter, faster-turning communities. Second, we are working through our larger legacy web positions, which will allow us to reduce to 7.4 years of active adult lots we own today. And third, we are well-positioned to continue to grow our unit volume, which effectively reduces our years of owned supply.
By focusing on shortening the duration of our land assets, we can accelerate inventory turns, improve returns on invested capital and reduce some of the risks inherent in the business. This will take time to accomplish, but I wanted you to understand the long-term direction for the company. 
And finally, also relating to our investment practices, I think the potential exists for us to be a little more balanced in our market position. We've clearly capitalized on the strong demand within the move-up category, but I see opportunities for us to realize a better balance across the buyer groups we serve. Today, approximately 45% of our deliveries are to move-up buyers, but at the division level, this percentage can be higher. 
Going forward, I believe we can diversify and expand our business among first-time buyers, where market demand appears to be accelerating. We will seek to replicate the success certain PulteGroup markets have achieved by building our first-time business in more markets across the country. 
On this front, I would note that approximately 40% of our land approvals in the third quarter were for first-time buyer communities, which is higher than recent quarters. 
Obviously, these are very high-level thoughts, but I wanted to provide some insights into how I view the business.
Now let me turn the call over to Bob for a review of the quarter."
294550,402855969,1057689,"PulteGroup, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2016",2016-10-20,"Earnings Calls","PulteGroup, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ryan, and good morning, everybody. As we've discussed on recent calls, 2016 reflects the growth we've expected, given our increasing land spend over the last several years. Q3 clearly continues that trend as home sale revenues grew by 29% to $1.",1765,"Thanks, Ryan, and good morning, everybody. As we've discussed on recent calls, 2016 reflects the growth we've expected, given our increasing land spend over the last several years. 
Q3 clearly continues that trend as home sale revenues grew by 29% to $1.9 billion, driven by a 16% increase in closings to 5,037 homes, combined with an 11% or $37,000 increase in average selling price to $374,000.
Consistent with our prior guidance, our deliveries of 5,037 homes represented a conversion rate of 52% in the quarter, which represents a roughly 400 basis point improvement over the third quarter of  last year. Our conversion rates have improved, but labor resources in many markets remained stressed and will likely continue to be so during this housing recovery.
Based on feedback from our division presidents, it's clear that labor availability has gotten even tighter relative to last year and continues to impact production timelines. Our decision last year to put a few more spec homes into production has turned out to be the right one, given these market dynamic. 
Looking at the fourth quarter, we currently project our conversion rate to be in the range between 62% and 64%. This represents the meaningful increase over the third quarter and is comparable with the fourth quarter of last year.We're pleased with the improvements we've made to our production cadence, especially in light of the challenging trade environment.
One item to note, however, is the potential impact of Hurricane Matthew on our operations. we fortunate that none of our employees were injured, and our communities weathered the storm extremely well, so our recovery time should be quick. This is likely not true for the local power companies, which had a lot of work in front of them restoring power and rebuilding infrastructure.
As that activity will take priority over installing meters or even bringing power to our new subdivisions, it's possible that we may face production and delivery delays in affected areas.
Looking at our closings by buyer group during the quarter, 29% were first-time; 44% were move-up; and 27% were active adult. In the comparable prior year period, the breakdown was 33% first-time; 35% move-up; and 32% active adult. The 11% gain in average sales prices for the quarter reflects the higher percentage of move-up closings as well as higher prices realized in each buyer group. In fact, our average sales price has increased 8% to $283,000 among our first-time buyers; 11% to $441,000 among our move-up buyers; and 4% to $358,000 among our active adult buyers.
With our backlog ASP showing an increase of 11% to $393,000 compared to last year, which is also up 5% from our Q3 deliveries, we expect our average selling prices to continue moving gradually higher in the coming quarters.
The company's recorded gross margin for Q3 was 21.1%, which was 10 basis points below our guidance range. Beyond margin pressure from higher absolute land cost is recycled through our land pipeline. We continued to experience labor rate inflation as it relates to both land development and house construction costs.
We had anticipated house costs to rise 1.5% to 2% this year, but labor costs are running outside of that band in many of our markets.
While we expected cost to rise at this stage of the housing cycle, market dynamics are not allowing these costs to be passed through to [indiscernible] buyers at the same rates we experienced over the past 2 years.
Assuming these conditions continue in Q4 and into 2017, we now expect Q4 margins to be in the range of 20.5% to 21%. Further, we expect this range will likely carry through to the full year 2017. As is our practice, we'll update you as the year progresses.
While our margin trends has been lower, I think it's important to highlight that we're still generating the highest margins among the big builders. As a reminder, our convention is to include sales commissions and cost of sales, while most of the industry reports commissions and SG&A. As a result, on a comparative basis, our reported gross margin present lower than our peers. On average, our commissions are approximately 350 basis points of revenue, so on a comparable basis, our reported Q3 gross margin of 21.1% would equate to 24.6%.
We believe part of the reason for our strong relative margins is our strategy to maximize the amount of lot premiums [indiscernible] our amount highest margin revenue streams.
In the third quarter, our total option revenues and lot premiums increased 9% over last year to approximately $71,000 per closing.
Sales discounts in the third quarter were 2.7% of sales, which is flat with Q2 this year and up about 70 basis points from last year,  where the roughly $10,000 per home certainly remained modest.
SG&A expenses in the third quarter was $183 million or 9.7% of home sale revenues.  Included in this total are $8 million of severance cost associated with actions taken in the quarter to reduce overhead expenses.
Among the actions we took was a reduction in our work force of approximately 350 people. The majority of those reductions took place in our corporate or area structures. Many of those roles has been established at the outset of our Value Creation efforts, but could be cut back us related initiatives are now part of standard operating procedures. In implementing these actions, we were obviously very careful to ensure we didn't hinder the ability of our field operations to manage what we expect to be a growing volume business in 2017 and beyond.
Also included in this quarter's SG&A were approximately $4 million of costs with shareholders activities. Having successfully reached agreements to 2 of our larger shareholders, we expect these costs to drop materially going forward.
As a reminder, on our last call, we discussed plans to cut SG&A cost from the expected 10% of revenues in 2016 to a target of 9% in 2017. All significant activity related to the actions to achieve our targeted spend level in 2017 were completed during the quarter.
Last year's third quarter SG&A spend of $159 million or 10.9% of revenues included a $6 million benefit associated with the reserve adjustment taken in the period.
In the third quarter of this year, we also reported $20 million of charges within other expenses net. This includes a $15 million charge due to the settlement of a dispute over a land transaction that we terminated a decade ago with the collapse of the housing market, in addition to $5 million of [indiscernible] and related costs taken in connection with our SG&A reduction efforts.
Financial services, during the quarter, generated pretax income of $21 million, up from $14 million last year as it benefited primarily from higher construction volumes in our homebuilding operations.
Mortgage capture rate for the quarter was 81% compared to 83% last year. Our tax rate in the quarter was 39.5%, which compares to our prior guidance of 38%. The increase related to adjustments to our deferred tax assets resulting from changes in certain state tax rates, which impacted our reported earnings by $0.01 per share.
Reported net income for the quarter was $128 million or $0.37 per share, which includes $31 million of pretax charges I detailed. That reduced our reported earnings per share by $0.06 per share.
Earnings per share for the quarter was calculated using approximately 342 million shares outstanding, which is down 3% from last year, resulting largely from share repurchase activities.
Looking at our homebuilding operations, we had 9,235 homes under construction at the end of the third quarter, which is up 18% over last year. Consistent with our strategy to increase specs but at a controlled rate, specs were 24% of Q3 homes under construction, which is up from 17% in Q3 of last year but effectively flat on a sequential basis from the second quarter of this year. We ended the quarter with 600 finished specs or less than 1 per community, which is up only slightly from the second quarter of this year.
We recorded 4,775 sign-ups during the third quarter, which represents an increase of 17% over the prior year. On a dollar basis, sign-ups increased an even greater 25% to $1.8 billion.
Looking at our sign-ups by buyer group. First time increased 8%, move-up increased 30% and active adult increased 9%. Adjusting for changes in community count, our absorption pace has increased 4% for the first-time buyers and 14% among active adult buyers, but were lower by 4% among move-up buyers. Beyond the impact from our Wieland communities, which has low absorption paces given their higher prices, some divisions have noted move-up buyers are taking longer to sign contracts. 
During the third quarter, we operated from 709 committees, which is up 16% over last year. The year-over-year increase is consistent with prior guidance for community count growth over the prior year in the range of 10% to 15%.
We remain active in the land acquisition arena. During the third quarter, we approved approximately 3,100 lots for purchase. At the end of the September, we owned approximately 102,000 lots and controlled an additional 43,000 lots via option. In total, we spent $266 million on land acquisition during the quarter, which brings our 9-month spend to approximately $910 million, excluding our purchase of the Wieland assets.
During the quarter, we also repurchased 12 million of our shares, representing just over 3% of our outstanding float for $250 million or $20.77 per share. This brings our total repurchase activity during 2016 to approximately 18 million shares for $350 million.
As we discussed on our Q2 call, we plan to continue to return excess funds to shareholders, subject to market conditions, through the repurchase of an additional $250 million of shares in Q4 and $1 billion in 2017.
In July, we raised $1 billion of 5- and 10-year debt at very attractive rates. Proceeds from the transaction were used to repay approximately $500 million of outstanding debt as well as to help fund our operations and our share repurchase activities. 
We ended the quarter with a debt to cap ratio of 40%, which is within the 30% to 40% range we seek to operate in. Depending upon the timing of future share repurchases, we may move above 40%, but expected future earnings should work to quickly delever our overall capital structure.
We ended the quarter with $461 million of cash, which resulted in a net debt to cap ratio of 36%.
Now let me turn the call over to Ryan for some comments on market conditions. Ryan?"

While there can be conflicting signals from period-to-period across the variety of metrics people track, I think most feel that economic conditions are improving, albeit at a slower pace than most would like.
Recent moves higher by 10-year treasury rates further suggest that the economy continues to get stronger. Certainly, the sizable gains seen in recent U.S. new home sales data supports the position that housing remains on a sustained path of recovery. As has been the case for the past several years, demand is being aided by low unemployment, job formations, a low interest rate environment and generally favorable supply dynamics.
With a 17% increase in units and a 25% increase in dollars, PulteGroup's third quarter sign-up data tracks to move higher in the broader housing market, and the anecdotal comments from our field reinforced the view that while there can be volatility from point-to-point, the overall trend is for modestly higher volume. 
For example, looking at the demand conditions in the quarter on a regional basis, we saw the following: strong demand in Florida and much of the Southeast, although Charlotte and Raleigh were a little bit choppy during the quarter at some of the higher price points. We didn't see much change in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast markets, where we're having to compete for each new sign-up. We have our eyes opened for any possible acceleration in D.C. once we get through the election cycle. Our Midwest and Texas operations continue to see strong demand conditions across the markets and throughout the quarter. As we said before, Houston has held up much better than expected, and given the recent rise in oil prices, it could be that the worst has already passed. Finally, in the Western 1/3 of the country, demand was solid throughout the quarter as we continued to experience good sign-up paces in our major markets of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Northern and Southern California.
Through the first few weeks of October, demand appears to be on its normal seasonal track. 
Overall, we are very pleased with Q3, and more broadly, the first 9 months of the year as we were able to get new communities opened, and they were met with strong buyer interest. With over 9,400 homes in backlog, we are well-positioned to complete a very strong 2016.
Let me close by saying it's a positive to have reached a resolution with 2 of our major shareholders and to have removed any uncertainties related to company leadership as we've successfully completed our announced CEO transition. Now we can focus conversations on talking about the business. As you read this morning and you heard in our comments, there are a lot of positives to discuss. 
And finally, I want to say thank you to the employees of PulteGroup. You've done an amazing job staying focused on serving our customers and delivering great quality homes.

In that vein, I wanted to ask you for a little bit of clarity about your land spend. First of all, I don't think I got that development number, so if you could just give us the specific, what the land spend was in the quarter. And then with respect to this 40% on the spend that was on first-time buyers in the quarter, can you help us understand how much of this stuff is the land that you're buying? Is what you might consider a stereotypical -- stereotypically located in first-time community more sort of out in the outer fringe versus maybe some of the stuff that's a little closer in maybe different kind of first-time buyer community?"

And then for your question on that first-time buyer, yes, we've been pretty clear that we're not out in the exurbs, chasing volume in that space. So we're typically going to be a little bit closer in, we're typically going to be a little bit higher price point that more affluent, millennial, first-time buyers, a little bit older, partnered, might have 2 incomes. So I don't think we have changed at all what we had expressed that first-time business means to us. It's just that with the acceleration of that business, we're seeing more opportunities to invest. And so  of the approvals, and that's not necessarily cash flow, that's just approvals. So the cash will be spent at some point in the future [indiscernible] as we move in that first-time space."

As this morning press release detailed, our Q3 results showed the company delivered another quarter of double-digit growth on both the top and bottom lines. And consistent with positive demand trends in U.S. housing, we realized one of our largest increases in sign-ups in recent years, up 17% in units and 25% in dollar value, as our business continues to benefit from the increased land investments we made in recent years.
Particularly encouraging is that we realized higher sales across all buyer groups, which is a great sign on the overall health of the market. Along with showing strong demand on the front end, we realized a 16% increase in deliveries for the quarter, which drove a 29% gain in top line revenues to $1.9 billion. The top line growth in business carried through to the bottom line as the company generated a significant expansion in earnings for the third quarter.
Overall, I am very pleased with the company's very strong third quarter. Before I turn over the call, however, there are a few other thoughts I'd like to offer before we get into discussing our operating results.
Since being named CEO in September, I've had the opportunity to speak with a number of shareholders, including meeting more than 60 investors during my attendance at one of the industry's larger home building conferences several weeks ago.
These conversations gave me the chance to exchange questions and comments with investors about PulteGroup, our strategy, about management and board changes, and most importantly, about the fundamentals of the housing market.
The conversations were wide-ranging. There were, however, a handful of questions which routinely came up regarding how we plan to run the business and what, if any changes, we plan to make. Given the consistent level of investor interest, I thought it appropriate to share a few of my answers with this larger group.
First, I've been with the PulteGroup for more than 15 years. Most of that time was spent in our operations, running some of our largest businesses, and more recently, as a senior officer, managing many of our corporate staff functions. In other words, I've been deeply involved in and worked closely with Richard on the development and implementation of the company's Value Creation strategy.
I've seen firsthand the significant operating and financial benefits we've realized from direct Value Creation since its launch over 5 years ago. I certainly remain an advocate of Value Creation and plan to continue operating against this strategy going forward.
That being said, I think it's appropriate to state that my background and my career experiences are unique and different from Richard's. So over time, you could see us emphasize certain things more strongly than we have in the past.
For example, having spent most of my career in the operations, I can tell you that operations is an area of particular focus, even passion for me. I am and will continue investing a lot of my time with my staff and our field leaders on finding opportunities to drive greater construction efficiencies and squeeze additional costs from our building processes. Programs such as Common Plan Management, value engineering and strategic pricing have been very successful, and we'll be working hard to build on these programs going forward.
Over the last 5 years, we have raised PulteGroup's gross margins to be arguably the best in the industry, and we certainly want to keep it that way.
Beyond the operations, we've also made progress adjusting our land portfolio to match our Value Creation goals of generating higher returns while managing our risk. I believe, however, there is more for us to accomplish.
For example, based on our trailing 12 months of deliveries, we own approximately 5.2 years of lots, which is down from 7.7 years in 2011. Over time, I would like to see this number continue to move lower, and ultimately get below 4 years, even approaching 3 years of ownership.
While this will take years to accomplish, there are actions we have implemented, which should allow our own land position to decline gradually over time. First, we are focusing our investments on shorter, faster-turning communities. Second, we are working through our larger legacy web positions, which will allow us to reduce to 7.4 years of active adult lots we own today. And third, we are well-positioned to continue to grow our unit volume, which effectively reduces our years of own supply.
By focusing on shortening the duration of our land assets, we can accelerate inventory turns, improve returns on invested capital and reduce some of the risks inherent in the business. This will take time to accomplish, but I wanted you to understand the long-term direction for the company. 
And finally, also relating to our investment practices, I think the potential exists for us to be a little more balanced in our market position. We've clearly capitalized on the strong demand within the move-up category, but I see opportunities for us to realize a better balance across the buyer groups we serve. Today, approximately 45% of our deliveries are to move-up buyers, but at the division level, this percentage can be higher. 
Going forward, I believe we can diversify and expand our business among first-time buyers, where market demand appears to be accelerating. We will seek to replicate the success certain PulteGroup markets have achieved by building our first-time business in more markets across the country. 
On this front, I would note that approximately 40% of our land approvals in the third quarter were for first-time buyer communities, which is higher than recent quarters. 
Obviously, these are very high-level thoughts, but I wanted to provide some insights into how I view the business.
Now let me turn the call over to Bob for a review of the quarter."
294550,402855969,1057925,"PulteGroup, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2016",2016-10-20,"Earnings Calls","PulteGroup, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ryan, and good morning, everybody. As we've discussed on recent calls, 2016 reflects the growth we've expected, given our increasing land spend over the last several years. Q3 clearly continues that trend as home sale revenues grew by 29% to $1.",1776,"Thanks, Ryan, and good morning, everybody. As we've discussed on recent calls, 2016 reflects the growth we've expected, given our increasing land spend over the last several years. 
Q3 clearly continues that trend as home sale revenues grew by 29% to $1.9 billion, driven by a 16% increase in closings to 5,037 homes, combined with an 11% or $37,000 increase in average selling price to $374,000.
Consistent with our prior guidance, our deliveries of 5,037 homes represented a conversion rate of 52% in the quarter, which represents a roughly 400 basis point improvement over the third quarter of  last year. Our conversion rates have improved, but labor resources in many markets remained stressed and will likely continue to be so during this housing recovery.
Based on feedback from our division presidents, it's clear that labor availability has gotten even tighter relative to last year and continues to impact production timelines. Our decision last year to put a few more spec homes into production has turned out to be the right one, given these market dynamics.
Looking at the fourth quarter, we currently project our conversion rate to be in the range between 62% and 64%. This represents the meaningful increase over the third quarter and is comparable with the fourth quarter of last year.We're pleased with the improvements we've made to our production cadence, especially in light of the challenging trade environment.
One item to note, however, is the potential impact of Hurricane Matthew on our operations. we fortunate that none of our employees were injured, and our communities weathered the storm extremely well, so our recovery time should be quick. This is likely not true for the local power companies, which had a lot of work in front of them restoring power and rebuilding infrastructure.
As that activity will take priority over installing meters or even bringing power to our new subdivisions, it's possible that we may face production and delivery delays in affected areas.
Looking at our closings by buyer group during the quarter, 29% were first-time; 44% were move-up; and 27% were active adult. In the comparable prior year period, the breakdown was 33% first-time; 35% move-up; and 32% active adult. The 11% gain in average sales prices for the quarter reflects the higher percentage of move-up closings as well as higher prices realized in each buyer group. In fact, our average sales price has increased 8% to $283,000 among our first-time buyers; 11% to $441,000 among our move-up buyers; and 4% to $358,000 among our active adult buyers.
With our backlog ASP showing an increase of 11% to $393,000 compared to last year, which is also up 5% from our Q3 deliveries, we expect our average selling prices to continue moving gradually higher in the coming quarters.
The company's recorded gross margin for Q3 was 21.1%, which was 10 basis points below our guidance range. Beyond margin pressure from higher absolute land cost is recycled through our land pipeline. We continued to experience labor rate inflation as it relates to both land development and house construction costs.
We had anticipated house costs to rise 1.5% to 2% this year, but labor costs are running outside of that band in many of our markets.
While we expected cost to rise at this stage of the housing cycle, market dynamics are not allowing these costs to be passed through to [indiscernible] home buyers at the same rates we experienced over the past 2 years.
Assuming these conditions continue in Q4 and into 2017, we now expect Q4 margins to be in the range of 20.5% to 21%. Further, we expect this range will likely carry through to the full year 2017. As is our practice, we'll update you as the year progresses.
While our margin trends has been lower, I think it's important to highlight that we're still generating the highest margins among the big builders. As a reminder, our convention is to include sales commissions and cost of sales, while most of the industry reports commissions and SG&A. As a result, on a comparative basis, our reported gross margin present lower than our peers. On average, our commissions are approximately 350 basis points of revenue, so on a comparable basis, our reported Q3 gross margin of 21.1% would equate to 24.6%.
We believe part of the reason for our strong relative margins is our strategy to maximize the amount of lot premiums and not having to use [indiscernible] to increase the amount of our highest margin revenue streams.
In the third quarter, our total option revenues and lot premiums increased 9% over last year to approximately $71,000 per closing.
Sales discounts in the third quarter were 2.7% of sales, which is flat with Q2 this year and up about 70 basis points from last year,  where the roughly $10,000 per home certainly remained modest.
SG&A expenses in the third quarter was $183 million or 9.7% of home sale revenues.  Included in this total are $8 billion of severance cost associated with actions taken in the quarter to reduce overhead expenses.
Among the actions we took was a reduction in our work force of approximately 350 people. The majority of those reductions took place in our corporate or area structures. Many of those roles has been established at the outset of our Value Creation efforts, but could be cut back us related initiatives are now part of standard operating procedures. In implementing these actions, we were obviously very careful to ensure we didn't hinder the ability of our field operations to manage what we expect to be a growing volume business in 2017 and beyond.
Also included in this quarter's SG&A were approximately $4 million of costs with shareholders activities. Having successfully reached agreements to 2 of our larger shareholders, we expect these costs to drop materially going forward.
As a reminder, on our last call, we discussed plans to cut SG&A cost from the expected 10% of revenues in 2016 to a target of 9% in 2017. All significant activity related to the actions to achieve our targeted spend level in 2017 were completed during the quarter.
Last year's third quarter SG&A spend of $159 million or 10.9% of revenues included a $6 million benefit associated with the reserve adjustment taken in the period.
In the third quarter of this year, we also reported $20 million of charges within other expenses net. This includes a $15 million charge due to the settlement of a dispute over a land transaction that we terminated a decade ago with the collapse of the housing market, in addition to $5 million of lease exit and related costs taken in connection with our SG&A reduction efforts.
Financial services, during the quarter, generated pretax income of $21 million, up from $14 million last year as it benefited primarily from higher construction volumes in our homebuilding operations.
Mortgage capture rate for the quarter was 81% compared to 83% last year. Our tax rate in the quarter was 39.5%, which compares to our prior guidance of 38%. The increase related to adjustments to our deferred tax assets resulting from changes in certain state tax rates, which impacted our reported earnings by $0.01 per share.
Reported net income for the quarter was $128 million or $0.37 per share, which includes $31 million of pretax charges I detailed. That reduced our reported earnings per share by $0.06 per share.
Earnings per share for the quarter was calculated using approximately 342 million shares outstanding, which is down 3% from last year, resulting largely from share repurchase activities.
Looking at our homebuilding operations, we had 9,235 homes under construction at the end of the third quarter, which is up 18% over last year. Consistent with our strategy to increase specs but at a controlled rate, specs were 24% of Q3 homes under construction, which is up from 17% in Q3 of last year but effectively flat on a sequential basis from the second quarter of this year. We ended the quarter with 600 finished specs or less than 1 per community, which is up only slightly from the second quarter of this year.
We recorded 4,775 sign-ups during the third quarter, which represents an increase of 17% over the prior year. On a dollar basis, sign-ups increased an even greater 25% to $1.8 billion.
Looking at our sign-ups by buyer group. First time increased 8%, move-up increased 30% and active adult increased 9%. Adjusting for changes in community count, our absorption pace has increased 4% for the first-time buyers and 14% among active adult buyers, but were lower by 4% among move-up buyers. Beyond the impact from our Wieland communities, which has slow absorption paces given their higher prices, some divisions have noted move-up buyers are taking longer to sign contracts. 
During the third quarter, we operated from 709 committees, which is up 16% over last year. The year-over-year increase is consistent with prior guidance for community count growth over the prior year in the range of 10% to 15%.
We remain active in the land acquisition arena. During the third quarter, we approved approximately 3,100 lots for purchase. At the end of the September, we owned approximately 102,000 lots and controlled an additional 43,000 lots via option. In total, we spent $266 million on land acquisition during the quarter, which brings our 9-month spend to approximately $910 million, excluding our purchase of the Wieland assets.
During the quarter, we also repurchased 12 million of our shares, representing just over 3% of our outstanding float for $250 million or $20.77 per share. This brings our total repurchase activity during 2016 to approximately 18 million shares for $350 million.
As we discussed on our Q2 call, we plan to continue to return excess funds to shareholders, subject to market conditions, through the repurchase of an additional $250 million of shares in Q4 and $1 billion in 2017.
In July, we raised $1 billion of 5- and 10-year debt at very attractive rates. Proceeds from the transaction were used to repay approximately $500 million of outstanding debt as well as to help fund our operations and our share repurchase activities. 
We ended the quarter with a debt to cap ratio of 40%, which is within the 30% to 40% range we seek to operate in. Depending upon the timing of future share repurchases, we may move above 40%, but expected future earnings should work to quickly delever our overall capital structure.
We ended the quarter with $461 million of cash, which resulted in a net debt to cap ratio of 36%.

While there can be conflicting signals from period-to-period across the variety of metrics people track, I think most feel that economic conditions are improving, albeit at a slower pace than most would like.
Recent moves higher by 10-year treasury rates further suggest that the economy continues to get stronger. Certainly, the sizable gains seen in recent U.S. new home sales data supports the position that housing remains on a sustained path of recovery. As has been the case for the past several years, demand is being aided by low unemployment, job formations, a low interest rate environment and generally favorable supply dynamics.
With a 17% increase in units and a 25% increase in dollars, PulteGroup's third quarter sign-up data tracks to move higher in the broader housing market, and the anecdotal comments from our field reinforced the view that while there can be volatility from point-to-point, the overall trend is for modestly higher volume. 
For example, looking at the demand conditions in the quarter on a regional basis, we saw the following: strong demand in Florida and much of the Southeast, although Charlotte and Raleigh were a little bit choppy during the quarter at some of the higher price points. We didn't see much change in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast markets, where we're having to compete for each new sign-up. We have our eyes opened for any possible acceleration in D.C. once we get through the election cycle. Our Midwest and Texas operations continue to see strong demand conditions across the markets and throughout the quarter. As we said before, Houston has held up much better than expected, and given the recent rise in oil prices, it could be that the worst has already passed. Finally, in the Western 1/3 of the country, demand was solid throughout the quarter as we continued to experience good sign-up paces in our major markets of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Northern and Southern California.
Through the first few weeks of October, demand appears to be on its normal seasonal track. 
Overall, we are very pleased with Q3, and more broadly, the first 9 months of the year as we were able to get new communities opened, and they were met with strong buyer interest. With over 9,400 homes in backlog, we are well-positioned to complete a very strong 2016.
Let me close by saying it's a positive to have reached a resolution with 2 of our major shareholders and to have removed any uncertainties related to company leadership as we've successfully completed our announced CEO transition. Now we can focus conversations on talking about the business. As you read this morning and you heard in our comments, there are a lot of positives to discuss.

So there's a bit of concern out there that pushing volumes be up absorptions rather than community count could accelerate some gross margin slippage.

The other piece, in terms of kind of overall demand, we like where the housing market is quite a bit. When you look at overall new home sales this year, somewhere in the 575,000 to 600,000 range, we believe we're still under historical norms and historical equilibriums.

So we're typically going to be a little bit closer in, we're typically going to be a little bit higher price point that more affluent, millennial, first-time buyers, a little bit older, partnered, might have 2 incomes.

As this morning press release detailed, our Q3 results showed the company delivered another quarter of double-digit growth on both the top and bottom lines. And consistent with positive demand trends in U.S. housing, we realized one of our largest increases in sign-ups in recent years, up 17% in units and 25% in dollar value, as our business continues to benefit from the increased land investments we made in recent years.
Particularly encouraging is that we realized higher sales across all buyer groups, which is a great sign on the overall health of the market. Along with showing strong demand on the front end, we realized a 16% increase in deliveries for the quarter, which drove a 29% gain in top line revenues to $1.9 billion. The top line growth in business carried through to the bottom line as the company generated a significant expansion in earnings for the third quarter.
Overall, I am very pleased with the company's very strong third quarter. Before I turn over the call, however, there are a few other thoughts I'd like to offer before we get into discussing our operating results.
Since being named CEO in September, I've had the opportunity to speak with a number of shareholders, including meeting more than 60 investors during my attendance at one of the industry's larger home building conferences several weeks ago.
These conversations gave me the chance to exchange questions and comments with investors about PulteGroup, our strategy, about management and board changes, and most importantly, about the fundamentals of the housing market.
The conversations were wide-ranging. There were, however, a handful of questions which routinely came up regarding how we plan to run the business and what, if any changes, we plan to make. Given the consistent level of investor interest, I thought it appropriate to share a few of my answers with this larger group.
First, I've been with the PulteGroup for more than 15 years. Most of that time was spent in our operations, running some of our largest businesses, and more recently, as a senior officer, managing many of our corporate staff functions. In other words, I've been deeply involved in and worked closely with Richard on the development and implementation of the company's Value Creation strategy.
I've seen firsthand the significant operating and financial benefits we've realized from direct Value Creation since its launch over 5 years ago. I certainly remain an advocate of Value Creation and plan to continue operating against this strategy going forward.
That being said, I think it's appropriate to state that my background and my career experiences are unique and different from Richard's. So over time, you could see us emphasize certain things more strongly than we have in the past.
For example, having spent most of my career in the operations, I can tell you that operations is an area of particular focus, even passion for me. I am and will continue investing a lot of my time with my staff and our field leaders on finding opportunities to drive greater construction efficiencies and squeeze additional costs from our building processes. Programs such as Common Plan Management, value engineering and strategic pricing have been very successful, and we'll be working hard to build on these programs going forward.
Over the last 5 years, we have raised PulteGroup's gross margins to be arguably the best in the industry, and we certainly want to keep it that way.
Beyond the operations, we've also made progress adjusting our land portfolio to match our Value Creation goals of generating higher returns while managing our risk. I believe, however, there is more for us to accomplish.
For example, based on our trailing 12 months of deliveries, we own approximately 5.2 years of lots, which is down from 7.7 years in 2011. Over time, I would like to see this number continue to move lower, and ultimately get below 4 years, even approaching 3 years of ownership.
While this will take years to accomplish, there are actions we have implemented, which should allow our own land position to decline gradually over time. First, we are focusing our investments on shorter, faster-turning communities. Second, we are working through our larger legacy web positions, which will allow us to reduce to 7.4 years of active adult lots we own today. And third, we are well-positioned to continue to grow our unit volume, which effectively reduces our years of own supply.
By focusing on shortening the duration of our land assets, we can accelerate inventory turns, improve returns on invested capital and reduce some of the risks inherent in the business. This will take time to accomplish, but I wanted you to understand the long-term direction for the company. 
And finally, also relating to our investment practices, I think the potential exists for us to be a little more balanced in our market position. We've clearly capitalized on the strong demand within the move-up category, but I see opportunities for us to realize a better balance across the buyer groups we serve. Today, approximately 45% of our deliveries are to move-up buyers, but at the division level, this percentage can be higher. 
Going forward, I believe we can diversify and expand our business among first-time buyers, where market demand appears to be accelerating. We will seek to replicate the success certain PulteGroup markets have achieved by building our first-time business in more markets across the country. 
On this front, I would note that approximately 40% of our land approvals in the third quarter were for first-time buyer communities, which is higher than recent quarters. 
Obviously, these are very high-level thoughts, but I wanted to provide some insights into how I view the business.
Now let me turn the call over to Bob for a review of the quarter."
294550,402855969,1058380,"PulteGroup, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2016",2016-10-20,"Earnings Calls","PulteGroup, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ryan, and good morning, everybody. As we've discussed on recent calls, 2016 reflects the growth we've expected, given our increasing land spend over the last several years. Q3 clearly continues that trend as home sale revenues grew by 29% to $1.",1778,"Thanks, Ryan, and good morning, everybody. As we've discussed on recent calls, 2016 reflects the growth we've expected, given our increasing land spend over the last several years. 
Q3 clearly continues that trend as home sale revenues grew by 29% to $1.9 billion, driven by a 16% increase in closings to 5,037 homes, combined with an 11% or $37,000 increase in average selling price to $374,000.
Consistent with our prior guidance, our deliveries of 5,037 homes represented a conversion rate of 52% in the quarter, which represents a roughly 400 basis point improvement over the third quarter of  last year. Our conversion rates have improved, but labor resources in many markets remained stressed and will likely continue to be so during this housing recovery.
Based on feedback from our division presidents, it's clear that labor availability has gotten even tighter relative to last year and continues to impact production timelines. Our decision last year to put a few more spec homes into production has turned out to be the right one, given these market dynamics.
Looking at the fourth quarter, we currently project our conversion rate to be in the range between 62% and 64%. This represents the meaningful increase over the third quarter and is comparable with the fourth quarter of last year. We're pleased with the improvements we've made to our production cadence, especially in light of the challenging trade environment.
One item to note, however, is the potential impact of Hurricane Matthew on our operations. We are fortunate that none of our employees were injured, and our communities weathered the storm extremely well, so our recovery time should be quick. This is likely not true for the local power companies, which had a lot of work in front of them restoring power and rebuilding infrastructure.
As that activity will take priority over installing meters or even bringing power to our new subdivisions, it's possible that we may face production and delivery delays in affected areas.
Looking at our closings by buyer group during the quarter, 29% were first-time; 44% were move-up; and 27% were active adult. In the comparable prior year period, the breakdown was 33% first-time; 35% move-up; and 32% active adult. The 11% gain in average sales prices for the quarter reflects the higher percentage of move-up closings as well as higher prices realized in each buyer group. In fact, our average sales price has increased 8% to $283,000 among our first-time buyers; 11% to $441,000 among our move-up buyers; and 4% to $358,000 among our active adult buyers.
With our backlog ASP showing an increase of 11% to $393,000 compared to last year, which is also up 5% from our Q3 deliveries, we expect our average selling prices to continue moving gradually higher in the coming quarters.
The company's recorded gross margin for Q3 was 21.1%, which was 10 basis points below our guidance range. Beyond margin pressure from higher absolute land cost is recycled through our land pipeline. We continued to experience labor rate inflation as it relates to both land development and house construction costs.
We had anticipated house costs to rise 1.5% to 2% this year, but labor costs are running outside of that band in many of our markets.
While we expected cost to rise at this stage of the housing cycle, market dynamics are not allowing these costs to be passed through to [indiscernible] home buyers at the same rates we experienced over the past 2 years.
Assuming these conditions continue in Q4 and into 2017, we now expect Q4 margins to be in the range of 20.5% to 21%. Further, we expect this range will likely carry through to the full year 2017. As is our practice, we'll update you as the year progresses.
While our margin trends has been lower, I think it's important to highlight that we're still generating the highest margins among the big builders. As a reminder, our convention is to include sales commissions and cost of sales, while most of the industry reports commissions and SG&A. As a result, on a comparative basis, our reported gross margin present lower than our peers. On average, our commissions are approximately 350 basis points of revenue, so on a comparable basis, our reported Q3 gross margin of 21.1% would equate to 24.6%.
We believe part of the reason for our strong relative margins is our strategy to maximize the amount of lot premiums and not having to use [indiscernible] to increase the amount of our highest margin revenue streams.
In the third quarter, our total option revenues and lot premiums increased 9% over last year to approximately $71,000 per closing.
Sales discounts in the third quarter were 2.7% of sales, which is flat with Q2 this year and up about 70 basis points from last year,  where the roughly $10,000 per home certainly remained modest.
SG&A expenses in the third quarter was $183 million or 9.7% of home sale revenues.  Included in this total are $8 billion of severance cost associated with actions taken in the quarter to reduce overhead expenses.
Among the actions we took was a reduction in our work force of approximately 350 people. The majority of those reductions took place in our corporate or area structures. Many of those roles has been established at the outset of our Value Creation efforts, but could be cut back us related initiatives are now part of standard operating procedures. In implementing these actions, we were obviously very careful to ensure we didn't hinder the ability of our field operations to manage what we expect to be a growing volume business in 2017 and beyond.
Also included in this quarter's SG&A were approximately $4 million of costs with shareholders activities. Having successfully reached agreements to 2 of our larger shareholders, we expect these costs to drop materially going forward.
As a reminder, on our last call, we discussed plans to cut SG&A cost from the expected 10% of revenues in 2016 to a target of 9% in 2017. All significant activity related to the actions to achieve our targeted spend level in 2017 were completed during the quarter.
Last year's third quarter SG&A spend of $159 million or 10.9% of revenues included a $6 million benefit associated with the reserve adjustment taken in the period.
In the third quarter of this year, we also reported $20 million of charges within other expenses net. This includes a $15 million charge due to the settlement of a dispute over a land transaction that we terminated a decade ago with the collapse of the housing market, in addition to $5 million of lease exit and related costs taken in connection with our SG&A reduction efforts.
Financial services, during the quarter, generated pretax income of $21 million, up from $14 million last year as it benefited primarily from higher construction volumes in our homebuilding operations.
Mortgage capture rate for the quarter was 81% compared to 83% last year. Our tax rate in the quarter was 39.5%, which compares to our prior guidance of 38%. The increase related to adjustments to our deferred tax assets resulting from changes in certain state tax rates, which impacted our reported earnings by $0.01 per share.
Reported net income for the quarter was $128 million or $0.37 per share, which includes $31 million of pretax charges I detailed. That reduced our reported earnings per share by $0.06 per share.
Earnings per share for the quarter was calculated using approximately 342 million shares outstanding, which is down 3% from last year, resulting largely from share repurchase activities.
Looking at our homebuilding operations, we had 9,235 homes under construction at the end of the third quarter, which is up 18% over last year. Consistent with our strategy to increase specs but at a controlled rate, specs were 24% of Q3 homes under construction, which is up from 17% in Q3 of last year but effectively flat on a sequential basis from the second quarter of this year. We ended the quarter with 600 finished specs or less than 1 per community, which is up only slightly from the second quarter of this year.
We recorded 4,775 sign-ups during the third quarter, which represents an increase of 17% over the prior year. On a dollar basis, sign-ups increased an even greater 25% to $1.8 billion.
Looking at our sign-ups by buyer group. First time increased 8%, move-up increased 30% and active adult increased 9%. Adjusting for changes in community count, our absorption pace has increased 4% for the first-time buyers and 14% among active adult buyers, but were lower by 4% among move-up buyers. Beyond the impact from our Wieland communities, which has slow absorption paces given their higher prices, some divisions have noted move-up buyers are taking longer to sign contracts. 
During the third quarter, we operated from 709 committees, which is up 16% over last year. The year-over-year increase is consistent with prior guidance for community count growth over the prior year in the range of 10% to 15%.
We remain active in the land acquisition arena. During the third quarter, we approved approximately 3,100 lots for purchase. At the end of the September, we owned approximately 102,000 lots and controlled an additional 43,000 lots via option. In total, we spent $266 million on land acquisition during the quarter, which brings our 9-month spend to approximately $910 million, excluding our purchase of the Wieland assets.
During the quarter, we also repurchased 12 million of our shares, representing just over 3% of our outstanding float for $250 million or $20.77 per share. This brings our total repurchase activity during 2016 to approximately 18 million shares for $350 million.
As we discussed on our Q2 call, we plan to continue to return excess funds to shareholders, subject to market conditions, through the repurchase of an additional $250 million of shares in Q4 and $1 billion in 2017.
In July, we raised $1 billion of 5- and 10-year debt at very attractive rates. Proceeds from the transaction were used to repay approximately $500 million of outstanding debt as well as to help fund our operations and our share repurchase activities. 
We ended the quarter with a debt to cap ratio of 40%, which is within the 30% to 40% range we seek to operate in. Depending upon the timing of future share repurchases, we may move above 40%, but expected future earnings should work to quickly delever our overall capital structure.
We ended the quarter with $461 million of cash, which resulted in a net debt to cap ratio of 36%.
Now let me turn the call over to Ryan for some comments on market conditions. Ryan?"

While there can be conflicting signals from period-to-period across the variety of metrics people track, I think most feel that economic conditions are improving, albeit at a slower pace than most would like.Recent moves higher by 10-year t",493,"Thanks, Bob. While there can be conflicting signals from period-to-period across the variety of metrics people track, I think most feel that economic conditions are improving, albeit at a slower pace than most would like.
Recent moves higher by 10-year treasury rates further suggest that the economy continues to get stronger. Certainly, the sizable gains seen in recent U.S. new home sales data supports the position that housing remains on a sustained path of recovery. As has been the case for the past several years, demand is being aided by low unemployment, job formations, a low interest rate environment and generally favorable supply dynamics.
With a 17% increase in units and a 25% increase in dollars, PulteGroup's third quarter sign-up data tracks to move higher in the broader housing market, and the anecdotal comments from our field reinforced the view that while there can be volatility from point-to-point, the overall trend is for modestly higher volume. 
For example, looking at the demand conditions in the quarter on a regional basis, we saw the following: strong demand in Florida and much of the Southeast, although Charlotte and Raleigh were a little bit choppy during the quarter at some of the higher price points. We didn't see much change in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast markets, where we're having to compete for each new sign-up. We have our eyes opened for any possible acceleration in D.C. once we get through the election cycle. Our Midwest and Texas operations continue to see strong demand conditions across the markets and throughout the quarter. As we said before, Houston has held up much better than expected, and given the recent rise in oil prices, it could be that the worst has already passed. Finally, in the Western 1/3 of the country, demand was solid throughout the quarter as we continued to experience good sign-up paces in our major markets of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Northern and Southern California.
Through the first few weeks of October, demand appears to be on its normal seasonal track. 
Overall, we are very pleased with Q3, and more broadly, the first 9 months of the year as we were able to get new communities opened, and they were met with strong buyer interest. With over 9,400 homes in backlog, we are well-positioned to complete a very strong 2016.
Let me close by saying it's a positive to have reached a resolution with 2 of our major shareholders and to have removed any uncertainties related to company leadership as we've successfully completed our announced CEO transition. Now we can focus conversations on talking about the business. As you read this morning and you heard in our comments, there are a lot of positives to discuss. 
And finally, I want to say thank you to the employees of PulteGroup. You've done an amazing job staying focused on serving our customers and delivering great quality homes.

We haven't provided any details, and I probably wouldn't want to get into it today in terms of specifics around implementation. What I'll -- what I will elaborate on as I did in some of my prepared remarks is that I'm a very big supporter of our Value Creation strategy. The company has realized great financial benefits from that strategy. And we'll continue -- we're going to continue to run that playbook. My experiences in the operations of our organization over the last 15 years are certainly a little bit different and unique from Richard's, and you'll see heavy emphasis and focus from me as the leader of our organization on driving the efficiencies out of our homebuilding operations. That's where we made substantial and sizable gains over the last 4 or 5 years in becoming a more efficient builder. I believe that we can continue to drive that well into the future. The other piece that I talked about is just being more balanced in terms of where we're investing our land. We are brand agnostic, and we've talked about that quite a bit. We have an entry-level, first-time business today, and we'll continue to have that business well into the future with Centex, Pulte and Del Webb brand construct. I'm quite encouraged by the fact that we are becoming more balanced than what we've been, as represented by the 40% of our land acquisitions in the third quarter going to the first-time buyer."

And then for your question on that first-time buyer, yes, we've been pretty clear that we're not out in the exurbs, chasing volume in that space. So we're typically going to be a little bit closer in, we're typically going to be a little bit higher price point that more affluent, millennial, first-time buyers, a little bit older, partnered, might have 2 incomes. So I don't think we have changed at all what we had expressed that first-time business means to us. It's just that with the acceleration of that business, we're seeing more opportunities to invest.
